               <p rend="noCount">In commemoration of the 200th anniversary of <title level="m">Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</title> (1817) and based on original talks given at an international symposium at New York University on April 21, 2017, this special <title level="s">Romantic Circles</title> Praxis volume offers not only a collection of essays that reassesses Lord Byron’s drama from an array of angles but also recent artistic adaptations of the script and an audio recording of a reenacted musical scene from the 1834 London production of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Among the subjects addressed in these essays are the play’s dramaturgical and staging potential, the curious history of its publication, circulation, and reception, and the authorial intent of a work based on Byron’s scandalous life. The readings also revisit the complexities behind <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s hybrid genre, while expanding the range of cultural influences and source materials that have previously been associated with the play. With <title level="m">Manfred</title> Byron created a work that fused his own celebrity myth with elements from various cultures, faiths, myths, epochs, genres, and traditions. Byron fired the public imagination with a drama that, in pushing well beyond its rootedness in a Swiss landscape and in his own biography, transcends the limits of the personal and the local as an eccentric and eclectic work of global horizons.</p>

               <p>This volume of essays commemorates the 200<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> anniversary of one of the most popular and influential literary
          works of the nineteenth century, Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</title> (1817). In June 1817, when John Murray
          published the drama, it was no surprise that all 6,000 copies sold out rather quickly. A work about a tormented nobleman from the Swiss
          Alps, <title level="m">Manfred</title> captured the European imagination upon its publication for two major reasons. First, it dramatized
          one of the greatest scandals of the day: the allegations that Byron had committed incest with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, which forced
          him into exile from Britain the previous year. Second, in addition to addressing these rumors, the drama catered to the European-wide craze
          created by the wild popularity of his works and his consequent celebrity. With its publication, <title level="m">Manfred</title> delivered a
          new iteration of Byron’s best-selling product, the Byronic hero, a figure that he produced through the exploitation of his own public image.
          On one level, <title level="m">Manfred</title> fused the autobiographical elements of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>
          with the Orientalist flair of the heroes from his popular Turkish Tales, including the Giaour (<title level="m">The Giaour</title>), Conrad
            (<title level="m">The Corsair</title>), Alp (<title level="m">The Siege of Corinth</title>), Selim (<title level="m">The Bride of
            Abydos</title>), and Lara (<title level="m">Lara</title>). On another level, it transformed the Byronic hero into a philosophical thinker
          who possessed uncanny power and knowledge. </p>
               <p>Begun in Switzerland in 1816, <title level="m">Manfred</title> shares its genesis with another great literary achievement of the early
          nineteenth century, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Each work is an adaptation of the Faustian legend: both Victor
          Frankenstein and Manfred seek out forbidden sources of knowledge and are haunted by their ill deeds. Enduring a series of afflictions,
          including exile and the ruin of their loved ones, both end up seeking to forget their past and even contemplate suicide. <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>—along with John Polidori’s <title level="m">The Vampyre</title>—were conceived
          during the summer of 1816 in Geneva when Byron, the Shelleys, and Polidori exchanged ghost stories in a contest at Byron’s rented Swiss
          home, Villa Diodati. Byron’s contribution of a “fragment” on that legendary evening seemingly inspired him shortly thereafter to compose
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> as his first dramatic composition, which was written—like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>—in a
          gothic key.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> bears a number of literary influences, including Aeschylus’s <title level="m">Prometheus Bound</title>,
          William Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, John Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, Edward Young’s <title level="m">The Revenge</title>, Johann von Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>, William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, and
          Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Alastor</title>. Shortly following <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication, the play was translated
          into several languages throughout Europe, including German, Russian, Polish, and French. Friedrich Nietzsche felt a personal connection to
          Byron’s title character, who partially inspired his concept of the<title level="m"> Übermensch</title> in <title level="m">Thus Spoke
            Zarathustra</title> (1883-91). The drama inspired many other notable works, as well, including Alexander Pushkin’s <title level="m">Eugene
            Onegin</title>, Alexandre Dumas’s <title level="m">The Count of Monte Cristo</title>, Ivan Turgenev’s <title level="m">Fathers and
            Sons</title>, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s <title level="m">Notes from Underground</title>, Thomas Pynchon’s <title level="m">The Crying of Lot
            49</title>, and Susanna Clarke’s <title level="m">Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell</title>. <title level="m">Manfred </title>is also a
          source for later Byronic heroes, including Heathcliff from <title level="m">Wuthering Heights</title>, Rochester from <title level="m">Jane
            Eyre</title>, Captain Ahab from <title level="m">Moby Dick</title>, Pechorin from <title level="m">A Hero of our Time</title>, Michael
          Corleone from <title level="m">The Godfather</title>, Eric Draven from <title level="m">The Crow</title>, and Bruce Wayne from <title level="m">Batman</title>.</p>
               <p>Like many Romantic dramas, <title level="m">Manfred</title> has rarely been performed as a full theatrical production on stage. Byron
          himself cautioned that his dramatic poem was not intended for the stage but rather belonged to a category of metaphysical drama that he
          called “mental theatre.” Nevertheless, an adaptation of the play directed by Alfred Bunn and set to music by Henry Rowley Bishop took place
          at Covent Garden in 1834. In 1848, Robert Schumann adapted <title level="m">Manfred</title> for musical performance, and it opened to much
          success at the <foreign>Gewandhaus</foreign> in Leipzig in 1852. Inspired by the 1834 Covent Garden production, Drury Lane theater presented
          another stage version of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in October 1863. In 1885, the Russian composer, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, turned
          the play into the <title level="m">Manfred Symphony</title>. More recently, the BBC produced the play as a radio drama in 1988. The
          broadcasting network revived <ref target="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087qh9w">the dramatic reading</ref> in January 2017 in honor of
          the <title level="m">Manfred</title> bicentenary. </p>
               <p>The authors in this volume, whose essays are based on original talks given at an <ref target="http://romantics200.org/event/byrons-manfred-dramatic-reading-symposium/">international bicentenary symposium</ref> dedicated to
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> at New York University on April 21, 2017, re-examine Byron’s drama from an array of angles. They
          interrogate issues related to its publication, circulation, and reception history, while also exploring matters of authorial intent. For
          instance, although biographical readings of <title level="m">Manfred</title> have pointed to the protagonist’s and Byron’s sense of remorse
          for “destroying” his sister, Astarte, <ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.bernhard-jackson.html">Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s provocative essay</ref>, “Love in the First Degree:<title level="m">
            Manfred</title>, Byron, and Incest,” suggests that the play offers evidence rather of Manfred’s and Byron’s lack of guilt. Several of the
          authors also propose that, in contrast to critics who, like Byron himself, maintained that the drama is unstageable, <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers the dramaturgical potential to succeed on the stage as a performance in its own right. The play emerged at a
          defining moment in the history of theater and, despite its limited performance history, is rooted in the tradition of melodrama and revenge
          tragedy. Moreover, the present essays underscore the idea that <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s generic hybridity blurs several
          boundaries, styles, and tones. <title level="m">Manfred</title> is not only a tragedy but also a work of comedy that anticipates the humor
          and satire that Byron would eventually develop in <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. The readings even
          expand the range of cultural influences and source materials that have previously been connected with the play. With <title level="m">Manfred</title> Byron created a work that fused his own celebrity myth with elements from various faiths, myths, and traditions across
          cultures and times. Byron fired the public imagination with a drama that, while based on his own personal scandal, moved well beyond its
          rootedness in a Swiss landscape and in his own biography. The drama transcends the limits of the personal and the local as an eccentric and
          eclectic work of global horizons.</p>
               <p>The first section of the volume, “Foundations, Influences, Intertexts,” proceeds chronologically, beginning with some of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s oldest cultural and religious sources. In “Alpine Orientalism in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” Alan Richardson
          discusses <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s status as a culturally heterogeneous work whose “brazen commingling of Alpine setting and
          Orientalist lexicon” is saturated in signs and symbols associated with Zoroastrianism. According to Richardson, <title level="m">Manfred</title> provides an unusual “mixture of local and exotic,” fusing elements of Christian tradition, Greek myth, and even European
          witchcraft with various “Oriental” religions. Richardson connects the drama’s incest plot to Montesquieu’s <title level="m">Persian
            Letters</title> (1721) and finds key links to William Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title> (1784)—both of which contain Zoroastrian
          elements themselves. He proposes that Byron’s hero, short of being a Magian himself, is at the least highly knowledgeable of the
          tradition given his curious speeches and practices. Richardson concludes by suggesting that, as “Byron gave a pronounced Orientalist edge to
          an Alpine Gothic play that programmatically refuses to declare its allegiances, religious, mythological, geographical, literary, or
          generic,” <title level="m">Manfred</title> is an “iconoclastic” work that still speaks meaningfully to our contemporary moment.</p>
               <p>In “Freemasonry and Mental Theatre in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” Jonathan Gross highlights the conglomeration of faiths and
          traditions evident in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. He extends Richardson's argument about Byron's debt to Montesquieu's <title level="m">Lettres Persanes</title> by tracing the similarity to Byron and Montesquieu's shared Masonic beliefs, pointing out crucial
          images of "Magisme" in Byron's play (the casket and key in Act III) that have not been previously discussed. He argues that the play draws
          on Byron’s own knowledge of Masonic societies, to which Byron’s father—“Mad Jack” Byron—also belonged. Gross concludes his essay by
            seeing <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s heterogeneous elements as a lesson in cultural tolerance and comparative religion rather than an
          instance of eco-criticism or twentieth-century existentialism.</p>
               <p>In “Redeemed from the Worm: <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s Celebrity Revenge Tragedy,” Clara Tuite expands on <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s conglomeration of styles, registers, and tones, as well as the complicated genealogy of the Byronic hero, which she
          proposes stems back to Hamlet. Tuite argues that <title level="m">Manfred</title> is Byron’s take on the revenge tragedy and that the
          eponymous hero has his origins in Zanga, the avenger from Edward Young’s <title level="m">The Revenge: A Tragedy</title> (1721), whom Byron
          played in a performance in his youth while a student at Harrow School. Tuite suggests that these roots are connected with Byron’s own
          scandals and what she calls the “fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power, and intimate publicity: celebrity.” She contends that
          the text, which serves as an allegory of Byron’s life, offers evidence of two kinds of “unfinished business.” The first is the emotional
          unfinished business pertaining to the scandals that prompted his exile from Britain. The second is <title level="m">Manfred</title> as an
          embodiment of unfinished textual business: as a synthesis of many drafts and reworkings of text, intertext, and paratext—including the
          revised third act at the demand of Gifford and Murray—in the months that Byron wrote it over the winter of 1816-17.</p>
               <p>Peter Manning then tracks a “<foreign>hypochondrisch</foreign>” textual history of “self-involved protagonists” by uncovering an unexpected
          connection between Goethe and Byron outside of the obvious Faustian link. In “‘My pang shall find a voice’: <title level="m">Manfred</title>
          and <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>,” Manning fittingly turns to the work that made Goethe famous to uncover not
          only the commonalities between Werther and Manfred as heroes but also biographical links between Goethe and Byron themselves. Through his
          archival work on the editorial manuscripts of the posthumously published 17-volume collected edition of Byron's works (1832-33), housed at
          the National Library of Scotland, Manning’s research probes the curious editorial practices of John Wright, Byron’s editor. He reveals a
          genealogy that ties <title level="m">Werther</title> to the rejected third act of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron’s five-act
          tragedy, <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> (1821), and even the “sensational stage display” of Alfred Bunn’s Covent Garden performance
          of the drama in 1834. Manning’s discoveries show how Wright, in bringing the many exchanges and dedications between Goethe and Byron to
          light through his editing, emphasized the “hypochondriac” and melodramatic proclivities of the authors and, by extension, their characters.
          Manning demonstrates how the textual history that marks Goethe’s effort to “cast critical distance on his self-absorbed protagonist” is
          echoed by Byron’s similar impulses in his composition of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and beyond.</p>
               <p>The section ends with Alice Levine’s “<title level="m">Manfred</title>: Byron’s Other <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,” in which she
          challenges the conventional notion that <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> represent antithetical
          aspects of Byron’s writings. By examining Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> and other iterations of the legendary Hispanic
          libertine, Don Juan, Levine argues that <title level="m">Manfred</title>—contrary to the critical consensus—served as a foundational text
          for Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. For her, both works involve a form of “heterosexual transgression”; each culminates not only
          in the disappearance of female characters but also with the protagonists’ self-assertions among a community of “powerful male authority
          figures.” In finding commonality between these seemingly disparate works, Levine proposes that <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> are “two variations on the same plot and the same central character.” </p>
               <p>The second section, “Text, Circulation, Image,” opens with Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s essay, “Love in the First Degree: <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron, and Incest,” in which she reads <title level="m">Manfred</title> alongside Byron’s letters and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. In doing so, Bernhard-Jackson considers Byron’s skepticism on the subject of incest. She makes the provocative case
          that <title level="m">Manfred</title>, rather than being a work about Manfred’s guilt, is about his lack of guilt. As Bernhard-Jackson sees
          it, though <title level="m">Manfred</title> provided Byron with a “confessional medium,” the subjects of incest and torment must be
          disentangled from one another. While Manfred (and Byron) feels deeply for his (half)-sister, his commitment to both rationalism and
          liberation keeps him from feeling remorse. Highlighting the “ambivalent registers of [Byron’s] apologetic gestures,” Bernhard-Jackson
          contends that incest was a way for Byron to challenge inhibiting social structures.</p>
               <p>In “Dark Prometheus: <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the Last Infirmity of Evil,” Andrew Stauffer closely examines an enigmatic
          seven-line passage in the first act to argue that Manfred’s character is the anti-heroic version of the protagonist that Percy Shelley later
          created in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>: a “dark twin” who embodies “existential Romantic heroism.” Tracing this idea back to
          John Milton’s “Lycidas,” Stauffer concentrates on a particular phrase, “the last infirmity of evil,” asking whether it suggests Manfred’s
          superlative embrace of evil or, rather, his desire to purge the traces of evil in himself. He ultimately settles on a third reading,
          proposing instead that Manfred, in reaching the “summit of evil” and standing on “the dizzy brink of complete amorality,” moves beyond the
          limits of “self-justification.” Stauffer’s Manfred is one who, immediately prior to his own death, transcends his own limits by reaching a
          sense of calm and equanimity.</p>
               <p>Jane Stabler offers another close reading of <title level="m">Manfred</title> by analyzing the text’s inclusion of Byron’s signature
          punctuation—the dash. In “The Dashes in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” she interrogates Byron’s persistent use of the dash in his
          manuscripts as well as how his editors translated them into print. Distinguishing between the em dash and the long dash in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, she argues that Byron’s usage creates the effect of a complex “musical score” that, in transgressing rules of grammar,
          shapes the way readers “hear” the work’s extensive range of voices and silences. For Stabler, the Byronic dash can be “a sigh, an intake of
          breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent.” In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, the affect suggested by the dashing ranges from ludic interruption to wonder to gothic agony. To complement her analysis, Stabler supplies her readers with
          several images of Byron’s manuscripts and early printed editions from the National Library of Scotland.</p>
               <p>The section closes with Ghislaine McDayter’s investigation of the reception history of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, focusing on the
          way artists and illustrators rendered the play in the nineteenth century. In “The Iconography of Forgiveness: <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s Astarte,” McDayter analyzes a series of illustrated editions of both <title level="m">The Giaour</title> and <title level="m">Manfred</title> in order to highlight a trend in the play’s reception. Examining portrayals of each work’s hero and their love
          interests, Leila and Astarte in particular, she demonstrates how these interpretations are more concerned with Byron and his scandals than
          with the works themselves. McDayter proposes that a study of the depictions of these heroines offers “a window into the public view of the
          poet himself.” McDayter accompanies her analysis with reproductions of the various illustrations that she explores. </p>
               <p>The third section, “Voice, Performance, Adaptation,” begins with Diego Saglia’s look at the function and problem of voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. In “Voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title>: Sign, Symbol, and Performance,” Saglia demonstrates how voice in
          the play is simultaneously a “vehicle for authorial power” and a representation of an “unstable force.” Saglia argues that voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> serves an “oscillatory function.” It operates on the threshold between several domains, including that between
          transcendence and materiality, page and stage, drama and melodrama, theater and metatheater, absence and presence, the real and imaginary,
          the embodied and disembodied, and the visible and invisible. At the same time, Saglia highlights the relevance of unstable voices on the
          Romantic-era stage, suggesting that Byron wrote <title level="m">Manfred</title> with “questions of theatrical performance” in mind. In
          producing these “transdimensional interconnections,” voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> becomes one of the major elements behind the
          play’s textual and performative distinctiveness. The play is “one of the major Romantic texts on the power and meaning of uttering
          words.”</p>
               <p>Saglia’s analysis of the liminality of voice sets the stage, as it were, for my own essay, “Between Page and Stage: The Happy Medium for
          Romantic Drama,” in which I consider the performative possibilities of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, a “dramatic poem” that generally
          emphasizes high poetic language above dramatic action. Despite a long history of skepticism about its performability, dating back to Byron’s
          own comments about his reluctance to it being staged, I argue that <title level="m">Manfred</title> does indeed belong on the stage as a
          performance. By basing my findings on the recent New York City performances of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), and <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017), I argue that these kinds of hybrid Romantic works, which have typically been considered closet dramas, can benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a staged reading produced by a professional director and actors. I propose that the staged reading offers what I call a “happy medium,” a form of compromise between the page and the stage that produces a pragmatic and rewarding method for encountering these works as performances. I contend that such an
          experience offers an alternate interpretive space for the text, a performative mode that responds directly to the challenges of closet
          drama, and a mutually beneficial opportunity between literary critics and theater professionals. </p>
               <p>In the spirit of the theatrical possibilities of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Jeffrey Cox’s and Michael Gamer’s “<title level="m">Manfred</title> and Melodrama” follows my own with an unexpected adaptation of the conventional article format. Emulating their presentation of it at the April 2017 symposium, they offer a dialogue that not only places <title level="m">Manfred</title> in conversation with the tradition of melodrama but also attempts to understand “Romantic cultural consumption and appropriation” more broadly. In their reading, Byron
          reverses the usual order of things by consuming that most consuming of nineteenth-century genres, melodrama. <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s heterogeneous style and “melodramatic roots,” they show, are most evident in the rejected third act, which is (<ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.manning.html">as
          Manning points out</ref>) what Alfred Bunn drew on for his Covent Garden staging of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834. </p>
               <p>Frederick Burwick closes the section with “Staging <title level="m">Manfred</title>” by focusing on Bunn’s production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> at Covent Garden with Henry Denvil performing in the titular role, music by Henry Rowley Bishop, and scenery by Thomas
          and William Grieve. In examining reviews and first-hand accounts of the staging, Burwick argues that all the stage elements, including the
          scenery, the music, and the acting, created a spectacular effect that invoked Byron’s own biography. Burwick proposes that Bunn “succeeded
          in adapting <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a spectacular musical production,” yet maintains that Bishop’s libretto “deprived the
          audience of much of Byron’s dramatic poem.” Burwick enriches his study with fascinating materials, including a copy and an original
          performance of Bishop’s musical score, “The Witches Carnival,” which Bishop inserted into the finale of the Witch of Alps scene (Act II,
          scene two). These materials, along with two stage adaptations of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, can be found in this volume’s Table of Contents (<ref target="/praxis/manfred">Section V. Supplementary Materials</ref>)</p>
               <p>This volume culminates with an adapted version of Jerome McGann’s keynote address, “<title level="m">Manfred</title>, a Play of Language;
          or, Intimations of Mortality from Recollections of Erring Manhood,” in which he symbolically returns to the material with which he launched
          his distinguished career several decades ago with <title level="m">Fiery Dust</title> (1969). McGann revisits not only the subject of his
          groundbreaking scholarship but also his interest in the performance of Romantic drama, as he was one of the founding members of Cain’s
          Company in Chicago in the late 1960s, a theater group that dedicated itself to staging neglected dramas, including Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title>. In his essay, McGann offers a close reading of the text and its patterns of versification that neither insists on a single
          approach nor authoritative interpretation. Instead, he begins by assuming a position of negative capability, in the process underscoring how
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a “very strange work” that is replete with enigma and ambiguity. Through his explorations of the text,
          McGann echoes the volume’s other contributors, pointing out the intricacies of the various influences that make up <title level="m">Manfred</title>. His interrogation of several passages leads him to an important conclusion. Being of “rich and cryptic linguistic
          particulars,” <title level="m">Manfred</title> is indeed a “play”: a play of words, of “language in which secrets lie about everywhere,
          awaiting—seeking—discovery.” <title level="m">Manfred</title> recasts the Faustian legend as <emph>comedy</emph> in part through a style
          that intimates the tongue-in-cheek mode that Byron realized most maturely with <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don
            Juan</title>. </p>
               <p>McGann has played an invaluable role in helping to make the present volume possible. Back in December 2015, when Stuart Curran announced
          that the Keats-Shelley Association of America and the Byron Society of America were accepting proposals to sponsor events in commemoration
          of the Romantic Bicentennials, I imagined that a work of the reach and scope of <title level="m">Manfred</title> needed a celebration that
          was attentive to its ambition and originality. I therefore proposed an event that would fuse both scholarship and performance—one that would
          bring Byron scholars from around the globe together with New York City's singularly brilliant theatrical community. McGann agreed to partner
          with me to realize a modern production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> on stage. The <ref target="http://www.redbulltheater.com/manfred">dramatic reading</ref>, which was produced by Red Bull Theater, took place on Thursday, April 20, 2017 at the Loreto Theater of the Sheen
          Center on Bleecker Street (a review of it can be found online <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/reviews-blog/lord-byron’s-manfred-stage-new-york-city-rare-and-rewarding-experience-reviewed-lee">at
              <title level="s">Romantic Circles</title>
                  </ref>). Both McGann and I assumed roles as resident dramaturges, offering the actors and the
          rest of the production team important background and context of the play during rehearsals. The curtain rose with a nearly sold-out crowd in
          a theater with a 220-seat capacity. McGann also delivered the keynote address, <ref target="https://k-saa.org/manfred-event-follow-up-jerome-mcganns-keynote-lecture-at-manfred-symposium-april-21/">“Manfred: The Long
            Disease of my Life,”</ref> at the bicentenary symposium that took place the following day, which convened the present scholars from the
          U.S., Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia. In honor of the celebratory occasion, moreover, Broadview Press agreed to publish a
            <ref target="https://broadviewpress.com/product/manfred/">special bicentenary edition of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                  </ref> and offer
          complimentary copies of it to all our presenters. </p>
               <p>I would like to thank Jerry McGann—first and foremost—for joining me on this journey. I am also indebted to this volume’s many authors for
          partaking of the two-day event in New York City back in April 2017 as well as for developing these new and fascinating readings of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. I am grateful to the NYU Department of English, the University of Virginia Department of English, the Byron
          Society of America, the Keats-Shelley Association of America, and Broadview Press for their generous support. Thank you to the <title level="s">Romantic Circles</title> team, including Neil Fraistat, Paul Youngquist, Orrin Wang, David Rettenmaier, and Jeffrey Moro, for
          their assistance with producing this Praxis edition of many essays and supplementary materials—a hybrid volume that seems appropriate to me
          for an edition dedicated to <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Finally, I would like to recognize my research assistant, Hailey Pope, whose
          dedication, precision, and talent have helped to elevate this volume to its current state. </p>
               <p>As this volume marks the bicentenary of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication, it indirectly commemorates the 200-year milestone
          of its critical reception. The present essays have, on one hand, drawn significantly on the criticism from the foregoing two centuries in
          order to develop their own interesting and surprising claims. On the other hand, these critics have carved out new and refreshing
          possibilities for Byron’s first drama and, in so doing, have pointed auspiciously toward the future of Byron studies. In preparing the way
          for new readings of the play, they have also highlighted the fundamental place of <title level="m">Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</title> within
          Byron’s oeuvre. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">Early reviewers of Byron's <title level="m">Manfred</title> were troubled by one of the same features that has piqued the
        interest of readers and audiences from Byron's time to the present: its relentless and daring religious iconoclasm. Mingling references to
        Christian beliefs with figures and practices from many different traditions, among them Greek mythology, European witchcraft, and various
        "Oriental" religions, and seeming to treat them all with equal skepticism, Byron implicitly challenged one of the linchpins of English
        orthodoxy: the Established Church. In this essay, I pay special attention to the array of references to various Asian or "Oriental" motifs,
        including Zoroastrianism and Byron's debt to Montesquieu's representation of that religion in his <title level="m">Persian Letters</title>.
          <title level="m">Manfred</title> is not a work of literary Orientalism, yet its network of Orientalist references made a crucial aspect of
        its radical contemporary impact.</p>

               <p>I begin with a little-known episode in the early reception history of Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>, an episode that reminds us
          that we can only assume so much about a book’s contemporary audience based on its pricing and print run. Readers, including lower-class
          readers, will at times show great persistence and ingenuity in getting their hands on a notorious poem or play.<note xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" resp="author" n="1"> For an influential study of the importance of pricing, print runs, and copyright status in understanding
            reception history, see St Clair. For the special case of nineteenth-century British working class readers, see Rose.</note> One such
          reader, the artisan, Chartist agitator, and self-educated writer, Thomas Cooper, records his first exposure to Byron’s poetry when, at age
          thirteen, he managed to get “only a few hours” access to a canto of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and the poetic drama, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which would have been in print for only about a year.<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="author" n="2"> For
            an introduction to Cooper and other Romantic-era self-educated readers, see Richardson, <title level="m">Literature</title>, pp.
            232-47.</note> “I knew nothing of their noble author’s life or reputation,” he continues, “but they seemed to create almost a new sense
          within me. I wanted more poetry to read from that time; but could get hold of none that thrilled through my nature like Byron’s” (35).</p>
               <p> What accounts for this revolution in sensibility in an apprentice shoemaker brought about by a single exposure to a difficult, generically
          uncertain, and deliberately evasive work? Certainly, <title level="m">Manfred’</title>s iconoclasm would have appealed to the future
          radical, not least (especially given his midlife period of freethinking and anti-clericalism) its religious iconoclasm, a feature that
          troubled more than one contemporary reviewer. The <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title> noted Manfred’s “conversations with witches,
          spirits, deities, Nemesis, and Arimanes,” commenting: “truly a rather heterogeneous assemblage of mythology” (337-38). The <title level="j">Critical Review</title> also mentions pointedly how Byron draws “at once from the Grecian, Persian, and Gothic mythology” (627).
          Meanwhile, the <title level="j">British Critic and Theological Review</title> vents its anxieties over what it calls a “strange jumble of
          all the mythologies which ever existed” more overtly: “The fire worship of the Persians, the Nemesis of the Greeks, the fairy tales of our
          nursery, are brought into action, and what is worst of all, are combined with the appearance of Christianity,” all making for a veritable
          “Olla Podrida,” “execrable” in taste, “in execution absurd” (47). And that was <emph>after</emph> Byron cut the scene in which the
          near-Eastern demon, Ashtaroth, carries the Abbot of St. Maurice away to a time-out on the highest peak of the Shreckhorn.</p>
               <p> This olla or gumbo or pilaf, this mixture of local and exotic ingredients that is <title level="m">Manfred</title>, seems most
          heterogeneous, not to say incoherent, in its brazen commingling of Alpine setting and Orientalist lexicon. John Wilson, writing in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, found the Alpine location central to the style and spirit of the poem: “The action is laid among the
          mountains of the Alps—the characters are all, more or less, formed and swayed by the operations of the magnificent scenery around them”
          (290). And yet he describes the majority of these characters as so many “Wild personifications,” making the usual remark about the
          heterogeneity of this Alpine cast: “the Prince of the Air, witches, demons, destinies, spirits, and all the tribes of immaterial existences”
          (290, 292). Tribes, perhaps, does double duty here, for Byron has not simply recruited his supernatural players from among a variety of
          ethereal species, but from a decidedly global array of cultural traditions as well.</p>
               <p> In his recent book on Romanticism, global war, and global culture, Jeffrey Cox argues that what Byron himself called a “mixed mythology of
          my own” in <title level="m">Manfred</title> implies that “we too should reject any and all providential schemes, for none of them can
          contain the heterodox, heterological ‘nature of this world’” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:195; 78). And I agree. But beyond this general
          point, I wish to devote the rest of this essay to examining the particular Orientalist flavors running so boldly through Byron’s heterodox
          mélange. These range from incidental similes and allusions—the dusty “Simoom” wind of the Arabian desert, the “Chaldean shepherds” of Mesopotamia,
          the Syrian philosopher and mystic Iamblichus, “he who from out their fountain” raised Eros and Anteros (III.i.128, III.ii.13, II.ii.73-4)—to a much more significant network of references to Zoroastrianism, comparatively neglected by modern criticism of the poem, though noted by
          those early reviewers who mention its “Persian” mythology. As Marilyn Butler argued in her important 1989 essay on “Romantic Manichaeism,”
          references to paganism in the early nineteenth century frequently involved either undermining or attempting to shore up the claims of
          orthodox Christianity, and Zoroastrianism in particular became the “thinking radical’s favorite form of paganism” (15). The Zoroastrian
          elements of <title level="m">Manfred</title> go deeper than many of Byron’s readers have supposed.</p>
               <p>Everyone notices, of course, the unexpected presence of Arimanes, that is, Ahriman or Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit of Zoroaster’s
          antithetical cosmology, in the cast of Byron’s Alpine Gothic drama. Byron gives Arimanes lordship over all the various demons, sprites,
          witches, and lesser gods mentioned elsewhere in the play, whatever their provenance, though Arimanes himself seems ultimately subordinate to
          the “overruling Infinite,” presumably Ohrmazd or Ahura Mazda, Zoroaster’s supreme god and the source of all that is good (II.iv.47). But
          another Zoroastrian figure appears in <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s list of <foreign xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</foreign> as well,
          though she has rarely been recognized as such: Manfred’s sister, lover, victim, and object of perpetually frustrated desire, Astarte.</p>
               <p>Or, at least, Astarte’s name should be taken as Zoroastrian. Byron most likely did not connect the name Astarte with the Mesopotamian
          goddess Ishtar, precisely because he introduces Ashtaroth, a corruption of the same name and a totally different character, in one of the
          excised passages of Act III. Then where did Byron find the name Astarte? As I noted back in 1991 in the <title level="j">Keats-Shelley
            Journal</title>, Montesquieu’s <title level="m">
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">Lettres Persanes</foreign>
                  </title> or <title level="m">Persian
            Letters</title> contains an interpolated tale guaranteed to have drawn the attention of Byron, with its portrayal of political oppression,
          lovers separated by arbitrary religious codes, and even an escape from a harem (Richardson, “Astarté”).<note xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" resp="author" n="3"> See Montesquieu, <title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Lettres Persanes</foreign>
                     </title>, pp. 137-48 (numbered
            letter LXVII in modern French editions).</note> This tale concerns the history of a Zoroastrian brother and sister who fall in love as
          children, become separated on account of the invidious laws of their Muslim oppressors, and after various adventures and reverses reunite,
          marry, and live happily together. The incestuous brother, who recounts the story, is named Apheridon; his sister is named Astarté.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the greatly expanded electronic archive and ever more powerful search engines of the twenty-first century, I can now say that
          what I took, after duly diligent research and peer review, as an original scholarly discovery of my own was in fact my independent
          rediscovery of a connection made by Maurice Quinlan in an article on <title level="m">Manfred</title> and Zoroastrianism published in the
            <title level="j">Journal of English and Germanic Philology</title> in 1958, soon to disappear from Byron scholarship until quite recently
            (734).<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="author" n="4"> Quinlan in turn cites a still earlier link between Byron’s Astarte and
            Montesquieu’s Astarté made by Alois Brandl in an article published in 1936. For more recent studies, see Cochran, “Byron and the
            Dualists,” and Cochran, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, pp. 136-43 (“<title level="m">Manfred</title> and Zoroastrianism”).</note>
          Quinlan also anticipates the point about Astarte and Ashtaroth made above, and I am happy for this chance to acknowledge his precedence
          (734). Quinlan brings in the connection to Montesquieu rather late in his article, however, almost as an afterthought, and I have in
          contrast come to believe that the story of Apheridon and Astarté plays a larger role in <title level="m">Manfred</title> than either Quinlan
          or I myself initially believed. </p>
               <p>To begin with, Montesquieu seems to go out of his way to make representations of Zoroastrianism attractive for later writers in the radical
          and skeptical traditions such as Byron and Shelley. Islam (or what the text, in John Ozell’s 1722 translation, terms
            “<emph>Mahometism</emph>”), functions as a state-sanctioned, established church under whose “Yoke” the Zoroastrians, or Guebres, live
          (245, 237).<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="author" n="5"> Ozell’s 1722 English translation numbers the letter in question “Letter
            LXV” (vol. 1, pp. 234-55).</note> In his conversations with Astarté, after she has been forcibly converted to Islam, Apheridon relativizes
          the truth claims of her new religion by noting the antiquity of their original creed (“the ancientest in the whole world”) and the
          historical contingency that has made Persia a Muslim state: “it was chance alone that introduced <emph>Mahometism</emph>” (245). Naturally,
          much the same could be said of the historical rise of Christianity and its chance spread to Europe and Great Britain. Lamenting his sister’s
          captivity behind harem walls, Apheridon associates Zoroastrianism with both “sweet Liberty” and female “Equality,” while Islam becomes
          linked instead with slavery and the oppression of women (244). At last convinced to return to her childhood faith, Astarté thanks her
          brother for finding a “way to break the Chains which my mind had forg’d to it self,” a remarkable anticipation of Blake’s “mind-forg’d
          manacles” (247).<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="author" n="6"> Compare Blake’s “London” in <title level="m">Songs</title>, plate
            46.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In one of their dialogues, Apheridon tells Astarté that, should Persia somehow manage to return to Zoroastrian rule, she “would again see
          the morality of the ancient <emph>Magi</emph> predominate,” returning to a time when Persia was “all Magism” (245). In Act II, scene two of
            <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron’s occultist hero explicitly equates himself to the “Magi,” whose eyes, like his own, grew
          “familiar with Eternity”; in the Hall of Arimanes, the second spirit calls Manfred a “Magian of great power,” an identification repeated by
          the spirit who appears at the end of the play in an attempt to carry Manfred away (II.ii.89-91, II.iv.31, III.ii.105). The spirits, in other
          words, seem to identify Manfred as a Zoroastrian (since they could easily have used the more general term “magician”), and Manfred himself
          invites the identification.</p>
               <p>Manfred even seems, at least at one moment in the play, to be “practicing Zoroastrianism,” a point made by Quinlan over half a century ago
          and one that comparison with the <title level="m">Persian Letters</title> makes stronger (733). When, not yet convinced to abjure Islam,
          Astarté contrasts the monotheism of her imposed faith to her brother’s polytheism—“you likewise worship the Sun, the Stars, Fire, and even
          the Elements”—Apheridon defends the religion of their ancestors: “they only paid the sort of Religious Reverence, due to the Works of the
          Creator, and the Manifestations of the Deity” (246). Manfred’s striking apostrophe to the setting sun in Act III, shortly before his death,
          proceeds very much in the spirit of Apheridon’s apologia:

                     </lg>
                  </quote>
       Manfred’s rhetorical exchange with Nemesis and Arimanes also implies that, at the very least, Manfred understands the Zoroastrian faith in
          a sophisticated manner that contrasts with its popular reputation for sun-worship or, as in Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Lalla
            Rookh</title> (published only some weeks before Byron’s dramatic poem), fire-worship.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" resp="author" n="7">
            Moore’s text disagrees on this point with his own critical apparatus. In a footnote, Moore absolves the Zorastrians or “Ghebers” of both
            sun worship and fire worship, calling these “false charges” advanced by their “Mussalman tyrants” (p. 436, f.n. #2). Yet Moore not only
            calls this section of <title level="m">Lalla Rookh</title> “The Fire-Worshippers” but frequently alludes to fire worship as well, as when
            the Zoroastrian hero, Hafed, immolates himself on a shrine dedicated to the “Fire divine” (p. 459).</note> It would be too much to follow
          the spirits in claiming Manfred for the Zoroastrian faith. For one thing, Manfred’s evident sense of the forbidden nature of his incestuous
          relation to Astarte—“though it were / The deadliest sin to love as we have loved”—contrasts markedly with Apheridon’s assurance that,
          according to their inherited religious beliefs, he and <emph>his</emph> sister Astarté should feel entirely free to love, marry, and have
          children together (II.iv.123-4; 237). More importantly, the corrosive power of Byron’s iconoclastic poem emerges precisely from his
          commingling, leveling, and fusing of any number of religious and mythological traditions, not from reasserting the claims of one of the more
          ancient religions. But Manfred certainly comes closer to professing Zoroastrianism than he does to Christianity, Greek paganism, or anything
          else.</p>
               <p>Zoroastrianism plays only a minor role in William Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>, one of Byron’s favorite Orientalist fictions:
          we discover midway through the narrative that Dilara, Vathek’s favorite before meeting Nouronihar, “had been brought up amongst the magi,”
          and “cherished the idea of the Caliph’s devoting himself to the worship of fire” (138). But the Caliph himself deserves a prominent position
          among the many literary forebears—Faust, Faustus, Macbeth, Hamlet, Milton’s Satan, Godwin’s Falkland, Byron’s own earlier heroes, and
          still more—that Byron weaves into his thickly textualized characterization of Manfred.<note xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" resp="author" n="8"> The classic study remains Thorslev, <title level="m">The Byronic Hero</title>.</note> The multiple resonances with <title level="m">Vathek</title>, then, represent still another aspect of the Orientalism of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, whose hero displays various
          characteristics of Beckford’s parodically inflated Oriental despot. For one thing, both Vathek and Manfred reign supreme in their respective
          domains, though the former is a caliph of the Abbasid empire and the latter the lord of a feudal holding in a Swiss region apparently
          lacking any form of centralized government. Both have passed through a Faustian pursuit of knowledge—Vathek had “wished to know
          everything; even sciences that did not exist,” and both resort to the study of occult knowledge, Manfred in the company of his sister,
          Vathek in the company of his mother, Carathis, with whom he has an unnaturally close if not outright incestuous relation (82). Like Manfred,
          however, Vathek does pursue an illicit sexual connection, not to his sister, but to Nouronihar, whom he seduces in violation of her prior
          betrothal to her cousin and of the sacred “rights of hospitality” claimed in vain by her father (128). Both spurn the advice and scorn the
          intervention of the orthodox religious figures who alone might check their unbridled power—Manfred in relation to the Abbot, and Vathek in
          relation to a series of Muslim divines—and in the cancelled Ashtoroth episode from Act III, Manfred, like Vathek before him, goes so far
          as to mock and abuse his would-be religious sponsor.</p>
               <p>Most strikingly, perhaps, both inherit the inner hell of Milton’s Satan, Vathek ending more or less where Manfred begins. Each refuses a
          final offer of mediation, repentance, and perhaps redemption, on the grounds that the hour of redemption has long passed by. Manfred
          refuses, of course, in his rousing, yet oddly derivative, response to the Abbot in Act III:

                  </quote>
        The echoes we cannot help but hear emanate from Milton’s Satan, yet Beckford’s Vathek makes a similar claim when offered a final chance to
          repent by a well-meaning Genius in the guise of a devout shepherd: “If what I have done be so criminal, as thou pretendest, there remains
          not for me a moment of grace. I have traversed a sea of blood . . .” (148). Less memorable, much less poetic, but no less definitive.
          Vathek’s end, as I have already suggested, instills in him the same state of inner torment, the same Satanic mind, that Manfred already
          endures at the play’s beginning. Finding himself at last in the subterranean realm of Eblis, the Muslim Satan, Vathek learns from Soliman
          precisely what sort of eternal torment to expect when his brief period of infernal enjoyment has ended: “I am in torments, ineffable
          torments! an unrelenting fire preys on my heart” (154). In other words, “myself am hell.” And this is the inner hell that, as the Seventh
          Spirit makes clear in the drama’s very first scene, Manfred suffers from beginning to end: “I call upon thee! and compel / Thyself to be thy
          proper Hell!” (I.i.250-1). This curse resonates throughout the play, most audibly, perhaps, in Manfred’s final exchange with the demon or
          “genius”—this one anything but devout—who comes to fetch him off to some indeterminate underworld, Christian or pagan or neither: “I
          bear within / A torture that could nothing gain from thine” (III.iv.137-8).</p>
               <p> A final parallel between <title level="m">Vathek</title> and <title level="m">Manfred</title> concerns the towers that constitute key
          settings in both works. Beckford’s tower, a Babel-like monument to Vathek’s self-infatuation, becomes the scene of a grisly combination of
          necromancy and human “sacrifice” (102). Manfred’s tower, featured in Act III, seems to have been the scene of another human sacrifice of
          sorts, the mysterious death of Astarte, who, according to the servant Manuel, was with Manfred “within his tower” at the time of an “event”
          still “darkly” spoken of, an event the reader cannot help relating to the “all-nameless hour” mentioned in Manfred’s opening speech
          (III.iii.32-41, I.i.24). Peter Cochran, following McGann’s notes, seeks to differentiate the two works, consigning the “stupid” Vathek to a
          “monomaniac level” of “mother-fixation” and shared guilt that contrasts starkly with Manfred’s “dignity” and autonomous status as “his own
          tempter” and “his own Nemesis” (<title level="j">CPW</title> IV:474; <title level="m">Manfred</title> 202-4). Yet when one looks closely at
          Manfred’s relevant speeches, one finds not autonomy but a tissue of allusion and quotation, especially in relation to Milton’s Satan, but,
          as we have noticed, with a secondary echo of Vathek as well. Manfred’s—and Byron’s—ironic reliance on prior texts and voices precisely
          at the moment of claiming a sovereign, self-determining “mind” remains, for me, crucial to understanding the self-cancelling, self-critical
          nature of Manfred’s wishfully autonomous stance (III.iv.129).<note xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" resp="author" n="9"> As I first argued in
            1988: see <title level="m">A Mental Theater</title>, pp. 55-8.</note>
               </p>
               <p> In concluding, let me stress that I have not attempted to build a case for regarding <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a work of
          literary Orientalism. Had Byron wished to write an Orientalist poem, he knew exactly how to do so, having revived and all but patented that
          form in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> and the other “Turkish Tales” that followed. Rather, in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron
          gave a pronounced Orientalist edge to an Alpine Gothic play that programmatically refuses to declare its allegiances, religious,
          mythological, geographical, literary, or generic. This studied and, for its time, shocking eclecticism, this iconoclastic resistance to
          categorization, does indeed risk being taken for comedy, as more than one reviewer and critic has noted, and does invite parody, as Gilbert
          Abbot à Beckett’s <title level="m">Man-Fred</title> so memorably attests. Yet it also inspires the sort of iconoclastic “thrill” that Thomas
          Cooper recalled in the early nineteenth century and that, I believe, remains available to us in the early twenty-first. To borrow a key term
          from Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud’s recent and excellent study, <title level="m">Radical Orientalism</title>, in its heterodox and skeptical
          treatment of religion, in its hero’s resistance to all forms of authority, in its implicit idealization of an illicit sexual relation, and
          even in its generic ambiguity, <title level="m">Manfred</title> embodies in its own way what Cohen-Vrignaud calls, in relation to the
          Turkish Tales, Byron’s “infidelity” (178-217). We scholars continue to interrogate <title level="m">Manfred</title>, as indeed we should and
          as the other essays in this <title level="s">Praxis</title> volume eloquently attest. And, in a time of renewed hostility between West and
          East, a time of borders and walls and reactionary nationalistic nostalgia worthy of Castlereagh, we might do well to let <title level="m">Manfred</title> interrogate us.</p>

               <p>The writers and political figures Byron most admired—Alexander Pope, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Benjamin Franklin, Voltaire,
          Montesquieu, and George Washington—were all Freemasons. He admired them because of their talent and their moral outlook. Byron praises
          Franklin for his letters on religious toleration, for example, and holds up Washington as an example of self-effacing civic leadership in
          “Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte” (1814). Yet Byron’s relationship to the craft was at least as complex as Benjamin Franklin’s. The unlikely name
          Franklin adopted of “Silence Dogood” (Van Doren 21) concealed Benjamin Franklin’s more lascivious and libertine ways: his erstwhile marriage
          to Deborah Read (Van Doren 50), his illegitimate son William (Van Doren 91), pornography collection, sexual advice column, and 16-day visit
          to the notorious Sir Francis Dashwood in October 1772, when Dashwood led the Hellfire club, or Medmenham monks (Van Doren 437). Franklin
          conversed with Byron’s grandfather about the Patagonians (Van Doren 357). Unlike Franklin, however, Byron enjoyed making himself appear
          worse than he was, quite the opposite conduct of a Mason. Byron inherited his interest in masonry from William Byron, the fifth Baron Byron
          (1722-1798), the uncle of George Gordon (our poet) and the one who shot Mary Chaworth’s father. That such a man could also become master of
          a Masonic lodge proved to some the depths to which masonry had fallen (Bullock 11). Nevertheless, this same uncle of George Gordon, the
          Sixth Lord, defended a man tortured by the Portuguese inquisition and took principled stands on political issues of the day (Walker 126).
          Appearances could be deceiving. Man was “Half-dust, half-deity,” to use the language of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, alike unfit “to
          sink or soar” (I.ii.40-1).</p>
               <p>In several quotations from “The Vision of Judgment,” Byron treated masonry facetiously, mocking the back stairs diplomacy and mysterious
          mumbo jumbo connected with its practitioners. As a young man, Byron staged lodge-like fraternal meetings at Newstead Abbey in imitation of
          Sir Francis Dashwood’s Medmenham Monks, where he would sip wine from a human skull, a ritual specified in the Royal Arch ceremony and
          several Carbonari rituals, and one which may well have been practiced by his great-uncle who built Folly Castle at Newstead. (Moore 142).
          Charles Skinner Matthews noted how he kept a wolf and a bear at Newstead, in separate rooms, and his friends dressed in monkish masquerade
          (Moore 142). Yet this appearance of wickedness concealed a passion for moral self-improvement: the villainous libertine and notorious
          womanizer, seducing the wives of his close friends, such as James Webster, joined a Masonic lodge in Ravenna and became the unlikely patron
          of Italian and Greek independence. Masonry seems a strange master ritual for Manfred, whose name connects him to the gothic novel, <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title>, but perhaps it is not so strange after all. Which side will Manfred join after evoking three sets
          of spirits, the Witch of the Alps, and the Abbot? Good or evil? What I hope to show in the pages that follow is that the play neither
          rejects Western dualism (man/nature; good/evil) nor critiques radical autonomy, but rather embraces Freemasonry as a unifying national and
          trans-national force, a vehicle for social improvement relatively free of cant.</p>
               <p>It might be helpful to begin with a definition: “Freemasonry is a fraternal organization that purports to ‘make good men better’ by
          teaching them a number of moral precepts through a complex and secret brand of symbolism and ritual” (Gunn 247). If Freemasonry is a form of
          theatre, then there is a theatrical aspect to Masonic initiation, alluded to explicitly in Act 3, that might be connected to Byron’s forays
          into mental theatre in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. In Act 3 of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, for example, the hero calls for a
          “casket” and a “key” (objects used in Masonic ceremonies) (III.i.5), but rejects magic, Manichaeism, the occult, the Witch of the Alps, and
          Arimanes; he accepts Freemasonry, which embraces all religions, repudiating the Abbot with his narrow notions of doctrinal religion, and
          returns his body to Nature by propelling himself off a mountain.</p>
               <p>Washington, Franklin, and other Enlightenment figures submitted themselves to a theatrics of self-improvement, as did Byron with the
          Carbonari in 1818. In most Masonic initiation ceremonies, such as Washington’s, the inductee is led into a room blindfolded (Hodapp 23). He
          utters a catechism. At the end of the ceremony, the blindfold is removed. Light symbolizes enlightenment. Various symbols are learned as
          mnemonic devices of the Mason’s rebirth. The tracing board and knotted rope become symbols of thorny problems that must be untied; the
          drinking from the skull of Christ, in the 32-degree ceremony, all demonstrate the power of moral edification through gesture, movement, and
          ceremony.</p>
               <p>According to the ceremony involved in becoming a Master Mason, the death of Hiram Abif, a murdered architect who helped build the temple of
          Solomon, is ritually re-enacted through the act of initiation. He knew the secret Mason’s word, died to be reborn, and his death reminds us
          that Freemasonry is connected with building not only pyramids, nations, and religions, but also moral human beings (Bullock 11). As Hiram
          prayed daily for guidance from his God before drawing the designs that would set the craftsmen to work, so must we. Each Master Mason
          becomes his own architect. Each supervises the building of that temple not made by hands, but by Yahweh (“I am that I am,” as he is known in
          the Hebrew bible). In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, the hero actually repeats the Old Testament statement, “I am that I am” (<title level="m">Exodus</title> 3:14), which has been adopted “in the higher Degrees of the York, American, and several other Rites” (Mackey
          II:326): <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Like Freemasons themselves, each unique Masonic apron (even Washington’s or Burns’s) is a testament to its owner’s belief in a life
          well lived in brotherhood with other like-minded men. Freemasonry is not a religion; the fraternity of Freemasonry embraces all religions.
          Alexander Pope, perhaps the greatest poetic influence on Byron and the figure he most often defended, spoke as an enlightened Mason when he
          published <title level="m">The Temple of Fame</title> in 1715. He refers to Egyptian temples, suggesting that their columns, walls and
          altars exemplified architectural perfection. In the “Universal Prayer, completed in 1738, Pope suggests ethical views resembling those of
          Freemasonry. He maintains that humans utilize reason to develop their spiritual temples and are benevolent, just, and tolerant in their
          relations with others” (Weisberger 52). “Before the conclusion of the Master Mason Degree, the candidate was told to seek the lost word
          during his travels. Known only by Hiram, this word was associated with the Attributes of Deity. Symbolized by the All-Seeing Eye, the
          Supreme Architect was described to the candidate as being Omnipotent and Omniscient” (Weisberger 34). Traditionally, the movement of the
          mason is from darkness to light, symbolized by the blind-fold he wears and that is dramatically removed. “After ending his travels, the
          candidate was given an oath, had his blindfold removed, and was provided with light and with the teachings of the first degree. The
          candidate was informed that the lodge represents Nature and society and that his efforts should be devoted to understanding their laws and
          operations” (Weisberger 33). According to Margaret Jacob, “American orators spoke of the Copernican sun that unified and Enlightened’ the
          universe and bound it together `by the powerfully attractive influence of the Divine Principle of Friendship, Affection and Knowledge’”
          (146). Weisberger notes how “The Fellow Craft Degree especially embodied Enlightenment concepts and revealed the commitment of Modern
          Masonry to education. The Master of the lodge told the candidate that he was a fellow of the Masonic society, was expected to be benevolent
          and virtuous, and was to follow the light of knowledge” (34).</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> reverses the conventional direction of the Masonic initiative. Manfred goes from light toward darkness and
          finally toward self-oblivion, as in Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>, where Solomon’s temple becomes “Soliman’s” (Beckford
          247-49). I see this not as a critique of “the radical autonomy of the Byronic hero in this dramatic poem’s exploration of isolation, incest,
          and irreligion” (Dan White, Broadview, back jacket) or even as a celebration of it (Hubbell 17), but more as a restaging of Masonic
          ceremonies of self-improvement in and through nature (something like Byron’s pantheistic poem, “The Prayer of Nature”) (Moore 89). The
          nature Byron alludes to in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, however, is a nature radically un-Wordsworthian, as Timothy Morton has shown
          (Morton 158, 161). The problem with ecological readings of Byron’s play, beyond their presentism, however, is that they do not account for
          the direct engagement with forms of religion (Christian, Muslim, and Persian). Religion, after all, and the religious injunction against
          suicide, is what Byron’s mental drama is also, if not only, about. Here Madame de Staël’s “Essay on Suicide” might be more helpful than
          Hegel’s “Unhappy Consciousness,” especially since Madame de Staël was living across Lake Leman the very summer Byron wrote the play and
          Byron met her on more than one occasion (Morton 159). “She has made Copet as agreeable as society and talent can make any place on earth,”
          he told John Murray (Marchand 2:659). Even <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, the work from which Byron borrows the play’s epigraph, might be
          more useful than either Hegel or De Staël, for it directly raises the existential question of whether to be or not to be, and how.</p>
               <p>Manfred sees beyond the narrow world of simple-minded friends who console him, the Chamois Hunter and the Abbot. “There is more in the
          world than is dreamt of in your philosophy,” the epigraph reads, echoing Hamlet’s address to Horatio. Building on Alan Richardson’s careful
          tracing of Byron’s debts to <title level="m">Macbeth</title> and <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> in
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Manfred</title>, I would like to argue for <title level="m">Hamlet</title>’s relevance, since <title level="m">Hamlet</title>
          treats the ghostly presence of a murdered father and explores how ghosts influence the hero
          (<title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Mental Theatre</title> 48, 56). <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s counterpart to Hamlet’s father is
          Count Sigismund. The theme of magic recalls Richard Burton’s <title level="m">Anatomy of Melancholy</title>, one of Byron’s favorite books,
          and one that deals directly with the connection between spirits, melancholia, and the act of reading (Moore 81). <title level="m">Manfred</title> thus shares alchemical and Rosicrucian, not to say Masonic, interests with the seventeenth century Scottish spy and
          alchemist, Robert Moray; Alexander Pope’s “Rape of the Lock” (1712); Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire’s Rosicrucian novel,
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">The Sylph </title>(1779), which quotes Pope in its epigraph and title; Mozart’s
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">The Magic Flute </title>(1791); William Godwin’s
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">St. Leon, or the Rosicrucian </title>(1799); Percy Shelley’s
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">St. Irvyne, or the Rosicrucian </title>(1810), which was influenced by Godwin’s novel; and the opening
          scene from Goethe’s <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Faust, </title>which was developed in three sections until finally published in
          1806 (1772-1775; 1790; 1806). <title level="m">Manfred</title> is very much a poem or play of its day and reflects these literary works that
          treat the importance of Freemasonry as a revolutionary political movement.</p>
               <p> In 1819-1820, when he became involved with the Masonic lodge of the “’mericani” and the Carbonari (Eisler 670), Byron embarked on a course
          of Masonic “do-gooding,” which had begun in the House of Lords, continued in Italy, and ended in Greece (Gross, “A Poetic Revolutionary”
          217, 227). At this time, Byron began to deliberately misspell his publisher’s name, changing Murray to Moray. The allusion, unremarked upon
          in footnotes to Leslie Marchand’s letters, can be traced thanks to David Stevenson’s <title level="m">The Origins of Freemasonry</title>.
          Byron’s deliberate misspelling of Murray’s name most likely alludes to Robert Moray, Scottish occultist, diplomat, and spy for Charles II
          (1667), the royal family for whom Byron’s ancestors had fought. Moray is a Scottish Faust. As Stevenson notes, his interest in Hermeticism,
          Rosicrucianism, alchemy, and symbols typifies the sort of late Renaissance influences which had given birth to Scottish freemasonry in the
          era of William Schaw (102). This era folded occult studies into Christianity and recognized that esoteric knowledge could augment and
          explain Christian scripture, though its meanings should not be made accessible to everyone.</p>
               <p> Robert Moray reads the pentacle as an anagram spelling “Agapa” (Stevenson 173). “This character of Hyeroglyphick, which I call agapa, is
          famous amongst the Egyptians and Grecians,” Moray explains. “For the Egyptian part of it I remit you to Kircherus books…The Greekes
          accounted it the symbol of health and tranquillity.” Having explained “Agapa’s relationship to the pentacle, Moray then used that word as
          the basis for an acrostic which he wrote out for his correspondent: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Agapa (“he loves” or “love thou”) </l>
                        <l>Gnothi (an imperative “know” or “gain knowledge”) </l>
                        <l>Anecho (“remain constant” or “endure”) </l>
                        <l>Pisteuei (“he puts his trust in” or “he has faith in”) </l>
                        <l>Apecho (“Abstain” or “exercise restraint”)” (Stevenson 174) </l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Moray thought that his pentacle was a sign of health that exhibited God’s love (Agapa, or Agape). Henry Cornelius Agrippa
          illustrated the pentacle with five Greek letters round it in his famous <title level="m">De Occulta Philosophia</title> of 1533. That
          Manfred would also make use of imagery in his evocation of the spirits (Astarte as star) and in the opening of Act III seems fitting, since
          Manfred connects Astarte to another five-letter word, “Kalon” (III.i.13). The same summer that Byron started <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Mary Shelley began <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, which makes much use of the Faust legend, Rosicrucianism,
          Agrippa’s writings, and other aspects of the occult explored by her father’s Rosicrucian novel, <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799). </p>
               <p>For Masons, the pentagram recalls the five points of fellowship: <quote>[T]he figure five, often expressed as a pentacle, was widely
            regarded symbolically as referring to man by depicting his five extremities (head and limbs), and could also stand for the five wounds of
            Christ—connotations that may well account for the fact that the points of fellowship in freemasonry number five… Moray expounded the
            pentacle as a personal symbol standing for <title level="m">Agapa</title>, but he also accepted other levels of symbolic meaning, as when
            it was equated to stars. (Stevenson 175)</quote> Moray thought that his pentacle was a sign of health that exhibited God’s love (Agapa, or
          Agape), but there is nothing healthy about Astarte, the star that rules Manfred’s destiny. Astarte, “thy star,” appears to Manfred in the
          form of a pentagram, a star with occult significance (I.i.134). The reference is ambiguous: the stage direction tell us that “a star is seen
          at the darker end of the gallery” (51); we do not know by whom (the audience, Manfred?) and later we are told that “The star which rules thy
          destiny / Was ruled, ere earth began, by me” (a spirit, that rules a star) (I.i.110-1). Inverted, this pentagram, connected with Astarte,
          can be an Eden, in pre-lapsarian terms, or hell, a sign of the devil. The “lovelier star,” the seventh spirit’s words (which rules over this
          spirit of Astarte), becomes a comet and then the “monster of the upper sky!” (I.i.115-23). In Moray’s life “the star is Moray’s dead wife,
          now in the heavens, the seal a declaration of his continuing love” (Stevenson 178). </p>
               <p> In Goethe’s <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Faust, </title>a folded pentagram allowed Mephistopheles to enter and leave Faust’s
          study, in order to tempt him (I.1063-70). Like the five-lettered “Agape,” Astarte also works numerically. Both Astarte and Augusta are words
          with 7 letters (IV:1.1.110-31), a number with magical significance (“Seven”). Though Manfred naively assumes that all seven spirits are
          under his control, he comes to realize that six of the male spirits—Manfred addresses each as “him”—are subordinate to the seventh, that
          of woman; in fact, “mountain” and “night” are added as spirits for no other reason than to complete the anagram of woman (White and Beazel
          18-9). The first letters of “ocean, air, night, mountains, winds” when re-arranged spell “w-o-m-a-n,” and “earth” and “star” are left over.
          Woman’s power is shown by the fact that the Witch of the Alps bargains with Manfred’s soul to lead him to Arimanes: not unlike Caliph
          Vathek’s arrival at the Hall of Eblis in Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>. </p>
               <p>Masons believe that geometry represents the craft and that all six arts are subordinate to this all-important principle of measurement:
          geometry. “The seven liberal sciences or arts, as defined by classical authors, were grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music,
          and astronomy…all seven sciences were founded on one science, that of geometry,” as Stevenson explains (20). That Byron’s wife was an
          “amiable mathematician”—the “Princess of Parallelograms”– explains why this seventh spirit in the form of a woman is so powerful (February
          6, 1814, <title level="j">BLJ</title> IV:47). On October 28, 1816 Byron described Annabella as “formed for my destruction”; in a letter to
          his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, she is like Manfred’s “comet” (Augusta becomes Annabella, and finally a kind of sky-“monster”)
          (<title level="j" xml:space="preserve">BLJ </title>V:119). He had finished <title level="m">Manfred</title> only a few months before. “I
          loved her, and destroy’d her” could be said of both Augusta and Annabella (II.ii.117). Though he claims he has polluted Astarte, he also
          suggests why this is not so. One man’s incest is another man’s religion, as Montesquieu’s <title level="m">Persian Letters</title> shows,
          the text where the names Astarte and Aspheridon are first employed. </p>
               <p>Montesquieu’s <title level="m">Persian Letters</title> encouraged Byron to think about ethics deontologically: that is to say, not in terms
          of consequences but in terms of the acts themselves. In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron uses the religion of the Gabars, as
          Montesquieu had done in <title level="m">Persian Letters</title>, to view incest not as a taboo, but as a cultural practice. “What can you
          expect from a religion which makes you unhappy in this world and gives you no hope for the next?” Astarte’s brother asks Aspheridon in
          Montesquieu’s <title level="m">Persian Letters</title>. He continues to suggest that Magism precedes Islam and thus has a greater authority:
            <quote>Songez que la nôtre est la plus ancienne qui soit au monde ; qu'elle a toujours fleuri dans la Perse, et n'a pas d'autre origine
            que cet empire, dont les commencements ne sont point connus ; que ce n'est que le hasard qui y a introduit le mahométisme ; que cette
            secte y a été établie, non par la voie de la persuasion, mais de la conquête. Si nos princes naturels n'avaient pas été faibles,
            vous verriez régner encore le culte de ces anciens mages. Transportez−vous dans ces siècles reculés : tout vous parlera du magisme, et
            rien de la secte mahométane, qui, plusieurs milliers d'années après, n'était pas même dans son enfance. (Ibben to Usbek, Letter
            LXVII, p. 232)</quote>
                  <quote>Remember that ours (Magism, or Zoroastrianism) is the oldest religion in the world, that it has never ceased to flourish in Persia,
            and that it originated with the Persian empire, the beginnings of which are unknown; that it was only by chance that the religion of
            Mohammed was introduced, and that his sect established itself not by persuasion, but by conquest. If it were not for the weakness of our
            rightful princes, you would see the religion of the ancient magi still in force. If you go far back into the past, what you will hear
            everywhere is the voice of Magism, not of the Islamic sect, which several thousand years later was not even in its infancy. (Ibben to
            Usbek, Letter LXVII, p. 139) </quote> According to this reading, Byron’s exploration of Magism in <title level="m">Manfred</title> allows
          him to transvalue Christian morality, as he had done in <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies</title>, and as Beckford does in <title level="m">Vathek</title>. Byron does not critique “<emph>Western</emph> Dualism” (my italics) in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, for the play
          locates Manichaeism in Eastern religions as well (Hubbell 11). <title level="m">Manfred</title> shows Byron emancipating his hero from
          institutionalized religion altogether, as he hoped to do through his activity with the Carbonari and in Manfred’s rejection of the Abbott’s
          consolations. “For some, and Moray [see below] was evidently among them, the social bond provided by membership of a masonic lodge, provided
          a substitute bond to that of organised religion, with strong ethical overtones and ritual to replace, or more than replace, that present in
          protestant public religion” (Stevenson 186). Byron held this emancipated position as early as 1811, five years after he had penned “The
          Prayer of Nature” (Moore 88). “I am no Platonist, I am nothing at all,” he wrote to the amiable Francis Hodgson on September 3, 1811, “but
          I would sooner be a Paulician, Manichean . . . Zoroastrian, than one of the seventy-two villainous sects who are tearing each other to
          pieces for the love of the Lord and hatred of each other” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> II:89). Without proclaiming himself a “stupid
          atheist” or “irreligious libertine” (to use the language of the Masonic “Charges” that dated from 1723, chapter one, p. 48), Byron refuses
          to subscribe to one religious sect, for he sees Zoroastrianism as pre-dating them all (Manfred is later dubbed “A Magian of great power”
          [II. iv.31]). “Let me live well if possible, and die without pain,” he concluded in his letter to Hodgson; “The rest is with God” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> II:89). Byron’s refusal to engage in religious dissension in his letters with Hodgson is strikingly Masonic. As
          James Anderson’s “Constitution of the Freemasons” (1723) states, “But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of
          the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which
          all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinion to themselves, that is, to be good Men and true . . . by whatever Denominations or
          Persuasions they may be distinguish’d” (“The Charges of a Freemason”). Benjamin Franklin published this volume in 1734 in the United
          States.</p>
               <p>Taking this deontological and deistic stance a step further, following Franklin and other Masons, Manfred visits Arimanes. The play moves
          from the Christian gothic setting that opens the play to another hell, a Persian one, the Hall of Eblis, to use the term William Beckford
          employs (and from which Byron borrows). The stage direction at the beginning of Act II, scene iv states: “The Hall of Arimanes–Arimanes on
          his throne, a Globe of Fire, surrounded by the Spirits” (<title level="j">CPW</title> II.iv.473). Yet, when all is said and done, Manfred’s
          shocking journey, like Vathek’s, resembles nothing so much as a tedious lodge ceremony; worse still, the Eastern mysteries appear to be
          nothing more than a kind of Christian baptism. More unites these fellowship ceremonies than divides them. As Matthews notes of Newstead
          Abbey, Byron’s friends engaged in unspeakable acts, which involved little more than nibbling on sandwiches and reading books (Moore
          142).</p>
               <p>In Act II, Manfred visits a pre-historic (in fact, Persian) hell connected with stars and the sky, a mental theatre or Masonic embracing of
          all religions, though in inverted, Persian form. Byron borrows allusions to Arimanes and the Hall of Eblis from Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>, just as he borrowed the name Manfred from Walpole’s <title level="m">Castle of Otranto</title>, who was an excommunicated
          (1254) King of Sicily (1258-1266) (Montague 23). In <title level="m">Vathek</title>, characters who worship the pre-Adamite Sultans wander
          around with hearts on fire in their chests, like the somewhat variable iconography of the Rosicrucians, from which Freemasonry was an
          outgrowth. “The Rosicrucians took their name from the supposed founder of their order or brotherhood, Christian Rosenkreutz, or `Rosy Cross’
          . . . It would also immediately recall the coat of arms adopted by Martin Luther, a rose with a cross emerging from it, thus specifying that
          the movement was a Protestant one which strove for religious reform in the tradition of Luther—though it was not narrowly and exclusively
          bound to Lutheranism” (Stevenson 97). From ancient times, the rose was also a symbol of Aphrodite or Venus, and all acts of love that are
            <foreign xml:lang="la">sub rosa</foreign> or hidden (Stevenson 97). In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, these Masonic allusions are to
          Persia, Germany, and Greece, Englished, as it were. Arimanes “derives his name from Ahriman, the Principle of Darkness and Evil” in
          Zoroastrian mythology (McGann <title level="m">, CPW</title> IV:473). Having chosen to remove the “H” from Arimanes for example, Byron
          dabbles in orientalist themes, as portrayed by the freemason Montesquieu, without committing himself to the Persian religion, German
          Lutheranism, or the Greek worship of Aphrodite. Manfred is not a Christian but a “Magian of great power” (II.iv.31); “Aphridon,” as
          Richardson points out, describes his religion as Magisme, “le culte de ces anciens Mages” (Richardson 143). “Although the poem’s pervasive
          dualism ("half-dust, half-deity” [1.ii.40]) seems reason enough for Byron to have introduced Zoroastrianism into <title level="m">Manfred</title>, it is nevertheless helpful to have in Montesquieu’s connection of sibling incest with “Magisme” another ground for the
          initially startling appearance of a Persian deity set mainly in the Alps” (22). Since Manfred has also addressed Roman gods in the Coliseum
          passage, and the Greek term “Kalon” earlier in the play (another pentagram type word with five letters), I would argue that there is nothing
          startling at all in these allusions when we consider the thoroughly Masonic symbolism of the play, which has not been remarked upon before
          (III.i.13). Manfred’s interest is in “Kalon,” the Greek ideal of perfection and beauty (Broadview 49n2): “leaving that beautiful which still
          was so,” he says of the Roman Coliseum, “till the place / Became religion, and the heart ran o’er / With silent worship of the great of old”
          (III.iv.37-39). As Masons suggest, places can “Bec[o]me religion”: there is a direct analogy between the Masonic art of building beautiful
          buildings and the keeping of secrets necessary for the production of such architecture as pyramids, the Second temple, and the Coliseum. </p>
               <p>After the Hall of Arimanes scene with its “Globe of Fire” borrowed from Beckford (II.ii), <title level="m">Manfred</title> continues its
          parade of Masonic symbols: pentagrams, anagrams, and magical invocations, culminating in “one of the most important symbols of Freemasonry,”
          the key (Mackey II:384). Herman presents Manfred with the key and casket, symbols of rebirth. The key and the casket are connected not only
          to the effort to summon Astarte’s spirit, but also with having “a tongue of good report and to abstain from the debasing vices of slander
          and defamation” (perhaps that is why Astarte, like Annabella, says so little!) (Mackey II:384). Byron’s language resembles a Masonic
          ceremony: “the Worshipful Master raps his gavel a second time, looks to the candidate and says, `Brother Junior Warden, what is the hour?’
          The candidate stands up, but he is usually very confused at this point, because he has no idea what the meaning of the question is. The
          Worshipful Master raps his gavel again and repeats, `Brother Junior Warden, what is the hour?’” (“Death, Burial and Resurrection”). In his
          play, Byron uses the language of the Master Mason ceremony in the following exchange to provide a new context for baptism and rebirth: <quote>

          Casket, key, hour: all are Masonic symbols used in initiation rights, where the apprentice dies (like Manfred will die) to
          be reborn. Even the position of the sun has Masonic overtones, for the Masonic ceremony makes reference to “a stranger in the South" and
          also the “stranger to the East."</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Byron relies on words (“key,” “casket”), and even rhetorical questions (“what is the hour?”) borrowed from Freemasonry. In the
          ceremonies of the Masters Degree in the Adonhiramite Rite, for example, the following catechism appears: <quote>What do you conceal?<lb/>All
            the secrets which have been intrusted to me.<lb/>Where do you conceal them?<lb/>In the heart.<lb/>Have you a key to gain entrance
            there?<lb/>Yes, Right Worshipful.<lb/>Where do you keep it?<lb/>In a box of coral which opens and shuts only with ivory teeth.<lb/>Of what
            metal is it composed?<lb/>Of none. It is a tongue obedient to reason, which knows only how to speak well of those of whom it speaks in
            their <!-- DR: removed strange link around this word -->absence as in their presence. (Mackey 384) </quote> Speaking well of people is not
          something Manfred does, per se. Yet his effort to learn such a recalling of his own curses, to borrow the language of Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, aligns well with his project of self-annihilation and self-silencing.</p>
               <p> In the same way that Moray played with pentagrams, Manfred makes reference to another magical word, “Kalon,” that is also mentioned in
          Byron’s letters as a youth in the years 1806 and 1807. “If I did not know Philosophy / To be of all our vanities the motliest, / The merest
          word that ever fooled the ear / From out the Schoolman’s jargon, I should deem / The golden secret, the sought ‘Kalon’ found / And seated in
          my soul” (III.i.9-14). This Kalon, “seated in my soul,” is almost identical to the secrets that the Master Mason holds in his heart,
          symbolized by the key Manfred asks for at the opening of Act III and the casket, which symbolizes his rebirth through such secret knowledge.
          If Philosophy is a “Schoolman’s jargon,” however, where does that leave Freemasonry? In the land of allegory, or mental theater, and
          self-improvement. Like Hiram Abif’s secret password to build Solomon’s temple, Manfred’s use of key and casket serves to write (or make
          legible) this five-lettered word “Kalon,” the good, in his soul. Kalon is the key, both literally and figuratively, to the Good life. “It
          will not last, / But it is well to have known it, though but once: / It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense, / And I within my
          tablets would note down / That there is such a feeling” (III.i.14-8). Kalon is feeling of Masonic fraternity, something that cannot be noted
          down, though Manfred intends to do just that; it must be memorized. </p>
               <p>Manfred has “One chamber where none enter” (III.iii.7). Count Sigismund kept fellowship in this room, but he differed from his son: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Count Sigismund was proud, but gay and free—</l>
                        <l>a warrior and a reveler; he dwelt not</l>
                        <l>With books and solitude nor made the night</l>
                        <l>a gloomy vigil, but a festal time</l>
                        <l>Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks</l>
                        <l>and forests like a wolf, nor turn aside</l>
                        <l>From men and their delights. (III.iii.19-24) </l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The wolf recalls the creature Charles Skinner Matthews encountered when he visited Newstead Abbey, along with a bear, and a
          group of friends dressed up in masquerade outfits as monks (Moore 143). All separate rooms made Newstead Abbey an inverted Masonic lodge,
          complete with rituals that recalled the Medmenham Monks of Sir Francis Dashwood, who another Mason, Benjamin Franklin, had visited in 1762.
          Matthews even called Byron “Abbot” during his visit in 1806. Unlike the tenets of these eighteenth-century fraternal organizations, however,
          Manfred is decidedly misanthropic: he turns “aside from men and their delights” (III.iii.24) Having rejected science “as but an exchange of
          ignorance for that / Which is another kind of ignorance,” Manfred embraces no single religion—neither Persian nor Catholic—because
          Masonry insists on pluralism (II.iv.62-3). Does the G of Freemasonry stand for “God” or geometry? Even this is not specified. “Aye-father! I
          have had those early visions /And noble aspirations in my youth, / To make my own the mind of other men, the enlightener of nations”
          (III.i.104-7). Enlightener is the key word, and recalls Byron’s “The Prayer to Nature,” his “Father of light” as well as Masonry’s effort to
          make the “tongue obedient to reason,” and free of slander (Mackey II:384). </p>
               <p> By casting Manfred’s death as a literal suicide, rather than a symbolic one, Byron could well be satirizing the doctrines of Freemasonry
          (spirits, casket, key) and rebirth. This facetiousness is in keeping with attitudes towards Masonry that appear in <title level="m">The
            Vision of Judgment</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. When Byron did join the Americani in Ravenna in 1820—Teresa’s family
          were already members of the Carbonari, a branch of Freemasonry—he turned what he had once burlesqued, Freemasonry, into something more
          romantic, reversing the logic of Canto IV of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (to turn what was once romantic to burlesque) (Eisler
          670).</p>
               <p> And yet, by seeing the Abbot in <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a self-reference, an inside joke, we can merge the intentions of the
          cancelled third act, which satirized religion in a heavy-handed way, with the final product that Gifford approved: a more lightly veiled
          satiric, or comparativist work drawing on Masonic rituals that Franklin, Montesquieu and others would have understood. Byron’s use of
          Masonic symbols is evident in Matthews’s remembrance of a visit to Newstead Abbey as early as 1806, when Byron first earned the sobriquet of
          “Abbot.” He wrote: “I must not omit the custom of handing round, after dinner, on the removal of the cloth, a human skull filled with
          burgundy. After revelling on choice viands, and the finest wines of France, we adjourned to tea, where we amused ourselves with reading, or
          improving conversation—each, according to his fancy,—and, after sandwiches, &amp;c. retired to rest” (Moore 143). Were “the evening
          diversions” that Matthews describes edifying and “improving” or debauched? What does seem clear is that Byron, like Sir Francis Dashwood,
          converted Newstead Abbey into a parody of a Masonic lodge: 
        <quote>Ascend, then, with me the hall steps that I may introduce you to my Lord and his visitants. But have a care how you proceed; be mindful to
          go there in broad daylight, and with your eyes about you. For, should you make any blunder,--should you go to the right of the hall steps,
          you are laid hold of by a ear; and should you go to the left, your case is still worse, for you run full against a wolf!—Nor, when you have
          attained the door, is your danger over; for the hall being decayed, and therefore standing in need of repair, a bevy of inmates are very
          probably banging at one end of it with their pistols; so that if you enter without giving loud notice of your approach, you have only
          escaped the wolf and the bear to expire by the pistol-shots of the merry monks of Newstead. (Moore 142)</quote>
        These merry monks, drinking out of skulls, recall the drinking songs Robert Burns composed (Mackey I:285) and Thomas Jefferson recorded in
          his scrapbooks (Alderman, mss. 5948): songs of liberty, secret societies that brought about the American and French revolutions according to
          Bernard Fay, Margaret Jacobs and Stephen Bullock. Matthews walked 25 miles home, recording a memorable, transformative initiation at
          Newstead Abbey (Moore 142).</p>
               <p>Masonry received a more burlesque treatment five years after <title level="m">Manfred</title> was published, in Byron’s <title level="m">The Vision of Judgment</title>. After describing George III’s raucous entry into heaven, singing the 131<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>
          Psalm, for example, Byron describes the “damn’d souls” who can move freely about, returning to the “keys” and afterlife imagery he explored
          in Manfred’s suicide/rebirth: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>They are proud of this—as very well they may,</l>
                        <l>It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key</l>
                        <l>Stuck in their loins; or like to an “entre”</l>
                        <l>Up the backstairs, or such free-masonry:</l>
                        <l>I borrow my comparisons from clay,</l>
                        <l>Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be</l>
                        <l>Offended with such base low likenesses;</l>
                        <l>We know their posts are nobler far than these (LIV)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Byron’s reference to “back stairs” recalls the fact that Freemasonry lodges in London were often held in taverns which
          required back stairs to enter. At the same time, his great uncle, Grand Master of Freemasonry, whose name was William Byron, the fifth Lord,
          met William Chaworth on a back stair, according to court transcripts, and it was this confrontation that led to their duel (Walker 131).
          That great uncle, “the wicked Lord Byron” (William Byron, the fifth Lord) was perceived as damned despite his Freemasonry. By 1740, the
          original impetus of speculative Freemasonry within London had worn off, symbolized by the leadership of William, fifth Lord Byron. Elected
          grand master in 1747 at the age of twenty-five, he attended only three meetings during his five years at the head of the grand lodge—once
          to be installed, once to suggest a successor, and once to install him” (Bullock 89). Byron recalls his ancestor, specifically his murder of
          his neighbour on a backstair, in his poem <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. “Such freemasonry,” signaled by the metonym of “backstairs” (or
          secret societies and clandestine meetings) provides a glancing reference to the fraternity of brothers which is reinforced through
          enjambment and a preposition (“entre / Up the back stairs”). “Back stairs,” like other double entendres bandied about by Byron’s narrator in
          <title level="m" xml:space="preserve">Don Juan </title>(Gross, <title level="m">Byron: the Erotic Liberal</title> 129-30), may refer to
          their reputation as sodomites, preferring male to female companionship. Certainly the “gilt key” they hold resembles the one Manfred asks
          for in his Masonic ceremony that closes the play. Though he attacks George III and Robert Southey, Byron’s narrator in <title level="m">The
            Vision of Judgment</title> does not exempt himself from his own satire, for he is a little facetious upon everything: aristocracy,
          Calvinism, knighthood, and the masonry of his own uncle, William the fifth Lord Byron. St. Peter still holds the rusty keys to the kingdom,
          after all, and Byron delights in punning on what passes for virtue in a world in which some poets are hubristic enough to imagine that they
          can praise a King into heaven. After all, the American revolution showed George III as well as the colonies that blind obedience to tyranny
          never ends well (Bullock 89). Manfred’s suicide, perhaps the least religious or masonic thing he could have done, occurs in a play replete
          with masonic symbolism. Manfred articulates his existential beliefs, rather than those of any revolutionary brotherhood. “The mind which is
          immortal makes itself,” as Manfred puts it, “Requital for its good or evil thoughts” (III.iv.130).</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay considers <title level="m">Manfred, A Dramatic Poem</title> (1817) as a form of revenge tragedy. It takes its
          cues from the text’s <title level="m">Hamlet</title> epigraph, and from that primal text of Byronic hero-formation, Edward Young’s <title level="m">The Revenge</title> (1721), whose avenger, Zanga, Byron performed at Harrow. In the wake of the separation of April 1816, and
          inspired by the recent memory of the 1815 London theatre season in which Edmund Kean and John Philip Kemble played Zanga, Byron returned to this ur-text of
          revenge, I argue, as he started work on <title level="m">Manfred</title> in September 1816. Through the figure of Manfred the magician, the
          drama allegorizes Byron’s authorial agency as that fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power and intimate publicity: celebrity. In
          its mediation of the separation between Lord and Lady Byron of April 1816—as public scandal and private event—<title level="m">Manfred</title> functions as a kind of celebrity revenge tragedy that attempts to move through revenge (if not past it) toward more mixed
          forms of intimate commemoration, thereby re-setting the “springs of wonder” that connect Byron’s authorial practice to his audience and “the
          wisdom of the world” (<title level="m">Hamlet</title>).</p>

            V:209, 188)—Byron delivers the poem’s epigraph: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#right">And this is your Motto</p>
                        <lg>

                     </quote> The “Motto”—this
            ostentatiously laconic epigraph from <title level="m">Hamlet</title>—sets a certain tone: (1) for framing the arrival of the Magician,
            within the play and as a MS to Murray (about which Byron was anxious, having written the week before, “Write to say whether or no my
            Magician has arrived with all his scenes spells &amp;c,” [<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:204]); (2) for reading the play in all its
            intense self-reflexivity; and (3) for how Byron deals with literary predecessors, especially Shakespeare, quoted here with a customary
            kind of droll offhandedness.</p>
                  <p>Shakespeare’s play famously starts <foreign>in medias res</foreign> after the death of Hamlet’s father; so too does Byron’s epigraphed
            quotation come in the middle of the dialogue between Hamlet and Horatio about the ghost of Hamlet’s father, omitting
            Horatio’s response to the news that Hamlet has spoken to his father’s ghost, who has revealed his uncle’s dire machinations: “O day and
            night, but this is wondrous strange” (Shakespeare I.v.891). In Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet responds to Horatio’s marking of the “wondrous
            strange” with “give it welcome” (I.v.893). Hamlet’s comment, “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio / Than are dreamt of in
            your philosophy,” announces a kind of enlightened disillusionment, as though Horatio is a mere philosopher, without any access to the
            mysteries of heaven and earth, while Hamlet has access to it all—all the darkness—and is no longer surprised by any of it (I.v.
              894-5).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                this essay at the Wren Library. And I acknowledge the Australian Research Council for supporting the research and writing of this essay.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> The epigraph from <title level="m">Hamlet</title> was added in the third
                issue of the first edition of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which is Jerome McGann’s copy-text for <title level="m">CPW</title>.
                There are no less than three substantive texts of <title level="m">Hamlet</title>; some editions, based on the First Folio, give “our
                philosophy” in place of “your philosophy,” which suggests a gentler response from Hamlet, less of the retort that is
                  “<emph>your</emph>” philosophy. Byron owned a copy of the 1788 <title level="m">Bell’s Edition of Shakespeare</title>, which is the
                edition I use throughout.</p>
                     </note> This invocation of Hamlet echoes Byron’s enlightened disillusionment at the revelation that Lady
            Byron, Annabella Milbanke, has been through his letters: “I am past indignation,” he wrote to Augusta Leigh, as he toured the Alps that
            were to feature as the setting of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (Sep. 14, 1816, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V:93) and in the <title level="j">Alpine Journal</title> that Byron wrote for Augusta.<note place="foot" resp="author">The <title level="j">Alpine
                Journal</title>, written in September-October 1816 as Byron toured the Alps with John Cam Hobhouse, has long been regarded as a key
              intertextual source for <title level="m">Manfred</title>, at least since the first officially collected edition of Byron’s works, of
              1832-3, when highlights of the <title level="j">Journal</title> accompanied the text, and when Byron’s correspondence with Murray about
              the poem was presented as an aid to interpretation by being placed for readers before the text of the poem (see <title level="m">Works</title>, XI, 3-4).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motto’s laconic disillusionment cues the hinterland of “bitterness” that informed Byron’s life and writing after April 1816, when
            everything became mediated by the memory of “the Separation;” this was particularly pronounced when Byron was writing the first two acts
            of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in Switzerland in September-October 1816 (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:104). As he writes to Augusta
            from the Diodati on September 8, 1816: “As for me I am in good health—&amp; fair—though very unequal—spirits—but for all that—she—or
            rather—the Separation—has broken my heart—I feel as if an Elephant had trodden on it—I am convinced I shall never get over it—but I try .
            . . I breathe lead” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:91). Writing “she—or rather—the Separation,” as though the thought of Lady Byron might
            be easier to bear by turning the person (“she”) into the event of the separation, Byron both separates and conflates the two. </p>
                  <p>The <title level="m">Hamlet</title> epigraph cues philosophy as the domain of the play’s protagonist, the magician Manfred, who in the
            opening monologue invokes the epigraph’s recessed figure of wonder: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Philosophy and science, and the springs</l>
                           <l>Of wonder, and the wisdom of the world,</l>
                           <l>I have essayed, and in my mind there is</l>
                           <l>A power to make these subject to itself—</l>
                           <l>But they avail not: (I.i.13-7)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> As Manfred laconically recites this list of things that do not avail themselves of his power to subject them—“Philosophy
            and science,” “the springs of wonder,” and “the wisdom of the world”—the poem thereby also ironically undercuts that very power, gaining
            its own power through the force of this critique of Manfred, and, through it, Byron’s public self-critique. For, as Jerome McGann has
            noted, “That Manfred is Byron’s surrogate has never been in doubt” (192). Such gaining through the undercutting of power is also suggested
            by Byron’s final salutation to Murray, when, having earlier requested that Murray submit the play to William Gifford for his reactions,
            Byron sends his love and thanks to Gifford (Murray’s chief literary adviser and Byron’s editor), for having judged and found wanting the
            play’s original third act (which Byron agreed was “d—d bad” [<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:211]). Also registered in Manfred’s opening
            monologue as “the wisdom of the world” is that strange, capricious prerogative by which audiences are both subject to the
            celebrity-author’s powers but also free <emph>not</emph> to be subject to them. In this way, <title level="m">Manfred</title> stages the
            rituals of celebrity culture and audience reception as objects of exploration.</p>
                  <p>To link one paratextual space of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (the drama’s epigraph) to another (the letter that sends it), the
            “Motto” makes a direct address from Byron to Murray, enacting a pre-existing relationship between Byron as Hamlet and Murray as Horatio
            that Murray initiated in 1814 when he signed off on a letter in which he requested a portrait of Byron—“the Original to whose continued
            friendship I owe so much”—with the salutation “I am my Lord ‘your poor servant ever’” (Murray 99). As such, the epigraph (“your Motto”)
            can be read as an indirect reprimand to Murray for having failed to properly appreciate the play, and for being backward in coming forward
            to “give it welcome” with either praise or constructive critique; Gifford, on the other hand, is conspicuously thanked for doing precisely
            that. To Murray, his avowedly “poor servant ever,” Byron signs “Yours ever,” while to Gifford he sends his “love and thanks.” This history
            of Shakespearean role-playing applies a further paratextual twist to Byron’s reference to “your philosophy”: questioning Murray’s
            self-identification as “your poor servant” and subtly impugning Murray’s loyalty. After <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication,
            Murray’s failure to report on the poem’s public reception became a theme of Byron’s testy correspondence, intensely interested as Byron
            was in the public’s reaction to a work that so clearly revisited the scandalous events that spurred his departure from England in April
            1816.</p>

                  <p>The <title level="m">Hamlet</title> epigraph is also significant in cueing the genre of the Elizabethan revenge tragedy; it is the
            conventions of the revenge genre, I argue, that Byron’s dramatic poem engages with its own “springs of wonder.” The word “springs” works
            here in what we might call an Alpine sense—meaning the places from which water and inspiration flow—but also in the sense of tricks,
            surprises, contraptions, a form of machine, like Hamlet’s play within a play: the mouse trap. (And Manfred is not a mouse, of course, but
            a worm—“Thou worm!” [I.i.125],—though his maker <emph>had</emph> had his heart trodden on by an Elephant.) Where Hamlet traps the
            conscience of the king, <title level="m">Manfred</title> sets out to catch the conscience of its author. In his discussion of Byron’s
            revision of the third act in the <title level="m">Life</title>, Thomas Moore deploys “spring” with a similar ambiguity, as he marvels over
            “the complete success with which, when his mind <emph>did</emph> make the spring, he at once cleared the whole space by which he before
            fell short of perfection,” using the figure of <emph>making the spring</emph> to suggest Byron both making the mental leap and crafting
            the machine or device (<title level="m">Life</title> IV:15).</p>
                  <p>Engaging the play’s makings and re-makings of revenge’s “springs of wonder,” my essay considers <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a
            form of revenge tragedy—the vital if broken heart of a sustained post-separation revenge fantasy that encompasses Byron’s letters and the
              <title level="j">Alpine Journal</title>. It examines how <title level="m">Manfred</title> allegorizes Byron’s authorial agency as
            that fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power, and intimate publicity: celebrity. I argue that in its mediation of the marital
            separation—as public scandal and in the forms of private commemoration—<title level="m">Manfred</title> functions as a kind of celebrity
            revenge tragedy that seeks to re-set the “springs of wonder” that connect Byron’s authorial practice to his audience and “the wisdom of
            the world.”</p>
                  <p>As the Elephant and the breathing of lead (which lined coffins) remind us, Byron had a generous capacity to be refreshed by self-parody,
            which often took the turn of Gothic pantomime and melodrama. For the Gothic mode cues pantomime, as Byron did explicitly in the April 9
            letter to Murray: “As for ‘Manfred’ . . . You must call it ‘a poem,’ for it is <emph>no drama</emph> (&amp; I do not choose it to be
            called by so Sothebyish a name)—a ‘poem in dialogue’ or—pantomime if you will” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:209). There is melodrama,
            too, which points the play’s intense self-reflexivity in the direction of emotion. <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s profuse Gothic
            intertexts are so many “membra” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:208)—limbs, arms and legs, quoted, discarded, remade and recycled:
            Walpole’s <title level="m">Otranto</title>, originator of the genre, and his melodrama <title level="m">The Mysterious Mother</title>;
              <title level="m">The Monk</title> (by “wonder-working Lewis,” as Byron put it in <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch
              Reviewers</title>, l. 265); Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>, that Lewis “translated . . . to me by word of mouth,” when he
            visited the Diodati in mid-August (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:206), and from which, as Goethe himself put it, Byron’s play drew the
            “strangest nourishment” (qtd. in Butler 33).<note place="foot" resp="author">Moore translates this as “strongest nourishment” (<title level="m">Works</title>, IV 322).</note> A less remarked but no less vital, and specifically theatrical, generic intertext for <title level="m">Manfred</title> is the Elizabethan revenge tragedy. Mediating between eighteenth-century Gothic and Elizabethan revenge
            tragedy is Marlowe’s <title level="m">Tragical History of Dr Faustus</title> (1604) about a necromancer who sells his soul to the
            Devil—which Byron denied having read or seen performed (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:268, 270). As a generic intertext, Elizabethan
            revenge tragedy literalizes <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s play with dead bodies and threats of scattered limbs: “Crush the worm! /
            Tear him in pieces!” (II.iv.49); “what ye take / Shall be ta’en limb from limb” (III.iv.104); “I sent him all three acts piecemeal, by the
            post” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:188). Thomas Kyd’s <title level="m">Spanish Tragedy</title> (1592); Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Hamlet</title> (1601, itself a revision of a lost play by Kyd); <title level="m">Othello</title> (1602-4); and the anonymous <title level="m">The Revenger’s Tragedy</title> (1607, attributed to Tourneur and Middleton), all bristle in the intertextual background, as
            does the genre of Restoration tragedy cued by Byron’s comparison of <title level="m">Manfred</title> with “Nat. Lee’s Bedlam tragedy”
              (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:179).</p>
                  <p>An even more vital intertext for <title level="m">Manfred</title> is <title level="m">The Revenge</title> (1721), by the
            graveyard poet Edward Young. To some extent a reworking of Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Othello</title>, Young’s <title level="m">Revenge</title> was a primal text for Byron, who performed its central character, the avenging Moor, Zanga, at Harrow Speech Day in
            1805. As Paul Elledge memorably notes, “Zanga is a patently juicy role, offering numerous openings for stagy exhibitionism, overstated
            deviltry, especially to a boy prone to and notorious for mischief-making himself” (129). Not only to a boy, but to that fully-fledged icon
            of serially elaborated notoriety that Byron would become after the separation and his move into exile: “Consistently [Byron] forced his
            readers to like and admire against their wills, to like and desire the forbidden, to applaud the transgressive actions he lavished upon
            them. Zanga fostered that impulse” (Elledge 129). Zanga is an early experiment in the Byronic Satanic hero, the thrillingly ambivalent
            tragic hero who teeters on the brink of villainy. Thus Byron reworks from Young’s reworking of Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Othello</title> one of the key discoveries of the Elizabethan revenge play: that the revenger is not a villain but a tragic
            protagonist. Within such a transformed conception of heroism, the figure of Zanga had an enduring significance for Byron; as late as 1821
            Zanga crowns a canon of Satanic-tragic heroes, as Byron asks rhetorically: “Who is the hero of ‘Paradise lost’? Why Satan,—and <title level="m">Macbeth</title>, and <title level="m">Richard</title>, &amp; <title level="m">Othello</title> and <title level="m">Pierre</title>, and <title level="m">Lothario</title>, &amp; Zanga?” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VIII:115).</p>
                  <p>Young’s <title level="m">Revenge</title> was a live text in Byron’s childhood and throughout the Regency, when Zanga was performed by
            major actors such as “Master” Betty, John Kemble and Edmund Kean.<note place="foot" resp="author">As Gerald Parker details, Zanga had also
              been performed by Garrick’s contemporary, Henry Mossop, who Byron playfully cites as a fancied rival when he nostalgically recollects
              his own performance in “On a Distant View of Harrow” (1806). In 1815, Kemble and Kean competed for the role, and were celebrated by
              Leigh Hunt and William Hazlitt, respectively (see Parker 178-9).</note> An early fan of Kean (“a wonder”), Byron wrote in February 1814:
            “There is a new Actor named Kean come out—he is a wonder—&amp; we are yet wise enough to admire him—he . . . will run Kemble hard—his
            style is quite new—or rather <emph>renewed</emph>—being that of Nature” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> IV:67). That style of “Nature” was
            an emotional style, and Kean was most famous for his powerfully impassioned outsider roles such as Richard III and Shylock, and his
            capacity for turning villains into compelling tragic heroes. Given that <title level="m">The Revenge</title> was such a formative event
            for Byron, far more significant in the role of Zanga than either Kean and Kemble was “Master” Betty, the sensational child actor, William
            Henry West Betty, also known as “the Young Roscius,” who performed Zanga in the 1805-6 season. As a peer of Byron’s at Harrow (and then at
            Cambridge [Christ’s]), and having played Hamlet five times at Drury Lane during Byron’s 1805 March schooltime (Elledge 108), Master Betty
            was the object of an “urgent rivalry” conceived by Byron, Elledge intriguingly speculates (121).</p>
                  <p>In the wake of the separation, and with the memory of a recent 1815 London theatre season in which Kean and Kemble had played
            Zanga, Byron returns to this “juicy role” and primal ur-text of revenge as he works on <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Another detail
            helps explain <title level="m">The Revenge</title>’s juiciness: a remark in the preface of the 1792 stage edition that <title level="m">The Revenge</title> is “yet better in the closet than upon the Stage” (Young iii). This recommendation of <title level="m">The
              Revenge</title> as a “closet drama” would have heightened the play’s appeal for Byron while he was writing <title level="m">Manfred</title>—which he did, avowedly, <emph>not</emph> for the stage;<note place="foot" resp="author"> Byron’s most emphatic protest
              against the staging of <title level="m">Manfred</title> comes in the letter to Murray, from Venice, March 9, 1817: “The thing I have
              sent you you will see at a glimpse—could never be attempted or thought of for the stage—I much doubt it for publication even.—It is too
              much in my old style—but I composed it actually with a <emph>horror</emph> of the stage—&amp; with a view to render even the thought of
              it impracticable” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V: 185). Erdman offers the classic analysis of this statement, and of the ambivalence
              that informs it.</note> Byron’s choice of <title level="m">The Revenge</title> would have fueled—and been fueled by—Byron’s revenge
            toward the London stage, thickening the extra-textual plots of revenge that <title level="m">Manfred</title> lovingly-hatingly
              reworks.<note place="foot" resp="author">Contributing to the sense of <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a play within a play, and of
              Byron as the author within his own play, a commiserating letter of February 1817 to Douglas Kinnaird (who had just resigned from the
              Drury Lane Subcommittee, after a falling out with the actress, Frances Maria Kelly) suggests further reasons why the genre of revenge
              tragedy was chosen to effect Byron’s revenge on the stage and on Drury Lane: “Sooner or later you will have your revenge—&amp; so shall
              I (in other matters) you on the stage &amp; I off—&amp; by Nemesis” (Feb. 3, 1817, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V: 168). Here, Byron’s
              figure of revenge “off” “the stage” captures precisely his ambivalent relation to the stage that manifests itself against it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In Young’s <title level="m">The Revenge</title>, the central character, Zanga, is a captive Moor, son of a king, Abdalla, who was killed
            in battle by Alonzo, now Zanga’s master. Unbeknown to Alonzo, Zanga harbours against him an all-consuming passion “To catch the man I
            hate, and then devour” (27). Having “toil’d, and groan’d for an occasion / Of ample vengeance” (9), Zanga decides upon jealousy as his
            motive—“Oh, jealousy . . . Thou king of torments” (27), that “Hydra of calamities” (26), “the jealous are the damn’d” (26)—and crafts an
            appropriately intricate scheme to make Alonzo jealous of his wife, Leonora. With all the rich dramatic irony that attends the genre,
            Alonzo enlists Zanga in his own plot of revenge against Leonora (“Thou, Zanga, . . . call vengeance, call the furies, call despair” [67]);
            and, as instructed, Zanga kills Carlos, Leonora’s alleged lover (“Poor mangled shade!”). But then Alonzo’s plan of vengeance goes astray.
            As Alonzo confides his scheme to meet Leonora in a leafy bower so as to confront her with her crime and kill her, the play delivers up the
            sweet spot of Zanga’s “maze / Of gloomy thought and intricate design” (27), with a striking (and strikingly Byronic) fantasy of sadistic
            bisexual perversity in glorious blank verse, when Zanga responds to Alonzo’s plan—sotto voce—with a vengeful curse: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>May serpents winding up the trees let fall</l>
                           <l>Their hissing necks upon them from above,</l>
                           <l>And mingle kisses—such as I should give them. (70)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> In this promiscuous tableau of acoustic mingling (of “hissing” with “kisses”) and gender-slithery/gender-neutral
            pronouning (of Zanga kissing “them”—Alonzo and Leonora), the spicy climax of Zanga’s curse, “And mingle kisses—such as I should give
            them,” brazenly suggests, of course, the erotic kiss, but also, more indirectly, the fatal kiss of death—the kiss “such as I should [like
            to] give them,” but can’t, but which serpents <emph>can</emph> deliver. The serpents are thus in this fantasy scenario the romantic
            stand-ins that carry out Zanga’s plots of desire and revenge. As it transpires, Alonzo and Leonora do not meet their ends by being fatally
            hissed and kissed. Instead, when Alonzo is poised to kill her with a dagger, Leonora wakes up, and Alonzo flees. Zanga then tells Leonora
            of her husband’s jealousy; Leonora and Alonzo meet to try and resolve matters, but then quarrel, at which point Leonora stabs herself. In
            the final explosive scene, Zanga exultingly discloses himself to Alonso, defiantly confessing: “I hated, I despis’d, and I destroy!” (82),
            before he “tramples on the body of his prostrate victim” (Hazlitt 228). For William Hazlitt, Kean played this in “an attitude . . . that
            was not the less dreadful from its being perfectly beautiful” [Hazlitt 228]). This is the scene that Byron played at Harrow.</p>
                  <p>Heavily based on Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Othello</title>, Young’s <title level="m">Revenge</title> offers a heightened treatment
            of the revenge plot’s imbrication with sexual jealousy and race, together with an arguably more complex characterization of the figures of
            the revenger and the Moor.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a detailed discussion, see Parker, esp. 173-79.</note> Zanga is a composite
            of the vengeful Iago and Othello as Moor to Alonzo’s reworking of Othello as jealous lover. But unlike Iago, Zanga has a conscience (“Oh,
            the medley / Of right and wrong! The chaos of my brain!” [68-9]). And his revenge is not just personal but cultural, political and
            religious, responding to centuries of oppression of Muslims by Catholic Spain: “I tread on haughty Spain, and all her kings” (82); “Be
            propitious, / Oh! Mahomet, on this important hour, / And give at length my famish’d soul revenge” (10). Zanga’s revenge also has a
            (proleptically Byronic) geopolitical edge: “If cold white mortals censure this great deed, / Warn them, they judge not of superior beings,
            / Souls made of fire, and children of the sun, / With whom revenge is virtue” (84). Such righteous opposition by “children of the sun” to
            the “cold white mortals” of England becomes an abiding trope of Byron’s post-exilic world. These “children of the sun” are summoned again
            in Byron’s “speech of Manfred to the Sun”—one of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s many echoes of <title level="m">The Revenge</title>
              (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:211).</p>
                  <p>Operating as a model for Byron’s fashioning of Nemesis—the goddess of retribution—Young’s Zanga offers a florid homage (and more fabulous
            snakes) to the figure of Vengeance: <quote>

                     </quote> Young’s <title level="m">Revenge</title> closes with the immortal line: “And each man finds a Zanga in his heart” (87).
            Byron finds his inner Zanga in the wake of the separation, imaginatively deploying against Lady Byron and the Milbanke family a powerfully
            personified vengeance that also fuels the early work on <title level="m">Manfred</title>. From Ouchy, on September 17, 1816, Byron writes
            to Augusta about Lady Byron and the springs of vengeance: <quote>Whatever my faults might or may have been—<emph>She</emph>—was not the
              person marked out by providence to be their avenger. One day or another her conduct will recoil on her own head; <emph>not</emph>
              through <emph>me</emph>, for my feelings toward her are not those of Vengeance, but—mark—if she does not end miserably <foreign>tot ou
                tard</foreign>. She may think—talk—or act as she will . . .—but woe unto her—the wretchedness she has brought upon the man to whom she
              has been everything evil . . . will flow back into its fountain. (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:95).</quote> Indeed, Lady Byron is
            imagined here <emph>as</emph> the springs of vengeance. Avowing that his feelings “are not those of Vengeance,” Byron nevertheless
            produces a pantomimic revenge fantasy that figures Lady Byron as a fountain of wretchedness—like a fast-motion cartoon of the reversal of
            fortune whereby Lady Byron’s vengeance is made to “flow back into its fountain” (Lady Byron herself) and “recoil on her own head.”
            Revenger and victim are inextricably linked; the blame for invoking vengeance is shared. So enmeshed is Byron in this revenge fantasy that
            he projects onto Lady Byron a desire to be <emph>his</emph> avenger, even as he repudiates her claim, casting her as his avenger in order
            precisely to repudiate her: “<emph>She</emph>—was not the person marked out by providence to be their avenger.” Byron ritualistically
            invokes an impersonal providence, rhetorically inflating the animus against Lady Byron (who is “everything evil”) and the discord between
            them. As in any revenge tragedy, “revenge reproduces the injustice it abhors”—enacting what Francis Bacon called revenge’s “wild justice”
            (Mullaney 147; qtd. in Mullaney, 147).</p>
                  <p>A couple of weeks later, in an entry in the <title level="j">Alpine Journal</title>, Byron again tries to will himself out of the desire
            for vengeance: “I am past reproaches—and there is a time for all things—I am past the wish of vengeance” (Sep. 29, 1816, <title level="m">BLJ</title> V:105). But he is not past it. Far from it. The statement is deeply ambiguous: even disclaiming his own wish for vengeance,
            Byron keeps open the possibility of an impersonal providence whose wish it might be to carry out that wish for vengeance on Byron’s
            behalf. Sure enough, as Byron writes to Augusta as late as June 3-4, 1817, a couple of weeks before <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s
            publication in Byron’s homeland while he is abroad in exile, “sooner or later time &amp; Nemesis will give me the ascendant” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:232). But far from denying, Byron’s writings are self-reflexively alive to these contradictions.</p>
                  <p>Such avowals-disavowals stage a dress rehearsal for what John Wilson (“Christopher North”) called in his <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> the “wild Personifications” of “this extraordinary drama”: Byron has
            “burst into the world of spirits” and “endeavoured to embody and call up before him their ministering agents, and to employ these wild
            Personifications, as he formerly employed the feelings and passions of man” (Wilson 290).<note place="foot" resp="author">Speaking of
              “wild Personifications,” and how they relate to “feelings and passions,” Steven Mullaney’s question about the ghost of Andrea and his
              companion Revenge in <title level="m">The Spanish Tragedy</title>—“should we call him a character, an embodied spirit or vengeance from
              Hades, or a personified allegory?” (Mullaney 64)—is also an appropriate question, I suggest, for the legion of Spirits, such as Nemesis,
              that populate <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s often crowded stage.</note> Another critic who liked Byron’s “wildness” was John Wilson
            Croker, who reviewed for the <title level="j">Quarterly</title>, and urged Murray to encourage Byron to continue with the “extravagance.”
            “Its wildness or, if you will, its extravagance, is to me its first recommendation” (Murray 225), Croker wrote, supporting his case by
            quoting Voltaire on <title level="m">Hamlet</title>: “amongst the beauties that sparkle in the midst of these terrible extravagances the
            ghost of Hamlet’s father is one of the most striking pieces of theatre” (May 12, 1817, qtd. in Murray 226). Murray showed Croker’s letter
            to Byron, which would have confirmed for Byron the strength and fitness of his use of the ghost of Hamlet’s father’s as a structuring
            absence in the poem.<note place="foot" resp="author">Coincidentally, Byron had already been reading Voltaire as he worked on <title level="m">Manfred</title>, writing to Hobhouse on March 31, 1817 that he had just bought “a complete Voltaire in 92 volumes—whom I
              have been reading” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V: 199).</note>

                  <p>In the weeks after <title level="m">Manfred</title> was published on June 16, Byron’s inner Zanga is still playing out in Byron’s
            letters: <quote>[I]f I can but live to tear down . . . that . . . Philistine family—I shall not have lived in vain—&amp; if Time &amp;
              Nemesis but do their usual part—&amp; reverse the present tide of human fortunes—see whether I leave one stone of their hearths upon
              another—or a fibre of their hearts unscorched by fire. (Jul. 3, 1817, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V:246).</quote> Having found his
            inner Zanga, and fired by vengeance’s charms, Byron fashions Nemesis as a pervasive figure in his letters, journals and poetry, from the
            time of the separation and the composition and publication of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, and for long after.</p>
                  <p>And what of the play itself? In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Nemesis arrives with appropriate fanfare and a sense of
            expectation—“Behold she cometh,” notes the Third Destiny—but also with an edge of drollery. Harried and late (“I was detained repairing
            shattered thrones”), she nevertheless obliges Manfred by conjuring Astarte, and with a rousing flourish: “Redeem from the worm.
            Appear!—Appear!—Appear!” (II.iv.95-6). This flourish hosts an intertextual exorcism, as “Appear!—Appear!—Appear!” gothically inverts
            Hamlet’s words to his father’s ghost: “Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit” (I.5.909). However, much like all the other assembled Spirits and
            Demons, Nemesis turns out to be somewhat disappointing. Commanding the spirit of Astarte to “speak”—“By the power which hath broken/ The
            grave which enthrall’d thee”—Astarte refuses and Nemesis is “baffled” (II.iv.106-7, 117). Nemesis’s final words to Manfred are vaguely
            withholding; when he asks her will he meet her again on the earth, she replies officiously, “That will be seen hereafter” (II.iv.166).
            This scene with Nemesis and Astarte can also be read as a reworking of Germaine de Staël’s attempt to broker a reconciliation between Lord
            and Lady Byron, in the early stages of the separation.<note place="foot" resp="author">For details, see Marchand III, 644-5, 650-1, and
              Moore, <title level="m">Works</title> III, 285-8.</note> Indeed, herself a fellow celebrity exile, de Staël is a significant protagonist
            in the biographical events reworked in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, and in the play’s paratextual background and critical reception.
            Jerome McGann’s marvelous reading of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which celebrates Byron’s “spoiler’s art” and illuminates how
            “Byron’s play can only succeed by attacking itself, satirizing and exposing itself to itself,” takes its cues from de Staël’s reading of
            the deliberate “bad taste” of Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> (McGann 194-5). The legitimator of deliberate bad taste, of bad
            taste as a strategy, de Staël is also significant as the mediator of Byron’s first encounter with Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>
            (before Lewis’s oral translation at the Diodati), through what Thomas Medwin referred to as her “sorry French translation” of parts of
            Goethe’s play in <title level="m">D’Allemagne</title> (1813)—another form of unsuccessful mediation (Medwin 141).</p>
                  <p>The failed intercession by “our Lady of Coppet” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:207) to effect a reconciliation between Lord and Lady
            Byron occurred just before Byron commenced work on <title level="m">Manfred</title> in September 1816. On August 24, in one of two brief
            letters to de Staël (of August 24 and 25) in which the separation and Byron’s feelings for Lady Byron are basically the exclusive subject,
            Byron writes: “The separation may have been <emph>my fault</emph>—but it was <emph>her</emph> choice.——I tried all means to prevent—and
            would do as much &amp; more to end it,—a word would do so—but it does not rest with me to pronounce it.——You asked me if I thought that
            Lady B[yron] was attached to me—to that I can only answer that I love her . . . I cannot conclude without thanking you once more for your
            kind disposition towards me on this” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:88). Here, Byron articulates a wish to “end” the separation. A letter
            shortly after that to Augusta, of September 8, suggests that de Staël was helping him to do precisely that: “Me. de Stael has been
            particularly kind &amp; friendly towards me—&amp; (I hear) fought battles without number in my very indifferent cause” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:92). De Staël’s well-meaning failure to broker a reconciliation with Lady Byron is reworked in <title level="m">Manfred</title> through the figuration of de Staël and Annabella as Nemesis and Astarte, respectively. Astarte is, of course, a
            composite figure who represents both Augusta and Annabella throughout the play; and while she is usually taken to represent Augusta
            (contemporary readers, such as Annabella’s confidante, Mrs. Villiers, wrote of the resemblance between Astarte and Augusta that “It is too
            barefaced for her friends to try to deny the allusion” [qtd. in Lovelace 69]), at this moment in the play in the Hall of Arimanes (Act 2,
            scene 4) she figures Annabella in her capacity as the former lover who might yet be reunited with Byron.</p>
                  <p>Just as Our Lady of Coppet’s intercession on behalf of Byron and his “indifferent cause” is unsuccessful, so too in the play an explicit
            reconciliation with and forgiveness from Astarte does not come. Crucially, however, this withholding (from the baffled Nemesis and the
            silent Astarte) is productive; it is part of the play’s experiment in re-setting the tone, an attempt to move past the wish of vengeance
            as anger and retribution and toward more mixed forms of the revenge genre, such as revenge farce or “revenge comedy”—apt for a “baffled”
            Nemesis—and other hybrid forms of intimate commemoration.<note place="foot" resp="author">Despite my focus on the genre of revenge
              tragedy, I would emphasize that I regard <title level="m">Manfred</title> as multigeneric, encompassing comic and melodramatic, as well
              as tragic, modes. For a suggestive formulation of the revenge comedy, which sounds out comedy’s darker notes in charivari, “public
              shaming rituals” and “the scapegoating scene generic to festive comedy,” see Jones (23, 26).</note>

                  <p>As befits the play’s allegorization of Byron’s poetic practice as a form of “Mysterious agency!,” Manfred is often linked with the
            magician figures of Faust, Prospero, or the Elizabethan occult philosopher Dr. John Dee (I.i.28). Another vital form of communing with the
            dead is antiquarianism; and another figure of the practitioner of magic is the antiquarian, such as John Weever, an historian of funeral
            monuments and church inscriptions who travelled throughout Britain and Europe, collecting and transcribing inscriptions on medieval tombs
            that were housed in dissolved monasteries. These were published in 1631 in the vast, unfinished survey <title level="m">Antient funeral

                  <p>Weever’s prefatory “The author to the reader” articulates an urgent sense of antiquarianism as a form of remembering and honoring the
            dead: <quote>Having seen, judicious reader, how carefully, in other kingdoms, the monuments of the dead are preserved, and their
              inscriptions or epitaphs registered in their church-books; and . . . also knowing withal how barbarously within these his majesty’s
              dominions, they are (to the shame of our time) broken down, and utterly almost all ruinated, their brazen inscriptions erazed, torn
              away, and pilfered; by which inhuman, deformidable act, the honourable memory of many virtuous and noble persons deceased, is
              extinguished, and the true understanding of divers families in these realms (who have descended of these worthy persons aforesaid) is so
              darkened, as the true course of their inheritance is thereby partly interrupted: grieving at this insufferable injury, offered as well
              to the living as the dead, out of the respect I bore to venerable antiquity, and the due regard to continue the remembrance of the
              defunct to true posterity; I determined with myself to collect such memorials of the deceased, as were remaining as yet undefaced; as
              also to revive the memories of eminent worthy persons entombed or interred, either in parish, or in abbey churches; howsoever some of
              their sepulchres are at this day no where to be discerned; neither their bones and ashy remains in any place to be gathered.
              (Weever)</quote> Here, practices of cultural memory are inextricably linked to burial practices; the dearly departed “sepulchres” that
            Weever so keenly wishes to discern bear inscribed “memorials” as well as “bones and ashy remains.” The monuments, inscriptions, and
            epitaphs mark out the place where such remains are to be collected and preserved. </p>
                  <p>Weever’s account reminds us of the etymological link between epigraph and epitaph. It was not until the eighteenth century that the
            practice of attaching epigraphs to the head of a literary work became common. Samuel Johnson’s <title level="m">Dictionary</title> (1755)
            defines “epigraphe” as “an inscription on a statue” such as a tombstone (Johnson I:309). The forerunner of the modern epigraph was the
            authorial coat of arms (Genette 144). Hence Byron’s use of the conventional term “motto,” which traditionally referred to the text of the
            coat of arms that accompanied its “device” or emblem, the visual design.<note place="foot" resp="author">Johnson defines “motto” as “a
              sentence or word added to a device, or prefixed to any thing written” (II, 69).</note> The coat of arms was a central feature of the
            design of funeral monuments; and religious monuments became, in turn, museums of armorial bearings—another form of memorial that Weever
            laments with the destruction of religious monuments.</p>
                  <p>In an 1819 letter to Murray about “the beautiful Cimetery of Bologna” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VI:148), Byron imagines his own
            epitaph. Musing upon epitaphs he had seen at nearby Ferrara, he is particularly struck by the words “Implora pace”: “Can anything be more
            full of pathos? those few words say all that can be said or sought—the dead have had enough of life—all they wanted was rest—and this they
              ‘<emph>implore</emph>’. . . . ‘<title level="m">implora pace’</title>. I hope, whoever may survive me and shall see me put in the
            foreigners’ burying-Ground at the Lido . . . will see those two words and no more put over me” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VI:149). With
            “those two words,” like the earth, “put over me,” Byron marks the epitaph’s function as both symbolic and material. The sheltering words
            have as much materiality and protective agency as the earth itself. And of course Byron’s peace will only be found in foreign ground: “I
            am sure my Bones would not rest in an English grave . . . I would not even feed your worms—if I could help it.——So—as Shakespeare says of
            Mowbray . . . that he after fighting . . . retired himself / To Italy; and there at <title level="m">Venice</title>, gave / His body to
            that <emph>pleasant</emph> Country’s Earth” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VI:149). So Byron returns to Shakespeare, who he opens the
            letter with—transplanting Shakespeare to Italian soil, as he had transplanted himself—explaining how at Bologna he “found besides the
            Superb Burial Ground—an original of a Custode who reminded me of the grave-digger in Hamlet” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VI: 148). As
            Byron affectionately details, this Shakespearean Custode “had the greatest attachment to . . . his dead people” and a collection of skulls
            to help remember them and the “joy” they dispensed (<title level="j">BLJ</title> VI: 149, 148). The grave-digger, then, is another kind of
            custodian (“Custode”), like the antiquarian, who communes with the dead. </p>
                  <p>When Manfred asks Nemesis to “call up the dead,” and Nemesis replies, “Whom wouldst thou / Uncharnel?” Byron uses a word that had
            particular significance at the time of the Elizabethan revenge tragedies (I.iv.82). “Uncharnelling” referred to the digging up and
            disinterring of the bones of the dead from the charnel house of St Paul’s in 1549, an act of desecration and memorial spoliation.<note place="foot" resp="author">For an illuminating reading of the great uncharnelling and its relation to shifts in cultural and religious
              emotion, see Mullaney (1-10) and Schwyzer (esp. 108-112).</note> “Uncharnel” has an ambiguous significance, then, meaning to raise from
            the dead, but also to deprive of proper memory. Hence the revenge tragedy’s remit of calling in honor’s debts in order to avenge such
            desecration, as Zanga, the righteous Moor, rhetorically asks as he avenges the Christian desecration of his proud Moorish race and Muslim
            culture: “What is revenge, but courage to call in / Our honour’s debts?” (Young 10). Weever was moved by a similar spirit of avenging
            desecration, describing his work as being to “preserve” “the monuments of the dead . . . knowing withal how barbarously within these his
            majesty’s dominions [Charles I], they are (to the shame of our time) broken down, and utterly almost all ruinated, their brazen
            inscriptions erased” (Weever). The widespread iconoclasm that marked the time of Charles I involved the same impulse that cleared the
            ossuary of St. Paul’s in 1549, both part of the ongoing cultural trauma that marked the Protestant reformation.</p>
                  <p>Like Weever, Byron in <title level="m">Manfred</title> conjures diverse forms of commemoration and “monuments of the dead.” In a letter
            to Murray, topped and tailed with queries about the whereabouts of the MS of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron referred to his
            marriage as a funeral: “You talk of ‘marriage’—ever since my own funeral, the word makes me giddy—&amp; throws me into a cold sweat—pray
            don’t repeat it” (Apr. 2, 1817, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V:204). Writing from Ravenna, on New Year’s Eve, 1819, he made the same
            association, in a letter to Lady Byron herself: “This time five years [ago] . . . I was on my way to our funeral marriage.—I hardly
            thought then that your bridegroom as an exile would one day address you as a stranger, and that Lady and Lord Byron would become bye words
            of division” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:260). In its working through and as a commemoration of the “funeral marriage” and the
            separation, <title level="m">Manfred</title> functions as a kind of funeral monument, as well as a form of revenge tragedy, a genre that
            explores the process of accounting for the dead (even—especially—when those dead to the heart are still alive). <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a funeral monument, then, that commemorates the death of the marriage, the wreck of the broken heart: it is the
            “casket”—fittingly, “a small wooden box for cremated ashes”—that Byron fashions for this wreck of the broken heart (III.i.5).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <head>IV. Posterity Out of Joint</head>
                  <p>In commemorating the wreck of the broken heart, <title level="m">Manfred</title> allegorizes how the private event of the author’s broken
            heart is relentlessly mediated by and as a public celebrity scandal. The “clankless chain” of memory is bound tighter by the echoing
            publicity of celebrity culture, so that Manfred-Byron is doomed not only to confront these memories, but also to do so before the public
            eye, for better and worse, for pain and pleasure—doomed but reveling drolly in bringing them into the light (I.i.259). Simultaneously
            invited and spurned, a key adversary of Byron’s play against which it prosecutes revenge is Byron’s public and the celebrity it bestows.
            Manfred’s being condemned to eternal life dramatizes Byron’s scandalous celebrity, and a sense of being inescapably before the public eye
            in a blaze of publicity—obsessively, interminably: “thy spirit shall not sleep.” Hence the “vigil,” a ritualized occasion of remaining
            awake, in prayer, reflection or keeping watch, of being accountable to a public, during the time one usually spends in private: “There is
            a power upon me which withholds / And makes it my fatality to live” (I.ii.23-4). A vigil of the heart, <title level="m">Manfred</title> is
            also a drama of conscience, about coming to terms with the knowledge that knowledge of one’s private acts cannot remain private but will
            circulate in the “public imagination” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:186), especially when these private acts are submitted to the public
            in the form of a play at the height of Byron’s infamy. As Byron writes to Thomas Moore, “I suppose now I shall never be able to shake off
            my sables in public imagination, more particularly since my moral ** [Clytemnestra?] clove down my fame” (Mar. 10, 1817, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V:186). Byron’s recently coined post-separation code-name for Lady Byron, Clytemnestra, is the classical embodiment of
            revenge, driven by jealousy on account of her husband’s infidelity and fury at the sacrifice of her daughter.<note place="foot" resp="author">In “Lines on Hearing That Lady Byron Was Ill” (written in September 1816, but not published until 1832), Byron addresses
              Lady Byron as “the moral Clytemnestra of thy lord” (37). As McGann notes, this poem was written shortly after the collapse of de Staël’s
              attempt to reconcile Lord and Lady Byron (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV, 460).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The social magic of authorial agency reaps ambivalent rewards and pleasures, in those strange solicitations of intimate publicity that
            animate celebrity culture; celebrity brings company (“My solitude is solitude no more”) and sympathy to “watch my watchings,” but also the
            sting of a capricious public that does not always avail itself of the choice to subject itself to the celebrity author’s powers, but
            sometimes chooses instead to repudiate and spurn, conspiring in the cleaving down of fame (II.ii.129-30). Hence the author’s impulse to
            avenge himself on his public. Revenge is one form of “calling in honour’s debts” to the dead; another form of honoring the dead is
            posthumous fame, immortal social life. Posthumous fame, that heroic form of fame Weever refers to as “true posterity,” is a way of being
            “redeemed from the worm;” celebrity is a different kind of fame: contemporary with life, it can disturb the chronological order of life
            and death, for better and worse. Such temporal disturbance is engaged in Manfred’s address to Astarte: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>For hitherto all hateful things conspire</l>
                           <l>To bind me in existence—in a life</l>
                           <l>Which makes me shrink from immortality—</l>
                           <l>A future like the past. I cannot rest. (II.iv.128-31)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> This figure of shrinking from immortality dramatizes the uneasy temporal aspects of celebrity as a form of contemporary
            fame that pre-empts posthumousness, a form of premature—unnatural—immortality: a kind of posterity out of joint.</p>
                  <p>But then again, the poem swerves to Manfred’s identification <emph>with</emph> the immortal, in his famous “mind which is immortal”
            speech: <quote>
                        <lg>

                     </quote> This is Manfred’s inner Zanga—or the backward anticipation of Zanga’s “Manfredian defiance”—a reworking of Zanga’s
            shameless rebuke to Alonso preparing the rack for him: “The fix’d and noble mind / Turns all occurrence to its own advantage; / And I’ll
            make vengeance of calamity” (Elledge 131; Young 85). Both Manfred and Zanga also channel the immortal lines of Milton’s Satan: “The mind
            is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> I.254-55). This
            audacious claiming of “its own place and time” enunciates the revenger’s desire to reintroduce a sense of spatio-temporal order. For
            Nemesis is about introducing a sense of order, putting things in their proper resting place, ceasing the haunting. Temporal disturbance,
            “time . . . out of joint,” is a key feature of revenge tragedy (<title level="m">Hamlet</title> I.v.915). Revenge and retribution are ways
            of turning back time. The revenger’s mission is to restore proper order, but the requirement of the genre is that this mission only
            succeeds with the death of the revenger himself.</p>
                  <p>While (satanically) redeeming Milton’s lines, <title level="m">Manfred</title> is not so much about redemption as about unfinished
            business: to redeem from the worm means to attend to unfinished business. <title level="m">Manfred</title> is about the unfinished
            emotional business that is the desire for revenge, but also about the unfinished textual business of first drafts, recycled work, such as
            “the Incantation,” written, according to Thomas Moore, “soon after the last fruitless attempt at reconciliation,” and originally published
            in <title level="m">The Prisoner of Chillon and Other Poems</title> (Dec. 1816) as “a Chorus in an unfinished Witch drama, which was begun
            some years ago” (I.i.192-261; <title level="m">Works</title> III:288; qtd. in <title level="m">CPW</title> IV: 463). Byron, then—much like
            the antiquary—is finding a place, preserving “The Incantation” by repurposing it as a strange, disembodied, multi-tasking curse upon Lady
            Byron and Manfred-Byron (recoiling on his own head). Burying the precious text under faint praise and disavowals of interest (“you may put
            it in the fire if you like—&amp; Gifford <title level="m">don’t</title> like”), Byron both preserves the precious inscription and gives it
            a kind of ambivalent “uncharnelling,” digging it up, moving it from one poem to another, giving it a new site, a new use, and adding new
            lines (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:193).</p>
                  <p>The famous redrafting of Act III on Gifford’s advice is part of this process and an ongoing saga of the correspondence with Murray. In a
            spectacular letter written en route from Florence to Rome, Byron tells Murray he must “wait” for <title level="m">Manfred</title> to be
            finished, and refers to the unfinished manuscript (and the revisions of the third act yet to be completed) at the end of an inspired rant
            about unfinished funeral monuments: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">I also went to the Medici Chapel—fine frippery in great slabs of various
                expensive stones—to commemorate fifty rotten carcasses—it is unfinished &amp; will remain so. The church of “Santa Croce” contains
                much illustrious nothing—the tombs of Machiavelli—Michael Angelo—Galileo Galilei and Alfieri—make it the Westminster abbey of Italy.—I
                did not admire <title level="m">any</title> of these tombs—beyond their contents. That of Alfieri is heavy—and all of them seem to me
                overloaded—what is necessary but a bust &amp; a name?—and perhaps a date?—the last for the unchronological—of whom I am one.—But all
                your Allegory &amp; eulogy is infernal—&amp; worse than the long wig of English numskulls upon Roman bodies in the statuary of [the]
                reign[s] of Charles—William—and Anne. . . . </p>
                        <p rend="noCount">I have done nothing at <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s third act—you must wait—I’ll have at it—in a week or two—or
                so.—(Apr. 26, 1817, <title level="j">BLJ</title> V:218)</p>
                     </quote> Here, as the particular figure of Charles returns us to Weever,
            the whole passage suggests an unwitting iconoclastic parody of Weever’s moving tribute to lost funeral monuments. In contrast to the
            absent monuments so lovingly elegized by Weever—“broken down, utterly almost all ruinated,” “at this day nowhere to be discerned”—Byron
            exuberantly details an infernal surfeit of “overloaded” monuments, of “fine frippery in great slabs of various expensive stones—to
            commemorate fifty rotten carcasses.” This caustic recital has a leveling effect, neutralizing sectarian religious sentiment by making the
            “fine frippery” and “illustrious nothing” of Italian Catholicism as equally preposterous as “the long wig of English numskulls upon Roman
            bodies in the statuary of the reigns of Charles—William—and Anne”—grotesque English hybrids mimicked in turn by the grotesque hybridity of
            Santa Croce as the “Westminster abbey of Italy.”</p>
                  <p>Byron’s identification with “the unchronological” emphasizes the importance of chronology: “the unchronological” are prone to forget
            dates, so they need to be reminded. Byron explains: “The <emph>context</emph> will show you <emph>the sense</emph>” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:218). The context for both topics (Florentine funeral monuments and <title level="m">Manfred</title>) is provided by that
            historical drama of religious conflict and its legacies of cultural trauma, brilliantly satirized—but commemorated too—in Byron’s
            rendition of these ecumenically bizarre funeral monuments. This broader historical context connects to another, more personal
            context—Byron’s desire for Nemesis to do its work. The context of revenge as a form of commemoration informs “the unchronological” as an
            ominous figure of the terrible power of memory, suggesting how memory can play havoc with a proper sense of place and time. Byron as “the
            unchronological” emphasizes the need for a date, intoning—like any committed revenge hero—that repeated formula of “Time &amp; Nemesis”
              (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:246). The revenger <emph>is</emph> the unchronological, poised in that limbo of “sooner or later.”</p>
                  <p>The texts, intertexts and paratexts of <title level="m">Manfred</title> calibrate so much unfinished business. The revenger’s unfinished
            emotional business links with the unfinished business of commemoration (“a bust &amp; a name?—and perhaps a date?”) and the business of
            unfinished manuscripts; just as the play’s mechanisms of self-reflexivity facilitate reflection on different forms of fame, so too, in the
            letter to Murray that sends the epigraph for <title level="m">Manfred</title>, does Byron engage these different forms of fame, joking
            about his own posthumousness: <quote>You tell me to “take care of myself—” faith and I will <anchor xml:id="Hlk509508425"/>—I won't be
              posthumous yet if I can help it—notwithstanding—only think—what a “Life &amp; adventures”—while I am in full scandal—would be
              worth—together with the “membra” of my writing-desk—the <emph>sixteen</emph> beginnings of poems never to be finished—(Apr. 9, 1817,
                <title level="m">BLJ</title> V:208)</quote> Not that anyone’s counting. But Byron assesses the current state of his celebrity and its
            commercial value, in a canny evaluation of the relationship between posthumous fame and celebrity. His swaggering suggestion that Murray
            consider how much an account of his life would be worth “—while I am in full scandal—” links celebrity to commodity culture, making
            himself over as a commodity, while distinguishing between posthumous fame and contemporary scandalous celebrity and their differential
            economic returns.</p>
                  <p>But even this playful celebration of Byron’s posthumousness and celebrity soon recurs to a blackly comic revenge fantasy—the seemingly
            interminable revenge fantasy that Byron unspools across <title level="m">Manfred</title>, the <title level="j">Alpine Journal</title> and
            the letters: <quote>Do you think I would not have shot myself last year—had I not luckily recollected that Mrs. Clermont [Lady Byron’s
              maid and confidante, former governess and nurse] &amp; Lady Noel [Lady Byron’s mother] &amp; all the old women in England would have
              been delighted . . . ? Be assured—that <emph>I would live</emph> for two reasons—or more—there are one or two people whom I have to put
              out of the world—&amp; as many into it—before I can “depart in peace” if I do so before—I have not fulfilled my mission. (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:208)</quote> What is that “mission”? It is to put “one or two people” into the world, to populate and
            “repeople” the world with new creations (as Byron’s narrator is soon to put it in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> IV). It is that
            often painful business of submitting himself and his vigil of the heart “in full scandal” to the public and contending with its reception,
            as Byron writes in that letter to Moore: “I suppose now I shall never be able to shake off my sables in public imagination. (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:186). And if never able to shake off the sables, nor for that matter was Byron ever able to shake off the public
            imagination. “However,” Byron adds, “nor that, nor more than that, has yet extinguished my spirit, which always rises with the rebound”
              (<title level="j">BLJ</title> V:186). Besides, Byron without his sables was arguably less compelling to the public imagination, as
            Francis Jeffrey suggests of Byron’s far more conventional history play, <title level="m">Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice. An Historical
              Tragedy</title> (1821): “Lord Byron, without his bitters and his sweets, his softness and horrors, is only a very bold and clever
            writer—withal somewhat clumsy and verbose” (Jeffrey 271). <title level="m">Manfred</title> might be conceived of, nevertheless, as Byron’s
            process of attempting to shake off the sables—an exorcism of vengeance and its Gothic forms—in order to rise with the rebound, with “his
            bitters and his sweets,” in the commanding (if ambivalent) mixing of generic registers and tones that he made his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Manfred, A Dramatic Poem</title> is a poem in search of a certain tonality, for memory, for commemoration. It re-sets
            the springs of wonder in search of a new set of tones and forms not only of revenge but of self-critique and commemoration, of the
            good and the bad, a new mix of comic and tragic forms that might—if not elude or “shake off”—at least disarm or re-mediate the wondrous
            strange rituals of intimate publicity to which Byron’s life and work were forevermore subject. Like Byron’s spirit, the old Gothic revenge
            forms also “rebound”: never fully exorcised, there’s bloom on their cheeks. Uncharnelled, “redeemed from the worm,” they “rebound” to
            enthrall. Hence our commemoration of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s “strange hectic” from which we draw the “strangest nourishment”
            (II.iv.100).</p>

               <p rend="noCount">In May 1820 Byron encountered Goethe’s remarks on <title type="m">Manfred</title> which, as translated by Hoppner, began:
        <quote>Byron’s tragedy, <title type="m">Manfred</title>, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular
        intellectual poet has taken my <title type="m">Faustus</title> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his
        hypochondriac humour.</quote>
        Goethe simultaneously demotes Byron to a derivative of himself and diverts attention from the most sensational instance of “hypochondriac
        humor” in the eighteenth century, his own autofiction, <title type="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>. This essay pursues the textual
        histories through which the authors sought to distance themselves from protagonists too close to themselves, the revisions Goethe made in
        successive editions of <title type="m">Werther</title> and Byron’s suppression of the original third act of <title type="m">Manfred</title>, 
        which Goethe could not have known. The original third act, however, was preserved in the seventeen-volume
        edition of Byron’s works published by John Murray in 1832-33. Attention to the activities of the editor, John Wright, in the construction of
        that edition, drawing upon unpublished materials in the John Murray Archive of the National Library of Scotland, reveals the interplay between
        the desires to establish posthumously the standing of Byron and to enhance the commercial value of Murray’s property, and the dissemination of
        the rejected “hypochondriac” materials. Wright’s preservation made them available for Alfred Bunn’s melodramatic presentation of 
        <title type="m">Manfred</title> at Covent Garden in 1834. Wright’s less notorious but more significant editorial intervention came when he
        inserted into his preface to <title type="m">Marino Faliero</title> Byron’s withdrawn dedication of the play to Goethe, responding directly to
        the charges of 1820. In highlighting the arc from the rejected third act of <title type="m">Manfred</title> in 1817 to the historical drama of
        1821 Wright brings forward Byron’s ongoing exploration, across multiple and different genres, of the conditions that give rise to the
        obsessions of his protagonists.</p>

               <p>On May 25, 1820 Byron reported to Richard Belgrave Hoppner, the British consul at Venice, that he had been sent “heaven knows why several
        Deutsche Gazettes of all which I understand neither word nor letter.” In them he found what “appear[ed] to be . . . Goethe’s [remarks] upon
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” begging Hoppner to translate them (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:106). Hoppner complied, and on June 7
        Byron sent the German original, Hoppner’s version, and an Italian one to John Murray, proudly telling him “to keep them all in your archives”
        because “the opinion[s] of <emph>the</emph> Greatest man of Germany. . . whether favourable or not are always interesting—and this
        is moreover favourable” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:113). Hoppner opens:</p>
               <quote>Byron’s tragedy, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular
        intellectual poet has taken my <title level="m">Faustus</title> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his
        hypochondriac humour.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Hoppner’s translation may be found in Appendix
        II, “Goethe and Byron,” <title level="m">LJ,</title> 12: 503-21. The quoted passages occur on p. 506.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>Byron had initially inferred that “the word <emph>‘hypocondrish’</emph> [is] any thing but favourable” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:106), 
        and it is on that word that I want initially to focus. The prototypical hypochondriacal hero is the
        protagonist of <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>, the work that made Goethe famous at twenty-five in 1774, which he omits
        entirely from his response. Manfred’s cry to the Witch of the Alps, “My pang shall find a voice,” signals the extravagant self-involvement and
        willfulness of both Manfred and Werther, a condition the authors then seek to disavow, or at least from which they seek to stand apart

               </p>
               <p>Already in his late sixties, Goethe read <title level="m">Manfred</title> shortly after its appearance in 1817; his remarks date from that
        period, though not published until 1820. “Ten years” after the publication of <title level="m">Werther</title>, Goethe “still marvelled at its
        ‘white-hot expression of pain and joy, irresistibly and internally consuming themselves’” (Boyle 124). Already by the second “genuine” edition
        of <title level="m">Werther</title> in 1775, Goethe had sought to forestall any simple identification of himself and his suicidal creation,
        adding the first quatrain of a poem to the title page of Book I that begins “Ev’ry youth for love’s sweet portion sighs, / Ev’ry maiden sighs
        to win man’s love,” but concludes on the title-page of Book II: "Be a Man, nor seek to follow Me."<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Genuine” is my translation of the “Ächte” on the title-page; that is, from Weygand in Leipzig, the publisher of the first 1774

        Goethe subsequently omitted the poem, but in the revised edition of 1787 the reader’s sympathy for Werther is further distanced by the increased role
        of the editor who frames Werther’s accounts of his situation by his own addresses to the reader. In addition, Goethe inserts new episodes
        specifically designed to widen the gap between Werther and the reader. In one added episode a young peasant falls in love with his widowed
        employer, and, when he tries to force himself upon her and is dismissed by the family, murders the hired hand whom he imagines as his rival.
        In the editor’s narrative, Werther is shown to have “put himself so completely in . . . [the] place” of the young peasant that he becomes the
        defender of a would-be rapist and murderer.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,

        portrait of Werther’s beloved Lotte that is less innocent and more complicitly seductive than in the first version is intensified by a second
        interpolated tale, in which Werther encounters a madman hunting for flowers to give his beloved, only to discover a day later that the man
        “was a clerk in the office of Lotte’s father, and it was a passion for her, which he nourished, concealed, revealed, and for which he was
        dismissed, that drove him mad” (Corngold 71).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The comparison of the
        first and the revised edition of the novel has a substantial history. See, for example, T. P. Saine and Deirdre Vincent.</note>
               </p>
               <p>These devices enable the reader to see Werther’s limitations and excesses, and so to see the degree to which the “<emph>hypocondrisch</emph>” 
        is the product of historically specific conditions: the cultural emphasis on sensibility, on the heart, a moment at
        which Homer, Werther’s first ideal, is contested by the moody Ossian, who “has driven Homer from [Werther’s] heart,” the naive by the
        sentimental, to use Schiller’s only slightly later terms (Corngold 63).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="a">On Naive and Sentimental Poetry,</title> 1795.</note>  
        Most seriously, the hypertrophied inwardness is enforced by the paucity of careers open
        to Werther: he finds the ambassador for whom he works pedantic, and his way forward is blocked by the aristocratic prejudices of the petty
        principalities that made up eighteenth-century Germany. Once he asks for his dismissal from court the logic of withdrawal leads swiftly to his
        declaration: “It is settled, Lotte, I want to die, and I tell you this without romantic excesses, with composure, on the morning of the day
        when I will see you for the last time” (Corngold 80). </p>
               <p>Goethe’s elevation of autobiography into resonant cultural diagnosis—the “me/not me” of literature—was not always grasped by the readers
        who turned <title level="m">Werther</title> into a Europe-wide fad and lionized him. “[I]t had never occurred to me,” he recalled in 1824,<quote>
        that an intolerable torment was vouchsafed for me by sympathizing, well-meaning souls: for instead of someone’s saying something nice to me
        about my little book, just as it was, they all wanted to know, once and for all, how much of the whole affair was actually true, whereupon I
        would become very upset and generally say something rude. For to answer this question, I would have had to pluck apart my little book, to
        which I had devoted so much thought for so long, so as to give its many elements a poetic unity, in the process destroying the form and
        causing the actual components, if they were not altogether destroyed, at least to be jumbled and scattered.

      The events of 1772 in Wetzlar—his relationship to Charlotte Buff and her fiancé Johann Christian Kestner and the suicide of Karl Wilhelm
        Jerusalem, who had accompanied Goethe when he met Charlotte, and whose death, Kestner reported, was attributed to love for a married woman
       —Goethe insisted had been transmuted into a representative fiction, a strong contrast with his response to <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
        Irked as he was by those who retrojected his novel onto his life, he did the same to Byron.</p>
               <p>As he continues his remarks Goethe reduces <title level="m">Manfred</title> to gossip:
      <quote>He has often enough confessed what it is that torments him. He has repeatedly pourtrayed it; and scarcely any one feels any compassion for
        this intolerable suffering, over which he is ever laboriously ruminating . . . When a bold and enterprising young man, he won the affections
        of a Florentine lady. Her husband discovered the amour, and murdered his wife; but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street,
        and there was no one on whom any suspicion could be attached. Lord Byron removed from Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his life
        after. (<title level="m">LJ</title> XII:506)</quote>
        Goethe sidesteps any recognition that <title level="m">Werther</title> had involved him in similar misprisions. For example, Kestner found it
        difficult to grant the novel independence from the events he and Lotte Buff had lived through with Goethe; he objected to the portrayal of
        Lotte, insisting that “Lotte’s sharing of Werther’s passion was a dishonourable trait which was not and could not be found in Lotte Kestner,”
        and his protest at seeing himself resurface in Albert, or at seeing himself seen by others as Albert, is concise: 
      <quote>did Albert have to be such a blockhead, “just so that you can swagger up to him and say ‘look what a fine
        fellow <emph>I</emph> am?’”</quote>
      Kestner himself turns for solace in this charged situation to the third person and the buffer of a foreign language in quoting a friend’s
        letter to him: “<foreign xml:lang="fr">il est dangereux d’avoir un auteur pour ami</foreign>” (Boyle 185-6).<note place="foot" resp="editors">I compress here the account of Boyle (pp. 185-86), who is quoting from Wilhelm Bode, 
        <title level="m">Goethe in vertraulichen Briefen seiner Zeitgenossen</title>, rev. R. Otto and P.-G. Wenzlaff (Berlin
        and Weimar, 1979), and thus guided I have checked the 1922 publication of Bode’s work.</note>
        The authorial imperialism that enabled Goethe to control and reshape the events of his life into his fiction without regard for the effect 
        on other actors in the events Byron repeats in transforming Augusta Leigh, who remained in England to confront the same questions of truth to
        experience that Goethe acknowledged and Kestner and Lotte Buff face, into the mythical Astarte.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Ghislaine McDayter emphasizes in <title level="a">The Iconography of Forgiveness: 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s Astarte</title> in this volume.</note>
        Goethe objects that in <title level="m">Manfred </title>“the gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last oppressive
        to us” but he concedes: “Yet is the dissatisfaction we feel connected always with esteem and admiration.”</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the tantalizing hints of a confession of incest, <title level="m">Manfred</title> should not, as Jeffrey Cox has recently
        persuasively argued in <title level="m">Romanticism in the Shadow of War</title>, be wholly inserted into the kind of erotic entanglements that
        Goethe retails. In both <title level="m">Werther</title> and <title level="m">Manfred,</title> the convergence of the poet’s life and the cultural
        moment is striking. The emptiness of time Manfred suffers catches the mood of a post-Congress of Vienna, post-Waterloo moment. Byron was not
        alone in feeling that peace had come but with the restoration of the old regimes revolutionary energies had departed. In Switzerland in 1816,
        Byron was not only temporally and geographically between Augusta and Annabella and the erotic profusion of Italy and the stability of Teresa
        Guiccioli; he was also between engagement in Regency politics—Parliamentary speeches on the Frame-breakers, opposition to the Regent—and
        the rejuvenation offered by joining the Carbonari against Austria and then the Greek Revolution. Manfred’s flamboyant withdrawal from the
        world acts out the uncertainty of his creator facing a world that failed to inspire commitment.</p>
               <p>The textual history that marks Goethe’s effort to cast critical distance on his self-absorbed protagonist has a counterpart in 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>, though not in the 1817 text that Goethe read. Much of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was
        drafted by September 1816, but the play was not completed when Byron left Switzerland for Italy. Acts I and II were sent to John Murray by
        March 9, 1817, when the original fair copy of Act III was also sent.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A compression of McGann’s account of the composition and publication of the play.</note>
        Self-deprecating comments accompanied the transmissions: “I have no great opinion of this piece of phantasy” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170), 
        “a drama as mad as Nat. Lee’s Bedlam tragedy” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:179), and, finally, “I have really &amp; truly no notion whether 
        it is good or bad— . . .You will submit it to Mr. G[iffor]d &amp; to whomsoever you please besides” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185). 
        Byron’s submission to the rejection of Act III by William Gifford, Murray’s literary advisor, grew from an earlier relationship. Gifford had been 
        an early model for Byron, who invokes his couplet satires, the <title level="m">Maeviad</title> and the <title level="m">Baviad</title>, in 
        <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title>; in 1813, after the overwhelming success of the first two cantos of 
        <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, Byron was still addressing him as a lowly acolyte: “I feel greatly at a loss how to write
        to you at all—still more to thank you as I ought.—If you knew the veneration with which I have ever regarded you long before I had the most 
        distant prospect of becoming your acquaintance literary or personal—my embarrassment would not surprize you” 
        (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III:63-4). More than thirty years older than
        Byron, the former editor of the conservative <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin</title> and then of the Tory <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>,
        Gifford epitomized the established values and tastes that Byron’s poetry subverted, but, as late as his time in Missolonghi, Byron angrily
        rebutted to his banker and friend Douglas Kinnaird the rumor that he was the author of an attack on Gifford, who was rich in enemies: “It is
        not true that I ever <emph>did—will—would—could—</emph>or <emph>should </emph> write
        a <emph> satire</emph> against Gifford—or a hair of his head—and so tell Mr. Murray.——I always considered
        Gifford as my <emph> literary</emph> father and myself as his
        ‘<emph>prodigal</emph> Son’” (emphases in original: <title level="m">BLJ </title>XI:117).
        When Gifford approved of the first two acts of <title level="m">Manfred</title> but did “not by any Means like the Conclusion,” Murray managed
        the dilemma by sending the assessment with a cover letter that attributed the condemnation to the “paternal interest” Gifford took in Byron’s
        “literary well being” (Nicholson 219). </p>
               <p>Fathers, however, do not fare well in Byron’s poetry, or rather they fare all too well, habitually crushing the rebellious Byronic hero, and
        so it is with <title level="m">Manfred</title>. In the original third act, Manfred reacts to the Abbot who menaces him, unless he repents and
        gives his lands to the monastery, by having him carried off by the demon, Ashtaroth, singing.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The name of Byron’s male demon “Ashtaroth” appears in the Bible as derived from the worship of the Phoenician
        goddess Ishtar, or Astarte: a fitting extension of the transgression of orthodoxy in Manfred’s forbidden love of Astarte. See Quinlan,
        who, however, reads his evidence differently. Elsewhere in this volume Alan Richardson illuminates the connection of the Zoroastrian
        thread of Byron’s drama to the use made of the doctrine in contemporary radical discourse.</note>
        Gifford was contemptuous:
      <quote>The Friar is despicable, &amp; the servants uninteresting. The scene with the Friar ought to be imposing, &amp; for that purpose the Friar
        should be a real good man—not an idiot.—More dignity should be lent to the catastrophe . . . Manfred should not end in this feeble way -
        after beginning with such magnificence and promise—and the demons should have something to do in the scene. (Nicholson 220)</quote>
     Byron wholly capitulated, telling Murray:
      <quote>The third act is certainly d-----d bad . . . It must on no account be published in its present state;—I will try &amp; reform it—or
        re-write it altogether—but the impulse is gone—&amp; I have no chance of making anything out of it. I would not have it published as it is
        on any account. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:211)</quote>
      Within a month Byron had composed a new third act, acceding to Gifford’s strictures point by point: “The Abbot is become a good man—and the
        Spirits are brought in at the death—you will find I think some good poetry in this new act here &amp; there—&amp; if so print it—without
        sending me further proofs—<emph>under Mr. G[iffor]d’s correction</emph>” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:219). In making the Abbot a
        good man, Byron at once severed himself from the Gothic, of which a corrupt and usually lustful monk was a staple, severing himself also from
        the play’s roots in “an unfinished Witch drama” begun years before and from his experience on the managing committee of Drury Lane Theatre and
        the hundreds of plays he had read during his tenure (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:463). In revising, Goethe had similarly ringed 
        <title level="m">Werther</title> with
        complicating perspectives; Byron’s excision, under pressure from Gifford, is more like repression, and, though it accelerated a shift in
        Byron’s mode, it came at a cost. In contrast, another stalwart of the <title level="j">Quarterly</title>, J. W. Croker, after reading the first
        two acts of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, urged Murray to “do all you can to induce Lord Byron to go on with his tragedy—for such I
        suppose it is to be. Its wildness, or if you will, its extravagance, is to me its first recommendation” (Nicholson 224). Croker, the author of
        the notorious review of Keats’s <title level="m">Endymion</title>, was in general no fan of the younger poets, but, in singling out Byron’s
        “extravagance,” he points to a strength Gifford could not recognize, and which the chastening and elevating of the third act sacrificed. At
        the close Manfred defeats the demons who have come for him by asserting his superiority—“Thou hast no power upon me, <emph>that</emph> 
        I feel; / Thou never shalt possess me, <emph>that</emph> I know”—and in this triumph of the will
        can then quietly die (III.iv.125-6). The new calm for which Byron strove, countering the Titanism of the earlier acts, suffuses his final
        speech: “Old man! ‘tis not so difficult to die” (III.iv.151). When Byron saw that the 1817 first edition had dropped the speech, he forcefully
        protested: “You have destroyed the whole effect &amp; moral of the poem by omitting the last line of Manfred’s speaking” 
        (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170). In their quest for a grander conclusion, neither Gifford nor Murray had comprehended the significance of 
        the deliberate understatement, an intertextual rebuke to Werther’s elaborate staging of the suicide in which his succumbing to despair climaxes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Murray to Byron August 29, 1817: “[You] will find that I am absolutely incapable of doing any thing which 
        I did not think you would approve—or at any rate that concealment—is totally out of the question—Mr Gifford after consulting me omitted 
        your close of the Drama from no other motive than because he thought that the words you allude too [sic]—lessened the effect—&amp; I was 
        convinced of this myself” (Nicholson 241).</note>

               <p>After Byron’s death in 1824, Murray obtained the copyrights of the poems that had been too scandalous for him to publish in the poet’s
        lifetime and brought out in 1832-33 a canon-fixing <title level="m">Works of Lord Byron with his Letters and Journals</title> in seventeen
        handsome volumes, of which the first six were filled by Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Life</title>, previously published in 1830.
        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is in volume 11.

      The driving force behind the edition was its editor, John Wright, in whose hands a publication announced on the title page as “in fourteen
        volumes” when it began to appear <emph>seriatim</emph> in 1832 reached seventeen volumes when it concluded in 1833. Wright was
        convinced “that the new management of the Poetry, with the explanatory Notes, etc. will do more for the character of the Lord [Byron] than all
        the writings respecting him that have hitherto appeared.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter from John Wright to John Murray, 15 May 1832.

        He persuaded Murray to extend <title level="m">Don Juan</title> into a third volume: “I now find it will be quite impossible to do justice 
        to the work, if you persist in compressing the 
        <title level="m">Don Juan</title> into two volumes . . . the Notes, critical, historical, moral, and religious are <emph>very
        numerous</emph>, and of a most interesting and fascinating description. I therefore intreat you to allow me another volume for the Poetry.” He
        failed, however, despite detailed pleading of the commercial advantages, to win Murray’s assent to the proposition that “the work ought to
        consist of <emph>eighteen</emph>” volumes (November 1832, MS. 41309). Wright tirelessly sought out those whose lives were
        entwined with Byron’s, and who might share precious texts. Having obtained manuscripts from Augusta Leigh, he proceeded to Teresa Guiccioli:
        the Countess, he reported, “feels very sore and angry with Moore, and with reason” and so gave him two volumes of Moore’s <title level="m">
        Life</title> with corrections (October 8, 1832), emboldening him to propose that Murray intimate to her that
        <quote>The Countess would also be rendering a service to the memory and character of Lord Byron, if she would permit me to look over the original
        manuscripts of Marino Faliero, Sardanapalus, the early cantos of Don Juan, and any other poems that she may have.</quote>
        Wright then unabashedly offered Teresa an enticement: if she were to look over
      <quote>Medwin, Hunt, Blessington, and the rest, and mark in the margin such misrepresentations respecting <emph>herself</emph> and Lord
        B, as she may wish to have set right . . . I could turn them to good account. (MS. 41309)</quote>
        Turning the publisher, his employer, into his intermediary, Wright offers him too a “good account,” the possibility of what on a later
        occasion he frankly called “a little sensation . . .[to] add a thousand or two to the sale of the work” (Dec. 3, 1832, MS. 41309).</p>
               <p>I have digressed from <title level="m">Manfred</title>, but only to show the editorial practice that shaped the dress in
        which Byron appeared for the remainder of the century. Wright was the kind of editor who could declare with pride, and perhaps even glee, that
        he had gone over the fifth canto of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> “and have extracted matter for at least thirty notes” (MS. 41309). I am
        only partly joking when I comment that his practice is simultaneously that of the Oxford Wordsworth, committed to the author’s final text, and
        that of the Cornell Wordsworth, committed to the earliest, often manuscript, version. The aim of the set was to establish Murray’s prize poet,
        but in addition to printing the corrected 1818 text of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and surrounding it with encomia from Francis Jeffrey and
        Professor Wilson attesting to its <emph>gravitas</emph>, the edition prints the correspondence in which Gifford condemned the
        original third act—and the rejected act itself, as in this example:
      <figure>
                     <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/manning/manning_image2Thumb.jpeg"

                  </figure>
      The consequence is that the calm of the final text achieved on the page is continuously disrupted by the return of the
        repressed in the notes below: an edition intended to monumentalize Byron instead preserves the <emph>hypocondrish </emph> turmoil from which it 
        emerged. Other traces of the gestation of the drama remain. Declaring in 1820 that he had never read Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> but 
        acknowledging that “Matthew Monk Lewis in 1816 at Coligny translated most of it to me <emph>viva voce</emph>,” Byron maintained that “it was the 
        <title level="m">Staubach</title> &amp; the <title level="m">Jungfrau</title>—and something else—much more than Faustus that made me write 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:113). The “something else” has usually been understood as the hinted incest 
        with Augusta, which makes the edition’s note in Act I showing the closeness of the drama to excerpts from “the Journal of his Swiss tour, which 
        Lord Byron transmitted to his sister,” perhaps indelicate (21n1). Murray was “much struck with your description of pastoral life in the Alps - 
        wch [<emph>sic</emph>] I hope you do not omit &amp; indeed as much of the first impressions made by the Scenery will be given as you can - all 
        the world has been there &amp; will be delighted to tread the Air again in imagination” (Nicholson 217). The Alpine sublime was a commercial 
        imperative on which Murray did not fail to capitalize in the frontispiece to the volume by J. M. W. Turner.</p>

               <p>Even more than Murray, Wright understood that as most of the poetry had been previously published, the success of the
        edition depended on the added value of the apparatus and especially the illustrations. He wrote Murray that even when they pictured familiar
        places, such as Venice, “they may be so varied as to give them an air of novelty” (MS. 41310). Every volume had not one but two frontispieces.
        On Monday, November 26, 1832, Wright implored Murray: “Turner should be induced to do something very striking for the 14<hi rendition="#sup">
        th</hi> volume. This is, I assure you, of great importance” (MS. 41309). In the first frontispiece, Turner, working from a sketch by W.
        Page, provides a bland view of Parnassus and the Castalian Spring, in the second a dramatic view of the Battle of Waterloo from the
        perspective of Hougoumont, appropriate to the review of the end of Napoleon’s career and the Congress of Vienna in “The Age of Bronze,”
        contained in the volume.</p>

               <p>I rehearse these familiar materials to suggest that, when Alfred Bunn decided in 1834 to produce at Covent Garden a stage version of the
        drama that Byron claimed he had “rendered . . .<emph>quite impossible</emph> for the stage,” he did not have
        to look far for the materials of sensational stage display (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170).

      As Margaret Howell’s study of the acting version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain reveals, the settings and words were predominantly Byron’s
        own—incorporating the original rejected third act (Howell ch. 3). The product was less “<title level="m">Manfred Transformed</title>,” as 
        Howell titles her chapter, than “<title level="m">Manfred Restored</title>”: what Gifford excised and the <title level="m">Works</title> 
        preserved but degraded to the apparatus, Bunn raised into his script. The exception was the hint of incest, which
        theatrical censorship forbid representing on stage, and which had been duly removed. Bunn, Howell writes, made “Astarte Manfred’s cousin and
        ultimately his redeemer, an alteration clearly influenced by Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>”—that too seems a return of the influence
        Byron denied (98). In this stage version Manfred neither dies defiantly nor with calm dignity: Astarte reappears to announce, “I do forgive
        thee!” and, the stage direction indicates, Manfred “<emph>breaks from the Abbot, rushes toward her — falls &amp; dies</emph>”
        (Howell 103). Thereupon, reports the playbill, all was “Borne down by a violent THUNDER STORM” [see Fig. 6]. In his
        reminiscences, Bunn recalled, amid the general enthusiastic reception, a particular consequence probably made possible by the interdiction of
        the theme of incest:
      <quote>It was eminently successful—applauded by a crammed auditory, lauded, with but one exception, by the press, and witnessed with an inward
        satisfaction and delight by the poet’s sister, the Honourable Mrs. Leigh. In a letter from this accomplished lady, she says, “<title level="m">
        Manfred</title> was splendidly got up, and Miss Ellen Tree’s Witch of the Alps I shall dream of!” (Bunn I:146) </quote>
               </p>
               <p>In sending the revised third act to Murray, Byron commented “I certainly am a devil of a mannerist—&amp; must leave off” (<title level="m">
        BLJ</title> V:185). As the proliferating cantos of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> demonstrate, “leaving off” was not Byron’s truest mode,
        especially when “leaving off” was initiated by a senior figure of authority. The contradictory impulses of the 1832 edition are faithful to
        Byron insofar as they present him divided between earlier and later versions of himself. The effect produced by editorial intervention in 1832
        parallels the break in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> between the arrested figure of Juan, who bears the traces of Byron’s childhood and
        scandalous separation, othered into a young Spaniard, and the narrator, who “rattle[s] on exactly as I’d walk . . . born for opposition,”
        fully engaged with, and brilliantly and sardonically commenting on, postwar Europe (XV.19-22). Goethe became the sage devoted to renunciation
        invoked by Carlyle in <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title>, contemporary with Bunn’s production of <title level="m">Manfred: “</title>Close thy
        <emph>Byron</emph>; open thy <emph>Goethe</emph>” (Carlyle 153). <emph>Byron </emph>could
        not close Byron; in one of his forecasts of the development of Juan, he told Murray: “I meant to have made him a Cavalier Servente in Italy
        and a cause for a divorce in England—and a Sentimental ‘Werther-faced man’ in Germany—so as to show the different ridicules of the society
        in each of those countries,” not maturing into wisdom but “gradually gaté and blasé as he grew older—as is natural (<title level="m">
        BLJ</title> VIII:78).
        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Marchand notes that the phrase “Werther-faced man” is mediated through Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Fudge 
        Family in Paris</title>.</note> “I want a hero, an uncommon want,” he opened <title level="m">Don Juan</title>: “I’ll
        therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan, / We all have seen him in the pantomime / Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time” (I:1). Byron’s
        nominal hero is a stock figure whose metamorphoses become the instrument to “show the different ridicules of the societies in each of those
        countries,” not a settled sage or aspirant to the status of “<emph>the</emph> Greatest man of [Europe].” Byron theatricalizes; if
        the production travestied him, it also caught qualities integral to him—without, however, the two voices of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
        or of Wright’s edition.</p>
               <p>The zeal of Wright preserved a Byron that Murray, on the advice of Gifford, had initially repudiated; it also disseminated an exchange
        between Byron and Goethe over the review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> by producing a literary history that never happened. On February
        25, 1817, in the same letter that Byron announced to Murray from Venice that he had sent him “the other day some extracts from a kind of 
        drama—which I had begun in Switzerland—&amp; finished here,” he requested a favor:
      <quote>Look into ‘Moore’s (Dr. Moore’s) view of Italy’ for me—in one of the volumes you will find an account of the <title level="m">Doge
        Valiere</title> (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy—or the motives of it—get it transcribed for me &amp; send it in a letter to me
        soon—I want it—&amp; can not find so good an account of that business here—though the veiled portrait—&amp; the place where he was
        once crowned—and afterwards decapitated still exists—&amp; are shown. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:173-4)</quote>
        Five weeks later he repeated to Murray that “This was the thing that most struck my imagination in Venice” (<title level="m">BLJ</title>
        V:203). The chronological conjunction indicates the closeness of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>,
        though the latter tragedy was not completed until 1820. One grows from a “Witch drama” in a Gothic setting, and the other marks a determined
        program to quit the extravagant “manneris[m]” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185) that Gifford condemned. “It appears to
        me,” Byron declared to Murray as the tragedy approached publication,
      <quote>that there is room for a different style of the drama . . . good English—and a severer approach to the rules—might combine something not
        dishonourable to our literature, I have also attempted to make a play without love.——And there are neither rings—nor mistakes—nor starts—nor outrageous ranting villains—nor melodrame [<emph>sic</emph>]—in it. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VIII:78)</quote>
        Yet the two plays share the thematic of a world emptied of significance, figured in <title level="m">Manfred</title> by the death of Astarte
        and in <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> by the failure of the Venetian aristocracy adequately to punish the perpetrator of a slander
        against Angiolina, the wife of Faliero. That failure undermines the authority of which he, as Doge, is the emblem, driving him “into
        conspiring against the State of which he was the actual reigning Chief,—the last circumstance,” as Byron hyperbolically put it, “makes it
        the most remarkable—&amp; only fact of the kind in all history of all nations” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:174). Manfred’s confession,
        “From my youth upwards / My spirit walk’d not with the sons of men,” presents his withdrawal into icy seclusion in general terms (II.ii.50-1);
        Faliero’s turning from a long lifetime of service to tormented alliance with disaffected plebeians against his class is painfully particular.
        In the revised third act, Manfred justifies his abandonment of the “noble aspirations in my youth, / To make my own the mind of other men, /
        The enlightener of nations” by boastfully proclaiming

        Faliero experiences himself as having been turned into a “living lie” by the refusal of the Forty to respect ducal authority; both

        1821.</p>

          The imperial model of “almighty Rome” in <title level="m">Manfred</title> yields to a parallel nearer to Britain in <title level="m">Marino
          Faliero</title>, the maritime power of Venice, now sunk from glory to a place of Carnival and the intrigues and <emph>contretemps</emph> 
            that fill Byron’s contemporary life, letters, and <title level="m">Beppo</title> (written the same year as
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> was completed). The degradation of authority Faliero experiences, as many commentators
        have noted, corresponds with the shift in political force in England from the reforming aristocratic liberals of the late eighteenth and early
        nineteenth century to working-class radicals such as Cobbett and Orator Hunt. The involvement of Hobhouse with the radicals, leading to his
        imprisonment, profoundly discomfited Byron, and despite the <foreign xml:lang="fr">éclat</foreign> of his entry into the Greek
        Revolution (and death at Missolonghi), Byron was aware that the aristocratic status he flaunted was ceding political effectiveness to
        organized movements.</p>
               <p>Byron framed <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> with a Preface summarizing his sources, and an Appendix in which he
        printed extracts from them, in the original languages and in translation. These Wright curtailed to a dozen pages set in tiny type, but
        together they demonstrate the care Byron took to establish the cultural and historical context in which his characters act. The paratexts are
        integral to the design of the volume as a whole and connect directly to one of Wright’s most telling editorial interventions. On October 17,
        1820, roughly seven months after seeing Goethe’s critique of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and two months after the completing the copy of 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, Byron sent Murray his “dedication of” the drama “to Goethe" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:206), 
        countermanding his request on January 19, 1821: “<emph>Omit</emph> the Dedication to Goethe” (<title level="m">LJ</title> VIII:66). In his 
        <title level="m">Life of Byron</title> (1830), republished in the 1832-1833 edition of the
        <title level="m">Works</title>, Moore printed an expurgated text of the “never before published . . . very singular Dedication . . . written 
        in the poet’s most whimsical and mocking mood” (V:356). Notwithstanding its previous appearance, Wright, while rebuking Moore for his excisions, 
        reprinted Moore’s text in his preface to <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, positioning it to lead directly into Byron’s Preface and play. 
        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Wright regretted the omissions (attacks on Wordsworth and Southey) from the text because the “MS. having since
        been lost,” they cannot be repaired. The MS. was subsequently found in the Goethe Archiv, Weimar, and printed by Alois Brandl in 1899,
        and may be found transcribed in  <title level="m">CPW</title> (4:544-47). Barry Weller and Jerome McGann there observe that it “meant to
        respond to the criticisms” but the effect on readers of Wright’s printing and placing it as he did is rightly outside their editorial
        concerns (523). E. M. Butler narrates in full the misadventures that befell the intention to dedicate a drama to Goethe: Byron wrote a
        shorter and uncontroversial dedication for <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (1821), but it was not printed until the separate edition
        of the play in 1823; a still shorter dedication to Goethe is affixed to <title level="m">Werner</title> (1823).</note>
        The reader of Wright’s text, and those derived from it across the nineteenth century, thus apprehends, with greater or lesser self-consciousness, 
        the play as part of the sequence <title level="m">Manfred</title> =&gt; Goethe on <title level="m">Manfred</title> =&gt; Byron’s Dedication to 
        Goethe =&gt; <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>. The exchange we experience did not happen: Goethe did not receive the Dedication until 1831, 
        by which time Byron had been dead for seven years. Goethe died in 1832, before the appearance of the twelfth volume, containing 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, of the <title level="m">Works.</title>
               </p>
               <p>In transmitting the Dedication to Murray, Byron enclosed
        <quote>an Italian abstract of the German translation of <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s appendix in which you will perceive quoted what Goethe
        says of the <emph>whole body</emph> of English poetry (&amp; <emph>not</emph> of one in particular) on this the Dedication is founded as you will 
        perceive—though I had thought of it before for I look upon him as a Great Man. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII: 206)</quote>
        Even if Goethe had not aimed solely at Byron the stricture quoted in the Dedication that “the predominant character of the whole body of the
        present English poetry is a <emph>disgust</emph> and <emph>contempt for life</emph>,” it provided him the occasion for a
        riposte against the criticisms aroused by <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Moreover, the layout of Wright’s edition enfolds <title level="m">
        Manfred Faliero</title> in the riposte.</p>
               <p>Byron continues, exposing the point that Goethe had obscured by speaking of <title level="m">Manfred</title> only in
        relation to <title level="m">Faust</title>:
      <quote>But I rather suspect that by one single work of <emph>prose, you</emph> yourself have excited a greater contempt for life, than all
        the volumes of English poesy ever written. Madame de Staël says, that “Werther has occasioned more suicides than the most beautiful woman”;
        and I really believe that he has put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon himself,—except in the way of his profession. 
        (<title level="m">Works</title> XII:51).</quote>
        If the reply is only a witty <foreign xml:lang="la">tu quoque</foreign>, it also hints that a writer who had struggled to distance himself from his
        “white-hot expression of pain and joy,” as Goethe had in the post-publication embarrassments of <title level="m">Werther</title>, might have
        been more sympathetic to the urgencies of <title level="m">Manfred</title> than Goethe had been, and less ready to spread unfounded scandal
        about the poet’s life. The drama to which the Dedication was to be attached deepens the reply. Goethe had charged that Byron “repeatedly
        pourtrayed” his torment, to the point that “scarcely anyone feels compassion for this intolerable suffering, over which he is laboriously
        ruminating” (<title level="m">LJ</title> XII:506). <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> demonstrates
        that Byron’s preoccupations could be turned outward into a very different world, into “Venetian history and manners” (Wright’s terms, 
        <title level="m">Works</title> XII:45) of the fourteenth century, creating a “regular” drama in “good English” (Byron’s terms, qtd. in
        <title level="m">Works </title>XII:49) that unmistakably cast light on the shifting political conditions of a Britain that
        was not only post-Napoleon but also post-Peterloo. Devotees of “the Byronic” were disappointed, as Byron anticipated that they would be.
        Wright prints Francis Jeffrey’s verdict in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> that Byron fails because he chose
        a story “which not only gives no scope to the peculiar and commanding graces of his genius, but runs continually counter to the master
        currents of his fancy” (qtd. in <title level="m">Works</title> XII:46). In the drama, the passionate plaints of a <title level="m">Manfred</title>
        yield to the goal of provoking readers to critical thinking about the civic and the personal—but the oppositions are inadequate. 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> demonstrates—to Goethe and others—that imagination can turn personal history and Venetian history
        alike into a work of art, one that shows, as Goethe claimed for <title level="m">Werther</title>, the cultural situations that produce the
        self-involved protagonist. In what seems like an offhand P.S. to the Dedication, Byron writes:
       <quote>I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call
        <emph>“Classical”</emph> and “<emph>Romantic”</emph>—terms which were not subjects of classification
        in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. (<title level="m">Works</title> XII:52)</quote>
        The sentence seems a mere statement of fact, or a bemused reflection. It applies, however, to the
        entire sequence of Byron’s own productivity from <title level="m">Manfred</title> to <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, 
        continuous but shifting in form, not subject to a (single) classification.</p>

                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> represent antitheses of Byron’s
              poetic style. However, their overt differences with respect to poetic manner, content, and sensibility obscure their
              shared thematic material. Observing how the ending of <title level="m">Manfred</title> strikingly resembles the ending 
              of the <title level="m">Don Juan</title> source material leads to an awareness of gender issues
              underlying both works. Despite the apparent extreme contrast between the personalities and experiences of the poems’
              protagonists, both their tales embed a two-part structure, the first part focusing on heterosexual transgression, 
              the culmination, an all-male scene of reckoning.</p>

               <p>Byron completed <title level="m">Manfred</title> in the summer of 1817, just one year before beginning 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, yet the contrast between Byron’s two most remarkable poetic achievements could 
              not be more obvious. Byron, at least, saw it that way, declaring <title level="m">Manfred</title> “too much in my old 
              style,” while <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is in the new “style and manner of <title level="m">Beppo</title>” 
              (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185, VII:67). Who could seem more unlike one another than Don Juan and Manfred, and what 
              two story lines could possibly be more dissimilar than theirs as Byron presents them? Loving one woman too much and to 
              the exclusion of all others is ostensibly the fate of Byron’s solitary Alpine brooder; guilt haunts him, and 
              forgetfulness is the one thing he longs for. The hyper-gregarious hero from sunny Spain that Byron adopts for 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is defined by not loving any woman for more than a few fleeting moments; he seems 
              utterly lacking a capacity for guilt, and forgetfulness is the wind beneath his wings. Yet the protagonists of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and their life stories have much in common, 
              as different as they appear to be at first glance. It’s not merely that the poems share a philosophical viewpoint, 
              as one might expect to find in two works by a given author. Peel away a thin layer of their narrative surfaces and 
              deconstruct Byron’s “mock” recasting of the Don Juan source material, and you will find that these two poems share 
              a deep structure: the outline of a common story and central character.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In this paper <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, italicized, refers to Byron’s poem,
              pronounced Don Joo-an, while when not italicized, Don Juan should be read as Don Hwan, the protagonist of numerous European 
              works. The relation of the character of Manfred to that of Don Juan, despite their antithetical personalities and life
              stories, has not gone entirely unnoticed. Romantic literary and musical interpretations of Don Juan in fact show more 
              of an influence of <title level="m">Manfred</title> than of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. Thus, Svetlana Klimova 
              points out that the hero of A. K. Tolstoy’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1862) “is much closer to the ‘classical 
              Byronic hero’ than to Byron’s Don Juan . . . [and] reveals Tolstoy’s debt not only to Goethe . . . but also to Byron’s 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (344). Thomas Gray, writing about the figure of Don Giovanni in Romantic music, notes
              “the overwhelming impact of Lord Byron’s literary oeuvre and persona on the collective cultural imagination of Europe 
              in the 1810s and twenties,” but offers the caveat that Byron’s “own epic-satiric poem, <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,”
              is “one of his few major works entirely unsusceptible to dramatic or operatic adaptation.” Rather, Gray explains, the 
              “unbridled, hedonistic exuberance” of Mozart’s character” is in Romantic works tempered “with new Byronic shadows . . . 
              is suffused with a newly Romantic chiaroscuro,” so that Richard Wagner “carries the brooding Byronization of the Don 
              Juan figure to an extreme in the person of the Flying Dutchman, the doom-driven spectral seducer in search of redemptive
              quiescence” (78-79).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Because Byron’s ironic treatment of the Don Juan source material initially obscures the connection between 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and <title level="m">Manfred</title>, my point of departure is a consideration of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> alongside a more straightforward treatment of the Don Juan story well-known in Byron’s 
              day and ever since: namely, Mozart’s incomparable opera <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, with a libretto by Lorenzo
              da Ponte. Noting resemblances between the opera and <title level="m">Manfred</title> helps illuminate the fact that,
              despite how different these poems appear to be, <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan </title>
              are two variations on the same plot and the same central character. Indeed, regarding these two poems almost as one
              continuous work helps illuminate important themes latent in both of them.</p>

              thrilling and dramatically powerful scenes in opera. In this scene the Don locks hands with a statue that he has invited 
              to dinner: the statue of the Commendatore whom (in Act I) Don Giovanni killed in a duel after the Commendatore intervened
              to prevent the Don’s seduction or rape (interpretations vary) of his daughter. The parallels between this scene in the
              opera and the final scene in <title level="m">Manfred</title> with respect to action, character, imagery, and general 
              atmosphere are immediately obvious. In the opera, the statue repeatedly demands—in a resonant <foreign xml:lang="it">
              basso profundo</foreign> and more in anger than sorrow—the Don’s repentance for the dissolute ways of his life; the 
              villain refuses to repent, and he is finally engulfed in the flames of hell, as his servant, Leporello, looks on in 
              terror. In the final scene of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, a larger-than-life, indeed otherworldly, male figure,
              identified as the Spirit, similarly booms forth his implacable taunts and demands, beckoning Manfred to his final doom,
              while the Abbot looks on, fearful for Manfred (though not, he claims, for himself).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Despite 
              the obvious and significant similarity between the final scene in <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the Commendatore 
              scene in <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, I have found only one reference to it, in <title level="m">Schumann</title> by 
              Eric Frederick Jensen (50). Whether Byron had ever seen Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> is an open 
              question. The short answer is probably not. <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, which premiered in Prague in 1787 and
              had its Italian premier in Rome in 1811, did not receive its London premiere until 1817, after Byron had left England, 
              and was not performed in Venice until 1833 (strange though that seems for an enormously popular opera that, in the first
              fifty years since its premiere “made its way all around Europe, and as far afield as New York and Calcutta”) (Parakilas
              253). That said, Byron revised Act III of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in April and May of 1817, during which time 
              he had left Venice for Rome, traveling through Ferrara, Bologna, and Florence. Regular operagoer that he was, he could
              possibly have caught a performance of Mozart’s opera while on his travels. It should be noted that the first version of 
              Act III, written in Switzerland, has none of the <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> elements: no Abbott or Spirit, no
              scene of Manfred’s repeated rejection and denial. Regardless of whether Byron had seen a complete production in a major
              opera house of Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, he would undoubtedly have been familiar with some version 
              of the statue scene, elements of which found its way into <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s revised third act. For one
              thing, Da Ponte’s libretto borrowed heavily from a libretto by Giovanni Bertati, which was used in two other 
              <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> operas frequently performed in Venice. Furthermore, the ubiquity, both in England
              prior to Byron’s departure and in Italy, of theatrical, balletic, and amateur operatic performances of scenes from 
              Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as well as of other Don Juan dramas, make it highly unlikely that Byron
              would not, at some point, have seen something very much like the Commendatore scene familiar to most of us through 
              Mozart’s opera. As Byron noted of the hero of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, he is known to us from “plays in five, 
              and operas in three acts,” and “We all have seen him in the pantomime / Sent to the devil, somewhat ere his time” 
              (I: ll. 1620, 7-8).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, both scenes involve three male figures. At the center is the work’s hero (or anti-hero), a charismatic aristocrat, 
              a sexual taboo breaker (if not actual criminal) who remains fearless and unrepentant in his final hour. Next is his
              antagonist, a supernaturally powerful, older, punishing, or at least challenging, male figure who demands something of 
              the hero: the Commendatore demands the Don’s repentance; the Spirit demands that Manfred go with him. In 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title>, too, there is a plea for the hero’s repentance, which comes from the Abbot in Act III,
              scene one. The third man present in the scene—Leporello in the opera, the Abbot in <title level="m">Manfred</title>—is 
              an onlooker; lacking the stature both of the hero and of the supernatural figure, he is merely a human being with 
              normal responses, registering, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, the terrors that the audience must feel.</p>
               <p>In addition to the male triangle that structures these scenes, they share other features. Both heroes verbally communicate
              death’s taking hold of them: Don Giovanni cries out, “What strange tremor now assails my spirits!”;<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <foreign xml:lang="it">Da qual tremore insolito sento assalir gli spiriti!</foreign> Quotations from <title level="m">
              Don Giovanni</title> are from the libretto accompanying the CD recording by the Théâtre National de l’Opéra, Paris 
              (CBS, 1979), English translation by Lionel Salter. I have occasionally provided a more literal translation than Salter’s,
              which was made to correspond to the Italian verse line.</note> Manfred observes, “I feel my soul / Is ebbing from me”
              (III.iv.99-100). Death-related coldness is invoked in both scenes: when Don Giovanni takes the Statue’s hand, he
              shudderingly exclaims, “<foreign xml:lang="it">Che gelo e questo mai</foreign>!”; the Abbot, taking the hand of Manfred 
              in his dying moment, observes: “Cold—cold—even to the heart” (III.iv.149). Thus, too, a male handclasp occurs in both
              scenes. Both works culminate in a terrifying glimpse of the afterlife, and both heroes (or are they villains?) expire
              supernaturally: that is, from no known bodily cause. Also worth considering is the Abbot’s reference to the Spirit as 
              one of Manfred’s “guests” (III.iii.73). While Manfred does not appear to extend an invitation to the Spirit in the way 
              that Don Giovanni famously invites his “stone guest” to dinner, the verbal echo is resonant: the protagonists’ fate is 
              one they themselves invite—one might say desire.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Stone guest,” the common epithet for the statue 
              in <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, derives from <foreign xml:lang="es">El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de
              piedra</foreign>, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso de Molina that was the source for later Don Juan
              dramatizations.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the most striking thematic and dramatic similarity between the final scenes of the opera and the play is their 
              emphasis on the hero’s defiance in the face of supernatural threats and conventional moral or religious claims. It’s 
              true that, consistent with the original story and audience tastes, the opera affirms Christian beliefs by presenting 
              a horrified and groaning Don Giovanni swallowed by the terrors of hell, followed by the happy moralizing of the finale
              (“heaven has avenged us all,” etc.). In this respect the opera presents a distinct contrast with <title level="m">
              Manfred</title>, whose hero finds it “not so difficult to die,” having denied all supernatural powers, infernal or
              otherwise, external to the human mind (III.iv.151). Yet the brief display of hellfire at the end of the Commendatore 
              scene (often an occasion for hokey stage effects) feels like an afterthought compared to the thrilling power of the 
              scene leading up to that point. Dramatically and musically, the force of the scene derives from the sudden appearance 
              of the Commendatore, his threatening commands, and the defiance of a fearless man who, even in the face of death and 
              the terrors of hell, refuses to repent:<quote>

              The final “No!” is not so much sung as shouted from the very depths of the baritone’s being. The repetition of 
              Manfred’s contemptuous exclamations of rejection is likewise the core of the final scene of Byron’s drama:<quote>

               <p>That the ending of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>—in other words, the classic ending of the Don Juan 
              dramatizations ubiquitous in early nineteenth-century Europe—should bear such striking resemblance to the ending
              of <title level="m">Manfred</title> might surprise us. After all, in all other respects, as I noted at the outset, 
              the tone and content of <title level="m">Manfred</title> could not seem more unrelated to that of Mozart’s 
              <foreign xml:lang="it">dramma giocosa</foreign>. Yet since Byron did, as we well know, write a poem utilizing the 
              Don Juan story, observing the classic Don Juan ending in <title level="m">Manfred</title> immediately suggests the
              possibility of a connection between Byron’s metaphysical drama and his mock epic. The line of connection may be easily
              discovered by recalling the source for the many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century, French, English, and Italian
              adaptations of the Don Juan tale, <title level="m">
                     <foreign xml:lang="es">El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de
              piedra</foreign>
                  </title>, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso de Molina. As its two-part title suggests, 
              Tirso’s drama was very likely an engrafting of two legends: the escapades of a libertine and the story of a statue who
              comes to dinner and drags the sinner off to hell (Waxman 189). Thus, it’s easy to see how Byron’s <title level="m">Don
              Juan</title> bears reference to the first part of Tirso’s play, and <title level="m">Manfred</title> to the denouement,
              which the uncompleted <title level="m">Don Juan</title> does not arrive at (though Candace Tate, in her psychological
              reading of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, suggests that Juan’s encounter with the Black Friar, aka the Duchess of
              Fitz-Fulke, at the close of the sixteenth canto, is indeed relatable to Tirso’s and Mozart’s scene of the avenging stone
              guest [147]). But the material common to <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, as
              highlighted by their connection to the Don Juan story, is found not merely in the way one work corresponds to the first
              part of the Don’s adventures, the other to his demise, but in fact is found more broadly throughout both works.</p>
               <p>To begin with, the heroes of both poems, indeed the poems themselves, represent challenges to authority, religious 
              authority in particular. This is something both works have in common with the Don Juan source material. Tirso’s title
              identifies Don Juan not as a lover, but as a <foreign xml:lang="it">burlador</foreign>, a word commonly connoting
              “seducer,” but, as its etymological relation to burlesque suggests, more literally meaning mocker or trickster. Tirso de
              Molina was a monk, and his play was intended to ridicule the hypocritical, cheaply purchased repentance that allowed
              wealthy immoralists to misbehave. Later interpretations have seen in Don Juan’s libertinism and mockery a challenge not
              merely to a corrupt clergy, but to the taboos themselves, and in some cases to religion itself, when set against human
              drives and rational understanding. Now, the mocking element is certainly just as strong in <title level="m">Manfred</title>
              as it is in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>; both works take up cudgels against “cant moral” and “cant religious” 
              (<title level="m">The Works of Lord Byron</title>, V:542). While a comic turn to the satire is overt in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, the burlesque element of the original version of the third act of <title level="m">Manfred

              Manfred</title>, Byron rewrote it sometime between 25 April and 5 May 1817. It is this revised third act that has been
              transmitted through all printed editions of the poem. For the original version of Act III, see <title level="m">CPW
              </title>IV.67-71.</note>—as it takes aim at an Abbot who demands, along with Manfred’s repentance, a “gift of all [his]
              lands / To the Monastery” (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:468)—reveals a kinship between the spirit of Byron’s somber
              drama and his “merry” poem (<title level="m">Don Juan</title> IV.39).</p>
               <p>But beyond the poems’ challenges to religion and traditional mores, reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> in its relation 
              to <title level="m">Don Juan</title> illuminates significant embedded themes that they share. Such a reading begins with 
              the observation that the two-part structure of Tirso’s drama, of its various literary and operatic descendants, and of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> is noticeably gendered: women define the content of the first part of the narrative, men
              the second.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, the intense maleness of the
              Commendatore scene, following the opera’s series of girl-chasing episodes, is hard not to notice, if only with respect 
              to the vocal element. A comment posted at a YouTube recording of the Commendatore scene goes as follows: “There is not a
              tenor or soprano on that stage. It’s two basses and a baritone going at it. I love this. . . .”</note> The life of 
              taboo-breaking pleasure focuses on women (or a woman); the scene of fear, threat, punishment and/or triumph is a 
              homosocial scene. An Oedipal triangle? The law of the father? A scene of male bonding? However one interprets it, the
              legendary Don Juan and Manfred, the first part of whose stories centers on heteroerotics, reach their tragic apotheosis 
              in an all-male world. (Here, by the way, is a distinct departure from <title level="m">Faust</title>, which bears certain
              resemblances to the legend of Don Juan as it does to <title level="m">Manfred</title>, but which culminates in the lure 
              of the Eternal Feminine.)</p>
               <p>The contest between men, the agon of son and father, is implicit throughout Don Juan’s escapades with women, not just in 
              the final scene of reckoning. While women are the Don’s obvious target, his misbehavior with them mocks, in the most 
              direct and personal way, the authority of their lovers, husbands, and fathers, the power and laws of men.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Marina Warner points out: “In <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as in earlier, Spanish versions 
              of the Don Juan story, women are the immediate objects of the hero’s desire, but the ultimate targets of his exploits 
              are men, the men who hold the women in their keeping: fathers, husbands, fiancés . . .  [W]omen are prizes at stake in 
              a struggle for power between men” (94-95).</note>Thus, in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Juan’s lovemaking first
              cuckolds an old husband, then undermines a tyrant father, then outwits a sultan, and then takes aim at the English 
              country gentry. Peter Manning, discussing “the ubiquitous and decisive presence of fathers, father figures, and ancestors”
              in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, observes that “Byron’s pattern of setting Manfred in relief against other male 
              figures culminates in the soliloquy which opens the last scene of the play” (906). In that soliloquy, Manfred recalls
              standing “within the Coliseum’s wall, / ‘Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome” (III.iv.10-1):<quote>
                     <lg style="stanza">
                        <l>With silent worship of the Great of old,</l>
                        <l>The dead, but sceptered, Sovereigns, who still rule</l>
                        <l>Our spirits from their urns. (III.iv.39-41)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>As Manning explains: “The legendary Caesars, mentioned 
              three times in the first thirty lines of the soliloquy, are the inclusive symbol of the masculine authority to which
              [Manfred] now bows” (907). But the admiration is tinged with ambivalence, as Manfred derides the power of these revered
              fathers, noting that “Caesar’s chambers, and the Augustan halls, / Grovel on earth in indistinct decay” (IV.iv.29-30).
              While a pleasing interpretation of the characters and behavior of Manfred and Juan (as of the legendary Don Juan) is that
              they represent an attack on the Ancien Régime, we do not forget that these characters are themselves aristocrats and are
              empowered and admired on account of that.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Williams writes: “[Don Giovanni] is
              dependent, dialectically, on social institutions which he rejects—wealth, and the liberty given by class.” Williams quotes
              Ernst Bloch’s description: “a strangely ambiguous titanism . . . Does he belong fully to the society of the Ancien Régime,
              as its most ruthless representative, or do we detect in him, in the erotic explosive rebellion, part of a return to
              nature?” (113).</note> Even the pure mountain air and “natural music of the mountain reed” recall to Manfred an idyll
              defined in terms of gender and power: “here the patriarchal days are not / A pastoral fable” (I.ii.49-50). Byron’s own
              anxiety about fathers may be traceable as far back as his early fragment “When to their airy hall my fathers’ voice” (an
              anxiety, incidentally, equaled if not surpassed by Mozart’s towards his father, which some critics have regarded as a
              psychological underpinning of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Mozart’s
              ambivalence towards the towering figure of his father and its influence on <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, the 
              final scene in particular, see Peter Gay, “The Father’s Revenge.” See also Maynard Solomon, <title level="m">Mozart: A
              Life</title>, p. 246.</note> Thus, attempting to undermine powerful male figures and yet wanting to best them at their 
              own game form the Janus-head of these heroes’ deeds and words.</p>
               <p>To whatever extent Oedipal antagonism underlies the Don’s famed philandering or Manfred’s fateful fidelity, reading any 
              of the Don Juan literature or <title level="m">Manfred</title> without considering how they thematize anxiety about
              heterosexual love is scarcely possible. Some critics have suggested, in fact, that the mysterious taboo relationship 
              in <title level="m">Manfred</title>—“the deadliest sin to love as we have loved”—is not incest but homosexuality
              (II.iv.123).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Crompton, pages 369-70, notes. G. Wilson Knight considered the “incest
              motif” in Byron’s life “a red herring” and “that a more important and more consistently motivating secret of Byron’s 
              life lay somewhere within the area of homosexuality” (<title level="m">Lord Byron’s Marriage</title>, as discussed in
              Elfenbein, 39). We recall, too, that the first appearance of Astarte in the poem comes when a male spirit (“him, / Who is
              most powerful of ye”) appears “in the shape of a beautiful female figure” (I.i.185<emph>ff</emph>).</note> 
              This is an idea worth pursuing in the present context, even if ultimately one prefers not to translate the poem’s 
              mysteries and destabilizing ambiguities into a fixed code with specific references. Astarte is, after all, an obvious
              mirroring, Manfred’s feminized version of himself:<quote>
                     <lg style="stanza">
                        <l>She was like me in lineaments—her eyes,</l>
                        <l>Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone</l>
                        <l>Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;</l>
                        <l>But soften’d all, and temper’d into beauty;</l>
                        <l>She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,</l>
                        <l>The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind</l>
                        <l>To comprehend the universe: nor these</l>
                        <l>Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,</l>
                        <l>Pity, and smiles, and tears—which I had not;</l>
                        <l>And tenderness—but that I had for her;</l>
                        <l>Humility—and that I never had. (II.ii.105-15)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
              Equally significant is the fact that Manfred’s unhappiness and alienation, his sense of difference from other men, date 
              to his youth, in other words predate “that all-nameless hour” that he identifies in Act 1 as the beginning of his 
              suffering and guilt, and which we take to refer to Astarte’s death (see II.ii.50-61).</p>
               <p>And what is the cause of Astarte’s death? Suicide—presumably over guilt or despair at her incest—is hinted at, and 
              many readers have accepted suicide as the cause of her death and, therefore, of Manfred’s guilt.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, Jerome McGann notes that “some have argued that Byron deliberately left the nature of [his
              secret] sin vague and mystified. But this is by no means the case, as various early readers show. Reviewing the play 
              in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, John Wilson . . . had no difficulty at all in understanding Manfred’s guilt: 
              ‘. . . Manfred had conceived a mad and insane passion for his sister, named Astarte, and . . . she had, in consequence 
              of their mutual guilt, committed suicide.’ The play is not at all equivocal on these matters” (McGann 15). Elsewhere,
              however, McGann has written, “Astarte of the play is not Augusta . . . [it] is Manfred’s Fate understood as his destined
              and inmost Self, his epipsyche,” thus veering away from “not at all equivocal” with respect to the play’s references to
              incest and his lover’s suicide (<title level="m">CPW</title> 4:467).</note>
              But what is Manfred’s—and <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s—explanation of Astarte’s death?<quote>
                     <lg style="stanza">
                        <l>I loved her, and destroy’d her!</l>
                        <l>. . . Not with my hand, but heart—which broke her heart— </l>
                        <l>It gazed on mine, and wither’d. (II.ii.117-9)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
              These are crucial lines that, as often as one finds them quoted in criticism of the poem, have not been given the 
              attention they warrant.<note place="foot" resp="editors">An exception is Andrew Elfenbein, who notes that readers “have
              been tempted to invent histories” for Astarte’s death, and that “[t]he issue is not what happened, but what [Manfred]
              thinks happened. According to him the cause of her death was not incest but her gazing upon his heart” (39).</note> 
              Their teasing mysteriousness derives from the interplay of positive declaration of agency (“I . . . destroyed her!”),
              negation of means (“Not with my hand”), metaphoric substitution (“with my . . . heart,” “broke her heart,” “her heart
              . . . gazed on mine”), and passive causation (“withered”). One thing they do not state clearly, if at all, is that 
              Astarte killed herself. The expression “to break someone’s heart” typically means not the sharing of a mutual love but,
              rather, the opposite: rejection, lack of mutual feeling. In fact, the lines seem to suggest that something in Manfred’s
              “heart,” in his inmost being, caused his lover’s heart (i.e., her love, her life) to wither. Perhaps it was this 
              essential, hidden truth of Manfred’s nature—a truth that dare not speak its name—that was fatal to his female lover 
              and caused her to disappear from his life. Certainly, Manfred’s self-accusations heard in the Incantation seem a bit
              excessive for, even incongruent with, one who merely loved not wisely but too well. What does his “cold breast and 
              serpent smile” (I.i.242), his “shut soul’s hypocrisy” (I.i.245), or his “brotherhood of Cain” (I.i.249) have to do with
              Manfred’s avowedly passionate and profound love for Astarte? Cain, of course, was the original slayer of a man more 
              favored by the all-powerful, law-giving father. Such anxiety about masculine identity and power, perhaps underlying
              Manfred’s sense of hypocrisy or sinfulness, was neither caused, nor apparently could be cured, by the love of a good
              woman.</p>
               <p>Of course, we all know what caused the death of Astarte. It was Byron who caused the death of Astarte, in his dream that 
              he called <title level="m">Manfred</title>. If farewells to women are part of the recurrent imagery in the male fantasy
              known as Don Juan, they are certainly also a recurrent motif in the poetry of Lord Byron. From <title level="a">Maid of
              Athens, Ere We Part</title> to <title level="a">So, We’ll go No More A-Roving,</title> Byron’s lyrics repeatedly 
              suggest that pleasure, when it comes to his relationships with women, is ever at its lips bidding adieu.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The following lines and titles are among Byron’s numerous farewells to women: “Then fare thee well,
              deceitful maid” (<title level="a">To—</title> [<title level="a">Oh! had my Fate been join’d with thine</title>],
              1807); “Your lover should bid you a lasting adieu” (<title level="a">To Anne,</title> 1807); “Mary, adieu! I must 
              away” (<title level="a">Well! Thou Art Happy,</title> 1808); “In flight I shall be surely wise / Escaping from
              temptation’s snare” (<title level="a">The Farewell to a Lady,</title> 1808); “And though I bid thee now farewell” 
              (<title level="a">To Florence,</title> 1809); <title level="a">On Parting</title> (1811); “Adieu, dear maid!” 
              (<title level="a">Love and Gold,</title> 1813); “I only know we loved in vain— / I only feel—Farewell!—Farewell!" 
              (<title level="a">Farewell! If ever fondest prayer,</title> 1813); <title level="a">Fare Thee Well!</title> (1816). 
              The subject of love’s passing is a related topic: <title level="a">Love’s Last Adieu</title> (1807); <title level="a">They Say That Hope Is Happiness</title> (1814); <title level="a">Could Love for ever</title> (1819); <title level="a">January 22<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> 1824. Messalonghi. On this day I complete my thirty-sixth year.</title> Peter
              Cochran stated it flatly: “The Byronic Hero has no time for women" (<title level="m">Byron and Women [and Men]</title>
              xlv).</note> While Byron is hardly the only poet to have made sweet sorrow of lovers’ farewells, in Byron’s case, not 
              only his poetry but his life was a perpetual illustration of the principle he confided to Hobhouse within three months
              after beginning his love affair with Teresa Guiccioli: “that a man should not consume his life at the side and on the
              bosom—of a woman” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:214). Thus, while Manfred self-identifies as the abandoned lover, and
              readers identify Don Juan as the one who abandons, the outcome for these heroes—one might say the desired outcome—
              is the same.</p>
               <p>Citing several references to Manfred’s preoccupation with male power—with serving and swaying—and to his alternating
              guilt over inadequacy and pride in triumph, Manning concludes that “it may seem strange to suggest that one current of 
              the action is Manfred’s struggle to earn a place in the world of men” (906). Strange or not, that assessment certainly
              rings true. About <title level="a">La Belle Dame Sans Merci,</title> Karen Swann observed: “We tend to assume that the
              knight sincerely wants to capture the lady. . . . Focusing on his loss, we fail to notice what he gains at the end of 
              the poem—accession to an all-male community. Could this community, and not the ideal or even the fatal woman, be the 
              true object of his quest?”(90). Focusing on what Manfred identifies as his life-consuming loss, we may fail to notice 
              that his identity is achieved not as a woman’s lover, but in the fantasy of a triumphant contest with powerful male
              authority figures. In discussing Romantic triangles, Sonia Hofkosh noted that the “male relation, like the masculine
              subject, is the primary and prior one; the feminine, empty or derivative,” quoting Mary Jacobus’ explanation that “this
              triangle characteristically invokes its third (female) term only in the interests of the original rivalry and works 
              finally to get rid of the woman” (Hofkosh 102; Jacobus 119). The tales of both Don Juan and Manfred do indeed “get rid 
              of the woman,” and these heroes achieve their end by enormous self-assertion amidst powerful male figures. We might 
              note in passing that the word “love” or “loved” occurs nineteen times in <title level="m">Manfred</title> while “power” 
              or “powers” occurs thirty-nine times.</p>
               <p>Laurence Lipking has quipped that the “true moral of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as a libertine might see it,
              seems far from instructive: raping a daughter is permissible, so long as one does not also kill her father” (46). In 
              fact, the heterosexual misbehavior of the legendary Don Juan should be considered in light of the denouement: an anxiety
              dream about male identity, performance, and the laws and power of men. Although Byron presents different surface 
              treatments of this theme in <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, its outline is 
              visible in both works.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay suggests that Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> contains not an expression of Byron’s guilt about his
          incest with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, as previous critics have suggested, but rather considerable evidence of his lack of guilt. It
          argues that the play displays incest and torment, but in fact does not link the two, instead displaying Manfred’s love for Astarte as deeply
          felt without regrets. The essay then argues that one finds the same combination of deep love and lack of regret in Byron’s remarks about his
          relationship with his half-sister, as well as in the representations of incest in his other works. It suggests that this acceptance of
          incest links to Byron’s commitment to rational thinking and personal freedom, and it invites future criticism to explore this connection in
          more detail.</p>

               <p>
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> has incest and guilt at its core. Manfred has committed incest, and he is obsessively guilty. Two hundred
          years' worth of critics and scholars have considered the significance and inter-relationship of these two, and most agree that Manfred
          expresses guilt for having committed incest with his sister, Astarte. Moreover, many acknowledge that Manfred's incest is a mirror of
          Byron’s incestuous relationship with <emph>his</emph> sister, Augusta Leigh, and suggest that Manfred's guilt is an expression of Byron’s
            own.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For relevant twentieth-century readings, see, for example, Peter Thorslev, <title level="a">Incest

          concern in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, and a central concern to the Byron who wrote <title level="m">Manfred</title>. I would argue,
          however, that <title level="m">Manfred </title> the text and Manfred the character show not Byron's guilt over his incest with Augusta
          Leigh, but rather his lack of guilt. Furthermore, this is a lack that Byron continues to display in various ways in his later work, and one
          for which he has larger intellectual reasons.</p>
               <p>Byron plants the seeds of Manfred's lack of guilt in the character's opening monologue. Here Manfred proclaims: "Good or evil, life, /
          Powers, passions, all I see in other beings, / Have been to me as rain unto the sands, / Since that all-nameless hour" (I.i.21-4). This is a
          time-honored dramatic maneuver, a proleptic announcement that keeps the audience in suspense until a text reveals all at a later time. In
            <title level="m">Manfred</title>, however, that time never comes. In the course of the play, "that hour" remains literally "all-nameless":
          no one ever explains when or what it was. The closest anyone comes is in the exchange between Manfred and the Witch of the Alps in the
          second scene of the second act:<quote>

                  </quote> Once unpicked, this deeply unclear clarification reveals the source of Manfred's guilt to be not incest but Astarte's death
          and his role in causing it. A rough paraphrase of these lines would be,<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>I loved her, and made her no more. . . .</l>

                        <l>Daughter of Air! I’m telling you that since the moment of her death—</l>
                        <l>But words are just air—watch me when I sleep</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Although the play does not make explicit a connection between "that all-nameless hour" and "that hour" (and note that in the
          second case, too, "that" is a floating referent, referring back to nothing), in this passage "that hour" appears to link back to the moment
          when Astarte's "blood was shed— / I saw—and could not staunch it," not to the moment when Manfred and Astarte had sexual relations.</p>
               <p>The text goes on to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Manfred has committed incest, and it persistently establishes that he is
          tormented, but it never actually connects the two. In fact, the construction of Manfred's revelation to the Witch figures his motive for
          incest not as lust or as a desire to do evil, but as love: "I loved her, and destroy'd her!" His soliloquy after she departs reiterates this:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>If I had never lived, that which I love</l>
                        <l>Had still been living; had I never loved,</l>
                        <l>That which I loved would still be beautiful—</l>
                        <l>Happy and giving happiness. (II.ii.193-6)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Even when he confronts the Phantom of Astarte, he seeks not expiation for incest but reassurance that she does not hate him
          and is not suffering: "Say that thou loath'st me not—that I do bear / This punishment for both" (II.iv.125-6). Manfred makes no reference to
          a sense of guilt here, only to an imposed punishment and an overwhelming love.</p>
               <p>But <title level="m">Manfred</title> does not limit itself to repeated evidence that Manfred does not regret his sexual relationship with
          Astarte. It also emphasizes Byron's lack of compunction about <emph>his</emph> incest. It achieves this in part by Manfred's declarations of
          love for Astarte, in part by the strength of his lack of regret, and in part by the play's obsessive avoidance of naming the act of incest.
          If this last sounds counterintuitive, that is because it is. It needs to be. As D.L. MacDonald has pointed out, Byron could scarcely
          announce his love affair with his sister to the public, but <title level="m">Manfred</title> nonetheless refers to it "obsessively, but by
          aposiopesis," as well as by persistent lacunae and allusions that draw attention to the act rather than disguising it (37). Manfred tells
          the Chamois Hunter that they loved each other as they "should not love" (II.i.27); he later informs the Witch that his beloved "was like me
          in lineaments" (II.ii.105); the servant Manuel is significantly interrupted just at the right moment in his description of Astarte,<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>her, whom of all earthly things</l>
                        <l>That lived, the only thing he [Manfred] seemed to love,—</l>
                        <l>As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,</l>
                        <l>The lady Astarte, his—</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent2">Hush, who comes here? (III.iii.44-7)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Just in case there should be any doubt, Manfred reminds the Phantom of Astarte that "it were / The deadliest sin to love as
          we have loved" (II.iv.123-4): not many kinds of love fit that bill. In fact, the play's very existence is a demonstration of Byron's absence
          of remorse. According to a statement drawn up by Lady Byron in 1816, rumors of Byron's sexual connection to Leigh had "become current in the
          World" before his departure from England (qtd. in Marchand 589), and when a man suspected of incest publishes a verse drama about a man who
          seems to have committed incest, pangs of conscience do not appear to have played a role in either the incest or the publication.</p>
               <p>Reviewers certainly understood precisely what was not being named. Francis Jeffrey deplored the "painful and offensive nature of the
          circumstance" on which the play's "distress was ultimately founded" (140). In the <title level="j">British Review</title>, William Roberts
          wrote that Manfred's love "appears to have been of the sort that lies under a natural interdict" (86), while the <title level="j">Day and
            New Times</title> put it more plainly, explaining that Manfred "committed incest!" In fact, the <title level="j">Day and New
          Times</title>, at least, knew what had occurred outside the text as well as in: its announcement of Manfred's incest was followed by the
          assertion, "Lord Byron has coloured Manfred into his own personal features" (130).</p>
               <p>It is not unreasonable to suggest that an author who wants to keep a secret should be more secretive, nor to suggest that an author who is
          not terribly secretive might not want to keep his secret. Byron was fully aware of the public horror and censure that would attend upon any
          clear revelation that his hero and his hero's sister, or he and his own half-sister, had committed incest. It is significant that Manfred
          takes care to clarify that he alone is responsible for what transpired with Astarte: "What is she now?—a sufferer for my sins" (II.ii.96-7).
          In an 1814 letter Byron exhorted Lady Melbourne, his confidant in the matter, not to reproach Leigh for having sex with him: "it was not her
          fault—but my own <emph>folly</emph>" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:27, Byron’s emphasis).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on
            contemporaneous responses to and beliefs about incest, see James Twitchell, <title level="m">Forbidden Partners: The Incest Taboo in
              Modern Culture</title> (Columbia UP, 1989).</note> But his awareness of risk did not stop him from publishing a work that he knew would
          be widely read as confessional, featuring as its main character a version of himself who demonstrated no regret for what he had done. All
          this suggests that, while he may have been concerned about public reaction, he, like Manfred, did not regret the act itself.</p>
               <p>In fact, Byron's justification for his actions also mirrors Manfred's, except that while Manfred cries his love, Byron confided it. He
          wrote to Lady Melbourne that Leigh was "twined round my heart in every possible manner—dearest &amp; deepest in my hope &amp; my memory"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:69). Still, for both creator and created, this love is rendered legitimate by reason of its uniqueness
          and the great gap it fills. "I have wandered o'er the earth, / And never found thy likeness" (II.iv.144-5) Manfred tells Astarte, while
          Byron wrote to Leigh, "we—at least—I—am by a crowd of circumstances removed from the only being who could ever have loved me, or whom I can
          unmixedly feel attached to" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:95).</p>
               <p>In light of this quotation, it seems significant that Byron was as reluctant as his hero to stop referring to his forbidden relationship.
          Even before <title level="m">Manfred</title>, he inserted a reference in <title level="m"> Childe Harold</title> III, where the waters of
          Lake Leman "sound sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved" (95). More interesting, however, is a very carefully encoded reference in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> two years later, in the passage in which Donna Julia is excusing her way toward adultery:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>She now determined that a virtuous woman</l>
                        <l>Should rather face and overcome temptation,</l>
                        <l>That flight was base and dastardly, and no man</l>
                        <l>Should ever give her heart the least sensation;</l>
                        <l>That is to say, a thought beyond the common</l>
                        <l>Preference, that we must feel upon occasion</l>
                        <l>For people who are pleasanter than others,</l>
                        <l>But then they only seem so many brothers. (I.77)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> As Byron points out, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> contains "much which could not be appreciated / In any manner by the
          uninitiated,” and in this stanza the reference to his personal experience may go unnoticed by those not on the look-out (XIV.22). But for
          those aware of the facts of Byron's personal life, it is difficult to read the seemingly innocuous last line of this passage without finding
          it considerably less than innocuous. Byron, after all, knew how some women act toward their brothers. What's more, in a passage that pulls
          the rug out from under each of Julia's virtuous stratagems, revealing them as merely excuses to edge toward sin, such sly acknowledgement
          that the fraternal can turn—indeed, in one particularly relevant case has turned—into something more makes perfect sense. Julia, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is telling its initiated readers, is fooling herself about the asexuality of brothers.</p>
               <p>Jerome McGann has written that the job of <title level="m">Juan</title>'s reader is not so much to "decipher the text" as to "describe and
          retrace" Byron's "acts of encipherment,” and Gary Dyer has built on this to suggest that one might fruitfully focus on both the encipherment
          and its context and meanings (207; 573). Indeed, what is most fascinating about this moment in which incest is enciphered is the meaning of
          its existence in its context: the fact that, given contemporaneous notions of morality, Byron chose to include it in a published work at
          all. Literature is not thick with joking references to incest, because incest is not something authors or audiences usually take lightly.
          But Byron does. Now, it is true that the Byron of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> takes pretty much everything lightly. That aspect,
          however, was precisely what most repulsed reviewers: William Hazlitt complained of the poem that "Our enthusiasm for genius or virtue is . .
          . turned into a jest by the very person who has kindled it . . . It is not that Lord Byron is sometimes serious and sometimes trifling,
          sometimes profligate and sometimes moral; but when he is most serious and most moral, he is only preparing to mortify the unsuspecting
          reader by putting a pitiful hoax upon him" (162). Hazlitt and others objected to this facet of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> because to
          joke about morals is to suggest their insignificance, to announce that they are foolish enough to be the subject of jokes. By inserting his
          sly joke—that a woman may feel a preference for men "who are pleasanter than others, / But then they only seem so many brothers"—Byron
          suggests that the idea that brothers are, naturally, sexually off-limits is laughable, that sibling incest (not least his own, which is the
          basis for the joke in the first place) is something harmless enough to be the root of a joke. The meaning of this moment, then, is Byron's
          own casual relationship with incest and its prohibition.</p>
               <p>Admittedly, this revelation is only accessible to the initiated: those readers who know Byron's past and make the connection. By the time
          he writes <title level="m">Cain</title> in 1821, however, Byron has decided to declare his feelings more openly than he did in either <title level="m">Juan</title> or <title level="m">Manfred</title>. As Heather Stansbury has recently pointed out, this final Byronic portrayal of
          incest represents it not as something to be condemned, "but, rather, entirely natural" (25). Astounded by Lucifer's revelation that
          brother-sister love will one day be a sin "in your children" (I.ii.361), Cain's wife and sister, Adah, asks rhetorically,<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Was not he, their father,</l>
                        <l>Born of the same sole womb in the same hour</l>
                        <l>With me? Did we not love each other? And</l>
                        <l>In multiplying our being multiply</l>
                        <l>Things which will love each other as we love</l>
                        <l>Them . . . ? (I.ii.367-72)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Incest here is not merely natural but logical.</p>
               <p>In addition, <title level="m">Cain</title> portrays the incestuous love of a sister as the prop that outlasts all others. Exiled from the
          Garden of Eden, separated from his family and the life he has known, Cain goes forth hand in hand with Adah, who will join him both in
          sorrow and in peopling the world: "Now, Cain! I will divide thy burden with thee . . . Lead! thou shalt be my God, and may our God / Be
          thine! Now let us carry forth our children" (III.i.551-5). Stansbury writes that Byron "describes the product of incest," Adah and Cain's
          son Enoch, "as a means of strengthening the family bond," but Byron also shows sibling incest itself as a means of strengthening that bond
          (25). Cain's mother, Eve, calls down "the eternal Serpent's curse" on him for killing Abel (III.i.403); his father banishes him
          (III.i.444-5). Only the sister who is also his wife cleaves to him. Byron even goes so far as to transfer into Adah’s mouth the plea for
          mercy that Cain makes in the Bible. The Bible passage, "And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment <emph>is</emph> greater than I can bear.
          Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
          vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <emph>that</emph> every one that findeth me shall slay me" (<title level="m">King James
            Bible </title>, Gen. 4.13-14), becomes in Byron’s play:<quote>

                  </quote> Allowing one character to ventriloquize another is perhaps the clearest endorsement of their relationship that an author can
          offer.</p>
               <p>The deeper question raised by all this discreet and indiscreet support for incest is “Why?” Why produce works that extol incest as love and
          that extol that love as the greatest support in life? Why hint at, make jokes about, and eventually openly approve sibling incest, when it
          would be much easier, safer, and more generous to the sister you say you love to keep quiet about having participated in that act?</p>
               <p>The answer is both simple and complex, grounded in both Byron's psyche and his ethic. First, Byron liked being seen to be bad. He wanted
          and expected <title level="m">Manfred</title> to cause some sort of scandal. In a surely unique combination of (hopefully) unconscious
          appropriateness and irony, he wrote to Augusta Leigh in March of 1818 asking if the publication of the drama had caused "a pucker" (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:466) Hints of incest more than ensured that pucker.</p>
               <p>Second, there is the effect of distance. Just as his time in Europe had made Byron less aware of the habits and mores of English society,
          it may be that it had made the society and people he knew there less real to him.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Byron's growing
            distance from English society, see Peter Manning, <title level="a">Don Juan and the Revisionary Self,</title>
                     <title level="m">Romantic Revisions</title>, eds. Robert Brinkley and Keith Hanley (Cambridge UP, 1992), pp. 210-26.</note> In 1819 he
          wrote ruefully to Leigh, "Three years absence—&amp; the total change of scene and habit make such a difference—that we have now nothing in
          common but our affections &amp; our relationship" (<title level="m">BLJ </title> VI:129). The loss of immediacy brought by distance would
          explain why he was not held back by the potential harm his revelations might cause to Leigh.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on
            Byron's egotism, see Lytton Strachey, <title level="a">Byron, Shelley, Keats and Lamb,</title>

               </p>
               <p>Finally, he may simply never have considered what harm he might do, or he simply might not have cared. Daniel McVeigh argues that Byron's "hints
          about their incest would have been unconscionable had he perceived a real threat against" Leigh (611). But Byron <emph>did</emph> perceive a
          threat, as evidenced by his remarks to Lady Melbourne, about "my . . . folly" and, later, of his "misery . . . on <emph>her</emph> account"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:69, Byron’s emphasis). Perhaps the potential damage to Leigh did not outweigh his own wishes. Empathy for
          individuals was never Byron's strong suit.</p>
               <p>It would do a disservice to Byron, however, to suggest that these were his only reasons for choosing to write what he did. He also had
          strong philosophical reasons for doing so. As Evan Gottlieb observes, Byron was highly rational, and predominantly interested in society,
          particularly in the structures and masks society imposed (99-100). Byron's personal experience would have given him empirical evidence that
          the incest prohibition was one of these imposed structures, not least because he began his liaison with his sister with a certain sense that
          what he was doing was wrong, but that sense quickly vanished. On August 11, 1813, when the affair was still in its early stages, he
          commented to Lady Melbourne that "I should have been glad of your advice how to untie two or three '<emph>Gordion</emph> knots' tied round
          me . . . some are rather closely twisted round my heart" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III:87-88, Byron’s emphasis), and on August 22, he
          wrote to Thomas Moore, "I am, at this moment, in a far more serious, and entirely new, scrape than any of the last twelve months—and that is
          saying a good deal” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III: 96). <note place="foot" resp="editors">A passage did follow this announcement, but
            Moore put asterisks in its place. This is not entirely unusual: in order to make Byron’s letters palatable to a wide audience (one that
            would include women), Moore replaced with asterisks numerous passages that he deemed unacceptable to such readers. Unfortunately for
            scholarship, Moore’s published versions of these letters are now the only ones that exist. Because of this, it is impossible for us to
            guess what Byron added here.</note> Yet he quickly sloughed off these worries. When Lady Melbourne wrote to him on April 25, 1814, "I
          could talk &amp; reason with you for two Hours, so many objections to urge, and after all, for what—<del rend="overstrike">for the sake of
            Augusta</del>—is it worth while!"<note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrase “for the sake of Augusta” is crossed out in the original
            document. It is impossible to know how Melbourne originally intended it to connect to what remains.</note> Byron responded firmly.<quote>
            Oh! but it is "worth while"—I can't tell you why— . . . however I will positively reform—you must however allow—that it is utterly
            impossible I can ever be half as well liked elsewhere—and I have been all my life trying to make some one love me—&amp; never got the sort
            that I preferred before. But positively she &amp; I will grow good—&amp; all that—&amp; so we are <emph>now</emph> and shall be these

                  </quote> This response is an ambivalent promise of reformation if ever there were one—note
          that dismissive "&amp; all that." But it is also an unambiguous endorsement of the behavior—consider that outburst, "Oh, but it is worth
          while!"</p>
               <p>Nor does Byron seem to have changed his mind over time. In April 1817, he wrote to Leigh from Switzerland, "I shall never find any one like
          you—nor you (vain as it may seem) like me. We are just formed to pass our lives together" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:96); three years
          later, after four years away from her, he wrote: "I always loved you better than any earthly existence, and I always shall unless I go mad"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:159). Manfred's moving pleas to the Phantom of Astarte,<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">

            the annihilation of all thoughts feelings or hopes—which have not more or less a reference to you. (<title level="m">BLJ</title>
              VI:129-30)</quote> In fact, Byron's connection to Leigh seems to have brought him the deepest, most frank, and longest-lasting love of his
          life (although what exactly "love" meant for Byron is difficult to say).</p>
               <p>When one considers Byron’s own experience, then, as well as his more general philosophical stance that any certainty and knowledge beyond
          the most basic are subjective, his skepticism about the incest prohibition seems more understandable. In response to Adah's astonishment
          that incest might be deemed a sin, <title level="m">Cain</title>'s Lucifer responds that it "cannot be a sin in you—whate'er / It may seem
          in those who may replace ye in / Mortality" (I.ii.375-7), yet later on he declares to Cain, "Evil and Good are things in their own essence"
          (II.ii.657). If both of these are true—and <title level="m">Cain </title>endorses both, and it appears to offer Byron's own opinions—then it
          stands to reason that the incest prohibition is not good "in its own essence," but rather is a taboo imposed for certain reasons. Thus, for
          Byron, it is open to question. Byron's relationship with Leigh, like Manfred's with Astarte, is a sexual connection between people of equal
          age, non-coercive, and apparently without issue.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Although Byron wrote to Lady Melbourne that Augusta "was
            not to blame...she was not aware of her own peril—till it was too late," in the same letter he refers to her "subsequent
              '<emph>abandon</emph>', and in an 1819 letter to Augusta makes it plain that he ceased their sexual connection when she requested it:
            "we may have been very wrong—but I repent of nothing except that cursed marriage—&amp; your refusing to continue to love me as you have
            loved me" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:110; <title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:129). As for children, at one point Byron was concerned
            that Augusta was pregnant by him and might give birth to a damaged baby, but that concern vanished with the birth; "it [the baby] is not
            an ape," he wrote to Lady Melbourne (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:104). In fact, the Byrons had already practised a more acceptable
            form of interbreeding that nonetheless led to less obvious damage: their habit of marrying their cousins ensured replication of a mania
            and manic depression that haunted the family.</note> In and of itself, free from social constructs and impositions, it would cause no
          wider damage. Adah's lines to Lucifer, pre-dating socialization, support this: what can be wrong with a love that springs from and only
          produces more love?</p>
               <p>Such reasoning is understandably difficult for audiences, since Byron's vision assumes a sexual world free of coercion and of what one might argue is an instinctive repulsion. Yet Byron's deduction is based on a standard empirical model. Like any good Enlightenment scientist, he has done the experiment then drawn the conclusion based on concrete experience (his own), rather than on the abstraction and assumption that is conventional morality.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this way, Byron continues the alliance with David Hume that is a
            hallmark of his advancing career, for Hume argued that morality was originally a social construct rooted in the practical advantages it
            brought to those who practiced it. Here one might also consider Claude Levi-Strauss's theory of incest and exogamy in <title level="m">The
              Elementary Structures of Kinship</title> (Beacon, 1969). On the other hand, in his <title level="m">Treatise</title> Hume warns against
          the kind of inductive reasoning Byron uses.</note> The flaw in his conclusion, however, is that he reasons inductively, from particulars (himself) to generalities (the majority of people), assuming that his general readership feels, or could feel, as he does. On the other hand, <title level="m">Cain</title> shows that part of what underlies Byron's view on incest is a belief that the generality labor under morals that have been impressed on them. This, too, has validity: both the Romantics and
          contemporary scholars wrestle with the question of the degree to which morals are innate and the degree to which they are imposed. Byron's
          thinking here, then, engages with that of his contemporaries, and with our own questioning.</p>
               <p>It takes a deeply unusual man to put empiricism before morality—most people do the reverse. But Byron was, and remains, deeply unusual.
          Moreover, the gift of his uniqueness is that it offers scholars many layers of thought to unfold. Nowhere does this complexity seem more
          true than in the case of his thinking about incest. The topic features even more frequently in Byron's writing than it does in Romantic
          texts generally,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Alan Richardson has shown that incest featured heavily in Romantic writing. See
            Richardson, <title level="a">Rethinking Romantic Incest: Human Universals, Literary Representation, and the Biology of Mind, </title>
                     <title level="j">New Literary History</title>, vol. 31 (Summer, 2000), pp. 553-572.</note> and, in virtually every work in which it
          appears, it is portrayed positively, or at least not negatively: <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>, <title level="m">Parisina</title>, <title level="m">Epistle to Augusta</title>, <title level="m">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</title> III, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, <title level="m">Cain</title>. Both this repetition and this portrayal suggest that for Byron incest is the expression
          of something central to his understanding of how the world should be. It is up to us to discover what that something is. Some twenty years
          ago, D. L. MacDonald suggested that examination of Byron's incest and its use in his works might yield fruitful results (37). That fruit
          remains ripe for the plucking.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">As Manfred glimpses “the last infirmity of evil” from his
                    position on the Jungfrau, he confronts a post-moral order dependent on a
                    particular kind of relinquishment, the obverse of the forgiveness that
                    Shelley’s Prometheus attains at the outset of his play. He claims prematurely,
                    “I have ceased / To justify my deeds unto myself,” and his pursuit of such a
                    mental and moral state in fact determines the action of the remainder of the
                    play, just as his initial voiced desire for “forgetfulness” and “self-oblivion”
                    must be achieved. At this early point in the play, Manfred’s solitude is
                    “peopled with the furies,” just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tortured on his rock
                    by Jupiter’s “hounds of hell.” Both heroes have something to get
                    over: Prometheus, his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. Going (like
                    Nietzsche) beyond good and evil, Manfred represents an existential Romantic
                    heroism in sharp contrast to Shelley’s messianic version; his humor is the
                    golden laughter of a careless god.</p>

               <p>I want to begin with Manfred on the Jungfrau, one of the poem’s key moments of
                    reckoning in which Byron’s hero struggles to apprehend the trajectory of his own
                    fall and end, literally and figuratively. Contemplating a leap from the
                    precipice to his death on the rocks below, he also meditates Satanically on the
                    vector of his moral degeneration and the death-in-life that it has entailed:
                            <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>There is a power upon me which withholds,</l>
                        <l>And makes it my fatality to live;</l>
                        <l>If it be life to wear within myself</l>
                        <l>This barrenness of spirit, and to be</l>

                        <l>To justify my deeds unto myself—</l>
                        <l>The last infirmity of evil. (I.ii.23-9)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> This essay amounts essentially to an extended footnote to
                  those lines—and particularly to those final clauses: “for I have ceased to
                    justify my deeds unto myself—the last infirmity of evil.” I hope to expose
                    some unresolved energies or faultlines in this passage that divide the moral
                    vision of the play. As the driving action throughout, Manfred pursues a certain
                    kind of cessation or relinquishment, the dark twin or obverse of the repentance
                    and recalled curse that determines Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>. Manfred tells the Witch of the Alps that his solitude is
                    “peopled with the Furies” (I.ii.131), just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tormented
                    on his rock by Jupiter’s “tempest-walking hounds,” who show him visions of his
                    own terrors (<title level="m">Promtheus Unbound</title> I.331). That is, both
                    heroes are tortured by furies that are also interior anxieties and fears (one
                    might say that the various scenes of supernatural aggression in both works are
                    essentially records of panic attacks). Both heroes have something to get over:
                    Prometheus, his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. <title level="m">Manfred</title> the play offers a mordant, Byronic version of the thesis
                    that Shelley will also advance in his philosophical psychodrama: you become a
                    demi-god by giving things up. In relinquishing his anger, Shelley’s hero
                    regenerates the cosmos and also makes himself oddly irrelevant: his
                    Puff-the-Magic-Dragon-like retreat to a cave where he will sit with Asia “as the
                    world ebbs and flows” (III.iii.24) marks both his ascension and retreat into
                    pair-bonded solipsism. Manfred’s quest is more ostentatiously self-centered, and
                    yet he pursues a form of emptying out that might negate the self entirely.
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a dead reckoning of the negative
                    way.</p>
               <p>So, to begin: how do we gloss these lines? The interpretive problem starts with
                    the quadruple negative, further destabilized by one of Byron’s ambiguous dashes:
                    “I have <emph>ceased</emph> / To justify my deeds unto myself— / The <emph>last
                        infirmity</emph> of <emph>evil</emph>.” Two primary questions arise. First,
                    is it the <emph>justification</emph> of one’s ill deeds, or the
                        <emph>cessation</emph> of that justification, that Byron intends as “the
                    last infirmity of evil”? The dash makes it possible for the final phrase to
                    govern either the infinitive (“To justify my deeds unto myself”) or the entire
                    preceding clause (“<emph>I have ceased</emph> to justify my deeds unto myself”).
                    Second, by “the last infirmity of evil,” does Byron mean the <emph>ultimate
                        stage </emph>of evil, or the <emph>last remaining flaw</emph> in evil’s
                    otherwise-perfect constitution? </p>
               <p>Maybe Milton can help. Byron’s “last infirmity” phrasing adapts a passage from
                    “Lycidas”: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>
                           <emph>Fame</emph> is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise</l>
                        <l>(That last infirmity of Noble mind)</l>
                        <l>To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes. (70-3)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> For Milton, “last infirmity” means the final remaining
                    weakness after all other errors have been purged. “Fame is the spur,” but it
                    also remains a recognizable flaw in a “Noble mind” that should be above concerns
                    for applause and praise. Moreover, Milton himself is here adapting a line from
                    Tacitus’s <title level="m">Histories</title> (IV.6): “<foreign xml:lang="la">etiam sapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur</foreign> (the desire
                    for glory is the last thing relinquished, even by wise men). So, as Byron
                    inherited the phrase, “last infirmity” meant the final weakness to be overcome
                    or shed, the longest-lived flaw. But “last infirmity of evil” complicates the
                    question—since evil itself can be thought of as infirmity, and thus the “last
                    infirmity” would be in fact the crowning weakness, the consummate infirmity, the
                    final summit or stage of descent into pure evil.</p>
               <p>We are left with two options so far: whatever the phrase “the last infirmity of
                    evil” modifies, that thing is either the last grace, the final scrap of goodness
                    that mitigates evil (a “last infirmity” in the mode of Milton and Tacitus),
                        <emph>or</emph> the last step on the ladder of degeneracy, the ultimate
                    state of sin. So, what does the phrase modify? Well, again we have two primary
                    opposing choices: either the claim “I have <emph>ceased</emph> to justify my
                    deeds unto myself” or the infinitive “to justify my deeds unto myself”—that
                    is, either self-justification or the cessation of it. These oppositions, then,
                    ultimately resolve into two primary interpretive choices, once you cancel out
                    the positives and negatives: self-justification is either the worst thing or the
                    last hope in the moral vision of Byron’s play.</p>
               <p>Jerome McGann has indicated that he sees <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a
                    critique of hypocrisies and an exposure of self-deceptions. He writes in <title level="m">Byron and Romanticism</title>: “We are sinners who want to cover
                    our sins, to mitigate their depth. This desire is precisely ‘the last infirmity
                    of evil’ that Byron wrote his play to engage” (92). In this view,
                    self-justification arises from a guilty conscience, and manifests itself in a
                    dangerous sense of righteousness. Plenty of evidence suggests that this was
                    Byron’s view, particularly around the time of the composition of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, when he was angry at Lady Byron and her allies
                    and raging over the hypocrisies of English society. The “Incantation” from
                        <title level="m">Manfred </title>is precisely an
                    “In-<emph>cant</emph>-tation,” a curse on cant and an excoriation of the “false
                    tears,” “serpent smile,” “unfathomed gulfs of guile,” and the “shut soul’s
                    hypocrisy” that were at once Annabella’s, her maid Mary Jane Clermont’s, and
                    Byron’s own—not to mention those of Castlereagh and Romilly, whom he hated
                    (I.i.201-71). Those who justify their deeds unto themselves adopt an essentially
                    Satanic moral posture, reversing the polarities of good and evil—“Evil be thou
                    my Good” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> IV.110)—something like James
                    Hogg’s <title level="m">Justified Sinner</title>, who is far more dangerous, far
                    more evil, because of his sense of righteousness. Robespierre and the Terror
                    stand somewhere in the near distance. As Alan Liu writes of the French
                    Revolution, <quote>Thus where the plot of the Revolutionary tragedy might have
                        remained the angry sentence, “war demands sacrifice,” Justice at last
                        legitimized demand to make the sentence read, with an assurance and dignity
                        so supernal that we might well think of the angel-interpreter comforting
                        Hagar: “war <emph>justifies</emph> sacrifice.” (159)</quote> In other words,
                    to justify evil is to weaponize it, to make it active as not only necessary, but
                    “good.” In such a view, to cease in this self-righteous activity and admit one’s
                    hypocrisies would be a prelude to confession: self-justification becomes the
                    worst stage of evil, while its cessation is the first step and the last grace
                    that might lead to redemption.</p>
               <p>The problem with this reading, of course, is that Manfred hardly appears redeemed
                    on the Jungfrau. Quite the contrary, he feels a “barrenness of spirit” as if he
                    has become his “own soul’s sepulchre” (I.ii.26-7). The general thrust of the
                    passage suggests a state of dejection and acedia, as if Manfred has yielded up
                    moral questions in despair. He has ceased to justify his deeds, ceased to
                    provide morally or ethically inflected accounts of his actions, even to himself,
                    and thus attained the summit of evil, having given in to the “last infirmity” in
                    “this long disease my life,”—to allude to the title of McGann’s keynote
                    address, and to Pope (Pope, “Epistle” 132). In such a state, Manfred hears no voice of
                    conscience, not even a perjured one: he just gives up and does what he 
                    wants—except he only wants what he can’t have: forgetfulness, oblivion, forgiveness,
                    Astarte. In this view, self-justification is the last grace, and its abandonment
                    signifies a descent into the slough of sin’s infirmity. Yet Manfred still
                    glimpses evil from where he stands: he has not yet moved to a place where “evil”
                    as such ceases to exist—his conscience is not totally gone. Making this
                    statement, he voices a judgment on himself, meaning he has not stepped beyond
                    moral calculation, even though he finds himself on the dizzy brink of complete
                    amorality. He still wants to forget, which means he still remembers; and he will
                    soon plead Astarte for forgiveness, which means he still feels guilt and
                    remorse. It’s not over yet: on the Jungfrau, Manfred is not yet beyond good and
                    evil.</p>
               <p> In his opening soliloquy, Manfred asserts a post-mortal perspective, claiming
                    that <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rendition="#indent3">Good—or evil—life—</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> In this comprehensive devaluation of “all I see in other
                    beings”—good, evil, life, powers, passions—and of his own feelings for
                    earthly things—dread, fear, hopes, wishes, and love—Manfred asserts a cold
                    impermeability to human existence. But there are two things he has not
                    renounced: nature and himself—or, more accurately, the beauty of the external
                    world and his own tormented conscience. Getting over these things will occupy
                    him for the rest of the play. We observe a series of encounters with natural
                    scenes—from the Jungfrau, to the personified Witch of the Alps, to his
                    farewell to the sun, and finally, to his address to the moon shining on the
                    mountains—all of which involve varying degrees of longing and admiration. He
                    says on the Jungfrau, “Beautiful! how beautiful is all this visible world,” but
                    he rejects the Witch of the Alps whose beauty might have redeemed him in a
                    Wordsworthian vein, and he concludes his thoughts on the Coliseum remembering
                    how the moonlight left <quote>

                  </quote> The turn from nature (moonlight on the Alps) to memory
                    (moonlight on the Coliseum) and thence to “silent worship of . . . / The dead”
                    marks a transition away from external beauty to internal experience, in a
                    recognizably Byronic mode of transfiguration (III.iv.39-40).</p>
               <p> In admitting that other spirits rule his spirit, Manfred edges closer to the
                    final renunciation the drama requires. Despite the ostensible defiance and
                    willfulness of the last scene, he undergoes his final relinquishment:
                    essentially, he gets over himself. And his last gesture—to reach for the hand
                    of another human (either Manuel or the Abbot, depending on the version)—suggests
                    a last abandonment of his walled interior stronghold. Perhaps now
                    finally, truly giving up on self-justification, he moves past evil to another
                    order—and I am thinking here of Nemesis saying of Astarte, “She is not of our
                    order” (II.iv.115). In an entry on “applause” in <title level="m">The Gay
                        Science</title>, Nietzsche has occasion to quote the Tacitus passage on the
                    desire for glory: <quote>The thinker does not need applause or the clapping of
                        hands, provided he be sure of the clapping of his own hands: the latter,
                        however, he cannot do without. Are there men who could also do without this,
                        and in general without any kind of applause? I doubt it: and even as regards
                        the wisest, Tacitus, who is no calumniator of the wise, says: <foreign xml:lang="la">quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima
                            exuitur</foreign> -- that means with him: never. (sec. 330, p.
                        144)</quote> Here we glimpse the case of Manfred, beyond self-justification
                    and beyond Nietzsche’s limits, one who believes he can do without the clapping
                    even of his own hands: “I have ceased to justify my deeds unto myself,” even
                    though that renunciation is always the <foreign xml:lang="la">novissima
                        exuiter</foreign>, the last thing to go. To escape his self-imposed
                    torments, the bite of conscience, Manfred must also abandon his self-regard:
                    only then, as a kind of stoic empty vessel, can he achieve the calmness of his
                    passing. </p>
               <p>As I suggested at the outset of this talk, much of <title level="m">Manfred</title> might be understood as the record of a panic attack or
                    nervous breakdown, with the last lines as aftermath. The same thing happens to
                    Prometheus in the first act of Shelley’s drama: one of the Furies says to him,
                    “we will rend thee . . . nerve from nerve, working like fire within” (I.475-6)
                    before she and her sisters torment him with scenes of his worst fears and causes
                    for despair. To triumph over these attacks, Prometheus and Manfred both have to
                    let it go: the past, the struggle, the violently-defended self. For Manfred,
                    this means a move from the murky Gothic “witch-drama” he has been inhabiting
                    towards the high equipoise of classical tragedy. As the play progresses, Manfred
                    seems less of a Shakespearean and more of a Sophoclean or Senecan protagonist,
                    quoting the last words of Nero to the Abbot—“It is too late” (III.i.98)—and
                    thinking of the Roman Coliseum shortly before his death. 
                    <note place="foot" resp="author"> As McGann notes, Byron “applies Suetonius’
                        account of the death of Nero (<title level="m">Lives of the Caesars</title>,
                        VI. Chapter 49) to the suicide of Otho, Rome’s sixth emperor,” in Manfred’s
                        conversation with the Abbot (III.i). Manfred’s self-identification with the
                        stoic suicide of a noble Roman indicates an affinity with Classical tragic
                        heroism. His famous meditation on the Roman Coliseum occurs at the beginning
                        of Act III, scene four.</note> His final words, “Tis not so difficult to
                    die” (III.iv.151), strike a distinctly classical note, the culmination of this
                    trend. In partial confirmation, a contemporary reader of <title level="m">Manfred</title> made marginal pencil notes in Greek in an 1817 copy of the
                    second edition (Figure 1). The lines are from Sophocles’ <title level="m">Ajax</title>, which our reader heard echoed in Manfred’s farewell address
                    to the sun in Act III, scene two: <quote>

                    set in glory. Fare thee well! / I ne'er shall see thee more” (III.ii.23-5).
                    Taking his leave of nature and his place among the noble minds of classical
                    antiquity, giving into or finally shedding his last infirmities, Manfred becomes
                    a hero by losing himself, for good…and evil.</p>

                  </title> examines the
                    ways in which one aspect of Byron’s manuscripts has been translated by his
                    editors. The dash is one of the most distinctive and controversial features of
                    Byron’s writing and is the vehicle for the silent part of his voice. Like many
                    other editors, I think that accidentals can be substantive. In this paper, I
                    look at the cultural associations of the dash, its translation from manuscript
                    into print in Byron’s particular case, and the different versions of 
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> that come into sight (and hearing) if 
                we use Byron’s manuscripts as a musical score.</p>

               <p>In the opening scene of the play, Manfred tells the
                    spirits to appear “in your accustom’d forms” (I.i.180).<note place="foot" resp="author">I am grateful
                            to David Fairer, Alice Levine, and Susan Wolfson for their perceptive
                            comments on the paper and to Helen Symington for her invaluable
                            assistance in making images from Byron’s manuscripts in the NLS. For
                            obvious reasons, MLA-style formatting of quotations is not helpful when
                            discussing Byron’s open punctuation and I have departed from it where
                            necessary when quoting from Byron’s manuscripts.</note>
                In response, they ask him to “choose a form –” and
                    Manfred replies: “I have no choice” (I.i.183-4). This is not only an expression
                    of doomed fatefulness (because the shape can only be Astarte), but also a
                    world-weary “I don’t care” or, as my teenage son would say, just before he gets
                    grounded, “I don’t give ––.”
            </p>
               <p>Manfred’s “I have no choice” is a kind of textual shrug – one which Byron redeploys in the fair copy of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title> Canto II, stanza 151, when he offers alternative metaphors to his publisher. As shown below, he writes in the margin of the manuscript, “Take of the variations what is thought best –– I have no choice.”

               <p>This paper examines the expressive mark of punctuation that leads to “I have no choice”—the long dash (reproduced by Byron’s printers and in this paper as a double “em” dash “–”), which has a distinctive place in 
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> and Byron’s writing as a whole. Like the “em” dash, the long or double “em” dash is both a mark of punctuation and (in Byron’s case) a refusal to punctuate. Its ambivalence heightens our awareness of the reader as a co-producer of meaning and as one of the many who are coerced by Manfred’s (and Byron’s) assertions of authority. The long dash, therefore, encapsulates many of puzzles about the interpretive freedom of Byron’s readers, his editors and, indeed, his actors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> One of the
                            most searching investigations I have found of the role of the dash in
                            the reading experience is the discussion of Laurence Sterne’s 
                    <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title> in Hunter 41-69. I discovered
                            this essay through Warren Oakley’s work after the <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                    Symposium in April 2017, but Hunter’s summary of the
                            work of the dash anticipates my sense that Byron’s dashes provide a
                            musical “score” for the reader: “Its quantitative guide to pause,
                            rhythm, and silence and its indication of shifts of speaker, changes of
                            direction, or modifications in tone provide for readers a score that the
                            voice can perform by giving the eye a visual diagram of structural
                            transitions” (49).</note>
                In reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> we assume all three of these roles and none of them.</p>
               <p>Byron is not alone in the Romantic period in his
                    promiscuous use of dashes: the manuscripts of P.B. Shelley and Jane Austen also
                    flicker and pulse with dashing energy, but Byron’s editors seem to have allowed
                    a higher proportion of his manuscript dashes to appear in printed form (William
                    Gifford, we remember, edited works by both Byron and Austen). In published form,
                    Byron’s dashes were still controversial. The <title level="m">British
                        Critic</title>’s review of <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>
                remonstrated about the prolixity of dashes in January 1814:
                <quote>
            We must protest against the effect of dashes, which occur,
                    without any reason whatsoever, sometimes twice or thrice in one line, and never
                    less than a dozen times in a page. (50)</quote>
            The same reviewer suspected that dashes were introduced “to give spirit to what was previously flat 
            and a mysterious meaning to what was before unintelligible.” Encountering the same device in 
                <title level="m">The Corsair</title>, the <title level="m">British Critic</title> 
                sounded increasingly impatient: “[w]e wish the Noble Lord
                    would omit these linear conjunctions” (March 1814, 288).</p>
               <p>The art of Byron’s dashes was shaped by print technology
                    as well as the diverse hands that worked over the manuscripts. When published by
                    John Murray, Byron’s poetry normally appeared on the page in Thomas Davison’s
                    elegant typeface in which the “em” dash almost joins the last letter of the 
                    preceding word to the first letter of the next, forming a sort of “linear conjunction.” 
                    Davison’s “em” dashes are usually seamless, but in the third stanza of the first edition 
                    of “When we two parted,” for example, which was printed by Bulmer &amp; Co, one can 
                    see how the “em” dash occasionally gets broken in the middle, forming a sort of typographical shudder.

                The visual frisson of the broken dash is uncommon, but <emph>affective</emph> dashing in 
                Byron’s poetry is not unusual. Byron’s dashes often seem to be the metrical equivalent 
                of the exclamations listed at the beginning of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> 
                Canto XV: “An ‘Oh!’ or ‘Ah!’ of joy or misery” (XV.1,] <title level="m">CPW</title> V:589), 
                or of non-verbal moments such as “a syncope, / Or a singultus” (XV.2), a sigh, an intake of 
                breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent of a pause, a rest, 
                or silence. In the midst of a densely literary work, dashes highlight the importance of the 
                non-verbal as a marker of intense emotion. As Janine Barchas points out, however, in relation 
                to the eighteenth-century novel, “[t]he overwhelming physicality of these moments may . . . draw 
                attention to themselves not as innocent approximations but as telltale evidence of the habits 
                of a master printer” (132). The translation of affect into luxurious print takes us to the 
                heart of the reviewers’ dilemma about the Byronic hero, and the uncertainty about whether 
                Byron’s readers were sharing the intimate secrets of a wounded soul or being taken for a ride 
                by a shrewd marketing operation.</p>
               <p>When the <title level="m">British Critic</title> praised Byron for omitting the 
                dashy “eye-traps” in <title level="m">Lara,</title> the phrase “eye-trap” 
                (from the 1750s, according to the <title level="m">OED</title>) was
                    used presumably as a variant of “clap-trap,” the extended pause that set apart
                    moments of high emotion in theatrical performances, designed to attract the
                    attention and applause of the audience.<note place="foot" resp="author">(October
                            1814) 409. Warren Oakley has investigated the significance of the “em”
                            dash in Laurence Sterne’s prose (also an influence on Byron), linking it
                            with the effects of the pauses in David Garrick’s acting. For further
                            details on the dash as melodrama, see Oakley 34-9.</note>
                On the page, Byron’s promiscuous “em” dashing resembles
                    the visual appearance of the Shakespeare plays David Garrick prepared for the
                    Drury Lane Threatre. Garrick used a dash to signal where an actor should pause
                    for effect so that in his published adaptations, as Warren Oakley has shown,
                    “[t]ypography indicates the location of each dramatic caesura, but is silent
                    about the nature of the action filling the expressive pause … prompting the
                    imagination of the reader” (34). The similarly hyperventilated appearance of 
                    the page in Byron’s Turkish Tales represents a test for the reader which is 
                    taken a stage further by the appearance of a still more elongated dash in the 
                    first edition of <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (as shown in figure 3).
                <note place="foot" resp="author">In relation to <title level="m">The Corsair</title> 
                    Matthew Bevis points out that Leigh Hunt captures the “air between hesitation 
                    and hurry” in Byron’s voice, which Bevis sees embodied in a dashing 
                    rhythm: “The typographical dash . . . both speeds up and slows down the narrative” (58).</note>

                The mark after “Waits but my chief” is Davison’s double “em” dash. It is placed 
                here to mark dramatic interruption, and is used for similar arresting effect in 
                the prose fragment attached to <title level="m">Mazeppa</title>, and for coy innuendo in
                <title level="m">Beppo</title>: “For my part, now, I ne’er could understand / 
                Why naughty women –– but I won’t discuss / A thing which is a scandal to the land” 
                (stanza 68; [“em” dash in <title level="m">CPW</title> IV:150, but restored to 
                double “em” in <title level="m">The Major Works</title> 333]). In the Garland facsimile 
                of the fair copy of <title level="m">Beppo</title>, one
                    can see how Byron’s manuscript dash after “naughty Women” is at least twice the
                    length of the dash after “For my part now,” suggesting that Byron intended a

                    “naughty Women” and what they do. The relative length of dashes within and
                    between manuscripts is not always as easy to decipher, however, and, as with all
                    his punctuation, Byron relied on his editors to translate manuscript into

                    recently in the John Murray Archive at 50 Albemarle Street, London), readers 
                    can still make out the editorial hand that determined the length of the 
                    dashes (see figures 4 and 5).

                    The pencil of Gifford had the authority to cancel Byron’s
                    own ink dashes and to adjust the pauses and, therefore, the pace of the
                    poem.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Gifford’s significant role in the production of Byron’s poems means that
                            the textual situation of Byron’s dashes is not the same as that outlined
                            for Sterne by Hunter where “The ubiquity of the dash insistently calls
                            attention to the manipulating hand of the author behind the printer: for
                            all the freedom Sterne pretends to give individual readers, the firm,
                            set-in-print authority of the text remains inflexible and controls
                            readers, getting them up to speed or slowing them down as he wants”
                            (49).</note>
                Gifford’s dashing almost always has a graphic basis in Byron’s manuscripts (in 
                that there is nearly always a dash in the immediate vicinity), but Gifford’s 
                usual role is to reduce the frequency of the Byronic dash and to turn it into 
                other marks such as a comma or (especially) a colon.  Like the poem’s infamous 
                asterisks, the “2 ems” long dash in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (––) signals 
                    the unsayable; but whereas a row of
                    asterisks shows where authorial content has been excised retrospectively by the
                    editor or publisher to avoid obscenity or legal prosecution, the long dash
                    suggests that a speaker <emph>nearly</emph> said something, but was then 
                    stopped or thought better of it: <emph>aposiopesis</emph>—the mark of knowing 
                    self-censorship. The long dash (––) is also a mark of complicity with the 
                    reader who is usually able to imagine what would have come next, as in Juan 
                    and Julia’s first sexual act: “And then –– God knows what next – I can’t go 
                    on; / I’m almost sorry that I e’er begun” (I. 115); or the reference to Donna 
                    Inez / Lady Byron: “His lady-mother, mathematical, / A –– never mind” (II.3); 
                    or, perhaps something less readily imaginable, “And horrid was the contrast to 
                    the view ––” (V.38), a more meditative pause as the narrator of <title level="m">Don
                        Juan</title> contemplates the body of the assassinated military commandant 
                    in Ravenna.</p>
               <p>Murray’s printer made a distinction between the one “em” dash (–) and the “2 ems” 
                long dash (––). In the Clarendon <title level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title> (1980-93), 
                however, some of these long dashes (including all the long dashes in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> in the corrected reprinting of 1992) were standardised 
                to “em” dashes, and it was not until <title level="m">The Major Works</title>
                that they made a reappearance. In the meantime, the new Penguin editions of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and Byron’s <title level="m">Selected Poems</title>
                by Peter Manning and Susan Wolfson retained long dashes from the earlier Murray and 
                Hunt editions. Viewed in the Penguin typeface, however, the difference between “em” (–) 
                and double “em” (––) dashes seems to me slightly more subtle than in the Oxford 
                texts (possibly because there is more space around the dash?). Since most students who 
                want an authoritative text of <title level="m">Manfred</title> will be directed to use 
                the Clarendon <title level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title> Volume IV as the 
                current standard edition, it is helpful to ask what (if anything) is lost when we 
                <emph>don’t</emph> see the long dashes and what are we meant to do with them when 
                we do. I’ll begin with the dashes that we do not see in the <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                of <title level="m">CPW</title> IV because of OUP’s tidiness and I’ll move on to the 
                ones that were not in the <title level="m">Manfred</title> of 1817 because of 
                Gifford’s tidiness.</p>
               <p>The key editorial difficulty about retaining Byron’s dashes was summed up by 
                Gifford [writing of <title level="m">The Corsair</title>]:
                    “Lord B. uses dashes for commas – this gives the work a very singular
                    appearance, &amp; in some places, mars the sense” (Nicholson,
                <title level="m">Letters</title> 70n). Byron, like Shelley, tends to use dashes 
                in place of other punctuation and sometimes, at least in his rough drafts, as 
                vital contact between pen and page as he reaches for the word that will come next.
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> In email
                            correspondence after the <title level="m">Manfred</title> Symposium, Alice
                            Levine made the suggestive point that the greater number of dashes in
                            Byron’s drafts as opposed to fair copies indicates that the dash might
                            be used “like the way people use ‘like’ to fill a silence rather than a
                            deliberate or even semi-deliberate punctuation.”</note>
                Byron trusted his editors to supply regular punctuation for him, but unlike the 
                normal “em” dash, one feels that the long double “em” dash never really signifies 
                a comma. Although in some respects it stands alone, the long dash shares the paradoxical 
                and musical nature of Byron’s other dashes and extra-punctuational markings.  The long 
                dash is a horizontal (in print) or slanting (in some manuscripts) line that can signal 
                opposing things: a fragmentary, uncertain, but logically continuous progression of thought 
                or a termination, a change of logical direction, a <foreign xml:lang="it">pausa</foreign>
                or pivot.</p>
               <p>The first thing to note is that Byron often changes the
                    position and length of his dashes between draft and fair copy. On the first
                    draft, Manfred asks the mountains of the Jungfrau, “Why are ye beautiful? – –”
                    with a couple of separate dashes after the question mark, but this becomes just
                    a question mark in the fair copy and the first edition of 1817 (Levine and
                    McGann 45).</p>
               <p>The second thing to notice is that (as in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>)
                    some of the long dashes (––) are inserted by the editor (Gifford again), and do
                    not exist in the MSS at all. When Manfred sees the beautiful form at the end of
                    the first scene:
            <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Oh God! if it be thus, and <emph>thou</emph>
                        </l>
                        <l>Art not a madness and a mockery,</l>
                        <l>I yet might be most happy. – I will clasp thee,</l>
                        <l>And we again will be –– (I.i.188-91, “em” dashes in <title level="m">CPW</title>),</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                The agonised emphasis on “<emph>thou</emph>” and the long dash
                    after “we again will be” are not present in the fair copy but were added when
                    the fair copy was set up in type in 1817 (16).</p>
               <p>The third thing to bear in mind is that long dashes are
                    shared between most of the characters and are not characteristic of Manfred
                    alone. When Peter Graham perceptively remarks that Manfred’s dashes supply the
                    place of “dark unvoiced thoughts,” this is true in some cases, but not in all of
                    them, and it does not extend to the other characters such as the Chamois Hunter
                    (53). In the draft manuscript, when Manfred attempts to dismiss the Chamois
                    Hunter with “I am not of thine order,” the man retorts: “Thanks to 
                    Heaven – / I would not be of thine –  for the free fame / Of William Tell; ––” 
                    and the long dash here makes the exchange much more like the playful 
                    abruptness of dialogue in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> 
                (reminding us of the comic and conversational use of the dash in Sterne’s novels 
                and in eighteenth-century stage comedy) (Levine and McGann 57). The cheeky long dash 
                for the Chamois Hunter was not retained in Byron’s fair copy, nor in Murray’s first 
                edition, but its presence on the first draft might be seen as a residual trace of the 
                experimental serio-comic <title level="m">Manfred</title> which John Wright and 
                Jerome McGann remind us was there from the start.<note place="foot" resp="author">The rejected
                            (comic) third act was first published by John Wright in footnotes to the
                            17-volume 1832-33 edition. As early as 1817, however, reviewers were
                            suspicious about the hybrid tone and form of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. 
                    The <title level="m">British Critic</title> described <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                    as a “nondescript” and an “Olla Podrida” – both terms which Byron associates with 
                    the style of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>; see <title level="m">British Critic</title> 
                    (July 1817) 47 and McGann 181-99.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the long dashes that Gifford allowed into the 1817 edition are performative 
                or gestural, telling us that in the midst of his poem, as in the narration of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Byron (and his editor) were aware that the 
                characters needed stage time to do something, or textual time for readers to 
                <emph>imagine</emph> them doing something. It is significant that the agency 
                that propels these dashes often fails to summon or dismiss or assist the body 
                that is being invoked or cajoled repulsed, so that in the duration of the dash 
                there is often something of a struggle with materiality (or immateriality) that 
                might involve a certain flailing of arms. The questionable authority of speech acts 
                is evident in Manfred’s initial commands to the spirits: “–– Rise! appear!” and “– Rise! 
                appear! ––Appear!” (25), where the long dashes suggest something of an embarrassing pause 
                as Manfred initially fails to make anything rise or appear.<note place="foot" resp="author">Michael
                            Simpson glosses this failure as a more dignified dramatization of the
                            labour of discourse (131).</note>
                A more solid connection between words and action is
                    evinced when the Hunter hoists Manfred back from the cliffs with, “Away with me
                    –– I will not quit my hold” (25). The long dashes that articulate his
                    instructions as he leads Manfred down the mountain represent the offer of
                    physical assistance (perhaps initially resisted, but eventually accepted) and a
                    shared faltering progress downward. In the next act, the Witch of the Alps
                    dismisses Manfred’s apparent attachment to a mortal, his alleged clinging on to
                    “recreant mortality” with an “ ––Away!” (36) and, at the end of the poem, the
                    Abbot attempts to dismiss the fiend in the third act with “Avaunt! ––”, and an
                    equally vain “I do charge ye in the name ––” (72).</p>
               <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes enact Manfred’s dismissal of
                    the Wordsworthian figures, the Chamois Hunter and the Abbot: the Chamois Hunter,
                    speaking of “heavenly patience ––” is impatiently interrupted by Manfred with,
                    “Patience and patience! Hence – that word was made / For brutes of burthen, not
                    for birds of prey” (28). The Abbot, remonstrating with Manfred at the start of
                    Act III, is also cut off: “yet so young, / I still would ––” and: “Yet, hear me
                    still ––” (61); the Spirit who comes to claim Manfred in the last act tells him,
                    “thy many crimes / Have made thee ––” but Manfred intercepts the adjective with
                    “What are they to such as thee?” (74). Long dashes in such instances accentuate
                    Byron’s stichomythia, the insistent line breaks that interrupt the flow of the
                    blank verse and enforce a poetics of un-Wordsworthian rupture.
                <note place="foot" resp="author">Michael Simpson notes the importance of the 
                    competition for verbal space in stichomythia (131-3).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes are self-interruptions,
                    which increase tension about what is being withheld or concealed. When Manfred
                    speaks with the Witch of the Alps, he initiates a series of half-revelations
                    that begin with the detail of the exceptional “one who –– but more of her anon”
                    (33; 35). And the same secret is almost disclosed but then withheld in the most
                    famous broken line in the whole poetic drama when Manuel speaks to Herman of
                    “the only thing he seem’d to love, – / As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,
                    / The lady Astarte, his –– / Hush! Who comes here?” (66).</p>
               <p>These are all dramatic dashes which depend on conflict
                    between two voices (or in the last example, a change of interlocutor). In a
                    separate category are the more lyrical long dashes which create a pause after a
                    completed statement, allowing the last sound before the dash to reverberate.
                    There are lots of these in the manuscript, but only one survives into the 1817
                    first edition. It is when the spirits ask Manfred what he wants from them and he
                    says, “Forgetfulness ––” (see figure 6).

            This is not an instance of interruption, or self-interruption, or <emph>aposiopesis</emph>, 
                and the reader or speaker delivering the line has to decide for how long to pause. It

                extended by several minutes if actors heeded all Byron’s dashes as if they were 
                Beckett-like pauses. If we use the manuscript as a dramatical-musical score (which 
                is how, I think, Byron wrote it), “Forgetfulness” is meant to echo round the auditorium 
                or the reader’s mind for a bit. The long dash here (my last example of the long dashes 
                that are present in 1817 but missing from <title level="m">CPW</title>) is a
                    way of augmenting the force of unforgettability, or the nature of consciousness
                    with a silence that is the echo of Manfred’s own thoughts.</p>
               <p>In order to recover some of the long dashes that Gifford filtered out of Byron’s 
                fair copy when he copy-edited the manuscript in 1817, I have arranged the following 
                illustrations to contrast the fair copy of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (now in the Murray archive in the National Library of Scotland) and the first edition. 
                I am using the “second issue” as described by T. J. Wise (I: 122) or the “Dramatis 
                Personae Variant” as described by F. L. Randolph (Randolph argues that this is more 
                likely to be the first issue) (64). First, Manfred’s soliloquy at I.i.21-4 (see figure 7).

            What was a succession of dashes after “sands” and “since”
                    in the first draft (Levine and McGann 27), and a heavy long dash after “hour” in
                    the fair copy has become just a full stop after “that all-nameless hour” in the
                    first edition. In both manuscripts, Manfred haltingly and hesitantly approaches
                    a fatal moment, a moment which becomes much more discreet and self-contained
                    after it passes through the hands of Gifford. The 1817 first edition version of
                    Manfred’s soliloquy is less uneven and more matter-of-fact, but in the fair copy
                    manuscript above one can see a darker stroke of erasure signalling a pause to
                    sound unfathomable agony.</p>
               <p>At II.ii.31-2, Manfred summons the Witch of the Alps:
                    “– to call thee thus, / And gaze on thee a moment” (see figure 8).

            The first draft uses three separate dashes after “a
                    moment” (Levine and McGann 63) and there is one long dash in the fair copy
                    (above); for the 1817 edition, Gifford again turns the long dash into a single
                    full stop. In the manuscripts, however, Byron seems to indicate that Manfred
                    should dwell on the beauty of the Witch for some time. This impression is
                    strengthened a little later in the fair copy when he says that he desires to
                    “look upon thy beauty – nothing further –” and after seeking refuge in the
                    mysteries of the earth, “I search no further. – – – –” (see figure 8). There
                    were two separate dashes after “no further” in the first draft (Levine and
                    McGann 64), growing to four separate dashes in the fair copy above. In the first
                    edition of 1817, everything is gathered into a terminal full stop (see figure
                    9).

           Even allowing for the fact that Byron often finishes the
                    last line of a manuscript page with multiple dashes as a sort of “PTO” to
                    himself, the manuscripts urge more of a pause than is audible in the
                    grammatically rationalized punctuation of 1817. Gifford’s removal of so many
                    dashes makes Manfred into a cooler, more composed, and more purposeful speaker
                    in the first edition than he is in the manuscripts, where the multiple breaks
                    and pauses in speech suggest a much more jagged melodramatic delivery.

               <p>The fair copy of Manfred’s exchange with Nemesis in Act
                    II, scene 4 is another heavily dashed section of manuscript dialogue, indicating
                    extreme emotional disturbance. To the question of Nemesis: “Whom wouldst thou
                    uncharnel?” Manfred answers in the fair copy, “One without a tomb. –
                    Call up – / Astarte. ––” (see figure 10).

                In the first edition, this exchange becomes positively
                    brisk, closed by Gifford’s neatly self-sufficient full stop after “Astarte.” The
                    appearance of the speech on the printed page of 1817 renders the necromancy as a
                    routine day’s work for Arimanes and Nemesis; whilst for Manfred, the summoning
                    of Astarte is terse rather than the more traumatic venture it appears to be in
                    manuscript.</p>
               <p>When Astarte appears, the stage directions for both
                    Manfred and Astarte are implied in Manfred’s speech (see figure 11).

            “She is silent,” we are told at II.iv.110, but when
                    Manfred’s thick heavy dash on the fair copy becomes a comma in the 1817 first
                    edition, what looks like unspeakable anguish in the manuscript is rendered as a
                    calm, potentially impassive observation of her silence. Through Gifford’s paring
                    and re-punctuating for the 1817 edition, the whole emotional temper of Manfred’s
                    speech becomes much more even and controlled whereas Byron’s manuscripts suggest
                    that (as usual) he was using dashes as a graphic means of drawing out and
                    intensifying affect.</p>
               <p>It would be misleading, however, to focus solely on dashes which carry the 
                affective freight of the unbearable or in Hunter’s elegant phrase “something 
                unspeakable and yet compellingly actual” (47). Dashes are used in the fair 
                copy of <title level="m">Manfred</title> for a wider range of effects, including 
                a sort of rapture—just as in the fair copy manuscript of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                X.3, dashes will carry the “glow” and “caper” cut by the poet’s “internal Spirit.” In
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> Act III, scene i, Byronic dashes signal 
                the boundlessness of mental travel. To the Abbot, Manfred recalls his youthful aspirations “to
                    rise / I knew not whither – it might be to fall;” and then Manfred/Byron
                    digresses to give us the lovely image of a Manfredian fall, which is actually an
                    aesthetic rise (a version of the rebound or recovery described by Clara Tuite in
                    the symposium):

            As figure 12 shows, the fair copy has longish dashes after “whither” and “fall” 
            and “mistook themselves,” and medium-sized dashes after “abyss” and “past” that 
            help to create a dawdling, meditative habit of mind (though one must be wary of 
            placing too much interpretive weight on what are very variably-sized markings). 
            The manuscript brackets in this passage encourage us to notice Manfred’s imagination 
            snagging on a detail of external beauty, which leads him to digress from visions of 
            himself and offer an aside on forms of natural plenitude and renewal. The dashes, 
            meanwhile, encourage that lingering with nature that occurs when Manfred describes 
            the Alps, or in his recollection of the Colosseum as a moon-softened necropolis.</p>
               <p>In one of his most discerning asides, Jerome McGann calls
                    the Alpine Journal “[o]ne of the great acts of English prose attention” (to what
                    extent was Byron acting, one wants to ask) (McGann 177). Sights and sounds are
                    recorded with a febrile, raw-nerved concentration for Augusta, linked by dashes
                    that suggest Byron’s headlong plunge into each experience as he attempts to
                    escape consciousness with an accumulation of sense impressions.

                  </figure>
            The manuscript page of the Alpine journal in figure 13 is a graphic illustration 
            of Byron’s attempt to describe the indescribable: “It is neither mist nor water 
            but a something between both ––.” The dash carries the affective force of the 
            liminal “something,” which is re-transcribed in Byron’s slow realization of the 
            lasting power of a formless form that has almost brought him to speechlessness: 
            “–– wonderful – &amp; indescribable. –– .” In the fair copy of
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, one can see the same <foreign xml:lang="it">pausa</foreign>, 
                the same pivotal seductions of the human mind by its own imaginings. This lagging,
                    internal re-play of beauty suspends the onward rush of dramatic time and
                    inevitability. Its backward-looking, valedictory effect is evident in my final
                    example of a longish dash that was edited out by Gifford see figure 14).

                In the fair copy of Act III, scene 2, Manfred’s soliloquy to the sunset 
                ending: “–– He is gone ––” becomes in 1817 “He is gone:” with Gifford’s 
                characteristic colon (Byron rarely uses colons in his manuscripts).  If 
                one treats the manuscript as theatrical script, the dashes suggest that 
                Manfred takes time to watch the sun disappear. In a stage performance, a 
                director might arrange a shadow to lengthen into total darkness by the time 
                Manfred reaches “gone.” A musical score might hold the final note, its echo 
                and the silence afterwards. Manfred, we know, “must watch” (I.i.2), and the 
                time he spends in “wanderings / And watchings” is important (III.iii.43-4). 
                As Michael O’Neill pointed out last year when the text was discussed in the 
                Summer of 1816 conference at Sheffield, one of the great paradoxes of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is that its hero keeps saying beauty means 
                nothing to him: “there is no form on earth / Hideous or beautiful to me,” 
                but his speeches are full of exquisitely shaped hymns to natural beauty 
                (I.i.184-5). Byron clearly was ravished by the Alpine scenery of 1816 
                which recurs throughout his poetry after the summer of 1816.

               The dashes around Manfred’s acts of attention partake of
                    what Ian Balfour notes as the “telegraphic notation” of the Alpine Journal (12),
                    or what Susan Wolfson refers to as the “lightning on the page” of dashes in
                <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> Canto III (765).</p>
               <p>Manfred’s tactile attentiveness (almost adhesiveness) to form finds 
                its echo in the very final scene where the Abbot attends the dying
                    Manfred. Manfred expires, of course, on a dash: “Old Man – ’tis not so difficult
                    to die. –” (Levine and McGann 130).<note place="foot" resp="author">In the fair 
                        copy there is also a dash after “die.”</note>
                Neither the dashes nor the rest of the line made it into
                    the first edition of 1817; and when the line was restored, the terminal dash was
                    cancelled and became a full stop. As he watches Manfred expire, the Abbot
                    reiterates Manfred’s words on the sinking sun: “He’s gone. – […] he is

            And then, as figure 15 above shows, we have Byron’s lovely signing off: 
            “End of act third – &amp; of this poem. – .  –” with a swirl that seems a more 
            emphatic version of the one under the journal entry of September 22, 1816 in 
            figure 13.</p>
               <p>In the post-production discussion, the director of the Red Bull production 
                of <title level="m">Manfred</title> spoke about the challenges of adapting 
                a poem lacking in causality for the stage. As a dramatic poem, Byron deliberately 
                juxtaposes causality with (forgive me) what we might call “pausality.” At 
                the micro-level of the dash and the macro-level of all those passages that 
                had to be cut for the performance (such as the Colosseum soliloquy), Manfred 
                steps back from decisive action to “linger yet with Nature” (III.iv.3). Poetically, 
                he fights against the constraint that is fate or dramatic time and his dashes signal 
                a determination to carve out form from poetic destiny so that “what ye take / Shall 
                be ta’en limb by limb” (III.iv.103-4); “limb” is followed by three dashes in the fair 
                copy. In the colder print of 1817, Manfred’s heroic resistance against the spirits of 
                conventional drama becomes just another full stop. But the pause implicit in those three 
                dashes help to make more sense of the spirit’s taunt: “Can it be that thou / Art thus in 
                love with life?” (III.iv.107-8).</p>
               <p>Manfred is not in love with life, but he is sensually and syntactically involved 
                with it; he is, we might say, attached to it. Byron’s hero has his own music, and 
                the dashes that punctuate his speech are often extra-metrical silent notes of 
                resistance that might seem indistinguishable from the terminal silence that ends 
                the poem. But these dashes are also cues for action; they are the echoes of the 
                last note but also the foot prints of the next move – a halting progress that drives 
                the poem forward. In order to see, hear and feel that complex music we might pay 
                more attention to the dashes in <title level="m">Manfred</title>.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">What this essay explores is the way in which the illustrations of Byron’s poetry, particularly images of his two
            heroines, <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s Astarte and <title level="m">The Giaour</title>'s Leila, reveal a great deal about the public
          response not so much to Byron’s poetry but rather to their own projected narratives and fantasies <emph>about</emph> Byron on to his poetry.
          Perhaps counter-intuitively, I will argue that it is by taking a careful look at the ways in which Byron’s heroines are illustrated that we
          are granted a window into the public view of the poet himself.</p>

               <p>Let me begin by quoting a well-known Byronic passage:<quote>
                     <lg style="stanza">
                        <l> . . . I rose,</l>
                        <l>Forgetful of our former woes;</l>
                        <l>And rushing from my couch, I dart,</l>
                        <l>And clasp her to my desperate heart;</l>
                        <l>I clasp—what is it that I clasp?</l>
                        <l>No breathing form within my grasp,</l>
                        <l>No heart that beats reply to mine,</l>
                        <l>. . . </l>
                        <l>And art thou, dearest, changed so much?</l>
                        <l>As meet my eye, yet mock my touch? (III.1287-92)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> While this passage is taken from Byron’s fragment tale, <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, written in 1813, the
          illustration I have provided above depicts a very different hero attempting to embrace his own lost love, the spirit of Astarte from Byron’s
          1817 dramatic poem, <title level="m">Manfred</title>. And yet, unless you knew something about Byron’s poetry, it would be difficult to
          distinguish between the poetic narrative of the Turkish Tale and the image I have shown you. The text appears to match the image very
          closely. Nor is this the only similarity between the two poems: critics and reviewers have long remarked on their shared indulgence in
          mysteries around unspoken and unspeakable crimes and representation of gothic action, made only darkly visible in <title level="m">The
            Giaour</title> through a multi-perspectival and fragmentary structure and in <title level="m">Manfred </title> by its echoing of what
          Byron referred to as Augusta’s “absurd, obscure hinting style of writing full of megrims and mysteries” (<title level="m">BLJ</title>
          V:231-2). They have also long been associated with obfuscation and scandal if not because of their poetic style then at least because of
          their shared plot details<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In John Wilson’s review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> for <title level="j">Blackwood’s Magazine</title> (June 1817), the critic, while fundamentally approving of the poem, is critical of the unnecessary
            confusion that dominates the plot. He observes that “it is difficult to comprehend distinctly the drift of the composition, and almost
            impossible to give anything like a direct account of it” (119). Similarly, the reviewer for the <title level="j">Critical Review</title>
            (July 1813) argues that, while on a second reading he was not as disturbed by the confusion at the heart of <title level="m">The
              Giaour</title>’s plot, he was annoyed by it at first. “It is possible, he says, “that possession of a key to the mystery that it
            involves, might obviate much of an objection to which we presume that it will by most readers be considered mainly liable, especially of
            such as are not satisfied unless everything be perfectly clear and intelligible to them on first perusal” (II.620).</note> —we might
          remember the Giaour’s insistence that he did not kill his lover (“Not mine the act, though mine the cause,” [1061]), and Manfred’s similar
          confession (“I loved her, and destroyed her . . . Not with my hand, but heart . . .” [II.ii.117-9]). Arguably, this was rather a moot
          distinction for the heroines in question.</p>
               <p>These strong textual resemblances, however, serve to highlight the very different manner in which these very works have been approached by
          the artists and illustrators of Byron’s poetry. Exploring some of the most widely circulated nineteenth-century illustrated editions reveals
          that the character of Leila is rarely represented, with artists preferring to focus on the vendetta between men—the Giaour and Hassan—which
          is the real “action” at the heart of the poem. One can choose from a wide array of images of these two testosterone-driven men, locked in a
          deadly, albeit vaguely libidinal, combat, while Leila appears very rarely. On the other hand, Leila’s spectral sister, Astarte, has a much
          more material presence in these printed texts and appears countless times in engravings or illustrations.</p>
               <p>What I would like to explore in this essay is the way in which the illustrations of these two heroines reveal a great deal about the public
          response not so much to Byron’s poetry, but rather to their own projected narratives and fantasies <emph>about</emph> Byron on to his
          poetry. Perhaps counter-intuitively, I will argue that by taking a careful look at the ways in which Byron’s heroines are illustrated, we
          are granted a window into the public view of the poet himself.</p>
               <p>To begin with the erasure of Leila, one must ask why poor Leila is left to languish in poetic oblivion while Astarte is so frequently
          represented. Given that their stories are so similar, why are not their visual fates?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an interesting
            reading of the erasure of Leila and the exploration of homoerotic desire in this poem, see Bari.</note> On one level the answer is
          probably pretty straightforward. The plot of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> is often read as political allegory, and Caroline Franklin
          reminds us that, while the character of Leila is in part based on a real woman “rescued” by Byron while on his travels, she is also strongly
          “compared to [her] native land of Greece” (38-40). Critics such as Jerome Christensen (93), and David Roessel (56), specifically associate
          her form with the image of the corpse-like Greece, the victim of Turkish oppression and violence,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jerome
            Christensen writes, “Love for Leila is like love for nature, or an unspoiled Greece” (93), while for David Roessel “[t]he use of the
            loaded word <emph>tyranny</emph>, which could be used almost as a synonym for Ottoman rule, links the personal freedom of Leila to the
            political freedom of Greece implied in the historical setting of the poem (sometime after 1770)” (56).</note> while Alan Richardson
          complicates this reading by drawing our attention instead to Leila’s identity as a Circassian Beauty—the quintessentially desirable woman in
          nineteenth-century terms (221). Even while playing a role in such political allegories, however, she stands in for a type (the Orientalized,
          Eastern beauty), rather than an individual woman.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richardson is quick to problematize the easy opposition
            between East and West that we are tempted to assume in these characters’ national associations. He makes a strong argument for Byron’s
            attempt to complicate this binary throughout <title level="m">The Giaour </title>, in part by having Leila described as a Circassian who
            embodies not only beauty but hybridity (221).</note> As such, it is possible to read Leila not as a woman or as a fully defined character,
          but rather as a marker in a political allegory: the symbol of a victimized and Orientalized beauty, the site of political turmoil and
          hybridity, or very specifically as “Greece, but living Greece no more! / So coldly sweet, so deadly fair” (<title level="m">Giaour</title>
          91-2). Certainly, the few images we have of her show her in a highly Orientalized dress, vaguely vapid in appearance and often staring into
          the middle distance (Figures 2 and 3). <figure>

          which serve as a mere pretext for the creation of exotic albums filled with lush images. In no way do these engravings serve as
          illustrations of the poems or their action, and what is notable about Leila’s image is that she could be represented by any young woman from
          the Peloponnese.</p>

               <p>Astarte, however, has a far more complex and sensational history. One reason for this is that she was based on a real woman and was
          repeatedly identified as a representation of Byron’s half-sister and lover, Augusta Leigh. As Peter Manning quite rightly observes, “In an
          understandable effort to circumvent the scandalmongering that befuddled earlier interpretations, criticism has tended lately to minimize the
          importance of incest in the drama” (77). Modern critics are wary of indulging in biographical readings of the play and even when read
          biographically, recent criticism has denied Augusta her role in the drama. Peter Cochran thus argues that “Astarte—all that <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers by way of heroine—is often taken, by those intent on creating sensation at all costs, to be a version of his
          half-sister Augusta; but I’d argue that in her remoteness and verbal economy Astarte is closer to Annabella” (<title level="m">Manfred</title> 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Annabella Milbanke and Byron were married on January 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi>
            1815. The marriage was a disaster and the couple separated shortly thereafter, with rumors of the poet’s incestuous relations with his
            half sister, Augusta, and acts of sodomy circulating around the case.</note> And yet, whatever modern criticism might think of Astarte’s
          identity or poetic function, Byron’s contemporaries were generally in agreement that Augusta was the model of Manfred’s criminal love.</p>
               <p>Having said this, I won’t rehearse the, indeed, sensational and often unpleasant details of the affair between Byron and Augusta, nor go
          over all the shocked references to it by the poem’s reviewers. To summarize briefly: when <title level="m">Manfred</title> was published in
          1817, shortly after Byron’s ignominious departure from England, London society was waiting for yet more scandal to feed the growing interest
          in the unfolding saga of his separation from Annabella. Few reviewers of this new poetic drama missed the fact that Astarte was described as
          the sister and the lover of this Byronic hero, and the commentaries on the poetic drama did little to quell the crescendoing gossip. <title level="j">
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">La Belle Assembleé</foreign>
                  </title>remarked rather coyly that “this drama is interesting, yet there are
          many domestic allusions, from which works of a dramatic nature should ever be free” (Reiman II:107). The <title level="j">European
            Magazine</title>, however, issued its own more damning and decidedly more pointed review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in August of
          1817, first summarizing the incest plot for its readers and then suggesting that this crime was the key to—if not Manfred’s—then at least
          the poet’s hidden meaning. Here, we are told, the “wretched brother more fully, though still darkly and ambiguously, alludes to the early
          circumstances of his life, (which) will more clearly enable readers to judge if we have made a correct guess at the elucidation of the noble
          poet’s story” (Reiman II:963). Such reviews seem mean spirited, but there is much to suggest that Byron was very aware of the brouhaha that
          he would create with <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication. He noted in a letter to Augusta written in March of 1818 that he is
          curious as to whether the publication of <title level="m">Manfred</title> has caused a “pucker” (qtd. in Lovelace 168). Augusta wrote back
          that she had been hurt both by the subject matter of the poem and by Byron’s apparent insensitivity to her plight, left behind as she was to
          face the Manfredian music on her own. “A propos of ‘puckers’ I thought there was unkindness which I did not expect, in doing what was but
          too sure to cause one—&amp; so—I said nothing—&amp; perhaps should not but for your questions” (qtd. in Lovelace 168). And a pucker there
          was. The Hon. Mrs. Villiers, an ally of Annabella Milbanke, wrote to the poet’s estranged wife that the <title level="j">Day and New
            Times</title> of June 1817 had released a review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in which “the allusions to Augusta are dreadfully
          clear. No avowal could be more complete. It is too barefaced for her friends to attempt to deny the allusion” (qtd. in Lovelace 166).</p>
               <p>So strong was the assumption that <title level="m">Manfred</title> represented Byron’s (as well as his tortured hero’s) confession of a
          secret sin that other reviewers also made explicit reference to it. The reviewer for the <title level="j">Theatrical Inquisitor</title>, for
          example, worries “we hope for the sake of manhood and morality, that the rumor is incorrect which has identified his inmost feelings with
          the subject before us” and we as readers are urged to “turn away from this book at this repulsive point” (Reiman V:2266-7). Indeed, many
          critics in either veiled or quite brazen terms make reference to <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a potential clue to the events leading
          up to the poet’s separation from his wife. Their greatest frustration, however, was that Byron’s absence from England made it impossible to
          see the effect that these accusations and condemnations had on him. Guilt could not be read on his countenance as one might the visage of
          any of his great “Conradian” heroes because he was well and truly hidden from society’s gaze. This was Byron’s great advantage and Augusta’s
          recurring tragedy. For, if Byron’s behavior could not be scrutinized for signs of moral depravity and guilt, then his partner-in-crime’s
          behavior could. It is for this reason that Augusta, left to the vigilant reforming zeal of Annabella and her circle, was rigidly policed and
          regimented so as to erase or obfuscate any possible outward signs of a criminal relationship to Byron. She was publicly “forgiven” and
          supported by Annabella, but only to ensure that she did not go to join her half-brother in Italy; her letters were rewritten by Annabella
          and her actions supervised so as to produce the most convincing image of innocence. In so doing, Augusta protected not only her own
          reputation, but Annabella’s as well. Augusta agonized over how to redeem her reputation after Byron’s departure, and when the spectral
          shadow of her past rose before her in the image of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s Astarte only a year later it was a considerable blow.
          What Augusta knew, and what Byron failed to acknowledge, was that it was not to the Byronic hero of <title level="m">Manfred </title>to
          which the public turned to decipher the truth of the poet’s incestuous relations, but to Astarte/Augusta. Augusta quite literally stood in
          for Astarte in the popular imagination of the day, as is made very clear by the infamous publication of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1869 <title level="m">Lady Byron Vindicated</title>. Stowe, freed from her promise of discretion to Annabella by her death, reveals to the world “the
          truth” about Augusta and Byron (236-7). A cartoon that appeared in <title level="j">Merryman’s Monthly</title> in October of 1869 makes the
          connection to <title level="m">Manfred</title> very clear, referencing as it does in its description, Stowe’s raising of Byron’s demonic
          spirit in this writer’s own version of the Manfredian “Incantation.” <figure>

                  </figure> As Jerome McGann alerts us, the Incantation was thought to refer back to its 1816 iteration as the fragment of a Witch’s Drama,
          commonly believed to be a sly swipe at Annabella.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As McGann observes, most readers would have understood
            Byron’s reference to the “Incantation” as “an unfinished Witch Drama, which was begun some years ago” as a vicious reference to “the
            period of my married life with Annabella Milbanke” (206).</note> Here, Manfred/Byron appears as a demonic spirit through Stowe’s
          conjuring. It came as no surprise, then, when Ralph Lovelace, Ada Byron’s son,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Ada Byron was the
            legitimate daughter of Byron and Annabella born on December 10<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> 1815, shortly before Byron’s self-exile in
            April the following year.</note> felt the need to publish his own 1906 defense of his grandmother under the title, <title level="m">Astarte: A Fragment of Truth.</title> As he observes in the purple prose for which the entire text is remarkable, “Astarte (Augusta) was
          haunted and ridden by a spectral Astarte vivified for a flash of time out of the eternal silences to prophesy judgment by the infernal gods
          upon Manfred” (<title level="m">Lovelace</title> 70). For Byron’s contemporaries and even for subsequent generations, <title level="m">Manfred</title> was a play that was first and foremost about deciphering Augusta, for it was only by reading and understanding her poetic
          incarnation, Astarte, that one could now hope to learn anything about the poet himself.</p>
               <p>With this in mind, what are we to make of the ways in which Astarte is depicted? One of the earliest images of Astarte appears in <title level="m">Finden’s Byron’s Beauties</title> in 1836. <figure>
                     <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image6Thumb.jpeg"
                              rend="inline"/>
                     <figDesc>Figure 6</figDesc>
                  </figure> Like the images of Leila we have already seen, the image of Astarte in <title level="m">Finden’s Byron’s Beauties</title> (Figure
          6) is taken out of its narrative context—even more so than in the illustrations of Leila who at least looked appropriately Turkish in dress.
            <title level="m">Finden’s</title> Astarte, however, is represented as a Greek goddess, perhaps gesturing to a Hellenized version of the
          Persian deity, Ishtar. In true Hellenic style, she sports carefully coiled hair, Chiton, and an arm bracelet. Innocent and demure, this
          Astarte seems an unlikely partner for Manfred, not to mention her being curiously dressed for a resident of the Alps. The text that
          accompanies the heroine’s image is noteworthy: Byron’s heroines, it is insisted, “are solitary symbols of loveliness which need no foil”
          (Finden vii). They are admirably adapted for isolated pictorial illustration, we are told, since their charm exists not in “the dramatic
          action in which they are engaged,” but “in their intensity of individual feeling” (Finden vii). The artist of this portrait of Astarte is
          careful to remove any possible hint of a context that might draw the reader’s attention back to the action of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and its scandalous associations in part because this album was produced specifically for young women and devotees of the
          poet. The illustration itself is accompanied by a long quotation from “Professor (John) Wilson,” a frequent contributor to <title level="j">Blackwood’s Magazine</title> where he served on the editorial board, often publishing under the alias “Christopher North.” Wilson, who
          was made professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh University in 1820, positions Astarte as “young, beautiful, innocent.” He does not deny
          her guilt but assures us that she has been “murdered—judged [and] pardoned” (qtd. in Finden vii). She was, Wilson insists, a soul cleansed
          of sin: “At last, she rises up before us in all the mortal silence of a ghost, and with fixed, glazed, and passionless eyes, revealing
          death, judgment, and eternity” (qtd. in Finden vii). What we find in her figure, then, is all passion spent. If there had been any guilt, we
          need not concern ourselves with it. Innocence and purity now reside in <emph>her</emph> looks and the implication is that, since a judgment
          has already been passed on Byron, the presumed instigator of the crime, it would be presumptuous of us to attempt a judgment of our own.
          Along these same lines, a production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was mounted in Covent Garden in 1834 for a total of 36
            performances.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Alfred Bunn, the stage manager of this production, introduced in the title role a young
            actor by the name of Henry Gaskell Denvil who performed <title level="m">Manfred</title>, in Frederick Burwick’s words, as “the
            incarnation of Byron” (80).</note> Augusta attended one of them and saw herself represented in angelic form, surrounded by spirits as she
          embarked on the salvation of her fictional brother. In this adaptation of the play, when Manfred is about to die, Astarte appears before him
          and cries out: “Manfred! Look up! I do forgive thee” (qtd. in Cochran, <title level="m">Theater</title> 175).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a detailed account of the various productions of <title level="m">Manfred</title> including the burlesque <title level="m">Man-Fred</title> in which the Count is transformed into a chimney sweep, see Tunbridge.</note> And so again, all is forgiven,
          heaven sought, judgment passed.</p>
               <p>In two slightly later illustrations, we see the act of judgment in process. In an 1838 illustration (Figure 7), Manfred reaches out to
          embrace Astarte, who, again looking like a Hellenic deity, arches away from his grasp in a gesture of modesty and evasion. <figure>

                  </figure> She is surrounded by a bright cloud or nimbus and her arms stretch up to the heavens. Manfred’s gesture, while clearly reaching
          out to the image, is as much one of adulation and reverence as desire. His sword points down to the ground in the shape of a cross and a
          skull lies in the corner as a <foreign xml:lang="la">memento mori</foreign>. The room he inhabits is in every other way, scrupulously
          academic, with open texts, a globe, and instruments. The second image (Figure 8), almost certainly crudely copied from the first (circa
          1854), represents a similar composition but a very different moral. <figure>

                  </figure> Astarte is now a voluptuous siren, her breasts fully exposed to her brother’s gaze beneath her diaphanous shroud. Manfred
          encircles the form in a gesture of passionate excitement, his robes rising with his sudden movement. His sword has morphed into a candelabra
          that symbolically burns, shall we say, rather brightly. The background has also undergone a tonal shift; it is now a sepulchral and gothic
          space, its décor given to skulls, crows, and snakes. Astarte, far from reaching up to heaven in a celestial arabesque, now reaches behind
          her head, her hand a claw that visually echoes the beak of the vulture above her. The iconography is equally clear. In this interpretation
          of the action, Manfred and Astarte have been judged—and damned—for their sins.</p>
               <p>By the mid-century, the interpretive attitude to Byron’s drama and potentially to Byron’s judgment shifted again. Astarte has left the
          pagan Elysian fields for a more conventional realm of Christian blessedness. It would seem that a pagan gesture of forgiveness from a
          Hellenic Astarte was too ambiguous for Byron’s defenders: the blessing now had to come from the Virgin Mary herself. Indeed, in the
          following two images of Astarte, dated 1849 (Figure 9) and 1891 (Figure 10) respectively, the young woman takes on all the iconographic
          attributes of the intercessor of man with God. In the first image, the iconography is so reminiscent of classic Mariology as to belie the
          context of <title level="m">Manfred</title> all together. She might as well be an icon. In the second image, the artist at least places
          Manfred in the picture, who bends in reverence to the spirit before him. <figure>

          image of a sinful man in a state of repentance and humility—hardly the image of Byron’s disdainful Manfred who defies the spiritual forces
          that threaten him with a sneer.</p>
               <p>The final Astarte image I want to discuss, however, is by far the most interesting. (Figure 11) <figure>

                  </figure> The original painting is by John Roberts Herbert, who produced several Byron illustrations in the late 1830s, including images of
          Don Juan, the Corsair, Beppo and Foscari, all circa 1838.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> My thanks to the Herbert scholar, Nancy Langham
            Cooper, who helped me to date this particular image of Astarte and Manfred to circa 1838. For more on Herbert see Cooper.</note> Once more
          we have the Madonna and penitent composition that we have seen before, but with some important variations. At this point, even the book has
          disappeared from Manfred’s side, and he now simply kneels, hands clasped in supplication before the figure of Astarte, who is once more
          surrounded by a celestial nimbus. But the lovers are no longer alone. Now a row of angels can be seen lining the wall behind the central
          figures, their heads buried in their hands in sorrow.</p>
               <p>How are we to read this interpretation of the action? Is this an image of the act of forgiveness with the angelic host appearing as
          evidence of Astarte’s innocence and thus Manfred’s redemption? Arguably not. In fact, this engraving is the most damning of all those we
          have seen thus far, partially because in this representation of Astarte, unlike all the others, she is depicted in modern dress. No longer
          does she resemble a goddess, a muse, or even the Virgin Mary—now she looks like a young woman just about to step out for a ball. If one
          studies the dress style of the late 1830s and early 40s—tight bodice, layered with an overskirt, full sleeves and off the shoulder cut—one
          sees that this Astarte embodies it perfectly. (Figure 12) Even the chain girdle that hangs from Astarte’s waist (something that was very
          popular in the sixteenth century, it is true) made a fashion comeback in 1836 London as a Chatelaine. (Figure 13) <figure>

                  </figure> Herbert has carefully woven elements of the old and the new here, but his Astarte would not at all be out of place in a
          contemporary society ballroom—or, indeed, in Augusta Leigh’s circle.</p>
               <figure>
                  <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image13Thumb.jpeg"

               </figure>
               <p>What is Herbert doing in this image? Why is his Astarte so clearly marked as a modern woman? The answer, of course, is that he has very
          cagily drawn the acknowledged but unspoken parallel between Astarte and her supposed biographical model, Augusta. If this hypothesis is
          correct, then the message does not bode well for Byron’s spiritual state. For, while it is possible to read the gesture of Astarte as one of
          absolution, I think this unlikely given a comparison with a second Herbert painting from 1851, “The Judgment of Daniel” (Figure 14). <figure>
                     <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image14Thumb.jpeg"
                              rend="inline"/>
                     <figDesc>Figure 14</figDesc>
                  </figure> Here, too, the blessed figure holds a hand up in exactly the same gesture that we see from Astarte, but in the case of Daniel, we
          can be certain that this expresses condemnation and not absolution, since he is in the process of condemning the elderly judges to death for
          their false accusations of Susanna, now found innocent of adultery. <figure>
                     <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image15Thumb.jpeg"
                              rend="inline"/>
                     <figDesc>Figure 15</figDesc>
                  </figure> The Byronic hero is explicitly being chastised and judged by Augusta’s stand-in, Astarte. Penitent though he may appear, he is not
          forgiven, and the angels weep in despair at the sight of his figure bathed in ominous shadows. Unlike the Covent Garden Astarte, this spirit
          does not speak in a voice of forgiveness, but her lofty silence speaks volumes. </p>
               <p>To conclude, there is something rather poignant in these many nineteenth-century images of Astarte as a powerful force who dominates,
          judges, and directs the Byronic hero’s moral path. For if ever there was a figure less likely to be held up as a moral guide, it was
          Augusta. But we have been complicit in this process too: our critical reluctance to be seen as sensational and our refusal to study the very
          real role that Augusta played in Byron’s life, creative or otherwise, has silenced Astarte/Augusta and made her as invisible as Annabella
          could have wished. This is not to say that Augusta and the issue of incest <emph>should</emph> be seen to be at the heart of <title level="m">Manfred</title> or indeed any other text by Byron—but to ignore her presence seems to me equally wrongheaded. Having been
          silenced and bullied into at least the performance of middle-class morality after Byron’s departure for the continent, Augusta, alone and
          isolated, was never allowed a public voice again. On her deathbed, after a painful decline, she had tried to communicate one last message to
          the world. Predictably, it could not be understood.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">Voice in Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a vehicle for authorial power, as
                well as representing an unstable force that may turn against those that wield it—and thus 
                primarily against the protagonist. Placed at the nexus of the physical and
                the spiritual, the human and the non-human, voice is a structural theme in the play,
                relating to spiritual and transcendental issues on the one hand, and questions of
                theatrical performance typical of the Romantic-period stage on the other.
                Multiplying the forms and meanings of utterance, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                foregrounds, explores, and valorizes voice, which in turn oscillates between a
                deceivingly singular denotation and an unstoppable process of proliferating
                connotations. In Byron’s dramatic poem, voice and voicing delineate a field of
                contacts, overlaps, and tensions, concentrating its questions about identity, power,
                authority, and control, as well as transcendental and social forms of
                interconnection or separation. This essay demonstrates that the process of
                transiting on which Byron’s play is predicated is crucially rooted in the dual
                nature of voice, its function as an instrument for conjuring and materializing, and
                its problematic relevance in the theater of the time.</p>

               <p>The earliest occurrence of “voice” in <title level="m">Manfred</title> appears in Act
                I, scene one where it resonates through the protagonist’s own voice as he invokes
                the spirits who will be carrying out his “task” (I.i.28):<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>. . . Now by the voice of him</l>
                        <l>Who is the first among you—by this sign,</l>
                        <l>Which makes you tremble—by the claims of him</l>
                        <l>Who is undying,—Rise! appear!—Appear! (I.i.37-40)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                Discussing this first mention of a “voice” in the text, Jerome McGann notes that:
                “This is one of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s keywords and should be tracked
                carefully through the poem. Ultimately, the ‘voice’ that ‘is the first among’ the
                spirits and the other characters in the poem, including Manfred himself, is Byron’s,
                the artificer of the entire imaginative work” (Byron <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                note to l.37). As Manfred carries out his first act of conjuring, the iteration of
                “by” informs the invocation and its mantra-like tone, its incremental repetition
                awarding a more than human authority to the protagonist’s speech and language of
                power based on explicit lexis (“power upon you,” [I.i.36]), vocatives (“Mysterious
                Agency,” [I.i.28]), and imperatives (“Rise! appear!” [I.i.36]). Ironically, however,
                all this is turned against Manfred later in the same Act and scene by the 
                “<emph>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</emph>” (<title level="m">CPW</title> 
                IV:60), which curses him in a similarly structured stanza (“By thy
                cold breast and serpent smile, / By thy unfathom’d gulfs of guile,” I.i.242-3). If
                voice stands for the power of authorship, it also represents an unstable force that
                may turn against those who wield it. At the same time, in both occurrences voice
                crucially functions as an interface between the physical and the spiritual, the
                human and the non-human.</p>
               <p>As James Mulholland suggests, a possible definition of “voice studies” pivots on
                their “use [of] voice as an analytic with which to understand the creation of
                literary texts and the process of reading in a sensate, aural world” (10-1), while
                their area of investigation focuses on forms of “textual virtualization” of voice
                that center on “the relationship among voice, self, and authority” (3, 13).
                Addressing these concerns, virtualizations of voice in Romantic-era literature
                function as a point of convergence of issues related to the production and reception
                of texts. In this respect, Susan Eilenberg has offered illuminating insights into
                Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetics by examining what happens “when a poet opens
                his mouth and somebody else’s voice comes out,” thus also raising questions about
                “the source of the poetic voice and the meaning of authorship” (3). Yet, questions
                of voice also present cultural implications that range beyond the perimeters of the
                text and bring into focus a whole range of issues of a corporeal, material, and
                ideological kind.</p>
               <p>In this light, the foregrounding of voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> points to
                another level of significance, one that is more prosaic than those listed so far, as
                well as a frequently overlooked one: voice is the highly problematic vehicle for
                theatrical performance in Romantic-period drama (Nuss 7-8). Indeed, it was a major
                concern for Joanna Baillie, the foremost dramatic and theatrical theorist of the
                age. In the “Introductory Discourse” to her first volume of <title level="m">Plays
                    on the Passions</title> (1798), she linked voice, power, and dramatic effectiveness
                by remarking that, when passions are made to “raise their voice, the power of
                distinguishing themselves has been taken away” (92). Later, in the Preface 
                <title level="a">To the Reader</title> to her third volume of 
                <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> (1812),
                she noted that: “The Public have now to choose between what we shall suppose are
                well-written and well-acted plays, the words of which are . . . heard but
                imperfectly . . . and splendid pantomime, or pieces whose chief object is to produce
                striking scenic effect” (<title level="m">Works</title> 231). A playtext in which
                these preoccupations coalesced in remarkably effective ways was Coleridge’s 
                <title level="m">Remorse</title>, the most successful stage tragedy of the period,
                which Byron knew and appreciated, and which seems to have left some traces in his
                own output (Cochran 70-2). The “splendid pantomime” in <title level="m">Remorse</title> 
                was its celebrated conjuring scene, which mixed magic, pantomime,
                voice (through an incantation, as in <title level="m">Manfred</title>), music, and a
                variety of visual effects. And this imbrication of voice inside a complex
                textual-performative continuum brings us back to <title level="m">Manfred</title>,
                which presents a similar array of practices and devices borrowed from the
                contemporary stage (Martin 107-16). In Byron’s “dramatic poem,” however, voice is
                also a specifically pre-eminent textual item (one of its key-words, as McGann says),
                structuring the play’s construction of a transcendental reality that mirrors and
                questions material reality.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    On the “spiritual” nature of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, see Byron’s letter 
                    to Thomas Moore of 25 March 1817, where he humorously calls it a “mad Drama” and 
                    a “Bedlam tragedy” in which, he exaggeratedly adds, “all the <emph>dram. pers.</emph> 
                    are spirits, ghosts, or magicians” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:188).</note> 
                In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron problematizes this connection and its liminal 
                or transitional status by investing consistently in voice and voicing, which he knew 
                to be major issues for playwrights, actors, and audiences owing to the enormous sizes of 
                the main theaters and because of the increasing popularity and influence of melodrama, in 
                which voice is constantly on the point of being submerged by silence or music.</p>
               <p>In tracing the connections between <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the
                contemporary stage, Philip Martin defined the play as an attempt at “modernizing the
                Gothic drama” (107), whereas more recently Jeffrey Cox has interpreted it as a
                critical revision of melodrama, Gothic or otherwise (76-8). Cox pointedly reads 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> as “a response to the melodrama and its evocation of
                perpetual war” (60), the latter being his phrase for the state of continued tension
                in Europe and the world following the peace ostensibly decreed by Waterloo and the
                Congress of Vienna. A reaction to melodrama’s reactionary endorsement of a
                “restoration of order” (60), <title level="m">Manfred</title> is “an after-war play
                that challenges the main form of post-war drama, the melodrama, in order to suggest
                a quite different response to the post-Waterloo world” (67). Accordingly, from Cox’s
                perspective, Byron’s play was “the serious drama of the post-Waterloo moment that
                was missing from the 1815-1816 season” (67). As such, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                adopts and at the same time contests the distinctive features of melodrama, one of
                which is voice, since, as Peter Brooks remarks, the melodramatic mode is typically
                informed by a “desire to express all” (4). In melodrama, “nothing is left unsaid” as
                “characters stand on stage and utter the unspeakable, give voice to their deepest
                feelings” (4).</p>
               <p>Reworking these various premises and contexts, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                multiplies the potential and import of utterance and, in doing so, foregrounds,
                explores, and valorizes them. In turn, voice and voicing take on a complex series of
                meanings that oscillate between a deceivingly singular denotation and an unstoppable
                process of proliferating connotations.</p>
               <p>After Manfred’s act of conjuring, “<emph>a voice is heard singing</emph>”
                (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:54), a voice that echoes and answers his own
                voice, yet is a bodiless and unlocated sound. As McGann highlights, this voice is
                unattributed (it is unclear whose voice it is) and unplaced (we do not know where it
                comes from). These complications are then compounded by the fact that “the stage
                direction signals that a social space exists in a dimension not explicitly present
                to the named characters,” so that the stage direction itself “emerges as a character
                who is aware of that social space, and who plays a major role in the action of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (Byron <title level="m">Manfred</title> note to
                ll.191-2). In addition, this bodiless and unlocated voice is a nod to the
                onstage/offstage dynamic typical of Romantic-period drama and especially Gothic
                drama, which constituted a major “location of in/visible actions and meanings” that
                “reinforce[d] and expand[ed] the tendency of Gothic theater to transgress the divide
                between on- and offstage, visible and invisible, real and imaginary” (Saglia
                “Theater” 362). A linking element shuttling between stage direction and dramatic
                text, voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> contributes to creating
                trans-dimensional interconnections, a process which is the play’s central textual
                concern as well as its distinctive performative trait.</p>
               <p>The connective function carried out by voice takes a variety of shapes from the
                outset. In the opening scene, it combines and contrasts sweetness and harshness,
                when Manfred blandishes the Spirits by saying: “‘I hear / Your voices, sweet and
                melancholy sounds, / As music on the waters’” (I.i.175-7). However, later in the
                same scene, the “<emph>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</emph>” adopts
                a very different tone, the angry invective of a curse, which encapsulates other, far
                from soothing, voices:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And a magic voice and verse</l>

                        <l>And a spirit of the air</l>

                        <l>Shall forbid thee to rejoice;</l>
                        <l>And to thee shall Night deny</l>
                        <l>All the quiet of her sky (I.i.222-9)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                Because the planes connected by voice are also those of power and disempowerment,
                Manfred’s use of voice as an instrument of authority in Act I, scene one is
                significantly short-lived, since it is immediately turned against him in this
                revision of the balance between the human and super-human. </p>
               <p>That the voice “<emph>in the Incantation</emph>” is one of the outstanding
                enigmatic features in Byron’s text is immediately visible from the very phrase 
                “<emph>in the Incantation</emph>,” seemingly intimating that the voice is
                inside the incantation it is uttering, that it not so much its source but rather an
                attribute or a feature of it. McGann sees <title level="m">Manfred</title> as “a
                crucial work in Byron’s career” and his ongoing contention with the Romantic
                imagination, since it “fully objectifies the self-destructiveness of this [betraying
                and betrayed] imagination” and promotes “the deconstruction of the self-deceived and
                self-destructive Romantic imagination” and its treacherously solipsistic
                propensities (“Brain” 64). McGann reads this process of deconstruction as deeply
                embedded in the Incantation, where the voice that “speaks the truth over the
                unconscious Manfred” is in fact “the silenced voice of Astarte,” a kind of audible
                absence conveying “her spectrous form of libido” as well as unveiling the betrayals
                of the imagination (64-5). From another perspective, Timothy Morton has drawn
                attention to the “offstage” quality of the voice “in the Incantation,” which
                “emanates from a hidden source” and constitutes what he terms an “acousmatic voice”
                (161). This mysterious voice works to convey “a sense of space that fills the
                auditorium” and is thus “necessarily synaesthetic”—a bridge between the play’s
                phantasmatic dimensions and its physical and material conditions of production, on
                the one hand, and its impact on reader or spectator, on the other (160).</p>
               <p>Although they pursue different interpretative agendas, these critical insights share
                an interest in how voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> connects the material and
                the immaterial, functioning as a lynchpin between bodied and disembodied states.
                Aptly, therefore, Act I, scene two features a reference to voice, as Manfred
                expresses a wish to escape his own body:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>. . . Oh, that I were</l>
                        <l>The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,</l>
                        <l>A living voice, a breathing harmony,</l>
                        <l>A bodiless enjoyment—born and dying</l>
                        <l>With the blest tone which made me! (I.ii.52-6)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                Here Byron explores the liminal zone between physical presence and evanescence
                through the imagery and medium of voice. On one side, this vision relates to the
                theme of physical dissolution that runs through the play and emerges in such potent
                formulations as “Earth! take these atoms!” (I.ii.109). On the other, it unveils the
                text’s connections with contemporary stage Gothic, which was a crucial cultural site
                for the elaboration of ideas of embodiment, as well as reflections on corporeality
                and its links to selfhood. Multiform and constantly renovating itself, stretching
                all the way from the 1760s to the 1820s and beyond (if we take Horace Walpole’s 1768 
                <title level="m">The Mysterious Mother</title> as its starting point), stage
                Gothic developed a complex series of engagements with physicality, ranging from the
                overwhelmingly material body of the villain to the dissolving body of the specter
                (Saglia “Staging” 166-7).</p>
               <p>Surfacing several times in the text, this doubleness is in full view in the Abbot’s
                description of Manfred’s confused condition in Act III: “an awful chaos—light and 
                darkness— / And mind and dust—and passions and pure thoughts / Mix’d, and contending 
                without end or order” (III.i.164-6). Yet, Byron most effectively translates 
                this binary couple of “excessively bodied” and
                “hauntingly disembodied” conditions through the couple Manfred-Astarte; and when the
                text awards a voice to the latter, it complicates further the already problematic
                status of the ghost in Gothic drama and its knot of aesthetic, cultural, and
                ideological stumbling blocks, such as how it should move, speak, and be dressed, or
                whether it should be represented on stage at all (Gamer 131-4; Saggini 166-7).
                Oscillating between presence and absence, the ghostly utterance in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> bestows a whole new range of meanings on voice, 
                placing it as a point of convergence between existence and non-existence. </p>
               <p>These preoccupations appear, in subtly allusive form, during Manfred’s exchange with
                the Chamois Hunter in Act II:<quote>

                As the Chamois Hunter reacts by calling Manfred a “Man of strange words” and inviting
                him to show “patience,” Manfred replies: “Patience and patience! Hence—that word was
                made / For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!” (II.i.31-6).</p>
               <p>Manfred has just been rescued from jumping off the edge of the Jungfrau. He has been
                removed from a position of liminality and oscillation between solidity and
                dissolution (he was “<emph>in act to spring from the cliff</emph>” [<title level="m">
                    CPW</title> IV:66]), his atoms on the point of returning to the great
                whirlpool of cosmic matter. Through language and voice, however, he continues to
                exist within a state of oscillation between different dimensions. The Chamois Hunter
                interprets this uncertain condition prosaically, telling him bluntly “thy senses
                wander from thee” (II.i.23), and thus positing a dissociation between body and mind,
                the material and immaterial components of the human. Manfred, instead, reinforces
                the oscillation by expanding on the implications of “blood,” the prime substance of
                physical and physiological life, which immediately becomes a reference to the
                consanguinity between him and Astarte that caused their passion (also associated
                with blood) to become criminal. In all this, the blood that was “shed” and the blood
                “[c]olouring the clouds” are the visible as well as symbolic signs of the sin that
                excludes him from “heaven.” Finally, the sense of liminality is summed up in
                Manfred’s description of heaven as the place “[w]here thou art not—and I shall never
                be,” a sentence that conjures up Byron’s distinctive preoccupation with “not being”
                somewhere, which complements what Stephen Cheeke has identified as Byron’s triadic
                concern with “[b]eing there, being in-between, having been there” (14).</p>
               <p>With a subsequent move, the text brings these locational shifts back into the fold of
                language and voicing. The Chamois Hunter associates Manfred with unusual language
                (“strange words”), a remark that doubles as an assessment of his uttering and
                voicing: Manfred’s words are strange both semantically (they do not make sense
                according to customary logic) as well as performatively (they are emphatic,
                overcharged). The hunter reacts to Manfred with a word, “patience,” that invites him
                to curb his semantic and performative unruliness alike, and which Manfred scornfully
                rejects by conjuring up another dissociation (“brutes of burthen” as opposed to
                “birds of prey”) mirroring the oscillation between material and immaterial, or lofty
                and mundane, that informs the entire play.</p>
               <p>Astarte is, of course, central to this fraught exchange between Manfred and the
                Chamois Hunter. She is present in that “ours” (II.i.25) which is then developed into
                the image of the “one heart” (II.i.26) and the observation that they “loved each
                other as we should not love” (II.i.27). Astarte is a figure—perhaps <emph>the</emph> 
                figure—of oscillation in the play, and her spectral
                status is once again linked to voice in Act II. There, in the soliloquy following
                his fruitless interview with the Witch of the Alps, Manfred announces: “I have one
                resource / Still in my science—I can call the dead, / And ask them what it is we
                dread to be” (II.ii.177-9). “Calling” reprises one of Manfred’s distinctive uses of
                voice—the invocation, the act of conjuring up, and the naming that makes entities
                appear. Significantly, when Astarte appears in Act II, scene four, her phantom voice
                utters Manfred’s name, and this new connection between material and immaterial,
                human and non-human, reactivates his desire, while also inverting the pattern since
                Astarte calls Manfred from the world of immateriality. He implores the apparition:
                “Say on, say on—/ I live but in the sound—it is thy voice!” (II.iv.150-1). Yet,
                these words read as, or indeed, sound heavily, tragically ironic. They represent yet
                another of those moments when the play mocks its own High Romantic discourse and
                unmasks the traps and pitfalls of the imagination. For Astarte’s voice is in reality
                Manfred’s own voice, since he has just told the Witch of Alps that “[Astarte] was
                like me [ . . . ] to the very tone / Even of her voice” (II.ii.105-7). Inevitably,
                Manfred’s use of voice as a way of escaping his own body into Astarte’s disembodied
                presence cruelly, and humorously, collides with the hampering presence of himself,
                his own voice, and body.</p>
               <p>Unlike Acts I and II, the third act does not feature voice as a separate lexical
                element, yet presents a wide range of forms of uttering and speaking from the
                outset. It significantly begins with a serried list of references to language and
                acts of voicing: the Abbot wants to “confer” with Manfred (III.i.24); he informs him
                that “Rumours [ . . . ] are abroad” (III.i.29-30); tells him that the populace believe
                “thou holdest converse with the things / Which are forbidden to the search of man”
                (III.i.34-5); and yet he does not seek out Manfred to “speak of punishment” but
                “penitence and pardon” (III.i.57). Uniformly pertinent to the semantic field of
                sound and verbal communication, this list designs a crescendo that culminates in
                Manfred’s death in scene four. Aptly, the final scene also contains the
                protagonist’s last act of voicing—the tirade against the spirit and other demons,
                which constitutes his greatest, most movingly tragic expression of that free will
                and power which the voice in the incantation temporarily took away from him at the
                beginning and which have been constantly under threat from the other antagonistic
                forces in the play. At the start of this act of “unconjuring,” Manfred tells the
                main spirit:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l> . . . Back to thy hell!</l>
                        <l>Thou hast no power upon me, <emph>that</emph> I feel;</l>
                        <l>Thou never shalt possess me, <emph>that</emph> I know:</l>
                        <l>What I have done is done (III.iv.124-7)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                The expression “What I have done” doubles implicitly as “What I have said,” since, as
                should be clear by now, Byron in <title level="m">Manfred</title> makes doing and
                saying, or being and uttering, inextricable. Moreover, any temptation to read this
                last speech in a purely transcendental key, that is one which sees voice losing its
                oscillatory status between material and immaterial in favor of disembodiment and
                dissolution, is interrupted and belied by the insistent materiality of voice.</p>
               <p>As Manfred concludes his speech and the demons vanish, the Abbot addresses the
                protagonist and notes:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Alas! how pale thou art—thy lips are white—</l>
                        <l>And thy breast heaves—and in thy gasping throat</l>
                        <l>The accents rattle—Give thy prayers to heaven— (III.iv.143-4)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                With their charged language and staccato rhythm, these lines highlight the bleakly
                physiological materiality of Manfred’s final act of voicing. The reference to the
                protagonist’s “gasping throat” in which his “accents rattle” signals primarily the
                dissolution of his body: voice intimates an impending disembodiment. But they also
                hark back to the question of voice on the Romantic stage, as they refer to and make
                manifest, in metatheatrical fashion, the actual delivery of sound by the actor
                playing Manfred. In other words, the play’s conclusion returns to voicing as
                utterance and as a material, stage-bound act. The attention to tone and delivery in
                the Abbot’s remark, which resembles a stage direction embedded in the dialogue,
                reminds readers that this dramatic poem is a play, a textual artifact aimed at a
                performance that thrives on voice, its nuances, and effects.</p>
               <p>In <title level="m">Manfred</title> voice delineates a transitional space—between the
                physical and the evanescent, the material and the spiritual—that is also a field
                of contacts, overlaps, and tensions. It is a site of problems and questions about
                identity (who is speaking? who is the listener?); power, authority, and control
                (also, and especially, in terms of the text’s pivotal theme of “resistance to 
                power—or the network of power that situates and subjugates self and freedom” [An. 107]);
                and forms of interconnection or separation between dimensions and characters, from
                transcendental as well as social perspectives, as with the complex mediated verbal
                interactions in Act II between Manfred and the Chamois Hunter or Manfred and
                Arimanes. These shifts between dimensions and exchanges among the <emph>dramatis 
                personae</emph> ground the process of transiting on which the play is
                predicated and are rooted in the dual nature of voice, its ritual function as an
                instrument for conjuring and materializing, as well as the dual status of voice in
                the theater of the time. A significant portion of the meaning of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> lies on the cusp between the written and the spoken 
                word, the latter to be understood not just as the word vicariously uttered in the printed
                text, but also actually and physically uttered by voices on a stage.</p>
               <p>If Byron’s dramatic poem is unusual in problematizing voice to this extreme of
                complication and resonance, in this respect it is also recognizably Romantic. As a
                hybrid construct, <title level="m">Manfred</title> reflects the question of voice as a
                recurrent concern in theater, but also more generally in the poetry of the period,
                as is visible in the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Hemans, among others.
                Melynda Nuss has examined how, “[t]hrough his experiments with theatre, Wordsworth
                learns to position himself as both actor and spectator to create a unique and
                all-encompassing public voice” (11). Christopher Stokes explores in detail the
                “subtle, interesting, and intellectually challenging” features of Coleridge’s
                problematizing of voice in his output (10). And John Anderson has read Hemans’s 
                <title level="m">The Forest Sanctuary</title> (1825) as “a prolonged meditation on the
                idea of voice” (56) that “suggests destabilizing alternative approaches to
                established epic” (56) through “a chorus of male and female, dead and living voices
                together, dialogically creating worlds for those who have ears to hear” (73). These
                poets’ productions offer endless variations on voicing and utterance that contribute
                to delineating a complex metapoetic and metaliterary discourse within
                Romantic-period verse. In their works, voice variously functions as an interface
                between body and spirit, or thing and essence; a correlative of the “correspondent
                breeze” or the “Eolian harp;” or a locus of cultural identity and historical agency,
                as in the German Romantic notion, coined by Johann Gottfried Herder, of poetry as a
                powerful manifestation of the <foreign xml:lang="de">Volkstimme</foreign>, the “voice 
                of the people.” Byron in <title level="m">Manfred</title> partly subscribes to and partly
                deviates from investments in voice by contemporary poets, as well as contemporary
                playwrights. Most peculiarly, by multiplying and intersecting the various meanings
                of voice, he places it at center stage so that his dramatic poem about a “Child of
                Clay” (I.i.131), who is “[h]alf dust, half deity” (I.ii.40), ultimately stands out
                as one of the major Romantic texts on the power and meaning of uttering words.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Drawing on three collaborations between New York
                    City’s Red Bull Theater and the New York University Department of English—the
                    staging of Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), Percy Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), and Lord Byron’s 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017)—I argue that Romantic closet plays
                    can benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a staged reading
                    by professional actors and directors. I contend that this type of performance
                    offers what I call a happy medium: a compromise between a full staging and a
                    private reading, which is suitable to the needs of this particular genre of
                    minimal dramatic action, heightened poetic language, and metaphysical or
                    “mental” subject matter. As a happy medium, the staged reading blurs the rigid
                    binary between the stageable and the unstageable, permitting a means of bringing
                    to performative light works typically limited to solitary or classroom reading
                    practices. In addition, this type of performance provides a heuristic through
                    which to explore the theatricality of these works, thereby carving out a new
                    interpretive space for expanding our critical discourse on Romantic drama,
                    theater, and performance.</p>

               <p>Despite Lord Byron’s claim that he “rendered [<title level="m">Manfred</title>] 
                quite impossible for the stage,” his
                    “dramatic poem” is actually a work that contains dramaturgically rich scenes 
                    (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:52-5). Among these is the exchange between
                    Manfred and the Chamois Hunter on the Jungfrau, which includes the moment that
                    Manfred’s plans to plunge to his death are thwarted by the hunter who restrains
                    him. The second act, in particular, offers most of the play’s theatricalizing
                    potential with the rapid, intense exchanges between Manfred and the spirits in
                    the Hall of Arimanes, the collective chanting that occurs during its
                    introductory hymn, and the mysterious, climactic dialogue between Manfred and
                    the Phantom of Astarte. The play closes with the appearance of the haunting
                    “infernal god” who brings Manfred presumably upon his death to the nether
                    regions from where the spirit originated (III.iv.63). Such portrayals suggest
                    that Byron invested his drama with scenes that invited theatrical
                    presentation.</p>
               <p>At the same time, the play presents
                    dramaturgical challenges. It contains several extended soliloquies, many of
                    which reveal Manfred’s private thoughts through elevated and often dense poetic
                    language. Such lengthy monologues take up far more of the play than any of its
                    dramatic action. The play’s unusual narrative sequence poses yet another
                    challenge, as <title level="m">Manfred</title> lacks a traditional plot scheme of clear
                    exposition and rising action. The classic elements of tragedy, such as agnorisis
                    and peripeteia, have already happened, and therefore Byron denies the audience
                    the conventional experience of catharsis. For these and other reasons, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is typically considered an unstageable play.
                    Byron even proposed that his work was “of a very wild—metaphysical—and
                    inexplicable kind” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:169-70); Byron later used the term
                “metaphysical” to describe his experimental drama, <title level="m">Cain</title> (1821).
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> was part of a genre that Byron called “mental
                    theatre,” a term for a special class of poetry that, as Alan Richardson has
                    contended, became a dominant mode of writing among many Romantic writers
                    (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VIII:186-7).<note place="foot" resp="author">See
                    Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">A Mental Theater: Poetic Drama and
                    Consciousness in the Romantic Age</title> (University Park:
                    Pennsylvania State University Press, 1988).</note> The play was seemingly intended for the
                    theater of Manfred’s mind, as it were, rather than the actual stages of
                    prominent London theaters such as Covent Garden or Drury Lane.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Frederick Burwick’s essay in this volume, <title level="a">Staging 
                                <title level="m">Manfred</title>,</title> examines Alfred Bunn’s 1834 production of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> at Covent Garden.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this essay, I wish to propose that, despite
                    its limited performance history since its publication 200 years ago, 
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> can be staged successfully. A case in point is
                    Red Bull Theater’s <ref target="http://www.redbulltheater.com/manfred">April 2017 
                    staging</ref> of the drama in New York City. What made this
                    production “playable” is owed in part to the atypical nature of the performance
                    method employed. It was not a full-on staging of elaborate sets; there were no
                    displays of intricately tailored costumes or arrangements of professional
                    lighting and musical ensembles. Neither was the play experienced as a silent,
                    private, individual reading of text. Instead, the performance was a hybrid
                    experience, a mixed theatrical event that wed the page to the stage. On the
                    bicentenary of its original publication, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                    was performed on the NYC stage by bringing the printed text together with trained
                    actors who dramatically read its lines aloud from scripts. This was achieved
                    through the rare collaboration between a professional director, professional
                    actors, and literary scholars, who served as resident dramaturges during
                    rehearsals.</p>
               <p>In what follows, I draw on three collaborations
                    between NYC’s Red Bull Theater and the NYU Department of English—Lord Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus 
                        Unbound</title> (2013) and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                (2017)—to argue that these ostensibly
                    unplayable Romantic dramas, which have typically been referred to as closet
                    plays, can indeed benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a
                    staged reading specifically implemented by professional actors and directors. I
                    contend that this type of performance provides a “happy medium”: a compromise
                    between a full staging (with set designs, costumes, elaborate lighting, and
                    rehearsed movements and gestures) and a private reading, which is suitable to
                    the needs of this particular genre of minimal dramatic action, heightened poetic
                    language, and metaphysical or “mental” subject matter. As a happy medium, the
                    staged reading collapses the binary between the stageable and the unstageable,
                    permitting such works typically limited to solitary or classroom reading
                    practices to become performances in their own right. Moreover, it provides a
                    heuristic through which to explore the theatricality of these works, thereby
                    carving out a new interpretive space for expanding our critical discourse on
                    Romantic drama, theater, and performance. </p>

                  <p>I will begin by briefly contextualizing the history of these scholarly-artistic
                    collaborations. In the Fall of 2011, a couple of my colleagues and I sought out
                    Red Bull Theater to co-produce a fully-staged performance of Lord Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>.<note place="foot" resp="author">I owe enormous debt to Randie
                            Sessler and Veronica Goosey, who joined me on this endeavor in its early
                            phases and have remained invaluable interlocutors on the subject.
                            Without them, neither this collaborative project nor this essay would
                            have been possible. I also wish to thank the Department of English at
                            New York University for generously co-funding this initiative over the
                            years.</note> We wished to
                    reexamine the theatrical potential of period plays by conducting a type of
                    research outside of the academy beyond
                    what a classroom or library could offer. This aspiration drew on the work
                of scholars such as Frederick Burwick, Jerome McGann, and Murray Biggs who had
                overseen stagings of these plays over the decades.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                Scholars have previously turned to the stage to examine questions of
                        “performability,” especially for period plays with little or no performance
                        history. For example, Jerome McGann’s theater group, <title level="m">Cain’s
                            Company</title>, brought Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title> and 
                    <title level="m">Heaven and Hell</title> to the theater in the 1960s. Murray
                        Biggs’s 1988 production of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Borderers</title>
                    gave the poet’s only drama a performance history. His later production
                        of Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> at Yale University in March
                        1990 for an international conference on Romantic drama gave Byron’s play a
                        long overdue revival among literary scholars. In 2000, Charles Rzepka
                        produced two performances of <title level="m">Obi; or Three-Finger'd
                            Jack</title> at Playwrights Theater at Boston University in July and at the
                        conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism
                        (NASSR) in August at the University of Arizona. Rzepka’s NASSR production
                        marked the first of what has now become a tradition of staging Romantic
                        dramas at these conferences; this performance was directed by Jerrold Hogle.
                        Furthermore, Frederick Burwick has also directed a number of Romantic plays,
                        including works by Hannah Cowley, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Joanna Baillie. In
                        2001, he directed a production of Thomas Beddoes’s <title level="m">Death’s
                            Jest Book</title> whose adapted script was created by Jerome McGann and was
                        performed at the NASSR conference, as well. Finally, it should be noted that
                        readings of plays have occurred at many literary scholarly conferences, as
                        well, including at the NASSR and the Wordsworth Summer Conferences. A
                        reading of Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title>, for instance, took place
                        at the 2010 NASSR conference, <title level="m">Romantic Mediations</title>.</note> 
                We reached out to Red Bull Theater
                because they expressed interest in the “rediscovery of neglected classics” (Red Bull
                Theater). The fact that these plays had been so rarely performed attracted the Red
                Bull team to this project; they were also intrigued by the kind of critical debates
                that these plays fostered. </p>
                  <p>Rather than investing in full productions, however, they proposed co-producing staged
                readings as part of the company’s Obie award-winning Revelation Reading Series.
                According to their website, Red Bull’s series provided “a unique opportunity to hear
                these plays performed by many of the finest actors in New York” (Red Bull Theater).
                Through this option, actors do not memorize their lines but rather use music stands
                to read aloud from scripts. Though I was disappointed by the less ambitious option,
                the viability of this low-risk and low-budget alternative was not simply pragmatic,
                as the cost of hiring professional actors for a full production would have been
                challenging to fund. This decision also led to the fortuitous discovery of an
                alternate and promising medium for interpreting these plays. Throughout the
                five-year relationship, we co-produced five dramas: Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                (2012), Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), Joanna Baillie’s 
                <title level="m">De Montfort</title> (2014), Frances Burney’s <title level="m">The Woman Hater</title>
                (2015), and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017).</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>***</head>
                  <p>The staging of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> in 2012 launched the collaboration
                with Red Bull by bringing one of Byron’s dramas to 42nd Street
                for the first time. The rehearsal and performance of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> 
                took place on November 12, 2012, at the Peter Jay Sharp
                Theater. Though this play is not typically considered unstageable, its limited performance history made it an appropriate choice for our co-production.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Jeffrey Cox and Michael Gamer have commented on the performance history of 
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>: “<title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> 
                    apparently had its first performance in
                        Brussels in January 1834. It opened in London in a production by Macready at
                        Drury Lane on 10 April 1834. With fine sets and great scenic effects, the
                        play was a success, running for twenty-three nights. Drawing upon recent
                        excavations in Nineveh and Babylon for his settings, Charles Kean revived
                        the play in 1853 in a production that achieved ninety-three performances in
                        two seasons; another production in 1875 was performed more than two thousand
                        times across England within two years” (Cox and Gamer 262).</note> In
                this section, I will briefly discuss how this first experience laid the groundwork
                for the collaborations that ensued.</p>
                  <p>During the five-hour rehearsal, which took place immediately before the performance,
                my colleagues and I were introduced to the theater team as literature researchers,
                and we expected to play a minor background role. As rehearsals progressed, however,
                the actors and director relied increasingly on us, instead of one of their own
                in-house professional dramaturges, for textual expertise. The Red Bull actors and
                director sought us out for contextual knowledge about the plays, including
                information about Byron’s biography and what they suspected might be its pivotal
                relation to the play’s content and themes; they also inquired about 
                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s reception history and about general background
                on the time period in which Byron wrote it. When we told them about Byron composing
                the play from Italy while in self-imposed exile, the actor playing King
                Sardanapalus, Amir Arison, drew connections between Byron’s biography and
                Sardanapalus’s lines on feeling alienated and “misplaced upon the throne—misplaced
                in life” (IV.332). Encouraged by their engagement with the text, we made some
                connections explicit for the team of actors. This included explaining the links
                between Byron’s philhellenism and his counter-imperialist leanings; this is made
                particularly evident, we stressed, through Byron’s choice in making the king’s lover
                a Greek (Myrrha) and slave to a despotic imperial state. We also pointed out that
                the play’s backdrop of the imminent collapse of the Assyrian Empire could be read as
                Byron’s commentary on the Ottoman Empire or perhaps what he saw as the future of the
                British Empire. In addition to seeking historical information from us, the cast and
                director turned to us for textual clarifications. This included paraphrases of
                complicated lines, along with proper pronunciations of names (such as Pania,
                Beleses, and Semiramis), places (such as Nineveh and Chaldea), or unfamiliar terms
                (such as <emph>satrap</emph>). During breaks, <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s 
                    director, Gaye Taylor Upchurch, sought our approval for
                some of her dramaturgical decisions. Even though she was the expert in that space,
                she and the rest of the team placed significant value on our opinions. </p>
                  <p>While sharing our knowledge with the actors and director, we conducted a form of
                ethnography that included observing the theater team’s impressions of and reactions
                to the text. First and foremost, Upchurch explained to us that, in order for 
                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> to succeed on stage, it had to be cut.<note place="foot" resp="author">It was no secret to
                            Upchurch and Red Bull’s directors that we initially resisted removing
                            any lines at all out of integrity and for our research purposes of
                            determining the theatricality of these plays based on how they were
                            created. In his 1990 production of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                            at Yale, Biggs also noted that “cutting [the text] was essential in
                            order to fit the play into the two-and-a-half hours beyond which a
                            student performance is apt to become intolerable. The 2833 lines of the
                            original were trimmed to 2128, but by a process of surreptitious
                            thinning rather than lopsided and visible excision. No cuts were made,
                            moreover, except by trial and error some way into rehearsal. The lines
                            least playable (by our cast) were the ones to go, but only after they
                            had entered fully into the company’s awareness of the author’s complete
                            undertaking” (Biggs, <title level="a">Notes on Performing 
                            <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                        </title> 379.).</note> Several of the actors,
                including Arison, expressed similar concerns about adapting the play’s lengthy,
                unwieldy verse passages for the stage. Upchurch eliminated what she classified as
                extended poetic descriptions and unnecessary repetitions that she thought stalled
                the play’s dramatic momentum. Upchurch also informed us that her priority was to
                keep the audience’s attention through a reasonable performance time. In the process,
                she hoped to deliver a clear plot sequence, while cutting down on passages of dense,
                allusive verse. See Figure 1 for a sample of such edits, displaying two of
                Upchurch’s major line cuts from Act IV in which King Sardanapalus recounts his
                stirring dream to Myrrha:
            <figure n="1">
                        <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/miranda-image1Thumb.png"/>
                        <figDesc>Sample of cuts made by Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch</figDesc>
                     </figure>
            In the first major cut on the left, Myrrha’s speech is truncated half way through
                line 56. In order to preserve the iambic pentameter, therefore, Sardanapalus’s
                response in line 64 is cut, too. The adjustment maintains the poetic rhythm, while
                removing complex images, metaphors, and philosophical meditations. The second cut on
                the right follows this approach, eliminating one of Myrrha’s multiple avowals to the
                King and other less substantive phrases and hesitations that stand in the way of
                Sardanapalus’s retelling of his dream. Though not all edits maintained this type of
                continuity, Upchurch succeeded in most cases in ensuring smooth transitions between
                actors’ lines and preserving Byron’s poetic form. </p>
                  <p>When the twelve-actor performance commenced later that evening, which included one
                actor who read Byron’s stage directions, Upchurch’s line cuts proved warranted, as
                the show still ran to a two-hour, twenty-minute performance (including one
                fifteen-minute intermission). The over 120 attendees responded enthusiastically.
                Many of them told us either during intermission or after the performance that the
                play presented an array of gripping elements: suspense, humor, romance, and themes
                of friendship and fidelity. According to audience members, some noteworthy moments
                included the pathos of Zarina’s loyalty to Sardanapalus as his wife and queen,
                despite the king’s betrayal and estrangement from her. Other absorbing elements
                included the heated and cross-cultural romance between the Assyrian king and his
                Greek lover as well as the play’s tragic yet spectacular finale: when Sardanapalus
                and Myrrha escape capture by the rebels by immolating themselves. Overall, the
                performance fostered the kind of responses—such as laughter and enthusiasm—that
                a talented cast and director were able to make possible.<note place="foot" resp="author">In 
                Biggs’s notes on the production of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>, he explains how he initially
                            sought out a “seasoned New York actor” for the role of the king, since
                            none of his “student actors seemed ready for it” (<title level="a">Notes of Performing
                                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                        </title> 380.). He settled on hiring
                            Brian Price, a trained actor in his mid-twenties who Biggs described as
                            having “a high and somewhat querulous voice and an inconspicuous
                            physique. Not obviously an auspicious choice; yet he proved a
                            revelation.” Biggs attributes his finding to Price’s “spontaneity,” an
                            attribute of comedy and levity that he believes Byron wrote into the
                            lines and character of the king. For Biggs, King Sardanapalus appears to
                            “be improvising his text as the character is improvising his rule,” and
                            we believe that Arison also seized upon the improvisational effects that
                            inhered in the Byronic text.</note> As King Sardanapalus,
                Arison generated laughter through amusing, hyperbolic poses in front of the mirror
                that suggested the king’s vanity (III.163-4). Arison commented that, despite his
                impotence as a monarch, incapacity to unite a divided Assyrian kingdom, and
                preference for soirees and libations instead of defending his realm and people from
                attack, the king’s character comes across sympathetically. </p>
                  <p>Approximately thirty audience members remained for the post-show discussion, with
                many interested to find out about the benefits achieved through the partnership
                between a university English department and a theater company. They also asked
                questions about <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s production and reception
                history as well as about specific contextual issues such as the political parallels
                between the play’s ancient setting and the concerns of Byron’s own day. In an email
                to Upchurch and the actors the day after the performance, Red Bull’s Associate
                Artistic Director, Craig Baldwin, wrote:

            Overall, it became clear that besides the superb acting Upchurch’s line cuts were
                theatrically effective. I suspect that both the dramatic reading and post-show
                discussion may have enticed some of them to explore more about Byron and his works
                in their own time. </p>

                  <p>The unexpected success of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> solidified the
                relationship between Red Bull and the NYU Department of English, making a staged
                reading of a Romantic drama an annual New York City event from 2012 to 2017. The
                positive reception prompted us to raise the stakes the following year by choosing
                Shelley's lyrical drama, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, a play that has
                not only been mostly confined to print—with only a handful of copies even making
                it to the press in Shelley’s lifetime—but has also been brought to the stage only
                a handful of times (Barcus 3).<note place="foot" resp="author">Here Barcus 
                    explains: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no
                            more than 20 copies, and John Gisborne remarked that
                           <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> was never intended for more than five or
                            six persons” (3). In April 1998, Rude Mechanicals, a renowned theater
                            company in Austin, Texas, put on what they claim to be the “original
                            world premiere” of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as a full
                            staged production at the University of Texas in Austin. It was directed
                            by Madge Darlington and produced by Theresa M. Kelley and Michael
                            Simpson. (<ref target="http://www.rudemechs.com/">www.rudemechs.com</ref>)</note> In his preface to the 1820
                edition of the drama, Shelley suggested that he did not intend it for performance,
                writing that its “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” were best suited for “the
                highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers” (209).
                The implication is that his drama demands a special “reader” instead of spectator.
                Indeed, Shelley’s inclusion of supernatural content, representations of cosmic-wide
                revolution, dense poetic effusions and images, and complex allusions present
                formidable challenges to staging it. The political allegorical heft and network of
                classical references of Shelley’s text are challenging enough to read: I wondered,
                therefore, how it would fare before a live audience.</p>
                  <p>The conversations leading up to—and during—rehearsals resembled those from the
                previous year, with the exception that Craig Baldwin decided to direct
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> personally. In an interview prior to the
                show, he reminisced about his Juilliard “voice and speech class” days in which his
                instructor would require his students to perform Asia’s “enchanted Boat” song from
                Act II, scene five, as an exercise in reciting “expressive” and “rich” language and
                sound (Personal Interview). Even though that experience was Baldwin’s first and only
                exposure to the play prior to our collaboration, he welcomed the chance to direct it
                for two major reasons. The first was the draw of what he considered Shelley’s
                “ecstatically appealing” verse and ambitious attempt “to describe the
                indescribable.” Baldwin noted his interest in the play’s reach “for greater and
                greater transcendence . . . [through] massive and multilayered ideas and images”
                (Personal Interview). The second reason was Baldwin’s fascination with what he
                considered Shelley’s prescience about late 20th and early 21st century 
                advances in theatrical technology. According to
                Baldwin, “Shelley liberated himself from writing in a theatrical tradition [of his
                contemporaries] and made precocious innovations” (Personal Interview). Baldwin
                argued that today’s elaborate technology used in Broadway or West End sets could
                bring many of the play’s spectacles to life, presenting features like Asia’s
                radiating light from Act II or the inter-animating visions of celestial bodies of
                Act IV as impressive visual effects. He also suggested that the play imagines what
                we would recognize today as a “Batman-like shadow world” with characters like
                Demogorgon as a “proto-Terminator” and the Phantasm of Jupiter arising from the
                lower depths like “scenes from <title level="m">X-Men</title>.” He even suggested that
                Shelley’s drama could adapt well as a film or even opera-musical.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In his brief exposure to the full
                            text, Baldwin came to conclusions about (unbeknownst to him) the
                            dramaturgical potential of Shelley’s play that some literary scholars
                            have already identified elsewhere. Jacqueline Mulhallen, for instance,
                            has analyzed Shelley’s lyrical dramas, both <title level="m">Prometheus
                                Unbound</title> and <title level="m">Hellas</title>, as “rooted in actual
                            theatrical practices” (Mulhallen, <title level="m">Theater</title> 16).
                            According to her, Shelley’s lyrical drama “accord[s] with his theory of
                            drama sufficiently to suggest that he thought them performable."
                            Mulhallen’s book aims to show Shelley as an effective dramatist for the
                            play’s “song, scenic effect, or suggestions of dance.” Jeffrey Cox has
                            also argued that the play “is insistently directed toward dramatic
                            traditions . . . [with an] entire range of drama from tragedy to
                            melodrama” (<title level="m">Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School:
                            Keats, Shelley, Hunt, and Their Circle</title>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
                            1998, 142). In their writing about Romantic mediality, moreover, Celeste
                            Langan and Maureen McLane have recognized the play’s “stunning
                            materiality,” “outsoarings,” and fascination with “conveyance” (<title level="a">The
                                Medium of Romantic Poetry</title> in <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion
                                to British Romantic Poetry</title>, ed. James Chandler and Maureen N.
                            McLane, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, 256). They argue:
                            “Shelley’s imagined revolution . . . was incessantly audiovisualized,
                            its movements virtually kinesthetic, propelling spirits and readers ever
                            onward in a shared dream in an optative mode . . . [the drama] pictures
                            revolution as a stunning sound-and-light show: curses, songs, ringing
                            voices, personified voices in the air, visions rolling on brains, light
                            illuminating reconstructed man” (257-8).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we expected, Baldwin admitted that the play would offer its share of staging
                difficulties. He particularly felt that the long poetic passages and minimal stage
                directions suggested that Shelley wrote it—not as an unstageable play 
                but—without any idea of how to stage it. As with <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>,
                the text needed cutting, perhaps even more ruthlessly, in fact. Baldwin suggested
                considerably trimming the drama’s second half during the extended celebrations
                across the cosmos.<note place="foot" resp="author">While
                            Baldwin made substantial line cuts, he compromised with me by
                            re-inserting particular passages that I believed were crucial to
                            understanding Shelley’s work. Some of these re-insertions included the
                            Furies’ visions of French Revolutionary terror from Act I and the Spirit
                            of the Hour’s observations on women’s new-found equality in the new
                            Promethean universe at the end of Act III.</note> In lieu of
                dramatic action, however, Baldwin determined to be crafty with what he considered
                Shelley’s “beautiful lyricism and musicality” (Personal Interview). One of his
                strategies for heightening the play’s sonoric experience included positioning actors
                beyond the stage throughout the entire space of the theater. During the actual
                performance, actors were positioned all across the stage as well as in the aisles.
                For example, in Act IV, while the actors playing Panthea and Ione described the
                redeemed world’s “inter-transpicuous” marvels from the stage, the dialogue between
                the Earth and the Moon took place throughout the orchestra aisles with audience
                members sitting directly between the speaking characters (IV.134). </p>
                  <p>Baldwin also divided Shelley’s lengthy choruses to heighten the play’s dramatic
                effects. He split the lines up between several actors who would recite them either
                individually or in tandem from the aisles. See Figure 2 for an example of one of
                Baldwin’s adapted choruses, which I have positioned beside Shelley’s original
                text:
            <figure n="2">
                        <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/miranda-image2Thumb.png"/>

                     </figure>
            Baldwin divided Shelley’s song among the characters in order to make the poetic text
                more dramatic. In doing so, he transformed the chorus into a style reminiscent of
                the witch scenes in <title level="m">Macbeth</title>, creating a call-and-response
                effect. Yet such a choice simultaneously raised a paradox. Baldwin interpreted
                Shelley’s lack of stage directions as license for creating a precise design for the
                dialogue, “binding” back <title level="m">Prometheus</title>, as it were, to a rigid
                structure. Perhaps this interpretive choice was antithetical to Shelley’s authorial
                intent. Nevertheless, the positioning of these characters in the aisles invoked
                their liminal status as spirits not fully within the material world. Moreover,
                Baldwin felt his choice created an opportunity for making a rich theatrical
                experience possible. </p>
                  <p>The staged reading took place on November 18, 2013 at the Lucille Lortel Theater in
                New York City’s West Village. Despite the drama’s complexities, it appealed to 
                many—though not all—attendees, as I discovered from speaking to audience members
                during intermission and after the show. Surprisingly, despite starting the
                performance with a full house of approximately 200 persons (maybe a record-breaking
                number in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s limited performance history),
                the play resumed post-intermission with approximately half of its initial audience.
                Perhaps this was because of the density of Shelley’s poetry or what appeared to be
                the resolution of dramatic action before intermission at the end of Act II. In an
                email following the show, Baldwin wrote that the house appeared divided: “Many of
                them seemed bored by the incessant and complicated imagery and the long poetic
                tracts, quite a few even left at intermission. Others stayed the whole time and
                seemed very excited about it at the talkback” (Baldwin, <title level="u">"Re: Questions"</title>). After much
                deliberation, I also came to the conclusion that the audience members—especially
                those unfamiliar with the play—might have believed that the second act’s dramatic
                conclusion was, in fact, the play’s finale. Despite the exodus at the interval, the
                number of dedicated attendees who remained perhaps reinforces Shelley’s caution
                about the play’s suitability for only a “select classes of poetical readers.”</p>
                  <p>In addition to sparking a lively post-show discussion that explored both the
                challenges and opportunities of Baldwin’s adaptation, the event received positive
                reviews. On behalf of the Keats-Shelley Organization of America, Suzanne Barnett
                described the show as a “rare and unexpected delight” and “a lively and nuanced
                performance that was especially impressive given that the cast had only a single
                rehearsal that same afternoon” (Barnett). She elaborated:
                <quote>
            The experience of hearing the choruses and semichoruses chant their intermingled
                lines from either side of the theater was both appropriate to the musicality of the
                source text and a canny solution to the limitations of a reading, as opposed to a
                full staging. It was also a delightful sensory experience, and it felt like a
                decision Shelley himself would have endorsed.
                </quote>
            Despite the limited rehearsal time indeed, Baldwin succeeded at finding a cast
                talented enough to deliver Shelley’s complex artistic portrayals and rich language
                effectively. One of the best examples of this occurred during the Moon’s speech in
                the last act’s cosmic rejoicing, a high point that Barnett also noted. Adam Green
                (The Moon) read his lines so powerfully that Myra Lucretia Taylor (The Earth) broke
                out of her character to say “You just took my breath away!” before resuming her own
                speech (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>). While scholars generally consider Act IV as both narratively and dramatically problematic, the performance appeared to succeed because of its emphasis on the aural pleasures of the poetry. In so doing, the production culminated with a depiction of Promethean cosmic renewal that also celebrated Shelley’s language in memorable ways.<note place="foot" resp="author">Michael Ferber

                  <p>The <title level="m">Manfred</title> staging reinforced many of the lessons learned a
                few years previously with <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. In
                commemoration of the bicentenary of the play’s publication, it took place on the
                evening of Thursday, April 20, 2017 at the Loreto Theater at the Sheen Center of New
                York City.<note place="foot" resp="author">For many parts of my analysis
                        of the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, I draw on my interview
                        with Keats-Shelley Association of America, which was published on their <ref target="https://k-saa.org/manfred-follow-up-omar-f-miranda/">site</ref>
                    on August 3, 2017 (<title level="a">Manfred Follow Up</title>).</note> During rehearsals,
                Jerome McGann and I served as resident dramaturges, working in collaboration with
                the play’s director, Michael Barakiva, who <ref target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/supplementals/MANFRED_RedBullScript_4-15-17.pdf">adapted the script</ref> to accommodate a
                12-actor cast. </p>
                  <p>Barakiva was inspired by the many challenges posed by <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
                    He remarked at the onset of rehearsals that
                    “the problem with the script dramaturgically is that we don’t get to see the
                    relationship with Astarte.” He suggested that, in order to create a more
                    “playable” drama, he would have instructed Byron to change the first act by
                    including either additional plot action or more speeches that give background
                    details. Yet Barakiva said that Byron’s language in <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                is “thick like a good sauce,” noting not only its Shakespearean
                registers in lines such as “We are the fools of time and terror” (II.i.164), but
                also the “dramatic upheavals” of Byron’s usage of dashes throughout.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Jane Stabler’s <title level="a">The Dashes in
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                        </title> in this volume for a thorough discussion on
                        the subject.</note> Like his predecessors (Upchurch and Baldwin),
                Barakiva cut the play substantially, producing a short performance that lasted
                approximately 50 minutes. He wanted to create the most playable version of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> possible and therefore removed most of its dense
                poetry. In making his cuts, unlike Upchurch and Baldwin, he paid no mind to
                preserving Byron’s patterns of versification. </p>
                  <p>Despite deferring to Barakiva without protest, McGann and I noted some of the
                director’s arbitrary decisions. He changed the gender of Byron’s characters, for
                instance, making all the immortals female (including Arimanes, Nemesis, and the
                other spirits) to distinguish them from the mortal male characters. When asked why
                he had come to the decision, Barakiva stated that the matter was personal,
                clarifying that he believed in “the superiority of women.” My skepticism was
                slightly allayed, however, when I later observed the—perhaps unintended—results
                of what he had achieved. As the performance unfolded on stage, his vision spoke to
                the play’s content and context. By dividing the characters in this way, the set up
                accentuated Manfred’s estrangement from either camp. Neither mortal nor immortal,
                Manfred (played by Jason Butler Harner) stood isolated on the stage throughout the
                entire performance, which stressed his status as an outcast caught in a liminal
                space between the human and superhuman worlds. Throughout the show, while the
                mortals (the Chamois Hunter, the Abbot of St. Maurice, Manuel, and Herman) sat
                upstage right behind Manfred, the immortals (the Spirits, the Witch of Alps,
                Destinies, Nemesis, and Arimanes) were seated opposite them upstage left. All the
                while, the audience was made continuously aware that Manfred could neither identify
                nor connect with any other being—not even the Phantom of Astarte.</p>
                  <p>The stage production also emphasized the text’s gothic aspects through the actors’
                use of vocal variation. A good example of this was in Act II, scene four when the
                Destinies, Nemesis, and Arimanes all appeared together on stage—aghast and
                indignant that Manfred, through the use of his supernatural power, had gained access
                into the Hall of Arimanes. When the actors read their lines either in unison or in rapid succession, the characters came across as a threatening and intimidating collective unit; whether the actors varied their tempo or pitch, they produced the haunting effect called for by the scene. Another moment that accentuated the text’s eerie features occurred when the actor who played Arimanes, Jacqueline Antaramian, uttered her first of only five words in the drama. In
                response to Nemesis, who asks “Great Arimanes, doth thy will avouch / The wishes of
                this mortal?” Antaramian sneered at Manfred for about ten seconds—in complete
                silence—before uttering “yea” in a prolonged, menacing, and chilling fashion
                (II.iv.80-1). Her manipulation of sound and facial expression as well as her
                distinctive delivery of the word itself signaled to me once again the benefits of
                translating this play from the page to the stage. Through her acting skill, she made
                evident that brevity can be as powerful on stage as one of Manfred’s lengthy
                monologues. </p>
                  <p>Another Barakivan eccentricity included communal readings of the stage directions:
                instead of having one person solely charged with reading them aloud, he randomly
                assigned each of them among all the actors. I appreciated this decision, as it
                resonated with the instabilities of voice and voicing so central to 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> (as Diego Saglia has compellingly argued in <ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.saglia.html">his essay</ref>
                in this volume). Barakiva also had a triangle rung for any reference to Astarte. It
                was used, for instance, after the Shepherd’s pipe is “heard in the distance,” when
                Manfred confesses “Yet there was One” (II.ii.103). Such a choice worked well, since
                the consistency of the instrument’s sound emphasized Astarte’s significance to the
                plot whether she was present on stage or not.</p>

                  <p>The co-productions of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus 
                Unbound</title>, and <title level="m">Manfred</title> were successful
                events for many reasons: the audience’s level of engagement, the fruitful
                collaboration between literary scholars and theater artists who came together
                through one common text of interest, and the opportunity to bring students in
                contact with these texts in innovative and exciting ways. These experiences also
                allowed the rare chance to hear the performance of Byron’s and Shelley’s poetry by
                professional actors who bring to life all theatrical aspects of the play, from the
                heated dialogue to the long, introspective monologues. </p>
                  <p>During rehearsals and performances, the literary scholar assumed a different role
                outside the academy, becoming a resident dramaturge and textual expert in a local
                theater. We provided a service to both theater professionals during rehearsals as
                well as to members of the community who wished to know more about the dramas during
                the post-show discussion. As Baldwin noted after the performance of 
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, “it is certainly very helpful to artists
                to engage with scholars when dealing with classical text in the theater . . .
                [especially] for directors, whose understanding of the play has to extend to its
                context, the purpose for it being written, the other work being written at the time,
                the other work by that author, etc., in order to make choices about how the play is
                contextualized in production” (Baldwin, <title level="u">“Re: Questions”</title>). The collaboration also
                allowed for some professional crossover, as Baldwin incorporated into his vision one
                of my own dramaturgical suggestions. At the end of the performance, as the actor
                playing Demogorgon, Mark Dole, read the lyrical drama’s final line, “This alone is
                Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory,” all of the actors on stage read it aloud in tandem
                with him as a gesture symbolic of the newly unified Promethean society (IV.578).</p>
                  <p>These rewards were indeed mutual, as this opportunity opened up a stimulating
                interpretive space. The professional actors bring out certain aspects of the prosody
                that might not come across as forcefully on the page, offering the audience a
                communal interpretation of these texts that is markedly different from a private
                reading. Moreover, we discovered that close reading can also happen on stage in
                illuminating ways. I was pleasantly surprised to learn, for instance, that Baldwin
                recognized opportunities for humor in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>.
                This occurs in Act I, for instance, when Mercury fails to persuade the obstinate
                Prometheus to succumb to Jupiter and reveal his secret knowledge to the god. For
                Baldwin, the actor playing Mercury’s minor, yet consequential, role could generate
                laughter by exaggerating his pitiable pleas and sense of self-defeat as the
                unsuccessful mediator between Prometheus and Jupiter. Baldwin pointed to the faun
                scene in Act II as another possibility for humor, particularly if the two actors
                emphasize the fauns’ fascination with the beautiful, ethereal, music-making spirits
                around them. Yet another opportunity for humor includes Jupiter’s lengthy monologue
                at the start of Act III, if the actor playing him succeeds at bringing out the
                melodramatic nature of the despot’s character. Baldwin offered Jupiter’s opening
                lines as an illustration of what he meant: “Ye congregated powers of heaven, who
                share / The glory and strength of him ye serve / Rejoice! Henceforth I am
                omnipotent” (III.1-3). He envisioned a talented actor reading these lines not only
                with a strong voice but also with an exaggerated “villainous laugh” to follow
                Jupiter’s ironic claims of omnipotence amid his crumbling empire. As a caricature of
                evil, according to Baldwin, Jupiter could offer the play’s greatest moment of comic
                relief with a skilled actor lending the appropriately hyperbolic inflections.<note place="foot" resp="author">Cox and other critics
                            have analyzed the features of masque and melodrama in Shelley’s play,
                            and such comedic effect would further support these lines of
                            inquiry.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <title level="m">Manfred</title> staging also highlighted the humor of Byron’s play, which
                    might appear surprising for a cosmic drama that centers on the agony of its
                    hero. A good illustration of this occurred during Manfred’s opening monologue,
                    when he, in his attempt to conjure the spirits of earth and air, fails to summon
                    them not just once but twice. Combine such writing with a talented actor who can
                    use silence and bedazzled facial expressions to his advantage to yield a comical
                    reaction from the audience. Consider also the moment in Act II when one of the
                    spirits in the Hall of Arimanes remarks that, “Had [Manfred] been one of us,” he
                    “would have made / an awful spirit” (II.iv.161-2). With this line, Byron perhaps
                    intended to signal the awe-inducing presence of his Faustian hero, in accordance
                    with the archaic meaning of the word, “awful.” Still, a contemporary audience
                    cannot help but hear the term’s more familiar modern resonance: had Manfred been
                    a spirit, in fact, he would have made a bad one. Needless to say, the crowd at
                    the Loreto Theater roared with laughter. Along with many other similar
                    opportunities, it became clear that the play has the capacity to be performed in
                    a way that brings out light-hearted, humorous moments. As an audience member,
                    rather than as a conventional reader, I took away from the experience that 
                    Byron—in addition to creating a “play” based on the scandalous affair with his half
                    sister, Augusta, which had seized the imagination of a continent—was having
                    fun with writing his drama. The performance pushed the generic expectations of
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> by
                    shedding light on its ambiguities as a hybrid work between the tragic and the
                    comic.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            As Alice Levine and Jerome McGann contend in
                                this volume, the play is not only a work of tragedy and stoicism but
                                also a comedy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Despite my initial skepticism about the limitations of
                    being a passive spectator—of being subjected to the directors’ and actors’
                    interpretation of the text—I have embraced such readings, however
                    idiosyncratic, as an opportunity. Even if I had disagreed with any particular
                    actor’s reading style, the experience of hearing
                    such an interpretation still proved fruitful, since it invited the immediacy of
                    varying reactions and responses. For instance, when Gisela Chípe, the actor
                    playing the Phantom of Astarte, read out her final word on stage, “Manfred,”
                    before leaving him and disappearing from the scene altogether, she uttered his
                    name with a heightened tone of desperation—as if she were beseeching Manfred
                    to join her on the other side among the dead. For me, this interpretation seems
                    to be a misreading. To my mind, the character of Astarte must exhibit both
                    calmness and detachment, for she models the kind of stoic disposition that
                    Manfred will fully acquire by the end of the play. Manfred and Astarte are,
                    after all, like each other in “lineaments” and share the “same lone thoughts and
                    wanderings” (II.ii.105-9). Nevertheless, the distinctive mode in which Chípe
                    read her line prodded me toward such reflection in the first place. Her reading
                    offered another way of interpreting Byron’s lines, inviting my reaction as well
                    as adding to our critical discourse.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the foregoing benefits, I wish to highlight the rewards of making
                these Romantic-era dramas come performatively alive through a staged reading, an
                auspicious alternative when a full production is not feasible. Despite my initial
                hope back in 2012 of producing full stagings of these works, it was through this
                unintended and initially less desirable medium, in fact, that I discovered an
                apposite vehicle for realizing even the most unplayable of these dramas as
                successful theatrical experiences. The staged reading is unusual in that it fuses
                the conventions of silent, individual, and private reading practices with that of
                communal and public performance. The medium permits actors, readers, spectators, and
                auditors to intersect in a space where all groups experience the text simultaneously
                yet differently. Actors perform by dramatically reading their lines aloud, while
                using minimal gesturing to evoke action, interaction, and movement. They serve as
                the intermediaries between the text and the audience members who absorb the drama as
                spectators and auditors.</p>
                  <p>While having actors read aloud from scripts might appear to restrict the suspension
                of disbelief that audience members might enjoy in more traditional theatrical
                milieus, the austere, minimalist format of this performance style heightens the
                reading experience in some ways. That is, without the spectacle of scenery,
                elaborate costuming, or other visual effects, the staged reading emphasizes the
                sound and substance of the text’s language, as the text is felt to be more present.
                Through a staged reading, all participants are invariably reminded that two distinct
                populations—actors and audience members (rather than characters in a drama)—have
                come together to “read” a script in different ways. By this I mean that audience
                members are permitted the benefits afforded to them in a conventional encounter with
                a text, as the silent, individual reading practice transforms into an enhanced
                communal experience in which texts are read physically, interpetively, and
                imaginatively. Without the distraction of visual effects or actors’ bodily movement,
                audience members also participate actively by collaborating creatively in the group
                process. As they envision the dramatic scenes in their minds, they conduct an
                interpretation of text within an alternate and stimulating site for reading and
                analysis outside of the classroom or the library. This reading community also has
                its pedagogical advantages by being a pragmatic way to invite students into the
                world of these difficult dramatic works. The staged reading allows students to enjoy
                the pleasures of poetic language and sound as well as the synergy generated by
                actors responding to the text’s dialogic structure. In animating the text in such a
                way, the experience draws students into each writer’s artistic vision. </p>
                  <p>Beyond the benefits for these diverse groups, the staged reading offers new ways to
                confront old challenges that scholars have identified in thinking about closet
                dramas. Catherine Burroughs, for instance, has written that the genre is “hybrid,
                oscillatory, and ambiguous,” contending that closet plays from the entire Georgian
                period (1737—1832) generally “blur the lines between voice and body, reading and
                staging, and gesture and speech” (445).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        In our staged reading experiences, the actors would complement their speech
                        with gestures of action rather than engaging fully in codified
                        movements.</note> For her, these works are unsuitable for elaborate
                theatrical productions. In <title level="m">Poetry and Politics of the Cockney
                    School</title>, moreover, Jeffrey Cox argues that works such as Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> attempted to remake contemporary melodrama
                by locating a “generic site” that “draws upon a strong theatrical tradition to
                imagine a stage beyond the theater” (Cox 124). He argues that Shelley, by seeking to
                negotiate “a proper balance between word and stage effect,” needed a theater other
                than what existed in the early nineteenth century (Cox 129).  In other words,
                Shelley’s “visions of embodied possibility” comprise an “imaginative theater” that
                seemed unreal in his day but might be realized in ours (Cox 145).<note place="foot" resp="author">Agreeing with Cox, Quillin also
                        suggests: “the poetic form of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                        defines the dramatic action, making the reader complicit in a closet drama
                        that is nonetheless theatrical in origin” (21).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the actors performed by reading from their scripts during each Red Bull
                performance, they negotiated the balance between voice and gesture and between
                language and the body. They partook of an in-between or mediated space where speech
                and writing became interdependent. They employed a type of performance that
                addressed the needs of these generically hybrid and “oscillatory” works of poetic
                drama. What I am suggesting is that the staged reading converts theory into practice
                by transmuting this imaginative style of drama into the material reality of a
                theatrical space. It provides an alternative means of seeing these texts as
                performable objects, allowing for the integration of the hybrid “generic site” (that
                Cox identifies) into a <emph>cross-medial site</emph> between voice and
                print and between the stage and the page. As this mixed medium offers an experience
                between a private reading and the grandness of the full stage production, in which
                the spectator experiences the negotiation between “word and stage effect,” it allows
                such experimental, neglected works of theater to emerge with ease at long last from
                their closets. </p>
                  <p>This take on the possibilities of the staged reading expands upon similar reflections
                recorded in the last few years with regard to other Byron productions. Writing about
                her own production of <title level="m">Cain</title> in 2010 at the University of
                British Columbia, Fannina Waubert de Puiseau has argued that the staged reading
                offered her production an opportunity to “look beyond the traditional stage” in
                order to inhabit a “transitional space between page and stage” (427). In his review
                of a ‘rehearsed reading’ of <title level="m">Manfred</title> at the King’s Head
                Theatre in London (performed on March 11, 2007), Michael Simpson noted that such a
                collective performance dramatizes the “act of reading a text” (44), while the
                spectator’s and reader’s “imagination [is] conducted within a collective world of
                print” (51). Simpson further suggests that this theatre of print “short-circuits the
                critical polarity of stage versus page” (48). In “theatricalizing text,” he
                contends, the rehearsed reading also “traces the glamorously infamous scene of
                reading” at Villa Diodati in the Summer of 1816 that gave rise not only to
                    Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> but also to Mary Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (and John Polidori’s <title level="m">The
                    Vampyre</title>): two works that Simpson argues are preoccupied with animation and
                resurrection. As it pays homage to the 1816 occasion that gave it life, the staged
                reading also reinforces the fact that Manfred is not simply “isolated in poses of
                egotistical sublime”; he is also “beset by external forces” (48). Byron’s text is a
                mixture of profound monologue and “intensely competitive dialogue,” as the staged
                reading honors the oscillation that, as Burroughs reminds us, is an integral part of
                the peculiarities of such dramas (48).</p>
                  <p>In the end, the success of these staged readings
                became possible because of a series of negotiations and compromises between literary
                critics and theater experts. The Red Bull team showed that professional talent,
                direction, and even adaptation can animate even the most experimental and
                rhythmically dense among these dramas. The staged reading enabled us to meet on
                middle ground—to discover a happy medium between poetry and drama, theater artists
                and scholars, art and criticism, theory and practice, page and stage, and the public
                and private spheres. Through Red Bull’s commitment to staging “under-performed”
                plays, this joint project has permitted the New York City theatergoing community to
                experience Romantic works as performances rather than as poetry in a private reading
                or classroom: Romanticism on the stage rather than on the printed or digitized page.
                At the same time, this collaboration has drawn attention once again to the Romantic
                fascination with the mixing of genres. In the spirit of the period that gave us the
                lyrical ballad, the historical novel, and the lyrical drama, another hybrid form—the
                staged reading—can be included as both an interpretative and performative
                possibility for these dramatic works.</p>

                    theatrical genre of his time, melodrama. We place melodrama’s facility in
                    appropriating materials from other cultural forms alongside a less-acknowledged
                    corollary: that the melodrama was also itself a major object of cultural
                    consumption, enough so that a text like  <title level="m">Manfred</title> stands
                    in mutually defining relation to plays like <title level="m">Bluebeard</title>, <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, and <title level="m">Rugantino</title>, both technically and thematically. Canvassing
                    critical writing on consumption from Neil McKendrick and John Brewer to Colin
                    Campbell and Timothy Morton, we argue for the melodrama as an exemplum for
                    understanding Romantic cultural consumption and appropriation, fed as it is by
                    popular forms like the gothic while yet providing a critique of consumption
                    similar to those we associate with Romantic poetry.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">We were both very pleased to be invited to join the special
                    Romantic Bicentennials Commemorative Event: Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>: Performance and Symposium. Many thanks to Omar F. Miranda
                    and Jerome McGann, as well as everyone associated with the bicentennial project.
                    It was a rare treat, indeed, to be able to watch Red Bull Theater’s staged
                    reading of Byron’s play, which brought the text to life in exciting new ways.
                    Once we saw an initial list of symposium topics, it became obvious that we were
                    taking up similar questions: Jeff had been thinking about <title level="m">Manfred</title> and melodrama for several years and had written about
                    Byron’s play in his <title level="m">Romanticism in the Shadow of War</title>;
                    Michael had just talked on the topic at the MLA Convention in Philadelphia
                    (2017). Having worked together before, we agreed to co-author a piece. Our
                    writing process began with Jeff responding to Michael’s paper and then with both
                    of us pursuing a back and forth exchange, as we added new ideas and developed
                    each other’s further; by the end, we had a truly collaboratively-written talk.
                    Then, given that this was a performative celebration of Byron’s drama and, given
                    the fact that we were scheduled to speak late in the day, we decided we should
                    do something a little performative ourselves, dividing up the paper into what
                    seemed to us logical sections or finding what seemed to be good points for there
                    to be a change in voice; we also decided to read the quotations being cited
                    during each other’s passages. What we present here is a transcript of what we
                    delivered, with a few corrections made and references added in; we appear as the
                    characters JC and MG. In the spirit of our own arguments, we hope some consumer
                    of this piece will be able to develop further than we could the idea of
                    melodramatic consumption. </p>

                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> We take our epigraph from Michael’s recent talk at the 2017 MLA in
                    Philadelphia:
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Consumption, in fact, might also be the best way to understand the hybridity
                        both of melodrama and of <title level="m">Manfred</title>.</note>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Elsewhere I have argued that melodrama is a machine built for speed (Cox
                    <title level="m">Romanticism</title> 51). I now want to follow Michael and argue it is a machine built
                    for speedy consumption—that is, it is designed to absorb and to digest
                    whatever is put in its way. And in this way, melodrama became arguably the key
                    dramatic form of the period, absorbing not just other theatrical modes, but
                    topical events, fads, ideas, and ideologies. To give just one example: Thomas
                    Holcroft's <title level="m">Tale of Mystery</title>, performed at Covent Garden
                    in 1802, was the first melodrama in English to be identified by that generic
                    marker. The play is a translation/adaptation of a French play, René-Charles
                    Guilbert de Pixérécourt’s <title level="m">Coelina</title>, which itself was an
                    adaptation of a novel for the stage. Just as Holcroft imported a hot theatrical
                    commodity from Paris, so had Pixérécourt sampled a wide range of cultural goods,
                    as James L. Smith reminds us: 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Almost everything in <title level="m">Coelina</title> was borrowed, and not only from the romance of that
                        title by Ducray-Duminil which provided Pixérécourt with his first two acts.
                        The rugged mountain scenery of Act Three . . . was first built for [a
                        production of] Schiller. Boulevard pantomime provides the action-packed but
                        almost wordless finale. The singing miller and clodhopping peasantry appear
                        by courtesy of Sedaine's music-drama. But the greatest debt is to the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fr">drame</foreign>, that genre of serious prose
                        tragicomedy which derives its sentimentality from Cumberland and its
                        bourgeois didacticism from the horrible homilies of George Lillo. (Smith
                        3)</note>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Pixérécourt, in many ways the father of classic melodrama,
                    did not so much create a form full-grown from his brow as cobble together a
                    hybrid, an assemblage of all the bits and pieces to hand.</p>
                  <p>Consuming everything in its path, the melodrama was also itself a major object of
                    cultural consumption. Comprehending this requires that we recall the melodrama’s
                    dominance within the cultural industry that was the Romantic-era theater. In
                    France, there were over 30,000 performances of Pixérécourt’s plays alone between
                    1797 and 1834. His counterpart, Auguste von Kotzebue, dominated the German
                    stage, so much so that even Goethe at his theater in Weimar offered some 87
                    stagings of Kotzebue’s plays compared to 19 of his own and 18 of Schiller’s.
                    Kotzebue also, in the years leading up to the premiere of <title level="m">A
                        Tale of Mystery,</title> ruled over the London stage, accounting for nearly
                    a quarter of all performances at Drury Lane and Covent Garden between 1798 and
                    1800. It is for this reason that ten of the nineteen plays in Benjamin
                    Thompson’s <title level="m">German Theatre</title> of 1800 are by Kotzebue;
                    Goethe has but one play. Melodrama in both its parts and wholes circulated
                    throughout Europe and beyond, so that we have Holcroft adapting Pixérécourt,
                    Pixérécourt drawing on Kotzebue, and Kotzebue, as least according to Coleridge,
                    stealing from earlier English writers.<note place="foot" resp="author">See

                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Again, we need to stress the ability of the melodrama to absorb materials from
                    just about anywhere. The plot of a melodrama might be derived from myth or
                    history, the Bible, or the news. A play might be set in medieval Europe or
                    roughly contemporary America or some imagined South Seas locale—Pixérécourt's
                    plays alone range from Robinson Crusoe’s island to the mines of Poland. While
                    perhaps not going as far as the pantomime in its engagement with contemporary
                    fashion—harlequinades, after all, were at the cutting edge of product
                    placement, with, for example, a card manufacturer paying for a scene in Charles
                    Farley’s <title level="m">Harlequin and Fortune</title> (Covent Garden, 1815) to
                    advertise his newly redesigned deck—melodramas were seen as tackling the
                    issues of the day, from absentee landlordism in Pocock’s <title level="m">The Miller
                        and his Men</title> (Covent Garden, 1813) to slavery in Fawcett’s <title level="m">Obi; or Three Finger’d Jack</title> (Haymarket, 1800); they were
                    read as taking up “fashionable,” if questionable, moral theories, as Coleridge
                    makes clear in his attack upon Maturin and Kotzebue in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>; and they were experienced as representing the
                    rhythms of contemporary life. While we think of the melodrama as engaging in
                    reductive exaggeration and faked emotion, the <title level="m">Times</title>
                    (November 15, 1802) reviewer of Holcroft’s <title level="m">Tale of
                        Mystery</title> emphasized its ability to capture “real life,” arguing the
                    play is 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> natural and characteristic . . . There is no extravagance of
                        idea—no elaborate research after simile and metaphor . . . the thought
                        seems to arise from the moment, the words appear to be suggested by the
                        circumstances which pass under the eyes of the spectator. (2)</note>
                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Much like the 1970s “Made for TV Movies” that were “ripped from the headlines,”
                    the melodrama convinced its audiences that it was mirroring their lives even if
                    it was through a glass not so much darkly as immediately sensational.</p>
                  <p>As a machine built for consumption, melodrama needs to be placed within the rise
                    of the consumer society that has been described by Neil McKendrick, John Brewer,
                    and J. H. Plumb, that has been theorized by Colin Campbell in relation to a
                    “romantic ethic,” and that has been seen by, for example, Tim Morton as a key to
                    Romantic poetics, what Morton identifies as a poetics of spice. Campbell follows
                    the historians in seeing the rise of a bourgeois consumer culture that is marked
                    by the rise of the novel, a cult of romantic love, and the creation of the
                    modern fashion industry. He identifies a distinctly modern hedonism grounded in
                    dreams of desire, with individuals 
                    <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> not so much seek[ing]
                        satisfaction from products, as pleasure from the self-illusory experiences
                        which they construct from their associated meanings. The essential activity
                        of consumption is thus not the actual selection, purchase, or even use of
                        products, but the imaginative pleasure-seeking to which the product image
                        lends itself, "real" consumption being largely a resultant of this
                        "mentalistic" hedonism. (89) </note>
                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Having constructed this
                    imaginative hedonism, Campbell then finds Romanticism, with its exaltation of
                    the imagination, as providing an ethos to support this spirit of modern
                    consumerism, as it locates in the imaginative creation of pleasure a
                    counter-argument against attacks on emotionalism and sentimentality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> The Gothic novel appears in Campbell’s account as a particularly egregious
                    example of how literature can be put in the service of a consumerism that
                    traffics in the promulgation of day dreams and longings for the exotic, of
                    desires that stand against the routines of everyday life. But as anyone who has
                    pondered the <emph>Fate of Frankenstein</emph> (<title level="m">Presumption;
                        Or, The Fate of Frankenstein;</title> English Opera House, 1823) knows, the
                    Gothic novel was consumed, at least in part, by the Gothic play. Horace
                    Walpole's <title level="m">Castle of Otranto</title> had been out of print for
                    fourteen years when Robert Jephson first adapted it for the stage as the <title level="m">Count of Narbonne</title> for Covent Garden in 1781—and since
                    then, Walpole's novel has never been out of print. The suggestion here is one
                    less of adaptation—novel to drama—than symbiosis. Walpole's gothic novel may
                    have given rise to Jephson's gothic play, but the adaptation in turn renewed its
                    original.</p>
                  <p>Or, moving forward a decade or two, we might remember that Matthew Lewis wrote
                    only one <title level="m">Monk</title> (1796), but that there existed no fewer
                    than four adaptations of it by the turn of the nineteenth century. Two were for
                    the stage: Charles Farley's grand ballet of action, <title level="m">Raymond and
                        Agnes</title> (Covent Garden, 1797), and James Boaden's <title level="m">Aurelio and Miranda</title> (Drury Lane, 1798). These in turn inspired a
                    chapbook version in 1798 and a ballad retelling in <title level="m">Tales of
                        Terror</title> in 1801. And, if we're to believe Lewis's bibliographers, the
                    success of these productions in turn inspired Lewis—who, like Walpole and
                    Maturin, was both a novelist and a dramatist—to adapt from himself, producing
                    a chap-book version of the Raymond and Agnes story and then, later, a melodrama,
                        <title level="m">Raymond and Agnes: or, The Travellers Benighted</title>. As
                    you probably already suspect, Lewis's melodramatic act of self-consumption was,
                    of course, consumed in turn—in this case, by H. W. Grosette, who produced what
                    became the standard dramatic version of Lewis's novel, <title level="m">Raymond
                        and Agnes, or the Bleeding Nun of Lindenberg, an interesting
                        melodrama</title> (Norwich, 1811; Haymarket, 1811).</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> What we haven't yet mentioned, however, is that most foundational aesthetic
                    form that melodrama consumed—music—especially music expressive of the action
                    at hand. Looking again to the <title level="m">Times</title> review of <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, we find in it a fairly startling
                    pronouncement: 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> The hurry and the perturbation of the scene were
                        forcibly depicted by the agitated notes of the orchestra, and this new
                        adjunct to the interest of the drama was immediately felt by the whole
                        audience. (2)</note>
                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Part of what made melodrama feel not just new but
                    also more realistic for audiences was its successful borrowing of incidental
                    music from ballet and pantomime and applying it to dramas of suspense. One might
                    say that melodrama's composers discovered in such music an uncomic potential,
                    not just in expressing physical action but also underlying mental anguish, as
                    when, in <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, to disquieting music,
                        "<emph>Bonamo reads the Letter to himself with great agitation</emph>"
                    (Busby 23), or "<emph>Enter Fiametta, Alarmed</emph>" (Busby 9). Such scenes
                    feel incredibly old-fashioned to us, smacking as they do of silent film; but to
                    audiences at the turn of the nineteenth century, they constituted a revolution
                    in naturalism similar to that heralded by David Garrick half a century
                    earlier.</p>
                  <p> As we've noted, earlier studies of Romanticism and consumer culture have
                    unearthed an overarching interplay between a consuming society and a Romantic
                    ethos (Campbell), and a tendency to treat commodities simultaneously as material
                    objects to be consumed and as vehicles for creating a poetics of transumption
                    (Morton). With melodramatic music, we aren't far from both. The scores of
                    melodramas were hot properties; composers quickly converted them to sheet music
                    for single instruments, usually piano forte, and sold them at a premium to
                    musical and theatrical amateurs keen for the newest sounds—who then would
                    transform these materials back into private performances, both musical and
                    theatrical. For <title level="m">The Castle Spectre</title>, for example, the
                    British Library holds no fewer than five separate musical publications, most in
                    multiple copies—of the overture, of individual popular songs, and of the
                    celebrated ghost scene, itself so popular that London publishers printed both it
                    and its source music, a chaconne of Jomelli, at great profit. With <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery,</title> we see something even more innovative—not
                    merely selections, as was traditional, but the entire score, including
                    overture, songs, book, and the incidental music.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> In our search for an exemplum of Romantic consumption, then, we wish to
                    suggest that the melodrama provides a better example than Campbell’s deluding
                    novel or Morton’s spicy poetry. Melodrama attends to both strands of Romantic
                    consumption. At once fed by and feeding the Gothic in all its forms, it provided
                    a site for fashion and for idealized love. Yet it also—at least in the hands
                    of its greatest practitioners—provided a critique of consumption similar to
                    those Morton locates in Romantic poetry. And so, in this twin spirit, let’s turn
                    to one final site of melodramatic consumption—a most gothic instance, the
                    library—that place where Colin Jager, following Deidre Lynch, finds writers
                    tapping the 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline">
                        <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> twin impulses, commercial and historical, of modernity . . .
                        [where] acts of canon creation are poised between the desire for the dead to
                        be safely dead so that they can be smoothly incorporated into a national
                        heritage, and the need to reanimate the dead, bring them back to life, so
                        that the living will be haunted by the power of the dead writers in whose
                        tradition they stand (pp. 145, 144).</note>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Certainly at this point we
                    are not far from <title level="m">Manfred</title>, nor should we be surprised to
                    find various melodramas, most conspicuously Grosette's <title level="m">Raymond
                        and Agnes</title>, opening in "A Gothic Library" in the Castle of Don Felix,
                    where a bookish Raymond is about to leave off book learning for the more
                    dangerous realism of a very Gothic world.</p>
                  <p>And if we move beyond literal libraries to other Gothic sites where books and
                    texts are encountered—through ubiquitous Gothic halls and Gothic laboratories
                    to the Faustian Gothic gallery of <title level="m">Manfred</title>—we can see
                    into the ways that melodrama—especially the early Gothic and Ghost melodrama
                    of Byron's time—thinks about its consumption of the past, its need both to
                    destroy and to purchase the cultural capital that underwrites it. And that may
                    be in part because early melodrama so frequently yokes the evocation of an
                    imagined Gothic past to the simulacra of the now offered by the melodrama.</p>
                  <p>Like the Gothic novels that Lynch and Jager discuss, <title level="m">Manfred</title> is obsessed with its literary precursors—Shakespeare,
                    Marlowe, Goethe, Lewis, Wordsworth, and on and on. It is significant that in the
                    first scene in the Gothic gallery, when Manfred goes beyond Faust to summon up
                    not a single <foreign xml:lang="de">Erdgeist</foreign> but a series of spirits,
                    he does so on the basis of a “written charm / Which gives me power upon you”
                    (I.i.35-6). Given <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s status as a closet drama,
                    so far so good, and we half-expect Manfred to produce a volume and read from it.
                    But this is not the way the scene goes. His first command not heeded, Manfred
                    moves beyond texts to "sign[s]" (I.i.38) and again bids the spirits appear—but
                    in vain. Finally, he must abandon text and even written signs for spoken
                    incantation, calling on:

                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> And only then do the spirits come. They do so, moreover, in a scene
                    as filled with gothic markers of theatrical conspicuous consumption as Manfred's
                    invocation is of gothic imagery. For Manfred's "gothic gallery" recalls that
                    most expensive of mechanized theatrical sets, the famous "blue chamber" of
                    George Colman the Younger's <title level="m">Blue-beard</title> (Drury Lane,
                    1798). And the seven spirits Manfred summons harken back to the mixed dramas of
                    the 1790s and 1800s, and to the supernaturally crammed stages of John Philip
                    Kemble's revivals of <title level="m">Macbeth</title> and <title level="m">Richard III</title>.</p>
                  <p>Still more remarkable is the spirits' collective response, which is preceded by
                    the following stage direction: "<emph>A star is seen at the darker end of the
                        gallery: it is stationary; and a voice is heard singing</emph>"
                    (I.i.49).</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Last night we were treated to <title level="m">Manfred</title> performed; in
                    the days leading up to that performance, both Jeff and I sought to imagine what
                    this first scene would be like, particularly this question of singing. Would
                    there be music? Should there be? If Byron's play had premiered at Drury Lane
                    during the 1815-16 season, how sumptuously would it have been staged, and with
                    what kind of incidental music? If we wish to follow melodrama's consuming
                    practices to that imagined premiere, we think that melodrama would have found
                    its match in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, whose opening scene declares its
                    readiness to harness melodramatic spectacle and tactics to turn them back into—nay,
                    to revive—tragedy, even though its structure is not the traditionally
                    legitimate five acts, but melodrama's truncated three. Given the success of
                    Coleridge's <title level="m">Remorse</title> three years earlier, we believe
                    that Byron's play would have been the hit tragedy he was looking for the year he
                    sat on Drury Lane's governing board—the year he ransacked yet another library,
                    Drury's manuscript collection of fallow plays, looking for a tragedy that could
                    hold the stage. Imagine this first scene of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                    melodramatically, with the spirits’ incantation (I.i.193-262) chanted or sung as
                    Manfred is overcome by his own grief. Add music expressive of both the words and
                    of Manfred's emotional turmoil. Finally, place it all in a cavernous gothic
                    library—and it's hard not to expect the melodrama to continue. All this in the
                    opening scene of a play that supposedly eschews theatricality generally and
                    melodrama particularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> If we had world enough and time we could go on to talk about other ways in
                    which <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers a kind of transumption of
                    melodramatic consumption. If the melodrama absorbs the theatrical tactics of a
                    myriad of forms from tragedy to pantomime, Byron’s play takes on the music,
                    spectacular sets, and supernatural machinery of the melodrama to use it in the
                    service of a new kind of tragedy. If the melodrama often explores a family
                    mystery that, once solved, allows a return to a conventional domestic order,
                    Byron regrounds family relations in the tragic sphere of incest. If the lead
                    characters of the melodrama, in the words of Hegel, pursue “spiritual conversion
                    and surrender of self" in order to reassert “ordinary morality” (92), Manfred
                    repeatedly refuses to give up the complexity of a selfhood he sees as standing
                    beyond any morality, ordinary or not. Byron consumes—completes and destroys—the
                    melodrama in the name of Romantic tragic drama.</p>
                  <p>But there is a final twist to this story of eating and being eaten: when Alfred
                    Bunn staged <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834, he returned it to its
                    melodramatic roots. The title page of the printed text highlights the

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">Alfred Bunn’s production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (Covent Garden, October
                    29,1834 to February 18, 1835) maintained a successful season and was regularly
                    performed during subsequent years. The major constituents, however, were in
                    unfortunate competition. Stage lighting gave emphasis to the immense paintings by
                    Thomas and William Grieve. The playbill forewarned the audience that “Chandeliers
                    around the Front of the Boxes will not be used on the Evenings of the Performance of
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title>.” The backdrop paintings were crucial to Bunn’s
                    production. “In order to produce the necessary effects of Light and Shade,”
                    downstage action took place in the shadows. Henry Gaskell Denvil in the lead role as
                    Manfred sought to impersonate the author, though dead and gone, reanimating himself
                    as the character condemned to an internal vigil. His performance was intended as
                    another stage enactment of Lord Byron and his personal scandal, representing on
                    stage an impersonation of Byron performing the role of the Byronic character. The
                    impersonations had become more familiar to London audiences than any of the fading
                    memories of the poet. As Byron himself confessed, Edmund Kean was exceptionally
                    skilled in his impersonations. When Denvil took on the role of Manfred at Covent
                    Garden, his performance was burdened by expectations that he would not simply
                    impersonate Byron in that role, but also reprise Edmund Kean’s well-known
                    impersonations of Byron. Also competing with Denvil’s performance as a voice in the
                    shadows beneath the vast backdrop paintings, was the full orchestral score by Henry
                    Rowley Bishop, who rearranged lyrics as popular opera with elaborate solos and
                    choruses. Among the most striking alterations was the retention of the song of the
                    witches (“As the raven sits / On the raven stone”) from the concluding scene of
                    Byron’s original version. Bishop has transformed the song for Ellen Tree, with
                    chorus, at the close of her scene as the Witch of the Alps. Bishop also altered
                    Byron’s revised conclusion, substituting a song made of lines from 
                    <title level="m">The Giaour</title> (“This—as the stream and ocean greet”). Bunn succeeded in
                    adapting <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a spectacular musical production, but
                    Bishop’s abbreviated and rearranged libretto deprived the audience of much of
                    Byron’s dramatic poem. </p>

               <p>Opening with a Faustian scene in which Manfred abjures his previous studies that “did
                not avail” (I.i.12), Byron introduces the time-conscious “vigil,” the compulsive
                need to “watch” and “to look within” (I.i.7-8). In each of the successive
                encounters, the temporality of “watching” is modulated in accord with a scheme other
                than the familiar course of earthbound time. With the spirits of earth and air, as
                with the demons of the Hall of Arimanes, Manfred shares an unconstrained vista of
                universal time and space. “The lightning of my being,” he tells the Seven Spirits,
                “is as bright, / Pervading, and far darting as your own” (I.i.155-6). Affirming his
                lot outside of normal mortality, he tells the Chamois Hunter “Look on me.”
                (II.i.42). “Look on me / Or watch my watchings,” he tells the Witch of the Alps
                (II.ii.128-9). To the Phantom of Astarte, he says, “Look on me!” (II.iv.119). To the
                Abbot of St. Maurice, the request is again repeated: “Look on me!” (III.i.138) and
                “Look upon me!” (III.i.149). While keeping watch upon the tower, Manuel relates to
                Herman how Astarte was once “companion of his wanderings / And watchings”
                (III.iii.43-4). Even as he prepares to die, Manfred defies the demons who come to
                fetch him. Unlike his Faustian prototype, Manfred has made no pact with the devil.
                He owes his mastery of dark powers to his “superior science” and “length of
                watching” (III.iv.116).</p>
               <p>The staging of <title level="m">Manfred</title> might have readily realized the motif
                of <emph>watching</emph> by implicating the audience in the different
                modes of witnessing Manfred as dominant character from scene to scene. Instead,
                Alfred Bunn’s premier production of the play at Covent Garden (October 29, 1834 to
                February 18, 1835) decentred the role of the title character with the theatrical
                enhancements of lighting, setting, and music. To take advantage of the poetic
                contexts of the demonic and sublime, Bunn commissioned a series of immense theatre
                paintings by the Grieves. Henry Gaskell Denvil was expected to perform the character
                of Manfred in the established manner of impersonating Byron performing the role of
                the Byronic character. Bunn was persuaded by Francis Jeffrey to accept that
                “obscurity is part of its grandeur.” This entailed a pretence of secrecy regarding
                “the painful nature of the circumstances,” which Jeffrey declared arose “from the
                disappointment or fatal issue of an incestuous passion on which its distress is
                founded” (Jeffrey 122). The hints of brother-sister incest in Manfred’s relation to
                Astarte were understood to be Byron’s own confession of his illicit relationship
                with his half-sister, Augusta Mary Byron. On August 17, 1807, Augusta married her
                cousin, Colonel George Leigh, and had a number of children by him, but Byron was
                acknowledged as father of her daughter, Elizabeth Medora Leigh, born in 1814. Two
                years later, Byron’s marriage to Annabelle Milbank had failed and he departed from
                England amidst rumours of incest with his half-sister (<title level="m">Broadview
                </title>13-4).</p>
               <p>Among Bunn’s entrepreneurial ploys to insure a sensation on opening night at Covent
                Garden was the invitation of a special guest. There was an electric buzz of
                excitement as the audience waited for the curtain to rise on the premier performance
                of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (29 October 1834). The buzz was hushed when the
                audience witnessed one last spectator take her place in one of the central boxes.
                The Honorable Augusta Leigh had arrived to watch the play that fueled the stories of
                incest (Tunbridge 212-36). Twenty years had passed since the
                birth of their daughter (April 15, 1814), and ten years since the poet’s death at
                Missolonghi (April 19, 1824), but the old
                scandals were as lively as ever. During the conjuration of Astarte (II.iv), heads
                were twisting back and forth in the attempt to judge the reactions to the events on
                stage by the lady in the box seat.</p>
               <p>The impersonations of Byron had become more familiar to London audiences than any of
                the fading memories of the poet. As Byron himself confessed, Edmund Kean was
                exceptionally skilled in his impersonations of Byron. Kean’s impersonations were
                only mildly embarrassing when performed in private. They were far too convincing
                when performed publicly, as in Kean’s performance as Salim in <title level="m">The
                    Bride of Abydos</title> (Drury Lane, February 5, 1818). When Denvil took on the
                role of Manfred at Covent Garden, his performance was burdened by expectations that
                he would not simply impersonate Byron in that role but also reprise Edmund Kean’s
                well-known impersonations of Byron.</p>
               <p>At odds with his own denial of any ambitions for theatre performance, Byron achieved
                a far more extensive stage presence than any other playwright of the Romantic era.
                He attained this prominence in spite of the limited and belated success of his own
                dramatic works. The popularity of the Byronic character seemed to follow inevitably
                from the partially autobiographical revelations developed in his literary
                protagonists. Many years ago, David Erdmann observed a closely related paradox that
                Byron should declare his purpose “to reform the stage” yet repeatedly deny his
                intentions to have his plays performed (Erdman 5-6). Upon submitting 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> to his publisher, John Murray, Byron confessed “an
                invincible repugnance” of the stage (March 9, 1817, <title level="m">BLJ</title>
                V:185). In a letter to Douglas Kinnaird, he declared that 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is “the very Antipodes of the stage and is meant to be so—it is
                all in the Alps &amp; the other world—and as mad as Bedlam—I do not know that it
                is even fit for publication—the persons are all magicians—ghosts—&amp; the
                evil principle — with a mixed mythology of my own” (March 25, 1817,
                <title level="m"> BLJ</title> V:194-195). </p>
               <p>One week later, Byron wrote again to Kinnaird to offer yet another reason why
                “success on the stage is not to me an object of ambition.” The reason is much like
                the one he borrowed from Milton’s Satan and gave to Manfred: “’Tis better to reign
                in Hell than to serve in Heaven” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, I.254-5;
                III.i.73). Neither success nor failure in serving the fickle audiences of London
                would bring any satisfaction. “Unless I could beat them all—it would be nothing”
                (March 31, 1817, <title level="m">BLJ</title> V:196). At odds with his disclaimers,
                Byron expressed again and again his thoughts on how his plays might be successfully
                performed (Erdman 219-43). The argument whether Byron’s works were to be relegated
                to the sub-genre of “closet drama” is rendered specious and irrelevant by the
                repeated success of the plays when revived on stage following the poet’s death.</p>
               <p>Of Byron’s eight plays, <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> was the only one
                performed during his lifetime, and Byron protested vehemently against that
                performance. In the Preface to the play, he wrote “I have had no view to the stage.”
                As principle reason, he cited his doubt in the competency of an audience to judge
                his work for better or worse: “Were I capable of writing a play which could be
                deemed stage worthy, success would give me no pleasure, and failure great pain. It
                is for this reason that even during the time of being one of the committee of one of
                the theatres, I never made the attempt, and never will” (<title level="m">Poetical
                    Works</title> 407-8). The performance of 
                <title level="m">Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice</title> (Drury Lane, April 25, 1821) featured John
                Cooper in the title role. The aged Doge is first angered by Steno’s taunts about the
                infidelity of his young wife, then enraged by the refusal of the Council to punish
                the perpetrator, and finally driven in frenzy to a conspiracy to overthrow his own
                government. Partly because Robert Elliston, manager at Drury Lane, had cut the
                scenes of the psychological self-torment, and partly because Cooper as an actor was
                incapable of expressing that capacity of an Othello to be his own Iago, the play
                closed after five performances (Murray 195-6). Elliston’s abbreviated version
                stripped away the subtle increments of the Doge’s frustration and infuriation, and
                Cooper’s performance of the character offered few of the attributes of Byronic
                temperament that might excite a gossip-craving audience.</p>
               <p>Several actors, including Edmund Kean (Manning 188-206) and William Charles Macready
                (Barker 342-4), sought to make the most of Byron’s autobiographical presence in the
                Byronic character. Responding to the public celebration of the virtuoso performer,
                actors engaged a rivalry in performing Byronic roles. Needing much more than simply
                enacting the spirit of the Byronic character, the actors had to make it appear as if
                Byron himself were on stage performing that character. Parallel to the double role
                that Byron assigns himself as narrator and character in <title level="m">Childe
                    Harold</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, the doubleness was also
                manifest in the stage performance (Burwick, “Subinsinuation” 98-110). Peter Cochran
                was among the first to give close attention to the staging of Byron’s plays (Cochran
                “Byron and Drury Lane” 1-34, 201-2). To the staging of Byron’s plays must be added
                the stage adaptations of such romances as <title level="m">The Corsair</title> and 
                <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>. Too, the appraisal of a stage Byron
                ought to include the stage adaptations of novels featuring the most notorious
                representations of Byron: Lord Glenarvon Ruthven in Lady Caroline Lamb’s 
                <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (1816) and Lord Ruthven in John Polidori’s 
                <title level="m">The Vampire</title> (1819). William Barrymore’s stage adaptation of
                    <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (Coburg, July 13, 1819) featured Henry Kemble
                as the Byronic Lord Glenarvon. J. Amherst’s version of 
                <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (Coburg, December 3, 1821) cast H. H. Rowbotham as Ruthven
                Glenarvon. Both Kemble and Rowbotham turned the role into a studied impersonation of
                Lord Byron (Burwick, “Playing” 71-86). James Robinson Planché, in 
                <title level="m">The Vampire</title> (English Opera House, August 9, 1820), brought John Polidori’s
                short story to the stage. He retained the now-familiar sinister name of Lord
                Ruthven, performed as a stage Byron by Thomas Potter Cooke (Burwick, 
                <title level="m">Romantic Drama</title> 230-57). The best of the Byron impersonators
                was Kean, who exercised that ability effectively as Selim in <title level="m">The
                    Bride of Abydos</title> (Drury Lane, February 5, 1818), adapted for the stage by
                William Dimond. When Charles Dibdin, Jr. prepared the staging of 
                <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (Sadler’s Wells, August 1, 1814), he gave Conrad all the poses
                and situations popularly associated with Byron (Burwick and Powell 59-72). </p>
               <p>Given its antecedents, the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title> at Covent
                Garden on October 29, 1834 was anticipated as another stage enactment of Lord Byron
                and his personal scandal (Playbill <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Covent Garden,
                1834). With scenery by Thomas and William Grieve (Grieve Theatre Designs) and music
                by Henry Rowley Bishop (Corder 78-97; Caldwell 179-80), stage-manager Alfred Bunn
                intended a spectacular production of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Denvil would be
                performing as Byron performing as Manfred, or as Kean performing as Byron performing
                as Manfred. Performing before Grieves’ imposing scenery, Denvil confronted the
                challenge of being upstaged magnificently by the stage itself. Several reviews
                appraised Denvil’s performance from the perspective of his audience. Bunn, as
                manager of Covent Garden, communicated the high expectations he had for his young
                tragedian (Bunn 214-7). William Macready’s account expressed cynicism masked as pity
                and the <foreign xml:lang="fr">noblesse oblige</foreign> of an experienced senior actor
                (Macready I:165-6, 187, 269-70). Planché, who had introduced Denvil to Bunn, assumed
                the role of a concerned mentor but also as playwright offering advice on performing
                an unusually challenging text (Planché I:213-4.).</p>
               <p>In spite of delivering with gusto those lines in which Manfred commanded the Chamois
                Hunter, the Witch of the Alps, Astarte, the Abbot of St. Maurice to look upon him,
                Denvil found it difficult to step out of the shadows. Determined to represent a
                reincarnated Byron/Manfred in the grips of a succession of passions, Denvil’s
                efforts were effectively stifled by an artistic exposition of the Byronic sublime in
                which Denvil served only as tour guide. According to one reviewer, the great
                attraction was neither Byron’s poetry nor Denvil’s acting, but rather “the beauty of
                the scenery, its music, and its mechanical and scenic effects, which are equal, if
                not superior, to any thing ever yet seen” (<title level="m">Observer</title>, qtd. in
                Meisel 175). The review continues: “The Messrs. Grieve have exhibited some of the
                most beautiful specimens of their art; the Jungfrau Mountains, the Cataract of the
                Lower Alps, and a Terrace of Manfred’s Castle are exquisite pictures, &amp; the Hall
                of Arimanes, a copy of Martin's Pandemonium was terrifically grand” (Meisel 175).
                The reviewer in the <title level="m">London Literary
                    Gazette</title> objected to the mistake of rendering the spiritual as physical, and
                expecting more of Denvil than the monologue provided. “To avoid the ridiculous was a
                great point, and in that he succeeded” (rpt. in <title level="m">Broadview
                </title>127-8).</p>
               <p>Planché’s main reason for introducing Denvil at Covent Garden was “the old obstacle,
                the want of a singer who could act.” Covent Garden was without “a popular
                melo-dramatic performer,” who could sing (Planché I:214). Although Planché made it
                clear that Denvil was to be reserved for those singing roles in melodrama, “Bunn,
                fancying he had secured a second Edmund Kean, insisted on Denvil making his first
                appearance as Shylock.” Reviewers attacked Denvil for his presumption. Denvil, for
                his own part, knew he was being cast in roles beyond his experience. “He is putting
                me,” were his words, “on a pinnacle to break my neck: but what can I do? I have, for
                weeks past, walked Kensington Gardens without a dinner, in order that my wife and
                little ones should not lose a crumb by me. Mr. Bunn offers me five pounds per week,
                which is affluence to us and salvation! How can I refuse?” (Planché I:214). Denvil
                did his best to fulfil the demanding Shakespearean roles, then at the end of October
                came the rehearsals for the grand spectacle of the season. On the evening of October
                29, Denvil stood alone in the dark. Literally. The playbill forewarned the audience
                that “Chandeliers around the Front of the Boxes will not be used on the Evenings of
                the Performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title>.” The backdrop paintings were
                crucial to Bunn’s production. “In order to produce the necessary effects of Light
                and Shade,” downstage action took place in the shadows. A voice in the shadows, a
                voice in the vastness (as rebuilt in 1809 Covent Garden seated 2,800 with no amplification), 
                Denvil’s Manfred was further constrained
                by a musical score in which Manfred was silenced by the series of solos and
                choruses. Denvil was a strong tenor—as Planché declared, he could sing as well as
                act. Nevertheless, he was given no opportunity to sing in Henry Bishop’s score.</p>
               <p>Denvil was so conscious of performing the character as an incarnation of Byron that
                he seemed to leave him but half resurrected from the tomb. In part that effect was
                owing to the breathy quality of Denvil’s voice. He seemed as much a supernatural
                being as Astarte or any of the characters conjured in the court of Arimanes (Planché
                I:213-5). Denvil rose to the challenge of performing multiple roles in the character
                of Manfred. He was the poet exiled in scandal and returned as a vampire from the
                grave; he was the tormented lover longing for the forgiveness of his lost Astarte;
                he was the defiant apostate fearing neither demons nor death. Singled out for
                special praise was the scene with the Witch of Alps performed by Ellen Tree (Planché
                I:214). </p>
               <p>As Planché explained, Bunn cast Denvil in a succession of demanding roles, as
                Shylock, as Richard III, and as Bertram. Not surprisingly, the critics blamed the
                actor for an overeager ambition:
                <quote>
            The diversity of opinion, not only as to the extent of his abilities, but respecting
                almost every scene of his performance, is, perhaps, scarcely to be equaled in the
                annals of criticism. After three performances with the same result; the conflicting
                evidence of the <title level="m">Times</title>, <title level="m">Herald</title>, 
                    <title level="m">Chronicle</title>, and <title level="m">Morning Post</title> being most
                amusingly summed up by the <title level="m">True Sun</title> in the evening. In these,
                and other characters, he had to endure comparison with Edmund Kean; but in Lord
                Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which was subsequently produced, he had the
                advantage of an original part, and united the suffrages of the critics. (Planché
                I:213-5).</quote>
            But it was not an original part, for Denvil once again was cast in a role in which he
                had to follow Kean as an impersonator of Byron. Denvil was a boy of twelve years
                when Byron left England. As an actor now aged thirty, Denvil knew Byron only at
                second-hand, through the poetry and through the acting of Kean and Macready. From
                neither could he receive any direction or practical counsel.</p>
               <p>When <title level="m">Manfred</title> opened at the end of October, William Macready
                was on tour and performing at Dublin. The audience reception
                remained sufficiently strong throughout the first season to sustain the run for
                thirty-six performances. Macready read the reviews and expressed his opinions in his
                letters to Bunn, who several months earlier had urged Macready to “perform Manfred,
                postponing for that purpose my Dublin engagement.” Macready told Bunn that it would
                be impractical to prepare for Manfred in advance of his visit to Dublin. In his
                diary, however, he recorded his conviction that there was “no chance for the success
                of Manfred—it is . . . not a monodrama, but a monologue; splendid as the poetry
                is, it is not at all dramatic.” Macready had already gained acclaim for bringing to
                the stage both <title level="m">Werner</title> (Drury Lane, December 15, 1830) 
                and <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (Drury Lane, April 10, 1834), roles that he
                would reprise during his Dublin engagement (Macready, 1:165).</p>
               <p>When Bunn engaged Denvil for the 1834-1835 season, Macready watched with interest the
                criticism in the <title level="m">Examiner.</title> From “his repetition of Shylock
                and his announcement to-morrow for Richard III,” John Forster, the respected
                literary reviewer, saw a flaw in Bunn’s confidence in Denvil, “whose exact place in
                the scale of actors he seems unable to determine” (Macready I:187). Based on
                additional reports, Macready’s estimation is similarly reserved: “he has, from what
                I have read of him, a mind above the common theatrical level and the intellectual
                material to furnish forth an artist.” Unable to anticipate the consequences of
                Bunn’s aggressive use of Denvil’s talent, Macready concludes, “What will come of it
                is in the will of other powers” (Macready I:187). A generous review of Denvil’s
                Shakespearean roles prompted Macready to denounce the <title level="m">Times
                </title> as a “base and profligate paper” guilty of “dirty malignity” for praising
                others and ignoring him (Macready I:189).</p>
               <p>Lamenting Denvil’s “brief career and his ill-treatment by Bunn, and melancholy exit
                from the stage of life,” Planché wrote as if Denvil were burdened with hardship and
                failure following his performance as Manfred. “Under a more judicious management”
                than Bunn had offered, Denvil might have been “permanently established in the higher
                position which . . . he had attained.” In spite of Planché’s gloomy pronouncement,
                Denvil fared well in his subsequent career. As soon as the season at Covent Garden
                ended, Denvil accepted an invitation from John Farrell at the Pavilion Theatre to
                perform as Manfred for the week of July 20, 1835. At the Pavilion in 1835, and in
                years following, Denvil’s performances as Manfred were no longer diminished by
                Bishop’s grand score, nor by the imposing scenes of the Grieves. Edward Woolf
                composed the new music, and scenery on a more modest scale was constructed by the
                Gordons, father and son, with sublime vistas by Brunning (Playbill, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Pavilion, 1835).</p>
               <p>In January 1836, Denvil was in Bristol playing Macduff opposite Macready’s Macbeth,
                and Iago opposite Macready’s Othello. In what may have been a warning, Denvil told
                Macready of pitching a fellow actor “from a height of eighteen feet” during a
                performance. Macready also complained of being “very much inconvenienced and
                embarrassed” by Denvil, as Iago, repeatedly upstaging him (Macready I:269-70). In
                addition to one character tormenting the other, the audience witnessed one actor
                tormenting the other. When Bunn ceased casting Macready in leading roles, leaving
                him to play only in an afterpiece, Macready lost his temper, called Bunn a “damned
                scoundrel,” and punched him in the face. Bunn defended himself by biting Macready’s
                little finger (April 29, 1836, Macready I:301-2).</p>
               <p>Denvil accepted an invitation from Park Theatre, New York, where he repeated the
                roles of his first season at Covent Garden, with his “début . . . in October, 1836,
                as Shylock. Which he followed up with Richard III, and Manfred, returning to England
                in 1837” (Adams 392-3). Denvil returned to performing the singing roles in
                melodrama, the roles for which Planché had said he was best suited. On one occasion
                (June 1, 1840) Denvil played the lead in <title level="m">The Pirate of
                    Manfredonia</title>, adapted from Maturin’s <title level="m">Bertram</title>, a role
                that he had played for Bunn during the fall of 1834. As
                evident from his appearances in New York, he had not utterly abandoned the
                Shakespearean roles Bunn had imposed upon him. At the City of London Theatre in 1843
                he appeared again as Shylock in <title level="m">The Merchant of Venice</title>, and
                as Rolla in Sheridan’s <title level="m">Pizarro</title>. </p>
               <p>Jointly with his wife, Alice Matilda, Denvil was managing and performing at the
                Pavilion Theatre in Whitechapel Road during the 1840s. Alice Matilda Denvil not only
                acted but also authored several of their plays, and by 1842 Master Manfred Denvil
                was on stage for the interlude performing a sailor’s hornpipe. On August 21, 1857,
                Charles Kean, lessee of Princess’s Theatre, signed an agreement for the engagement
                of Alice Matilda Denvil (Memorandum, Y.d.380, Folger Library, Manuscript). Planché’s
                reference to Denvil’s “melancholy exit from the stage of life,” suggested a gloomy
                fate for Denvil’s latter career. In spite of financial difficulties Denvil enjoyed a
                period of relative success at the Pavilion.</p>
               <p>Theatre critic Westland Marston began his account of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                by describing not Denvil but Ellen Tree:
                <quote>
            Miss Ellen Tree (whom I then saw for the first time) declaimed the lines allotted to
                the Witch of the Alps, lines which are not only few, but almost devoid of dramatic
                force, serving only to draw out Manfred's long and gloomy retrospect. Nevertheless,
                in her appearance, as she stood within the arch of a rainbow in her garments, which
                seemed woven of aerial colours touched by the sun, and in her voice, the tones of
                which, though sweet, were remote and passionless, she realized all the weird charm
                of a genius of lake and mountain. There was something glacial in her unsubstantial
                loveliness, something that belonged to the forms of sleep rather than those of
                common day. (Marston, 13-4)</quote>
            The scene with the Witch’s declamation, “Son of Earth! I know thee!” also impressed
                Augusta Leigh, who wrote: “Miss Ellen Tree's Witch of the Alps I shall dream of”
                (Marston, 14). Manfred’s lines on Astarte — “She was like me in lineaments, . . .”
                (II.ii.106-18)—Denvil delivered “with an intensity of horror and remorse that no
                actor could well have surpassed” (Marston 15). Marston remarked specifically on
                Denvil’s ability to mould his face to capture the moods of “the haughty and
                mysterious hero of the drama.” Marston was especially impressed by “the look of
                self-recoil” that contorted his face during the pause in saying, “I loved her, —and
                destroyed her!” (II.ii.118). Denvil had some measure of poetic feeling, and
                considerable power of facial expression.
                <quote>
            General praise was accorded to his Manfred . . . his pale, almost spectral face,
                thrown out by his dark garb, and a haughty isolation and melancholy in tone, look,
                and gesture that well conveyed the mingled pride and remorse of one who, though
                racked by the sense of a hidden crime, has won commerce with supernatural beings.
                (Marston 14)</quote>
            In spite of his positive appraisal of Denvil’s acting, Marston is still left with a
                puzzle: “Why an actor should be fairly successful in Richard the Third and Shylock,
                really fine in Manfred, and yet fail totally in Othello, is not at once obvious”
                (Marston 15-6). The fault lay, Marston suggested, in the actor’s failing to separate
                the acting of serious tragedy from that of popular melodrama. Denvil allowed his
                acting to degenerate “into the worst style of provincial rant.” As Manfred he had
                sustained “the ease, refinement, and poetic appreciation and quick insight into
                character and motive.” That higher order of acting was undermined by frequent
                performance in melodrama: “Distorted features, violence of gesture, and strain of
                lung were all the resources left to him” (Marston 15-6).</p>
               <p>Denvil’s impersonation of Byron as Manfred at Covent Garden was accompanied by a
                burlesque at the Strand Theatre ridiculing Bishop’s score, mimicking other
                composers, as fitting accompaniment to Denvil’s mimicking Byron and Kean (Tunbridge
                212-36). Gilbert Abbott à Beckett’s <title level="m">Man-Fred</title> (December 26,
                1834) amused the crowds with Mitchell’s impersonation of Denvil’s impersonation of
                Byron as Manfred (à Beckett ix.6). According to the reviewer in the
                    <title level="m">Times</title>, the best scene in the burlesque involved
                Mitchell’s mimicking “the attitude in which Mr Denvil lately astonished the visitors
                at one of the patent theatres, and in which he is represented in the shop windows”
                (December 27, 1834). That Manfred in Byron’s tragedy was perceived as needing a
                comic counterpart in burlesque is reconfirmed when <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                was revived thirty years later (Drury Lane, October 14, 1863) with Samuel Phelps in
                the lead role as Manfred. No time was lost in bringing forth Manfred’s madcap double
                in Martin Dutnall’s <title level="m">Mad Fred</title> at the Royal Surrey Theatre 
                (<title level="m">Times</title>, November 20, 1863). </p>
               <p>The opening scene in the Grieves’ “Gothic gallery” provided Denvil with a comfortably
                enclosed stage space, and presented the audience with a scene already familiar.
                Billed as “Goethe’s Terrific Drama of <title level="m">Faustus</title>” (Coburg, June
                7, 1824), the partial translations by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe
                Shelley were woven together by Henry M. Milner (Burwick, <title level="a">The 
                <title level="m">Faust</title> Translations</title> 30-42). Better known and more 
                often performed was Marlowe’s <title level="m">Doctor Faustus</title> 
                (1594, published 1604), which also opened with
                a scene of abjuration. “Settle thy studies Faustus,” Marlowe’s character tells
                himself, “and beginne / To sound the depth of that thou wilt professe.” Aristotle’s
                Analytics, Galen’s Medicine, Justinian’s Law, are put aside, for Faustus will now
                devote his mind to mastering necromancy (Marlowe 164, 166). Goethe’s Faust similarly
                dismisses his study of the traditional disciplines—Philosophy, Law, Medicine,
                Theology—as having failed to bring him closer to the knowledge he seeks 
                (<title level="m">Faust</title> ll.354-9). The abjuration scene occurs in other early
                plays. In Robert Greene’s <title level="m">Bacon Friar and Friar Bungay</title>
                (1594), the faculty charges Friar Bacon for having turned to magic, a trespass he
                readily confesses:

            Manfred’s abjuration of philosophy and science is preceded by his declaration of his
                ceaseless watching, a vigil which is a leitmotif in all his subsequent encounters.
                The abjuration of all previous endeavors which “availed not,” is followed by the
                conjuration of the spiritual powers of the universe.

            Manfred’s vigil is a mode of introspection, a constant monitoring of thought and
                feeling. As noted in my opening paragraph, Manfred seeks to enlist into this vigil
                each of those whom he meets in the ensuing scenes. The grandly insistent egocentrism
                in which Manfred commands all others to look on him could not be realized on the
                stage at Covent Garden, certainly not by the relatively inexperienced Denvil,
                probably not by Kean himself. Bunn, after all, had cut much of Manfred’s monologues,
                and had ordered a shadowy stage.</p>
               <p>Left with only pieces of monologue, Denvil’s Manfred was nevertheless able to abjure
                outmoded disciplines with a broad indictment of arcane knowledge. In the Hall of
                Arimanes, the First Destiny declares that Manfred’s aspirations have taught him the
                wisdom of hell: “That knowledge is not happiness” (II.iv.59-62). Recognizing the
                importance of Manfred’s opening monologue in establishing character, Denvil was able
                to lay claim Manfred’s ethical independence in the opening lines when he reframes
                the words of Genesis (2:9, 17) to define the futility and fatality of knowing.

            Manfred is less concerned with knowing good and evil as the consequence of eating the
                forbidden fruit, as he is with the revelation of forbidden knowledge. Manfred
                dismisses the three major endeavors of his life: first, the mastery of “Philosophy
                and science, and the springs / Of wonder and wisdom of the world.” Even though his
                mind had the “power to make these subject to itself . . . they avail not.” So too
                the consequences of good works “availed not,” and the ability to vanquish foes with
                military power “availed not.” In this limbo of ineffectuality, there remains no
                moral constancy or stability. “Good, or evil, life, / Power, passions, all I see in
                other beings,” have “since that all-nameless hour” (I.i.13-25) lost their meaning.
                That hour, as Manfred reveals in ensuing scenes, was the hour of Astarte’s
                death.</p>
               <p>The three-part abjuration is followed by three attempts at conjuration: first he
                conjures with a “written charm,” and then by the “sign, / Which makes you tremble.”
                When neither charm nor sign arouse the spirits, he utters a third incantation “By
                the strong curse which is upon my soul” (I.i.28-49). This spell succeeds, calling
                forth the spirits (I.i.50-131), whose respective songs are accompanied by full
                orchestra. The spirits of the four elements sing in succession. Air descends from
                the cloud, Earth from the mountain, Fire from the volcano, and Water from “the blue
                depth.” Then come the three powers: “the rider of the wind,” the “stirrer of the
                storm,” “the shadow of the night.” Next would come light, “The star which rules thy
                destiny,” but Bunn has omitted the role of the seventh spirit, who has no song, no
                lines, no place among the <foreign xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</foreign>. Instead, Bunn’s
                score moves directly into the chorus, where all seven are listed: “Earth, ocean,
                air, night, mountains, winds, thy star, / Are at thy beck and bidding” (I.i.132-3).
                To Manfred’s request for “forgetfulness,” the spirits reply that they “can but give
                thee that which we possess.” The forgetfulness that Manfred desires is an end to his
                unrelenting vigil, the image of “that which is most within me” (I.i.137). When he
                then calls upon the spirits to assume some form that he may behold them, the
                otherwise absent seventh spirit, played by Miss Clifton, appears and disappears in
                the form of Astarte:

                  </quote>
            Manfred faints, and a voice recites an incantational curse, “I compel / Thyself to be
                thy proper hell!” (I.i.250-2). Bishop’s songs for the spirits were fully adequate to
                overpower Manfred. </p>
               <p>In Act I, scene ii of Bunn’s production Manfred is transported to “A Wild Rocky
                Pass,” where Denvil lies on the scaffolding while the spirits sing their
                incantation, “When the moon is on the wave, And the glow-worm in the grass”
                (I.i.193-4). In the original text, the incantation continued for sixty-nine lines.
                Bishop has reduced the song to the first two ten-line strophes. When Manfred awakens
                from the trance, he must acknowledge the inefficacy of his conjuration.

            They too have “avail’d not.” Worse, he has been taunted by the phantom of Astarte. </p>
               <p>In the next scene (I.iii in Bunn’s production), the dimensions of the Grieves’
                settings become evident. Denvil is poised on the concealed scaffolding half way up
                the face of “the Mountain of the Jungfrau,” sufficiently high above the stage to
                lend credibility to his reflections on a suicidal leap. The Chamois Hunter was
                played by John Cooper, who thirteen years earlier was “the young actor doubly
                damned” by Byron for his performance in the title role of <title level="m">Marino
                    Faliero</title> (Bunn 154). As a transition to the scene with the Witch of the
                Alps, Denvil must again fall into a trance as Bishop introduces two more ten-line
                strophes from the Invocation, now adapted as a Malediction, “And a magic voice and
                verse / Hath baptized thee with a curse” (I.i.223-32, 253-62).</p>
               <p>Cutting the dialogue and rearranging the scenes, Bunn explained, was necessary to
                take advantage of Byron’s “vast contribution of the ‘marvellous’ and the
                ‘improbable’.” “By favoring us with little plot, little action, and few characters,”
                Bunn further argued, “the noble poet did his utmost to render his progeny unfit for
                representation.” By condensing the text, and enhancing the performance with grand
                set designs and appropriate music, Bunn was able to overcome the presumed dramatic
                deficiency. The resulting production “was eminently successful — applauded by a
                crammed auditory, lauded, with but one exception, by the press” (Bunn 215). That
                “one exception” was the reviewer in the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle
                </title>(October 30, 1834). </p>
               <p>Denvil was dwarfed by the grand backdrops painted by the Grieves, and the reviewer of
                the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> said so. Bunn expressed his anger over
                this review in his correspondence with J. P. Collier, proprietor of the 
                <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title>. Bunn accused Collier’s newspaper with
                having “belaboured the production of Manfred (as it had done all the preceding
                efforts of the season) unmercifully.” Among the “preceding efforts,” Bunn referred
                particularly to the vilification of Joseph and Mary Anne Wood 
                (<title level="m">Memoir</title> 15-8), whom Bunn had engaged for their performance in Rossini’s 
                <title level="m">Cinderella</title> (Covent Garden, October 1834). Bunn made it clear
                that he blamed the “theatrical reporter, and believed by me to be my theatrical
                opponent.” He wrote,

            My complaint to the Proprietor of the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> did
                not refer to <title level="m">Manfred</title> alone, but to the tissue of falsehood
                and nonsense which has appeared about <title level="m">Cinderella</title> and other
                pieces from time to time in that paper, and which has rendered it, in that
                particular department, the ridicule of all its readers. (Bunn 217)

            As described by the reviewer, Denvil was hindered in standing forth prominently as an
                empowered protagonist, but appeared rather as “little more than the showman of a
                series of splendid scenes painted by the GRIEVES; and as the
                house was kept in darkness, the effect was quite dioramic” (October 30, 1834). Other
                reviews had been more positive, but the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> was
                not alone in objecting to Denvil having to deliver abbreviated passages on a
                darkened stage. Henry Crabb Robinson, noting that Denvil had been deprived of the
                best of Manfred’s monologues, wrote that the production afforded no “pleasure except
                from the splendid scenery.” For that reason, “it should be called a show in which
                grand pictures are explained by words” (Robinson 145).</p>
               <p>Surviving in the performance script were Manfred’s lines repeating Satan’s
                declaration in <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> (1664) that “The mind is its own
                place, and it itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven” 
                (<title level="m">PL</title> I.254-5), lines already echoed in the incantation,
                “Thyself to be thy proper hell!” In the scenes with the Chamois Hunter, Byron
                defines the Swiss sense of liberty with allusions to Wilhelm Tell (Giddey 179-90;
                Piccitto 168-82). For the scene with the Witch of the Alps Byron drew from the
                legend of Tannhäuser, the celebrated medieval minnesinger who was captivated by the
                Venus of the Mountain (Grimm 246-7). For the scene in the Hall of Arimanes Byron may
                again have drawn from Milton’s description of Satan with the fallen angels in
                Pandemonium, but Milton introduced no mortal interloper defying Satan’s reign.</p>
               <p>Until Bunn decided to trim the monologues, half the lines in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> belonged to Manfred himself. The other characters, including
                Astarte, had no abiding presence in the plot, appear only in one or two scenes, and
                function to reveal aspects of Manfred’s character. Each scene thus functioned
                separately from the others, a division that was rendered more emphatic by the
                gallery-like exhibition of the massive canvases painted by the Greives. The
                Chamois-Hunter, living at one with the sublimity of Alpine nature, represents the
                Swiss spirit liberty and independence and the ethos of patience in adversity. At a
                distance he perceives in Manfred one who is “Proud as a free-born peasant,” but on
                closer approach recognizes a “madman” about to leap from the cliff. Aggressive
                intervention is necessary to halt the suicidal leap of Manfred, whom the
                Chamois-Hunter seizes with the chastising words, “Stain not our pure vales with thy
                guilty blood” (I.ii.111). Manfred confesses, as he will again and again, the origin
                of that guilt:

                        <l>Where thou art not---and I shall never be. (II.i.24-30)</l>

            Recognizing Manfred as the victim of “some half-maddening sin,” the Chamois-Hunter
                urges him to exercise “heavenly patience.” When Manfred scorns the advice as useful
                only for “brutes of burden,” the Chamois-Hunter replies that he would not share
                Manfred’s order “for the free fame / Of William Tell,” and whatever his sin, “it
                must be borne, and these wild starts are useless” (II.i.31-41). “Look on me,”
                Manfred answers. He bears his pain by maintaining his vigil, and watching his own
                thoughts, “I look within.” (II.i.42, 72). </p>
               <p>Confessing his fatal embrace and the injuries that befell those who loved him
                (I.i.84-7), Manfred departs from the Chamois Hunter and descends to the foot of an
                Alpine waterfall. Beneath the sunbow hovering in the mists of the cataract arises
                the Witch of the Alps, to whom he again confesses the loss of Astarte, and from whom
                he once more requests forgetfulness. John Martin’s
                    painting, <title level="m">Manfred and the Witch of the Alps</title> (1837),
                is a painting of a painting, preserving the appearance of Denvil and Ellen Tree in
                the scene painted by the Grieves. In relating his love for Astarte, Manfred reveals
                a narcissistic fascination with the mirrored image he perceives in the traits and
                features of his female companion. Astarte, Manfred declares, “was like me in
                lineaments—her eyes, / Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone / Even of her
                voice . . . were like to mine.” She had the “same lone thoughts and wanderings, /
                The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind / To comprehend the universe”
                (II.ii.105-11). This most harmonious of all possible heterosexual relationships is
                undermined by cultural taboos and familial or social opposition: “I loved her, and
                destroy’d her! / Not with my hand, but heart—which broke her heart”
                (II.ii.111-21).</p>
               <p>The rumored incest seemed to be confirmed in <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (published June 16, 1817) in the implied incestuous relationship between the Count
                and Astarte (Glass 211-26). The titillating gossip was repeatedly revived. Just as
                    <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                attracted attention for their presumed autobiographical revelations, the character
                of Manfred was deemed to be a thinly disguised dramatization of a forbidden love
                between Byron and his half-sister. </p>
               <p>Reiterating his need for spectator participation in his suffering, Manfred tells the
                Witch of the Alps to “look on me in my sleep, / Or watch my watching”
                (II.ii.129-30). She assures him that she can secure the forgetfulness that he
                desires, but it will require “obedience to my will” and a surrender to her bidding.
                Manfred scorns the offer. In his soliloquy that closes the scene, Manfred declares
                his intention to call the dead, as David had the Witch of Endor summon the ghost of
                Samuel or Pausanias had his priests call the spirit of Cleonice so that he could ask
                her forgiveness. The reviewer for the <title level="m">Observer</title> (November 2,
                1834) wrote that Denvil lost his dramatic leverage in these scenes. Instead of the
                living interrogating the spirits, Denvil presented the dead shuffling among the
                dead. In the brief scene on the summit of the Jungfrau Mountain, the Destinies and
                Nemesis anticipate the night of “our great festival” (II.iii.15), an event that
                suggests a parallel to the Walpurgis Night in Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>
                (Chew 174-8). Nemesis was played by Miss Taylor, who had previously performed as
                Rebecca in Thomas John Dibdin’s <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> and as Zapolya, in
                Dibdin’s adaptation of Coleridge’s play. Tree’s best moment was her dynamic speech,
                “Son of Earth! I know thee.” Following Denvil’s moving rendition of the monologue,
                “We are fools of time and terror” (II.ii.165), the scene closed with “The Witches
                Carnival,” in which Bishop developed Byron’s lyric as a Walpurgis-like revel.</p>
               <p>Bishop was ingenious in rescuing the song from the canceled version of Act III and
                placing it at the end of the scene with the Witch of the Alps. The comic grotesque
                of Byron’s lyrics and Bishop’s melodic shifts effectively prepare for the arrival at
                the Hall of Arimanes, yet it is also worthwhile to recall the satirical charge of
                the original context. In the first version, Byron exposes the Abbot’s piety as a
                mask for greed. “Charity, most reverend father,” Manfred tells him, “Becomes thy
                lips so much more than this menace.” The Abbot promises to refrain from malediction,
                unless Manfred “dost not all devote thyself / To penance, and with gift of all thy
                lands / To the Monastery.” In response, Manfred offers a gift
                to the Abbot—a demonic jack-in-the box. “There is a gift for thee within this
                casket,” he says, and opening it, out pops the demon Ashtaroth, singing the song of
                the raven and the Witches’ Carnival.

            Peter Cochran argued this discarded song was “the one detail of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> lifted directly from <title level="m">Faust</title>.” 
                (Cochran, <title level="m">Manfred</title> n36). Ben Hewitt analyzes the textual parallels:
                first the brief scene (<title level="m">Faust</title> 4399-404) in which Faust asks
                what is occurring at the raven stone (<emph>Rabenstein</emph>, a gallows),
                and Mephistopheles answers that a witches coven has gathered, but he know not what
                they cook and brew; and second the “raging magic song” (<foreign xml:lang="de">wütender
                    Zaubergesang</foreign>) sung by the witches who have gathered for their demonic orgy
                on Walpurgis Night (<title level="m">Faust</title> 3958-4015). Hewitt also observes
                that Byron “echoes Goethe’s use of quatrains” (83-4). The significant difference is
                that Ashteroth’s song is in tetrameters, combining iambs and anapests and a
                scattering of internal rhymes (as in: “The fetters creak—and his ebon beak”). The
                pecking beat of the first ten line gives way to the rhythmic dance of the latter ten
                lines.</p>
               <p>The realm of evil into which Manfred intrudes, as already noted, borrows indirectly
                from Milton’s Pandemonium. As observed by two reviewers (<title level="m">Times
                </title>and <title level="m">Morning Chronicle,</title> October 30, 1834), the setting
                replicates John Martin’s <title level="m">Satan Presiding at the Infernal
                  Council</title> (1823-27). Martin’s later version, 
                    <title level="m">Pandemonium</title> (1841), bears the influence of the Grieves. The emphasis is
                rather on the bold defiance of the presumed sovereignty of Arimanes. Manfred, like
                Prometheus defying Jupiter, refuses to “Bow down and worship” (II.iv.29-49).
                Arimanes, who speaks but one word, grants the request to call up the dead. Nemesis
                calls forth the spirit of Astarte. “Look on me,” he tells her, but thrice repeats
                his more urgent plea, “Speak to me!” (II.iv.117-50). Like Pausanias calling the
                spirit of Cleonice, Manfred wants Astarte’s forgiveness, and like Cleonice, Astarte
                replies with the revelation of his impending death. Thrice she utters his name;
                thrice she bids him farewell. Her sole message: “Tomorrow ends thine earthly ills”
                (II.iv.150-7). In the songs of Nemesis, the Destinies, and the Spirits (II.iii and
                iv), Bishop sought to fulfill his operatic aspirations with compositional hints of
                the aria sung by the Queen of the Night in Mozart’s <title level="m">Die
                    Zauberflöte</title>.</p>
               <p>Byron adhered to the three-act format that distinguished melodrama from the
                traditional five-act structure of comedy and tragedy. Bishop further reduced the
                structure by combining Acts II and III. Act I, scene v presented Manfred’s
                reflection on the <emph>kalon</emph> as transitory illusion. He is visited
                by the Abbot of St. Maurice, who comes to save Manfred’s soul. This is a very
                different Abbot than the one in the manuscript version who represented the
                corruption of the Catholic Church. As staged at Covent Garden in 1834, the Abbot was
                played by James Prescott Warde, known for his role as Cassius in Shakespeare’s 
                <title level="m">Julius Caesar</title> and as Mortimer in <title level="m">The Iron
                    Chest</title>, adapted from William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                by George Colman the Younger. This revised Abbot is free of greed and corruption but
                still constrained by dogma. Manfred tells him that there is no charm in prayer, no
                purification in penitence. As Milton’s Satan declared, the mind can “make a hell of
                heaven.” His fate, Manfred insists, is a matter exclusively between himself and
                heaven, and he wants neither church nor priest as his mediator. To behold one who
                has aged more than a mortal life time, he instructs the Abbot, “Look on me!” And to
                observe one who has experienced a full range of the maladies of fate. “Look on me!”
                (III.i.138, 149). </p>
               <p>In the next short scene, Manfred watches the sinking sun and declares himself ready
                to follow. Then in the third scene, the servants Herbert and Manuel recall former
                days --Manfred’s youth and his devotion to Astarte:

                        <l>That lived, the only thing he seemed to love, —</l>

                  </quote>
            The word “sister” remains, as it does throughout the play, unspoken.</p>
               <p>In the final scene, the Abbot returns, but again his offer of prayer is spurned. When
                the spirits come to claim Manfred’s immortal soul, the Abbot makes a futile effort
                to exorcise them. Manfred, however, rejects their claim. His power, he tells them,
                “Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,” rather by his own “length of watching,
                strength of mind, and skill” (III.iv.114-6). “Back to thy hell!” he commands them,
                “Thou hast no power upon me.” Just as he rejected the mediation of church and
                priest, he denies the claims of hell’s minions. The declaration of Milton’s Satan
                that “The mind is its own place, and it itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell
                of Heaven” (<title level="m">PL</title>I.254-5), as I have previously observed, has
                already been echoed in the lines, “I call upon thee! and compel / Thyself to be thy
                proper hell!” (I.i.252), and again in the lines, “The innate tortures of that deep
                Despair, / Which is Remorse without the fear of hell, / But all in all sufficient to
                itself / Would make a hell of Heaven (III.i.70-3). The words of Milton’s Satan are
                repeated for the third time:

                  </quote>
            The demons are driven off. The Abbot remains at Manfred’s side, still urging him to a
                final prayer. Instead, Manfred bids farewell with a simple statement: “Old man! ’tis
                not so difficult to die.” (III.iv.151).</p>
               <p>Although Manfred declares himself ready to kneel with Arimanes to “The overruling
                Infinite—the Maker” (II.iv.48), and the Abbot expresses his faith in Heaven, Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers no further confirmation of a divine
                paradise. The existence of Hell is sustained by the reign of Arimanes and by the
                demons who seek to take possession of Manfred’s soul. From beginning to end the play
                never questions a spiritual afterlife. With the song of the Witch’s Carnival revived
                and reinserted at the end of the scene with the Witch of the Alps, Bishop recognized
                that another song was needed for the finale following Manfred’s death.</p>
               <p>Following the witches’ song at the end of Act I, Bunn’s altered Act II opens with the
                Manfred atop the Jungfrau, where the spirits and destinies sing prior to Manfred
                entrance into the Hall of Arimanes. The spirits’ song of “The Captive Usurper” was
                the most political of the play, and its account of the fall and resurrection of
                Napoleon had a powerful resonance when Manfred was published in 1817.

            At the time of the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834, Napoleon
                was no longer himself a threat. The possibility that, having escaped from Elbe, he
                might escape again from St. Helena no longer existed. He died in 1821. But a
                Napoleonic legacy still prevailed, and the added song predicts a second return to
                power. With the evocation of the “July Monarchy” of France in 1830, that prediction
                was not entirely false. In 1834 a spirit of resistance persisted. Byron had not
                anticipated the need for a second song calling for a second revolt against
                monarchical greed, but Bunn’s production needed a reaffirmation of political unrest.
                In <title level="m">The Giaour</title> Bishop found the lyrics for his concluding chorus.
                Manfred utters his last words, “Old man! ’tis not so difficult to die.” The Abbot
                declares that “his soul hath ta’en its earthless flight.” Then Ashtaroth, who sang
                the song of the raven and witches in the deleted Act III, is reinstated to lead the
                spirits, witches, and destinies in the Finale. The Grieves had prepared the scene
                for an Alpine avalanche, and Bishop introduced the song with the booming roar of
                percussion to evoke the “Glaciers of the Upper Alps, partly borne down by a Violent
                Thunder Storm” (<title level="m">Programme</title> 12):

            During the previous year, F. Sutton played the island
                    dweller Attoo, who led the native resistance against the mutineers in
                Richard Brinsley Peake’s <title level="m">Neuha's Cave; or, The South Sea
                    Mutineers</title> (Adelphi, April 8, 1833-April 23,1833).
                    For Bunn that was experience enough to cast Sutton as the rebel spirit
                    Astheroth. In political keeping with the song on Napoleon’s captivity, the lines from 
                <title level="m">The Giaour</title> provided a finale that in 1834 might well be
                perceived as a response to events in France following the
                    July Revolution of 1830 and the new
                    Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Starting with the overthrow of the conservative government
                    of Charles X and the House of Bourbon, this was supposed to be a liberal constitutional
                    monarchy under Louis Philippe I. Calling himself King of the French, rather than King 
                    of France, he proclaimed himself a
                    populist and leader of the people’s party. He promised to follow the 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">juste milieu</foreign>, the
                    middle way between radical liberalism and arch-conservatism, the stream and the
                    ocean. It soon became clear, however, that his government was supported by
                    wealthy bourgeoisie and many of those who had been
                    prominent in the conservative court of Charles X. The prophecy of a re-emergence
                    of a “Captive Usurper” is realized when the stream and Ocean greet, / With 
                    waves that madden as they meet.” The “groan of war,” as the song predicts, would be heard again
                    in the revolution of 1848.</p>
               <p>The supernatural scenes dealt with an order of demonic spiritualism that had little
                in common with the ghosts and demons in the Gothic melodrama of the times. The
                visual dominance of the paintings may have been at fault, but so too was Denvil’s
                Manfred as a resuscitated Byron, an entity of a physical afterlife. Bishop’s music
                may have been more disruptive than conducive to the competing notions of time.
                Seventeen years after it was written, ten years after the poet’s death, Bunn’s
                production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was self-disrupting, omitting much of
                the dialogue crucial to developing Manfred’s character 
                (<title level="m">Programme</title>).</p>
               <p>Bishop’s music may have complemented, or even enhanced, the sublime settings by the
                Grieves, but they also created obstacles for Denvil’s role. Byron’s Manfred
                challenged the eternal time of heaven, hell, and mythic realms as well as the
                personal time of suffering or merciful forgetting. Bunn’s production further
                required that the actor conjure the phantom of the poet in a sequence of moods and
                tempers. Neither Bunn, nor the Grieves, nor Bishop made Denvil’s task easier. In
                spite of Planché’s dire pronouncement of Denvil’s “melancholy exit from the stage of
                life,” Denvil continued to find success, even in his troubled performances with
                Macready, whose career was damaged by ill-temper. Denvil at the Pavilion Theatre
                maintained a far more successful career than he had in the years before taking on
                the title role in <title level="m">Manfred</title>.</p>

                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a very strange work as
                    Nietzsche, perhaps more than anyone, so well understood. Partly it’s strange
                    because it’s a genre mashup, “A Dramatic Poem” that, like Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>, cultivates a medley of tones that constantly shift
                    from grave and exacting reflection to satire and comedy.<note place="foot" resp="author">This lecture/essay carries forward the extensive discussion of
                        the medley style of <title level="m">Manfred</title> from my earlier
                        lecture/essay <title level="a">Byron and Wordsworth</title> (Nottingham:
                        Byron Foundation, U. Of Nottingham, 1999), reprinted in my selected essays
                        of <title level="m">Byron and Romanticism</title>, ed. James Soderholm
                        (Cambridge UP, 2002).</note> Like Oscar Wilde’s <title level="m">Salome</title>, it is a work easier to illustrate than to stage, as Virgil
                    Burnett’s wonderfully sly drawing for <title level="m">Manfred</title>—done in
                    the manner of Beardsley—shows.</p>

               <p>An ironic and pitiless landscape, a seriously preposterous search, Byron’s
                    clubbed right foot, Ahab’s stump: there is a brief conspectus of the untrodden
                    ways of the Byronic Hero, the Pilgrim of Eternity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The drawing is the cover design for Burnett’s illustrated
                        edition of my <title level="m">Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                     </title> an acting version of the work I made in 2008

               <p> The drawing captures the tone and attitude that a person ought to take when
                    venturing on a study of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. But it doesn't
                    actually show us how Byron fashioned his queer masterpiece. For that, I will
                    work from three quotations that supply another way of mapping the territory of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>.<lb/>
                  <quote>Enigma, made to be unresolved, affords the opposition of immersion, of
                        argument: it offers an opaque exterior; not offering entry or exit, it
                        posits (the generic trace of pleasure). The enigma, cued only to itself,
                        faces nothing. However, it is not bracketed. It is merely less loose among
                        particles more active. Though its delight is not extinguished, it has no
                        tendency. Its argument is that, it, is, here.<lb/> – Alan Davies, <title level="a">Private Enigma in the Opened Text</title>

                  <quote>The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because
                        of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice
                        something—because it is always before one’s eyes.)”<lb/> – Ludwig Wittgenstein,

                  <quote>The continuing power of privacy in writing can make tangible what
                        otherwise seemed invisible: the world made strange so that we can see it, as
                        in a dream of the familiar become foreign.<lb/> – Charles Bernstein, <title level="a">Thought’s Measure</title>
                  </quote> Each seems to me an
                    apt comment on <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which is a poem about open
                    secrets, about strange things lying in plain sight. So it comes to us like a
                    dream that illuminates the familiar exactly because the world’s familiarities
                    estrange the world from us.</p>
               <p>An investigation of those matters might best start with <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s signature problem, the poem’s greatest open secret: the
                    scandalous reference to “the Lady Astarte, his—” (III.iii.55). Read
                    biographically—privately—the missing word has always been supposed to be
                    “sister” and Manfred’s “half-maddening sin” (II.i.31), incest. Everything about
                    the historical context of <title level="m">Manfred</title> supports that
                    reading, which can, and I think should, be glimpsed in <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s keyword: Astarte. We haven’t studied that word, listened
                    to it, closely enough. Say it: Astarte. A star. Star is one of the poem’s most
                    prominent motif words. Say the name again: Astarte. Augusta. Star. Gus. Once you
                    see or hear that, the echo becomes irresistible. Byron called his sister “Gus.”
                    The word Astarte is an exemplary instance of a private enigma in an open text.
                    Byron casts Astarte as the traumatic sign for Manfred’s estrangement from
                    himself and his world.</p>
               <p>But <title level="m">Manfred</title> is replete with traumatic signs. Traumatic
                    and dramatic. Remember that it is “A Dramatic Poem,” not “A Poetic Drama.” The
                    description suggests why it’s so difficult to stage. It also suggests that we
                    perhaps do best to approach it as a play of words, which is how we approach the
                    plays of Gertrude Stein. The action is primarily in the ways the words behave,
                    the plot that they are driven to execute. The simplicity of the poem’s surface,
                    its rehearsal of the all-too-familiar Faust legend, is seriously deceptive.
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a play full of secrets and, as such, a
                    work whose dangerous words need to be watched closely. When we do we discover
                    that its object is to dismantle the authority of the myth of Faust, one of the
                    two great myths of Western civilization. Byron would soon undertake <title level="m">Don Juan</title> to subject that other great Western myth to a
                    similar critical investigation.</p>
               <p>So let’s look closely at <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Consider three famous
                    passages—first, this reflection on Astarte: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>What is she now?—a sufferer for my sins—</l>
                        <l>A thing I dare not think upon—or nothing. (II.ii.196-7)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> What do we think of those three alternatives Manfred gives for his
                    question “What is she now?” In point of fact, “a sufferer for my sins—A thing I
                    dare not think upon—or nothing” are far from the only alternatives. But that’s
                    all we get because that’s all Manfred at this point can think of. If we pay
                    attention to exactly what Manfred says here we ought to be provoked. </p>

                    What are we to make of the “dead” Astarte being described as “one
                    without a tomb”? The remark gives one serious pause in at least two respects.
                    First of all, in an obvious sense, it upends the question Nemesis asks.
                    Uncharnel what? Uncharnel one without a tomb? But then we also have to wonder
                    how Manfred knows she is tombless, and what exactly that could mean.</p>
               <p>The problems metastasize. Consider the action that immediately follows when
                    Nemesis actually succeeds in calling up “The Phantom of Astarte.” Commanding her
                    to speak, neither he nor Arimanes can manage it. Then Manfred tries with his
                    spasmodic, insistent, and ultimately confused prayer since, as he admits, “I
                    know not what I ask, nor what I seek: / I feel but what thou art, and what I am”
                    (II.iv.131-2). When Astarte is finally induced—<emph>prayed</emph>—to speak,
                    her words are cryptic, not least of all when Manfred makes his final desperate
                    plea: “One word for mercy” (II.iv.154). The word turns out to be Manfred’s name.
                    What does that <emph>mean</emph>?</p>
               <p> From the outset of the poem/play, Manfred has come before us as a person of
                    consummate power, knowledge, and decision. But that image of Manfred is also
                    being cunningly undermined from the very beginning. Recall, for instance, his
                    move in Act I, scene one to summon the “spirits.” A sly comical tone pervades
                    the scene where we watch him take three tries to succeed in his conjuration. He
                    didn’t know exactly how to proceed. When he finally does hit on the correct
                    formula, we discover something else that’s interesting. We see that Manfred
                    didn’t know how those “subordinate” spirits, especially the Seventh Spirit,
                    would play tricks on him. That happens because Manfred is mistaken when he tells
                    the spirit that there is no “form on earth” he <emph>would</emph> find “hideous
                    or beautiful” (I.i.184-5). Manfred has unaccountably forgotten that the “form”
                    he at once fears and desires isn’t “on earth.” So when the Seventh Spirit
                    conjures “The shape of a beautiful female figure,” Manfred falls down
                    “senseless.” This is the “shape” or image of Astarte, not her phantom or ghost.
                    “The Phantom of Astarte” won’t appear until much later.</p>
               <p>Or remember that he knew he wanted to leap from the crag but hadn’t imagined he
                    would be prevented by a Chamois Hunter. Chance intervenes to prevent his
                    suicide. But when he leaves the Chamois Hunter—let’s call him Wordsworth,
                    another of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s secrets—he was free to resume
                    what he began. But he doesn’t. So, we wonder: does he <emph>really</emph> want
                    “Forgetfulness” and “Self-Oblivion”? Do we believe it when he says that he does?
                    Does he even want to die? What exactly is Manfred after?</p>
               <p>Or remember that he says he can “call the dead / And ask them what it is we dread
                    to be” (II.ii.178-9). But when he does this in Act II scene four, he doesn’t ask
                    Astarte that question at all. His prayer to Astarte’s Phantom is largely a
                    confession of his bewilderment (“I know not what I ask or what I seek”) until he
                    stumbles at last to his desperate request for “One word for mercy.” What are we
                    to make of the Phantom’s merciless-merciful answer, “Manfred”?</p>

                    Consider how freighted that final sentence is with the language of
                    Christian theology. But here the remark has wrung out the theology that stands
                    behind the words. Manfred politely declares how deeply he is in debt “for the
                    grace accorded” to him by Nemesis, Arimanes, and the demons. But such creatures
                    are not the agents of grace. Grace is accorded by God through Jesus Christ, and
                    this grace then frees you of the debt of sin. For anyone—like myself—who has
                    internalized the discourse of grace and debt and redemption, the passage is a
                    piece of well-mannered blasphemy. It recalls nothing so much as the polite
                    exchanges between Michael and Satan in <title level="m">The Vision of
                        Judgment.</title>
               </p>
               <p>Or consider this remark in his final act of defiance against the authority of the
                    demons who come to demand that he fulfill his bargain to live out the great myth
                    of Faust. “I do not combat against Death, but thee / And thy surrounding angels”
                    (III.iv.112-3). That is surely an odd thing to declare. Had he said, or had
                    Byron written, “And thy surrounding <emph>demons</emph>” both the prosody and
                    the myth would have been preserved intact. The word “angels” is seriously
                    intrusive. Are the angels of God hanging around the action of <title level="m">Manfred</title>? When the word comes in here we are flung back in thought
                    to the time when the demons were simply rebellious angels “hurled from heaven
                    for sinning” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title> IV.1). That prehistorical event
                    is much on Manfred’s mind throughout.</p>
               <p>These striking passages invite one to think again about what is perhaps <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s greatest passage, the “Incantation” that
                    climaxes and closes Act I scene one. Though it begs for a line by line
                    examination, I will confine my comments to a few of the most salient passages.
                    First off, recall how it is introduced to us: “A Voice is heard in the
                    Incantation which follows.” That is surely far more a direction for reading than
                    what it is formally, a stage direction. But it is indeed a stage direction for
                    the play of language Byron has mounted. One can easily miss the plain meaning of
                    those words: that we should be listening for “A Voice” within the incantation
                    which follows. We hear and read an incantation as we hear and read for the
                    subtext that is working somehow or other inside. The Incantation is double-talk,
                    both “a magic voice <emph>and</emph> verse” that—<foreign xml:lang="la">mirabile dictu</foreign>—has “baptized [Manfred] with a curse”
                    (I.i.223-4).</p>
               <p>In its most obvious register the Incantation is a curse laid upon Manfred by
                    Manfred himself, as the astonishing sixth stanza makes clear: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>By thy cold breast and serpent smile, </l>
                        <l>By thy unfathom’d gulfs of guile, </l>
                        <l>By that most seeming virtuous eye, </l>
                        <l>By thy shut soul’s hypocrisy; </l>
                        <l>By the perfection of thine art </l>
                        <l>Which pass’d for human thine own heart; </l>
                        <l>By thy delight in others’ pain, </l>
                        <l>And by thy brotherhood of Cain, </l>
                        <l>I call upon thee! and compel </l>
                        <l>Thyself to be thy proper Hell! (I.i.252-61)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Manfred is the ultimate authority for the curse, just as earlier we saw
                    that he could command the spirits because his life has been ruled by “a star
                    condemn’d” (I.i.44). That would be “Astarte,” who “withered” when she “gazed on”
                    Manfred’s “heart” (II.ii.119). It would also be Manfred, since Astarte is “The
                    star which rules [his] destiny” (I.i.110).</p>
               <p> “Wither” is the key, the final word in the “Incantation.” But it is a word
                    within which we hear another word, as becomes clear when we pluck each of them
                    out of their key locations in <title level="m">Manfred</title>:

                    Wither/whither. That is one of the most provocative as well as one of
                    the most decisive wordplays in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Decisive
                    because it’s so plainly tied to the surface action, the plot as traditionally
                    understood. Whither has the withered Astarte gone, whither is the wither-cursed
                    Manfred going at the end of the poem? Unlike Manfred, who has pledged allegiance
                    to the Kantian proverb, <foreign xml:lang="la">sapere aude</foreign>, the Abbot
                    dreads to think about that because he can only imagine either heaven or hell.
                    But an entirely different “Voice” may be heard in the unreferenced first-person
                    pronouns that speak through the Incantation. It is the voice we can only call
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Not Manfred, not Astarte, not even Byron.
                        <emph>Manfred</emph>, the one word that matches the strange “mercy” being
                    offered by the poem (or is it a play?).</p>
               <p> Well, as we know, it <emph>is</emph> a play, a play of language that we are
                    called to pay attention to. Some of the moments announce themselves with an
                    outrageous, comedic directness, as when a spirit says of the “convulsed” Manfred
                    after Astarte departs at the end of Act II: “He would have made an awful spirit”
                    (II.iv.162). Of course, that word means, first of all, “awe-inspiring,” like God
                    Almighty. But a ludic voice is heard in the spirit’s language that Byron would
                    soon let loose (1818) when he published <title level="m">Beppo</title>, written
                    shortly after <title level="m">Manfred</title>. It is a vulgate meaning of
                    “awful” that he received out of his Scots linguistic heritage and that is now
                    perhaps the primary meaning of the word. <note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Burns supplies good instances of the Scots usage—for instance in <title level="a">Tam O’Shanter</title>, 141.</note> In <title level="m">Beppo</title>, Byron again puns upon that word, or rather torques and
                        <emph>works</emph> it, to skewer the pious poet Sotheby as “A stalking
                    oracle of awful phrase” (LXXIV). </p>
               <p> Or consider the three times that <title level="m">Manfred</title> calls up the
                    image of a desert, the psychic place referenced in the contemporary lyric
                    “Stanzas to Augusta”: “In the desert a fountain is springing” (45). In <title level="m">Manfred</title> the word is carefully manipulated in order to
                    effect its striking final transformation and transvaluation. Here is the word in
                    its first two appearances: <quote>

                  </quote> That spelling, unusual now, was still a common orthographic form in
                    Byron’s time. But the word could be—and was by Byron—spelled both ways, and
                    in <title level="m">Manfred</title> Byron exploited the optional spelling to
                    fine effect. The third usage comes in Manfred’s climactic act of defiance in the
                    final scene. I shall quote the relevant passage at some length because it has
                    some further, equally remarkable and equally salient, word plays.

                  </quote> The pentameter line has, as throughout <title level="m">Manfred</title>, an iambic base, and in this passage, we see that all the lines
                    are quite regular until we come to the initial foot of “Born from the knowledge
                    of its own desert.” The line opens with an inversion but then quickly resumes
                    its iambic regularity. When we reach the final foot of the line, we would have
                    another clear inversion <emph>if</emph> the word were spelled “desart,” as it
                    was spelled twice before. But here it is spelled “desert” and the difference
                    exposes a word play that Byron achieves through prosodic ambiguity. If the
                    accent is left to fall on the word’s first syllable, then the line echoes the
                    idea (and the word) of “In the desert a fountain is springing.” But if it is
                    left to fall on the second syllable, filling out the iambic rhythm, then the
                    word means something else. It means “dessert,” and we hear in the line an echo
                    of Manfred coming at last to his just desserts. </p>
               <p> Is Byron also playing with the phrase “Born from”? It’s hard to think otherwise.
                    And if we look closely at the next four lines, in particular the parallel syntax
                    in the statement “I have been . . . my own destroyer and will be my own
                    hereafter,” more games with language are in play. “Hereafter” is primarily an
                    adverb and here, at first encounter so to speak, that is how we read it. But
                    because the parallelism encourages one to read it simultaneously as a noun, the
                    line is made to carry a virtually Nietzchean meaning. Note how the word “own,”
                    under these pressures, also slightly shifts its meaning the second time around. </p>
               <p> Or what about the comment Nemesis makes after “The Phantom of Astarte” leaves:
                    “She’s gone, and will not be recall’d” (II.iv.180). Actually, Astarte will never
                        <emph>not</emph> be “recall’d” (remembered) exactly because she is, like
                    Manfred himself at the play’s conclusion, “gone” forever. As such, she has
                    become what the dead Leila is to the Giaour, “The Morning-star of Memory”
                    (1130). This kind of Byronic loss operates according to a poetic formula laid
                    out in a lovely little poem Byron wrote shortly after returning in 1811 from his
                    Levantine sojourn. Though probably written with John Edleston specifically in
                    mind, the verses recall as well three other keenly felt losses: John Wingfield,
                    Charles Skinner Matthews, and his mother. <quote>

                  </quote> These are only some of the language games that play about <title level="m">Manfred</title>. I’ve noticed others, and I’ve no doubt that still
                    others have escaped my attention. While I leave those to your discovery, it may
                    be useful to recall that <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s structure depends in
                    great part on a handful of keywords like fear [9], mind [11], hour [12], “star”
                    [14], voice [15], soul [18], come [31], power [39], earth [46]. “Gone,” though
                    less frequently repeated, is yet another since it is invoked at three of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s most significant moments: II.iv.155, III.ii.29,
                    and III.iv.152-153. And, of course, “spirit” is everywhere, all of them, I
                    believe, transformations of what Manfred calls “the inborn spirit” 
                    (III.ii.22)—to make a distinction with the spirit or soul of men created by God. Such words
                    form a constellation of echoing motifs that recall the pervading presence of
                    Manfred’s epipsyche, Astarte, whose being and absent presence is specifically
                    linked to music (see I.i.175-9 and II.iv.134-5), as is Manfred’s:

                    significant demands on a reader’s attention. They underscore the aggressive
                    strangeness of one particular passage that we want to look at carefully. Coming
                    after Manfred turns off the Witch of the Alps and her offer to help him gain
                    what he “wishes” (II.ii.157), the passage is a kind of gloss on two enigmatic
                    but crucial lines in the “Incantation”: “Though thy death shall still seem near
                    / To thy wish, but as a fear” (I.i.256-7).

                  </quote> No one, I submit, can follow that passage and claim to understand what
                    it is saying while it is being read. Even when we excavate its allusions it
                    resists. Part of the difficulty is its odd juxtaposition of a mysterious
                    biblical event with a recondite episode from Greek history. Perhaps even more
                    obdurate are its rich and cryptic linguistic particulars. Consider as well how
                    the fall of that arresting language follows upon a phrase—“if they answer 
                    not”—that floats in an ambiguous syntactic space. It comes at first as a hanging
                    afterthought but then shifts to the opening of a sentence that is never
                    completed, the words dissolving into the dark exempla of two men who (vainly)
                    sought helpful knowledge from the dead. </p>
               <p>As if anticipating a reader’s puzzlement, Byron added an explanatory note to
                    clarify the second of those exempla: <quote> The story of Pausanias, king of
                        Sparta, (who commanded the Greeks at the battle of Platea, and afterwards
                        perished for an attempt to betray the Lacedemonians) and Cleonice, is told
                        in Plutarch's life of Cimon; and in the Laconics of Pausanias the Sophist,
                        in his description of Greece. (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:473) </quote>
                    Such a note only doubles down on the obscure verse. It has all the perversity,
                    though none of the slapstick, of those wonderfully preposterous notes Byron
                    attached to <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Reading this note, one wants to
                    reprise what Byron wrote in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> of Coleridge’s
                    obscure “metaphysics”: “Explaining his poetics to the nation, / We wish he’d
                    annotate his annotation” (see <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, “Introduction”
                    II).</p>
               <p> And we <emph>could</emph> annotate Byron’s annotation, as various editors have.
                    But if we did, the original textual problems would scarcely be removed. All the
                    words in the passage still preserve—indeed, they positively “fulfill”—their
                    “dubious import.” Certainly, we recognize that Pausanias and Cleonice are being
                    offered as types to Manfred’s and Astarte’s antitypes, but after we make that
                    equation our reflections on the ancient historical episode that Byron
                    elliptically lays out simply run free. “Dubious import”? I <emph>guess</emph>
                    so! The two sources Byron cites, Plutarch and Pausanias the Sophist, tell very
                    different versions of the story. As we pause over a glorious phrase like
                    “Arcadian Evocators,” we might well think—or hear—the passage itself as
                        <emph>evocative</emph>. </p>
               <p> Verse and note are alike seriously <emph>pro</emph>vocative, inviting us to
                    search out the relevance of Byron’s recollected tale. But the language of the
                    passage is such that it erects a kind of maze from its flagrant language. Where
                    to begin researching those particulars? Suppose we bracket out everything but
                    the central event, the murder of Cleonice, what do we get? This is what Byron’s
                    records—not Byron’s note—tell us. Pausanias has taken Cleonice, a princess
                    of Bithynia, for his mistress. When she comes at night to his chamber, she
                    accidentally overturns the lamp that was burning at his bedside. In the darkness
                    he awakes startled and, thinking she is an enemy, kills her with his sword,
                    “unknowing what he slew” (II.ii.186). Although the scene vaguely recalls what we
                    were told of Astarte’s death, it is the bedside lamp—unmentioned in Byron’s
                    verse or prose note—that leaps to attention, taking one back to the very
                    opening line of <title level="m">Manfred</title>: “The lamp must be
                    replenish’d”! </p>
               <p>To register that odd nexus, to make the connection that is at once hidden and
                    invited, produces a seriously uncanny effect. Were the deaths of Cleonice and
                    Astarte in some unrecognized sense Manfred’s fatality, the condition holding
                    him—before the play or even his life began—to his “enduring” vigil? <title level="m">Manfred</title> seems a play of language in which secrets lie
                    about everywhere, awaiting—seeking—discovery. This passage fairly defines
                    how <title level="m">Manfred</title> repeatedly “send[s] us prying into the
                    abyss” of its seductive intimations (<title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                        Pilgrimage</title> IV.166).</p>
               <p>The first person to annotate Byron’s annotation was Goethe, who was interested
                    because he knew <title level="m">Manfred</title> had been composed with his own
                        <title level="m">Faust </title>(Part I) in mind. We’ve already heard Peter
                    Manning’s brilliant remarks on Goethe’s misreading, but I return to Goethe now
                    because his commentary illuminates why Byron found Goethe’s famous poem the
                    perfect vehicle for roughing up the Western myth of Faust.</p>
               <p>Goethe begins with fulsome praise for what he calls the “wonderful phenomenon” of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>, “Byron’s tragedy”: <quote> This singular
                        intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the
                        strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the
                        impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of
                        them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot
                        enough admire his genius. (qtd. in <title level="m">Works</title> V:506-7)
                    <note place="foot" resp="author">Byron heard of Goethe’s 1820 review of
                            <title level="m">Manfred</title> and asked Richard Belgrave Hoppner to
                        make a translation of it for him. It is printed by R. E. Prothero in his
                        edition of <title level="m">The Works of Lord Byron: Letters and
                            Journals</title> (London, 1901) V. 506-507.</note>

                    Searching through
                    “the alterations [Byron] has made” to his poem, Goethe recognizes in <title level="m">Manfred</title> “the quintessence of the most astonishing talent
                    born to be its own tormenter.” Seeing that, admiring it, he then confesses his
                    “dissatisfaction” with <title level="m">Manfred</title>, judging “that the
                    gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last oppressive to
                    us.” </p>
               <p> As Peter Manning has pointed out in his essay from this volume, however,
                    Goethe’s view is based on a comically mistaken piece of gossip about Byron’s
                    personal sin and guilt. Completely absorbed in Byronic mythology, Goethe writes
                    that <quote> When a bold and enterprising young man, he won the affections of a
                        Florentine lady. Her husband discovered the amour, and murdered his wife;
                        but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street, and there was
                        no one on whom any suspicion could be attached. Lord Byron removed from
                        Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his life after. </quote> Guess
                    what? That would be a mashup of the stories of <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>, <title level="m">The Corsair</title>, and <title level="m">Lara</title> set in Italy! Believing the Florentine tale to be true, Goethe
                    goes on to argue that the Pausanias and Cleonice passage reflects Byron
                    “select[ing] a scene from antiquity, appropriat[ing] it to himself, and
                    burden[ing] his tragic image with it.” Byron was much amused by Goethe’s
                    fantasy.</p>
               <p> Yet in one obvious sense, Goethe is correct. Byron did select and burden his
                    poem and his hero with that tale from antiquity. But Goethe’s reading misfires
                    not so much because it is so badly misinformed about Byron’s actual life. It
                    misses its mark because <title level="m">Manfred</title> is about as far from
                    what Goethe repeatedly calls it, a “tragedy,” as that famous “Greatest Story
                    Ever Told” hovering in <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s background. Although
                    guilt and suffering are the pivot points of both stories—Jesus is crucified
                    and Manfred, like Ahab, has “a crucifixion in his face”—their finales are in
                    the strictest sense comic. </p>
               <p>Many have understandably glossed <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s climactic
                    scene with the closing lines of his poem “Prometheus,” Byron’s pastiche of a
                    chorus from Aeschylus’s lost play <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>:
                    “Triumphant where it dares defy / And making death a victory” (58-9). But <title level="m">Manfred</title> does not actually conclude in a posture of
                    triumphant defiance. That moment comes in the poem’s penultimate scene, when the
                    demons are dismissed. The finale comes afterwards and centers in Manfred’s
                    famous, even complacent, last words: “Old man! ’tis not so difficult to die.”
                    After the fitful fevers of his life, Manfred expects to sleep well. </p>
               <p>Most telling, Manfred’s last words echo St. Paul’s gloss on the meaning of the
                    life of Jesus, a tale whose argument is “that ye put off . . . the old man . . .
                    and put on the new man” (Ephesians 4: 22-24). Christian theology regards the
                    life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as a fundamentally comic action, a view
                    gloriously represented in Dante’s <foreign xml:lang="la">
                     <title level="m">Divina Commedia</title>
                  </foreign>. <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a comic action as well, but, being a kind of parody of
                    the Christian story, it also involves a series of comical texts that help to
                    build up the insidious, truly Nietzschean, joke on which <title level="m">Manfred</title> concludes. The last state of Manfred is far different from
                    the first. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Goethe said, “closely touched me,” and it is
                    easy to see that <title level="m">Faust</title> Part II marshals an argument
                    against the “unbounded and exuberant despair” that he found so “oppressive” in
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>. We know that in December 1816 Goethe had
                    sketched out a plan for Part II, but that plan did not indicate exactly how Part
                    II would end. It seems that reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1817,
                    which Goethe did, set him on his course to bring Faust to the redemption he
                    receives in Part II Act V when angels “bear Faust’s immortal essence” into
                    heaven. The redeemed Faust is exalted because his struggles have purified him:

                  </quote> As Goethe told Eckermann in 1831, he wanted Part II to move beyond the
                    tragic action of Part I—he saw Part I as a tragedy—to install a poetic
                    conception that “harmonizes perfectly with our religious views; according to
                    which we can obtain heavenly bliss, not through our strength alone, but with the

               <p> I bring up Goethe and Part II of <title level="m">Faust</title> in order to
                    spell out the sharp differences between their respective comedies. In a late
                    letter Goethe said that Part II was organized around a set of “very seriously
                    intended jests (<emph>Scherzen</emph>).” <note place="foot" resp="author">
                        The matter is discussed in Herman Meyer, <title level="a">'These Very
                            Serious Jests,'</title> reprinted in the first (1976) Norton Critical
                        Edition of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's <title level="m">Faust. A
                            Tragedy</title>, op. cit. ed., 603-615.</note> These enable the work’s
                    economy of grace and the redemption of Faust. But the comedy of <title level="m">Manfred</title> is different—indeed, it is deeply irreverent. Manfred has
                    no interest in either atonement or redemption (“What I have done is done”). He
                    rejects both as clearly as had Byron throughout his life. </p>
               <p> What has happened in Byron’s poem that has brought Manfred to his peaceful
                    death? Consider again the Pausanias and Cleonice passage, in this case the
                    opening lines:

                     </sp>
                  </quote> Though Manfred indeed has “no natural fear” (I.i.25), though he is
                    proud and defiant in face of all circumstance, he is nonetheless wracked by
                    fear. Indeed, he sees his life’s purpose not to overcome but exactly to
                    “champion human fears” (II.ii.205). </p>
               <p>So, what <emph>is</emph> it “that we dread to be,” that Manfred dreads to be, and
                    that he means to champion? He calls the dead, Astarte, to find out. The
                    consequence of their interview at the end of Act II, and of Manfred’s fearfully
                    tormented prayer to her, is the entirely untormented Act III. The psychic change
                    in Manfred is dramatic. We know, we can see, what has happened: in the end,
                    Manfred has no fears at all, natural or unnatural. We want to know why. What is
                    it that we’re <emph>not</emph> seeing?</p>
               <p>It helps to recall that Astarte declares “Manfred” the “one word for mercy.” In
                    addition, it helps to parse the cunning wordplays in “what it is we dread to be
                    . . . that is nothing.” One can scarcely not think of Hamlet’s famous soliloquy
                    and the “consummation devoutly to be wished” that Hamlet could not, however,
                    commit to. Before his interview with Astarte, Manfred dreads to be mortal and
                    therefore finally “nothing.” Manfred’s is the Faustian fear <emph>to be</emph>
                    mortal, simply to be Manfred: unpurified, unatoned, unredeemed, and—finally—“gone”:
                    “of the earth, earthy,” and then at last—to appropriate and shift the
                    Abbot’s final word—“earthless.”</p>
               <p>A letter Byron wrote in 1819 to Richard Hoppner helps to gloss the meaning of the
                    Byronic “mercy” exposed in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Visiting Bologna,
                    he stopped at the Certosa Cemetery and was deeply moved by the epitaphs engraved
                    on the tombs of Martini Luigi and Lucrezia Pinini: “<foreign xml:lang="ro">implora pace</foreign>,” “<foreign xml:lang="it">implora eterna
                        quiete</foreign>”. “It appears to me,” he wrote, “that these two and three
                    words comprise and compress all that can be said on the subject—and then in
                    Italian they are absolute Music” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:147). That
                    would be the absolute music of, say, <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, not
                    the Music of the Spheres.</p>
               <p>The comedy of <title level="m">Manfred</title> has set the agenda for the
                    soon-to-be-written <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don
                        Juan.</title> One thinks of Byron’s cheeky reply to John Murray’s request to
                    give up <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and write “a great work,” something
                    serious—an “epic”! <quote> I'll try no such thing; I hate tasks. And then
                        “seven or eight years!” God send us all well this day three months, let
                        alone years. . . . You have so many “divine” poems, is it nothing to have
                        written a human one? without any of your worn-out machinery? (April 6, 1819,
                            <title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:105) </quote>
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> has a lot of worn out poetical—and 
                    religious—machinery. Indeed, the whole point of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was to
                    give that machinery its final <emph>quietus</emph>. Reading it in 1817, Murray
                    and his editorial committee were uneasy, and especially with the outrageous
                    comedy of the original third act where the Abbot is manhandled by Astarte’s dark
                    double, Ashtaroth, who carries him off singing a profane jingle. They begged him
                    to rewrite it, and he did. But, by 1819, Byron was no longer open to such pleas,
                    having seen the first two cantos of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> expurgated
                    without his knowledge or permission. </p>
               <p>And yet perhaps <title level="m">Manfred</title> was improved by taking out those
                    Monty Python hijinks. The work’s impious argument loses none of its force, or
                    comic charm, for being better mannered. </p>
