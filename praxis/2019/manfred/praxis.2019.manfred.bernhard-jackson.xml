        <p rend="noCount">This essay suggests that Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> contains not an expression of Byron’s guilt about his
          incest with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, as previous critics have suggested, but rather considerable evidence of his lack of guilt. It
          argues that the play displays incest and torment, but in fact does not link the two, instead displaying Manfred’s love for Astarte as deeply
          felt without regrets. The essay then argues that one finds the same combination of deep love and lack of regret in Byron’s remarks about his
          relationship with his half-sister, as well as in the representations of incest in his other works. It suggests that this acceptance of
          incest links to Byron’s commitment to rational thinking and personal freedom, and it invites future criticism to explore this connection in
          more detail.</p>

        <p><title level="m">Manfred</title> has incest and guilt at its core. Manfred has committed incest, and he is obsessively guilty. Two hundred
          years' worth of critics and scholars have considered the significance and inter-relationship of these two, and most agree that Manfred
          expresses guilt for having committed incest with his sister, Astarte. Moreover, many acknowledge that Manfred's incest is a mirror of
          Byron’s incestuous relationship with <emph>his</emph> sister, Augusta Leigh, and suggest that Manfred's guilt is an expression of Byron’s
            own.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For relevant twentieth-century readings, see, for example, Peter Thorslev, <title level="a">Incest

          concern in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, and a central concern to the Byron who wrote <title level="m">Manfred</title>. I would argue,
          however, that <title level="m">Manfred </title> the text and Manfred the character show not Byron's guilt over his incest with Augusta
          Leigh, but rather his lack of guilt. Furthermore, this is a lack that Byron continues to display in various ways in his later work, and one
          for which he has larger intellectual reasons.</p>
        <p>Byron plants the seeds of Manfred's lack of guilt in the character's opening monologue. Here Manfred proclaims: "Good or evil, life, /
          Powers, passions, all I see in other beings, / Have been to me as rain unto the sands, / Since that all-nameless hour" (I.i.21-4). This is a
          time-honored dramatic maneuver, a proleptic announcement that keeps the audience in suspense until a text reveals all at a later time. In
            <title level="m">Manfred</title>, however, that time never comes. In the course of the play, "that hour" remains literally "all-nameless":
          no one ever explains when or what it was. The closest anyone comes is in the exchange between Manfred and the Witch of the Alps in the
          second scene of the second act:<quote>

              </lg>
            </sp></quote> Once unpicked, this deeply unclear clarification reveals the source of Manfred's guilt to be not incest but Astarte's death
          and his role in causing it. A rough paraphrase of these lines would be,<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>I loved her, and made her no more. . . .</l>
              <l>I didn’t physically murder her, but I revealed to her my feelings for her,</l>
              <l>And that killed her. I’ve been the cause</l>
              <l>Of physical bloodshed, but not hers—although she did physically shed blood—</l>
              <l>I saw it—and could not stop the bleeding. . . . </l>
              <l>Daughter of Air! I’m telling you that since the moment of her death—</l>
              <l>But words are just air—watch me when I sleep</l>
              <l>Or when I’m unoccupied—Come sit with me then!</l>
              <l>My isolation isn’t isolation anymore;</l>
              <l>I’m always stalked by those infernal goddesses who demand vengeance.</l>
            </lg></quote> Although the play does not make explicit a connection between "that all-nameless hour" and "that hour" (and note that in the
          second case, too, "that" is a floating referent, referring back to nothing), in this passage "that hour" appears to link back to the moment
          when Astarte's "blood was shed— / I saw—and could not staunch it," not to the moment when Manfred and Astarte had sexual relations.</p>
        <p>The text goes on to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Manfred has committed incest, and it persistently establishes that he is
          tormented, but it never actually connects the two. In fact, the construction of Manfred's revelation to the Witch figures his motive for
          incest not as lust or as a desire to do evil, but as love: "I loved her, and destroy'd her!" His soliloquy after she departs reiterates this:<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>If I had never lived, that which I love</l>
              <l>Had still been living; had I never loved,</l>
              <l>That which I loved would still be beautiful—</l>
              <l>Happy and giving happiness. (II.ii.193-6)</l>
            </lg></quote> Even when he confronts the Phantom of Astarte, he seeks not expiation for incest but reassurance that she does not hate him
          and is not suffering: "Say that thou loath'st me not—that I do bear / This punishment for both" (II.iv.125-6). Manfred makes no reference to
          a sense of guilt here, only to an imposed punishment and an overwhelming love.</p>
        <p>But <title level="m">Manfred</title> does not limit itself to repeated evidence that Manfred does not regret his sexual relationship with
          Astarte. It also emphasizes Byron's lack of compunction about <emph>his</emph> incest. It achieves this in part by Manfred's declarations of
          love for Astarte, in part by the strength of his lack of regret, and in part by the play's obsessive avoidance of naming the act of incest.
          If this last sounds counterintuitive, that is because it is. It needs to be. As D.L. MacDonald has pointed out, Byron could scarcely
          announce his love affair with his sister to the public, but <title level="m">Manfred</title> nonetheless refers to it "obsessively, but by
          aposiopesis," as well as by persistent lacunae and allusions that draw attention to the act rather than disguising it (37). Manfred tells
          the Chamois Hunter that they loved each other as they "should not love" (II.i.27); he later informs the Witch that his beloved "was like me
          in lineaments" (II.ii.105); the servant Manuel is significantly interrupted just at the right moment in his description of Astarte,<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>her, whom of all earthly things</l>
              <l>That lived, the only thing he [Manfred] seemed to love,—</l>
              <l>As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,</l>
              <l>The lady Astarte, his—</l>
              <l rendition="#indent2">Hush, who comes here? (III.iii.44-7)</l>
            </lg></quote> Just in case there should be any doubt, Manfred reminds the Phantom of Astarte that "it were / The deadliest sin to love as
          we have loved" (II.iv.123-4): not many kinds of love fit that bill. In fact, the play's very existence is a demonstration of Byron's absence
          of remorse. According to a statement drawn up by Lady Byron in 1816, rumors of Byron's sexual connection to Leigh had "become current in the
          World" before his departure from England (qtd. in Marchand 589), and when a man suspected of incest publishes a verse drama about a man who
          seems to have committed incest, pangs of conscience do not appear to have played a role in either the incest or the publication.</p>
        <p>Reviewers certainly understood precisely what was not being named. Francis Jeffrey deplored the "painful and offensive nature of the
          circumstance" on which the play's "distress was ultimately founded" (140). In the <title level="j">British Review</title>, William Roberts
          wrote that Manfred's love "appears to have been of the sort that lies under a natural interdict" (86), while the <title level="j">Day and
            New Times</title> put it more plainly, explaining that Manfred "committed incest!" In fact, the <title level="j">Day and New
          Times</title>, at least, knew what had occurred outside the text as well as in: its announcement of Manfred's incest was followed by the
          assertion, "Lord Byron has coloured Manfred into his own personal features" (130).</p>
        <p>It is not unreasonable to suggest that an author who wants to keep a secret should be more secretive, nor to suggest that an author who is
          not terribly secretive might not want to keep his secret. Byron was fully aware of the public horror and censure that would attend upon any
          clear revelation that his hero and his hero's sister, or he and his own half-sister, had committed incest. It is significant that Manfred
          takes care to clarify that he alone is responsible for what transpired with Astarte: "What is she now?—a sufferer for my sins" (II.ii.96-7).
          In an 1814 letter Byron exhorted Lady Melbourne, his confidant in the matter, not to reproach Leigh for having sex with him: "it was not her
          fault—but my own <emph>folly</emph>" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:27, Byron’s emphasis).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on
            contemporaneous responses to and beliefs about incest, see James Twitchell, <title level="m">Forbidden Partners: The Incest Taboo in
              Modern Culture</title> (Columbia UP, 1989).</note> But his awareness of risk did not stop him from publishing a work that he knew would
          be widely read as confessional, featuring as its main character a version of himself who demonstrated no regret for what he had done. All
          this suggests that, while he may have been concerned about public reaction, he, like Manfred, did not regret the act itself.</p>
        <p>In fact, Byron's justification for his actions also mirrors Manfred's, except that while Manfred cries his love, Byron confided it. He
          wrote to Lady Melbourne that Leigh was "twined round my heart in every possible manner—dearest &amp; deepest in my hope &amp; my memory"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:69). Still, for both creator and created, this love is rendered legitimate by reason of its uniqueness
          and the great gap it fills. "I have wandered o'er the earth, / And never found thy likeness" (II.iv.144-5) Manfred tells Astarte, while
          Byron wrote to Leigh, "we—at least—I—am by a crowd of circumstances removed from the only being who could ever have loved me, or whom I can
          unmixedly feel attached to" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:95).</p>
        <p>In light of this quotation, it seems significant that Byron was as reluctant as his hero to stop referring to his forbidden relationship.
          Even before <title level="m">Manfred</title>, he inserted a reference in <title level="m"> Childe Harold</title> III, where the waters of
          Lake Leman "sound sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved" (95). More interesting, however, is a very carefully encoded reference in <title
            level="m">Don Juan</title> two years later, in the passage in which Donna Julia is excusing her way toward adultery:<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>She now determined that a virtuous woman</l>
              <l>Should rather face and overcome temptation,</l>
              <l>That flight was base and dastardly, and no man</l>
              <l>Should ever give her heart the least sensation;</l>
              <l>That is to say, a thought beyond the common</l>
              <l>Preference, that we must feel upon occasion</l>
              <l>For people who are pleasanter than others,</l>
              <l>But then they only seem so many brothers. (I.77)</l>
            </lg></quote> As Byron points out, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> contains "much which could not be appreciated / In any manner by the
          uninitiated,” and in this stanza the reference to his personal experience may go unnoticed by those not on the look-out (XIV.22). But for
          those aware of the facts of Byron's personal life, it is difficult to read the seemingly innocuous last line of this passage without finding
          it considerably less than innocuous. Byron, after all, knew how some women act toward their brothers. What's more, in a passage that pulls
          the rug out from under each of Julia's virtuous stratagems, revealing them as merely excuses to edge toward sin, such sly acknowledgement
          that the fraternal can turn—indeed, in one particularly relevant case has turned—into something more makes perfect sense. Julia, <title
            level="m">Don Juan</title> is telling its initiated readers, is fooling herself about the asexuality of brothers.</p>
        <p>Jerome McGann has written that the job of <title level="m">Juan</title>'s reader is not so much to "decipher the text" as to "describe and
          retrace" Byron's "acts of encipherment,” and Gary Dyer has built on this to suggest that one might fruitfully focus on both the encipherment
          and its context and meanings (207; 573). Indeed, what is most fascinating about this moment in which incest is enciphered is the meaning of
          its existence in its context: the fact that, given contemporaneous notions of morality, Byron chose to include it in a published work at
          all. Literature is not thick with joking references to incest, because incest is not something authors or audiences usually take lightly.
          But Byron does. Now, it is true that the Byron of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> takes pretty much everything lightly. That aspect,
          however, was precisely what most repulsed reviewers: William Hazlitt complained of the poem that "Our enthusiasm for genius or virtue is . .
          . turned into a jest by the very person who has kindled it . . . It is not that Lord Byron is sometimes serious and sometimes trifling,
          sometimes profligate and sometimes moral; but when he is most serious and most moral, he is only preparing to mortify the unsuspecting
          reader by putting a pitiful hoax upon him" (162). Hazlitt and others objected to this facet of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> because to
          joke about morals is to suggest their insignificance, to announce that they are foolish enough to be the subject of jokes. By inserting his
          sly joke—that a woman may feel a preference for men "who are pleasanter than others, / But then they only seem so many brothers"—Byron
          suggests that the idea that brothers are, naturally, sexually off-limits is laughable, that sibling incest (not least his own, which is the
          basis for the joke in the first place) is something harmless enough to be the root of a joke. The meaning of this moment, then, is Byron's
          own casual relationship with incest and its prohibition.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, this revelation is only accessible to the initiated: those readers who know Byron's past and make the connection. By the time
          he writes <title level="m">Cain</title> in 1821, however, Byron has decided to declare his feelings more openly than he did in either <title
            level="m">Juan</title> or <title level="m">Manfred</title>. As Heather Stansbury has recently pointed out, this final Byronic portrayal of
          incest represents it not as something to be condemned, "but, rather, entirely natural" (25). Astounded by Lucifer's revelation that
          brother-sister love will one day be a sin "in your children" (I.ii.361), Cain's wife and sister, Adah, asks rhetorically,<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>Was not he, their father,</l>
              <l>Born of the same sole womb in the same hour</l>
              <l>With me? Did we not love each other? And</l>
              <l>In multiplying our being multiply</l>
              <l>Things which will love each other as we love</l>
              <l>Them . . . ? (I.ii.367-72)</l>
            </lg></quote> Incest here is not merely natural but logical.</p>
        <p>In addition, <title level="m">Cain</title> portrays the incestuous love of a sister as the prop that outlasts all others. Exiled from the
          Garden of Eden, separated from his family and the life he has known, Cain goes forth hand in hand with Adah, who will join him both in
          sorrow and in peopling the world: "Now, Cain! I will divide thy burden with thee . . . Lead! thou shalt be my God, and may our God / Be
          thine! Now let us carry forth our children" (III.i.551-5). Stansbury writes that Byron "describes the product of incest," Adah and Cain's
          son Enoch, "as a means of strengthening the family bond," but Byron also shows sibling incest itself as a means of strengthening that bond
          (25). Cain's mother, Eve, calls down "the eternal Serpent's curse" on him for killing Abel (III.i.403); his father banishes him
          (III.i.444-5). Only the sister who is also his wife cleaves to him. Byron even goes so far as to transfer into Adah’s mouth the plea for
          mercy that Cain makes in the Bible. The Bible passage, "And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment <emph>is</emph> greater than I can bear.

        <p>The deeper question raised by all this discreet and indiscreet support for incest is “Why?” Why produce works that extol incest as love and
          that extol that love as the greatest support in life? Why hint at, make jokes about, and eventually openly approve sibling incest, when it
          would be much easier, safer, and more generous to the sister you say you love to keep quiet about having participated in that act?</p>
        <p>The answer is both simple and complex, grounded in both Byron's psyche and his ethic. First, Byron liked being seen to be bad. He wanted
          and expected <title level="m">Manfred</title> to cause some sort of scandal. In a surely unique combination of (hopefully) unconscious
          appropriateness and irony, he wrote to Augusta Leigh in March of 1818 asking if the publication of the drama had caused "a pucker" (<title
            level="m">CPW</title> IV:466) Hints of incest more than ensured that pucker.</p>
        <p>Second, there is the effect of distance. Just as his time in Europe had made Byron less aware of the habits and mores of English society,
          it may be that it had made the society and people he knew there less real to him.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Byron's growing
            distance from English society, see Peter Manning, <title level="a">Don Juan and the Revisionary Self,</title>
            <title level="m">Romantic Revisions</title>, eds. Robert Brinkley and Keith Hanley (Cambridge UP, 1992), pp. 210-26.</note> In 1819 he
          wrote ruefully to Leigh, "Three years absence—&amp; the total change of scene and habit make such a difference—that we have now nothing in
          common but our affections &amp; our relationship" (<title level="m">BLJ </title> VI:129). The loss of immediacy brought by distance would
          explain why he was not held back by the potential harm his revelations might cause to Leigh.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on
            Byron's egotism, see Lytton Strachey, <title level="a">Byron, Shelley, Keats and Lamb,</title>
            <title level="m">Characters and Commentaries </title> (Chatto and Windus, 1933), pp. 53-68.</note></p>
        <p>Finally, he may simply never have considered what harm he might do, or he simply might not have cared. Daniel McVeigh argues that Byron's "hints
          about their incest would have been unconscionable had he perceived a real threat against" Leigh (611). But Byron <emph>did</emph> perceive a
          threat, as evidenced by his remarks to Lady Melbourne, about "my . . . folly" and, later, of his "misery . . . on <emph>her</emph> account"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:69, Byron’s emphasis). Perhaps the potential damage to Leigh did not outweigh his own wishes. Empathy for
          individuals was never Byron's strong suit.</p>
        <p>It would do a disservice to Byron, however, to suggest that these were his only reasons for choosing to write what he did. He also had
          strong philosophical reasons for doing so. As Evan Gottlieb observes, Byron was highly rational, and predominantly interested in society,
          particularly in the structures and masks society imposed (99-100). Byron's personal experience would have given him empirical evidence that
          the incest prohibition was one of these imposed structures, not least because he began his liaison with his sister with a certain sense that
          what he was doing was wrong, but that sense quickly vanished. On August 11, 1813, when the affair was still in its early stages, he
          commented to Lady Melbourne that "I should have been glad of your advice how to untie two or three '<emph>Gordion</emph> knots' tied round
          me . . . some are rather closely twisted round my heart" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III:87-88, Byron’s emphasis), and on August 22, he
          wrote to Thomas Moore, "I am, at this moment, in a far more serious, and entirely new, scrape than any of the last twelve months—and that is
          saying a good deal” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III: 96). <note place="foot" resp="editors">A passage did follow this announcement, but
            Moore put asterisks in its place. This is not entirely unusual: in order to make Byron’s letters palatable to a wide audience (one that
            would include women), Moore replaced with asterisks numerous passages that he deemed unacceptable to such readers. Unfortunately for
            scholarship, Moore’s published versions of these letters are now the only ones that exist. Because of this, it is impossible for us to
            guess what Byron added here.</note> Yet he quickly sloughed off these worries. When Lady Melbourne wrote to him on April 25, 1814, "I
          could talk &amp; reason with you for two Hours, so many objections to urge, and after all, for what—<del rend="overstrike">for the sake of
            Augusta</del>—is it worth while!"<note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrase “for the sake of Augusta” is crossed out in the original
            document. It is impossible to know how Melbourne originally intended it to connect to what remains.</note> Byron responded firmly.<quote>
            Oh! but it is "worth while"—I can't tell you why— . . . however I will positively reform—you must however allow—that it is utterly
            impossible I can ever be half as well liked elsewhere—and I have been all my life trying to make some one love me—&amp; never got the sort
            that I preferred before. But positively she &amp; I will grow good—&amp; all that—&amp; so we are <emph>now</emph> and shall be these
            three weeks &amp; more too.———<note place="foot" resp="editors">Quotations from <title level="m">BLJ</title> III:87-8, 96; Gross 171;
                <title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:104.</note></quote> This response is an ambivalent promise of reformation if ever there were one—note
          that dismissive "&amp; all that." But it is also an unambiguous endorsement of the behavior—consider that outburst, "Oh, but it is worth
          while!"</p>
        <p>Nor does Byron seem to have changed his mind over time. In April 1817, he wrote to Leigh from Switzerland, "I shall never find any one like
          you—nor you (vain as it may seem) like me. We are just formed to pass our lives together" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:96); three years
          later, after four years away from her, he wrote: "I always loved you better than any earthly existence, and I always shall unless I go mad"
            (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:159). Manfred's moving pleas to the Phantom of Astarte,<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>Astarte! my beloved! speak to me:</l>
              <l>I have so much endured—so much endure—</l>
              <l>Look on me! the grave hath not changed thee more</l>
              <l>Than I am changed for thee . . .</l>
              <l>One word for mercy! Say, thou lovest me. (II.iv.119-21)</l>
            </lg></quote> find echo in Byron's writing to Leigh:<quote> When you write to me speak of yourself—&amp; say that you love me—never mind
            common-place people &amp; topics—which can be in no degree interesting—to me who see nothing in England but the country which holds
              <emph>you</emph> . . . They say absence destroys weak passions—&amp; confirms strong ones—Alas! <emph>mine</emph> for you is the union
            of all passions &amp; of all affections—I do not speak of <emph>physical</emph>destruction—for I have endured &amp; can endure much—but of
            the annihilation of all thoughts feelings or hopes—which have not more or less a reference to you. (<title level="m">BLJ</title>
              VI:129-30)</quote> In fact, Byron's connection to Leigh seems to have brought him the deepest, most frank, and longest-lasting love of his
          life (although what exactly "love" meant for Byron is difficult to say).</p>
        <p>When one considers Byron’s own experience, then, as well as his more general philosophical stance that any certainty and knowledge beyond
          the most basic are subjective, his skepticism about the incest prohibition seems more understandable. In response to Adah's astonishment
          that incest might be deemed a sin, <title level="m">Cain</title>'s Lucifer responds that it "cannot be a sin in you—whate'er / It may seem
          in those who may replace ye in / Mortality" (I.ii.375-7), yet later on he declares to Cain, "Evil and Good are things in their own essence"
          (II.ii.657). If both of these are true—and <title level="m">Cain </title>endorses both, and it appears to offer Byron's own opinions—then it
          stands to reason that the incest prohibition is not good "in its own essence," but rather is a taboo imposed for certain reasons. Thus, for
          Byron, it is open to question. Byron's relationship with Leigh, like Manfred's with Astarte, is a sexual connection between people of equal
          age, non-coercive, and apparently without issue.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Although Byron wrote to Lady Melbourne that Augusta "was
            not to blame...she was not aware of her own peril—till it was too late," in the same letter he refers to her "subsequent
              '<emph>abandon</emph>', and in an 1819 letter to Augusta makes it plain that he ceased their sexual connection when she requested it:
            "we may have been very wrong—but I repent of nothing except that cursed marriage—&amp; your refusing to continue to love me as you have
            loved me" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:110; <title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:129). As for children, at one point Byron was concerned
            that Augusta was pregnant by him and might give birth to a damaged baby, but that concern vanished with the birth; "it [the baby] is not
            an ape," he wrote to Lady Melbourne (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:104). In fact, the Byrons had already practised a more acceptable
            form of interbreeding that nonetheless led to less obvious damage: their habit of marrying their cousins ensured replication of a mania
            and manic depression that haunted the family.</note> In and of itself, free from social constructs and impositions, it would cause no
          wider damage. Adah's lines to Lucifer, pre-dating socialization, support this: what can be wrong with a love that springs from and only
          produces more love?</p>
        <p>Such reasoning is understandably difficult for audiences, since Byron's vision assumes a sexual world free of coercion and of what one might argue is an instinctive repulsion. Yet Byron's deduction is based on a standard empirical model. Like any good Enlightenment scientist, he has done the experiment then drawn the conclusion based on concrete experience (his own), rather than on the abstraction and assumption that is conventional morality.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this way, Byron continues the alliance with David Hume that is a
            hallmark of his advancing career, for Hume argued that morality was originally a social construct rooted in the practical advantages it
            brought to those who practiced it. Here one might also consider Claude Levi-Strauss's theory of incest and exogamy in <title level="m">The
              Elementary Structures of Kinship</title> (Beacon, 1969). On the other hand, in his <title level="m">Treatise</title> Hume warns against
          the kind of inductive reasoning Byron uses.</note> The flaw in his conclusion, however, is that he reasons inductively, from particulars (himself) to generalities (the majority of people), assuming that his general readership feels, or could feel, as he does. On the other hand, <title level="m">Cain</title> shows that part of what underlies Byron's view on incest is a belief that the generality labor under morals that have been impressed on them. This, too, has validity: both the Romantics and
          contemporary scholars wrestle with the question of the degree to which morals are innate and the degree to which they are imposed. Byron's
          thinking here, then, engages with that of his contemporaries, and with our own questioning.</p>
        <p>It takes a deeply unusual man to put empiricism before morality—most people do the reverse. But Byron was, and remains, deeply unusual.
          Moreover, the gift of his uniqueness is that it offers scholars many layers of thought to unfold. Nowhere does this complexity seem more
          true than in the case of his thinking about incest. The topic features even more frequently in Byron's writing than it does in Romantic
          texts generally,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Alan Richardson has shown that incest featured heavily in Romantic writing. See
            Richardson, <title level="a">Rethinking Romantic Incest: Human Universals, Literary Representation, and the Biology of Mind, </title>
            <title level="j">New Literary History</title>, vol. 31 (Summer, 2000), pp. 553-572.</note> and, in virtually every work in which it
          appears, it is portrayed positively, or at least not negatively: <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>, <title level="m"
            >Parisina</title>, <title level="m">Epistle to Augusta</title>, <title level="m">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</title> III, <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>, <title level="m">Cain</title>. Both this repetition and this portrayal suggest that for Byron incest is the expression
          of something central to his understanding of how the world should be. It is up to us to discover what that something is. Some twenty years
          ago, D. L. MacDonald suggested that examination of Byron's incest and its use in his works might yield fruitful results (37). That fruit
          remains ripe for the plucking.</p>
