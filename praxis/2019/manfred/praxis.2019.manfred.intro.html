            <p class="noCount">In commemoration of the 200th anniversary of <em>Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</em> (1817) and based on original talks given at an international symposium at New York
               University on April 21, 2017, this special <em>Romantic Circles</em> Praxis volume offers not only a collection of essays that reassesses Lord Byron’s
               drama from an array of angles but also recent artistic adaptations of the script and
               an audio recording of a reenacted musical scene from the 1834 London production of
               <em>Manfred</em>. Among the subjects addressed in these essays are the play’s dramaturgical and staging
               potential, the curious history of its publication, circulation, and reception, and
               the authorial intent of a work based on Byron’s scandalous life. The readings also
               revisit the complexities behind <em>Manfred</em>’s hybrid genre, while expanding the range of cultural influences and source materials
               that have previously been associated with the play. With <em>Manfred</em> Byron created a work that fused his own celebrity myth with elements from various
               cultures, faiths, myths, epochs, genres, and traditions. Byron fired the public imagination
               with a drama that, in pushing well beyond its rootedness in a Swiss landscape and
               in his own biography, transcends the limits of the personal and the local as an eccentric
               and eclectic work of global horizons.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Commemorating <em>Manfred</em>’s Bicentenary: An Introduction</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>This volume of essays commemorates the 200<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of one of the most popular and influential literary works of the nineteenth
               century, Lord Byron’s <em>Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</em> (1817). In June 1817, when John Murray published the drama, it was no surprise that
               all 6,000 copies sold out rather quickly. A work about a tormented nobleman from the
               Swiss Alps, <em>Manfred</em> captured the European imagination upon its publication for two major reasons. First,
               it dramatized one of the greatest scandals of the day: the allegations that Byron
               had committed incest with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, which forced him into exile
               from Britain the previous year. Second, in addition to addressing these rumors, the
               drama catered to the European-wide craze created by the wild popularity of his works
               and his consequent celebrity. With its publication, <em>Manfred</em> delivered a new iteration of Byron’s best-selling product, the Byronic hero, a figure
               that he produced through the exploitation of his own public image. On one level, <em>Manfred</em> fused the autobiographical elements of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> with the Orientalist flair of the heroes from his popular Turkish Tales, including
               the Giaour (<em>The Giaour</em>), Conrad (<em>The Corsair</em>), Alp (<em>The Siege of Corinth</em>), Selim (<em>The Bride of Abydos</em>), and Lara (<em>Lara</em>). On another level, it transformed the Byronic hero into a philosophical thinker
               who possessed uncanny power and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Begun in Switzerland in 1816, <em>Manfred</em> shares its genesis with another great literary achievement of the early nineteenth
               century, Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>. Each work is an adaptation of the Faustian legend: both Victor Frankenstein and
               Manfred seek out forbidden sources of knowledge and are haunted by their ill deeds.
               Enduring a series of afflictions, including exile and the ruin of their loved ones,
               both end up seeking to forget their past and even contemplate suicide. <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>—along with John Polidori’s <em>The Vampyre</em>—were conceived during the summer of 1816 in Geneva when Byron, the Shelleys, and
               Polidori exchanged ghost stories in a contest at Byron’s rented Swiss home, Villa
               Diodati. Byron’s contribution of a “fragment” on that legendary evening seemingly
               inspired him shortly thereafter to compose <em>Manfred</em> as his first dramatic composition, which was written—like <em>Frankenstein</em>—in a gothic key.</p>
            <p><em>Manfred</em> bears a number of literary influences, including Aeschylus’s <em>Prometheus Bound</em>, William Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em>, John Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>, Edward Young’s <em>The Revenge</em>, Johann von Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, William Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em>, and Percy Shelley’s <em>Alastor</em>. Shortly following <em>Manfred</em>’s publication, the play was translated into several languages throughout Europe,
               including German, Russian, Polish, and French. Friedrich Nietzsche felt a personal
               connection to Byron’s title character, who partially inspired his concept of the<em>Übermensch</em> in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> (1883-91). The drama inspired many other notable works, as well, including Alexander
               Pushkin’s <em>Eugene Onegin</em>, Alexandre Dumas’s <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, Ivan Turgenev’s <em>Fathers and Sons</em>, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s <em>Notes from Underground</em>, Thomas Pynchon’s <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>, and Susanna Clarke’s <em>Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell</em>. <em>Manfred </em>is also a source for later Byronic heroes, including Heathcliff from <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Rochester from <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Captain Ahab from <em>Moby Dick</em>, Pechorin from <em>A Hero of our Time</em>, Michael Corleone from <em>The Godfather</em>, Eric Draven from <em>The Crow</em>, and Bruce Wayne from <em>Batman</em>.</p>
            <p>Like many Romantic dramas, <em>Manfred</em> has rarely been performed as a full theatrical production on stage. Byron himself
               cautioned that his dramatic poem was not intended for the stage but rather belonged
               to a category of metaphysical drama that he called “mental theatre.” Nevertheless,
               an adaptation of the play directed by Alfred Bunn and set to music by Henry Rowley
               Bishop took place at Covent Garden in 1834. In 1848, Robert Schumann adapted <em>Manfred</em> for musical performance, and it opened to much success at the <span class="foreign">Gewandhaus</span> in Leipzig in 1852. Inspired by the 1834 Covent Garden production, Drury Lane theater
               presented another stage version of <em>Manfred</em> in October 1863. In 1885, the Russian composer, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, turned
               the play into the <em>Manfred Symphony</em>. More recently, the BBC produced the play as a radio drama in 1988. The broadcasting
               network revived <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087qh9w">the dramatic reading</a> in January 2017 in honor of the <em>Manfred</em> bicentenary. </p>
            <p>The authors in this volume, whose essays are based on original talks given at an <a class="link_ref" href="http://romantics200.org/event/byrons-manfred-dramatic-reading-symposium/">international bicentenary symposium</a> dedicated to <em>Manfred</em> at New York University on April 21, 2017, re-examine Byron’s drama from an array
               of angles. They interrogate issues related to its publication, circulation, and reception
               history, while also exploring matters of authorial intent. For instance, although
               biographical readings of <em>Manfred</em> have pointed to the protagonist’s and Byron’s sense of remorse for “destroying” his
               sister, Astarte, <a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.bernhard-jackson.html">Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s provocative essay</a>, “Love in the First Degree:<em>Manfred</em>, Byron, and Incest,” suggests that the play offers evidence rather of Manfred’s and
               Byron’s lack of guilt. Several of the authors also propose that, in contrast to critics
               who, like Byron himself, maintained that the drama is unstageable, <em>Manfred</em> offers the dramaturgical potential to succeed on the stage as a performance in its
               own right. The play emerged at a defining moment in the history of theater and, despite
               its limited performance history, is rooted in the tradition of melodrama and revenge
               tragedy. Moreover, the present essays underscore the idea that <em>Manfred</em>’s generic hybridity blurs several boundaries, styles, and tones. <em>Manfred</em> is not only a tragedy but also a work of comedy that anticipates the humor and satire
               that Byron would eventually develop in <em>Beppo</em> and <em>Don Juan</em>. The readings even expand the range of cultural influences and source materials that
               have previously been connected with the play. With <em>Manfred</em> Byron created a work that fused his own celebrity myth with elements from various
               faiths, myths, and traditions across cultures and times. Byron fired the public imagination
               with a drama that, while based on his own personal scandal, moved well beyond its
               rootedness in a Swiss landscape and in his own biography. The drama transcends the
               limits of the personal and the local as an eccentric and eclectic work of global horizons.</p>
            <p>The first section of the volume, “Foundations, Influences, Intertexts,” proceeds chronologically,
               beginning with some of <em>Manfred</em>’s oldest cultural and religious sources. In “Alpine Orientalism in <em>Manfred</em>,” Alan Richardson discusses <em>Manfred</em>’s status as a culturally heterogeneous work whose “brazen commingling of Alpine setting
               and Orientalist lexicon” is saturated in signs and symbols associated with Zoroastrianism.
               According to Richardson, <em>Manfred</em> provides an unusual “mixture of local and exotic,” fusing elements of Christian tradition,
               Greek myth, and even European witchcraft with various “Oriental” religions. Richardson
               connects the drama’s incest plot to Montesquieu’s <em>Persian Letters</em> (1721) and finds key links to William Beckford’s <em>Vathek</em> (1784)—both of which contain Zoroastrian elements themselves. He proposes that Byron’s
               hero, short of being a Magian himself, is at the least highly knowledgeable of the
               tradition given his curious speeches and practices. Richardson concludes by suggesting
               that, as “Byron gave a pronounced Orientalist edge to an Alpine Gothic play that programmatically
               refuses to declare its allegiances, religious, mythological, geographical, literary,
               or generic,” <em>Manfred</em> is an “iconoclastic” work that still speaks meaningfully to our contemporary moment.</p>
            <p>In “Freemasonry and Mental Theatre in <em>Manfred</em>,” Jonathan Gross highlights the conglomeration of faiths and traditions evident in <em>Manfred</em>. He extends Richardson's argument about Byron's debt to Montesquieu's <em>Lettres Persanes</em> by tracing the similarity to Byron and Montesquieu's shared Masonic beliefs, pointing
               out crucial images of "Magisme" in Byron's play (the casket and key in Act III) that
               have not been previously discussed. He argues that the play draws on Byron’s own knowledge
               of Masonic societies, to which Byron’s father—“Mad Jack” Byron—also belonged. Gross
               concludes his essay by seeing <em>Manfred</em>’s heterogeneous elements as a lesson in cultural tolerance and comparative religion
               rather than an instance of eco-criticism or twentieth-century existentialism.</p>
            <p>In “Redeemed from the Worm: <em>Manfred</em>’s Celebrity Revenge Tragedy,” Clara Tuite expands on <em>Manfred</em>’s conglomeration of styles, registers, and tones, as well as the complicated genealogy
               of the Byronic hero, which she proposes stems back to Hamlet. Tuite argues that <em>Manfred</em> is Byron’s take on the revenge tragedy and that the eponymous hero has his origins
               in Zanga, the avenger from Edward Young’s <em>The Revenge: A Tragedy</em> (1721), whom Byron played in a performance in his youth while a student at Harrow
               School. Tuite suggests that these roots are connected with Byron’s own scandals and
               what she calls the “fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power, and intimate
               publicity: celebrity.” She contends that the text, which serves as an allegory of
               Byron’s life, offers evidence of two kinds of “unfinished business.” The first is
               the emotional unfinished business pertaining to the scandals that prompted his exile
               from Britain. The second is <em>Manfred</em> as an embodiment of unfinished textual business: as a synthesis of many drafts and
               reworkings of text, intertext, and paratext—including the revised third act at the
               demand of Gifford and Murray—in the months that Byron wrote it over the winter of
               1816-17.</p>
            <p>Peter Manning then tracks a “<span class="foreign">hypochondrisch</span>” textual history of “self-involved protagonists” by uncovering an unexpected connection
               between Goethe and Byron outside of the obvious Faustian link. In “‘My pang shall
               find a voice’: <em>Manfred</em> and <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em>,” Manning fittingly turns to the work that made Goethe famous to uncover not only
               the commonalities between Werther and Manfred as heroes but also biographical links
               between Goethe and Byron themselves. Through his archival work on the editorial manuscripts
               of the posthumously published 17-volume collected edition of Byron's works (1832-33),
               housed at the National Library of Scotland, Manning’s research probes the curious
               editorial practices of John Wright, Byron’s editor. He reveals a genealogy that ties
               <em>Werther</em> to the rejected third act of <em>Manfred</em>, Byron’s five-act tragedy, <em>Marino Faliero</em> (1821), and even the “sensational stage display” of Alfred Bunn’s Covent Garden performance
               of the drama in 1834. Manning’s discoveries show how Wright, in bringing the many
               exchanges and dedications between Goethe and Byron to light through his editing, emphasized
               the “hypochondriac” and melodramatic proclivities of the authors and, by extension,
               their characters. Manning demonstrates how the textual history that marks Goethe’s
               effort to “cast critical distance on his self-absorbed protagonist” is echoed by Byron’s
               similar impulses in his composition of <em>Manfred</em> and beyond.</p>
            <p>The section ends with Alice Levine’s “<em>Manfred</em>: Byron’s Other <em>Don Juan</em>,” in which she challenges the conventional notion that <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em> represent antithetical aspects of Byron’s writings. By examining Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em> and other iterations of the legendary Hispanic libertine, Don Juan, Levine argues
               that <em>Manfred</em>—contrary to the critical consensus—served as a foundational text for Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em>. For her, both works involve a form of “heterosexual transgression”; each culminates
               not only in the disappearance of female characters but also with the protagonists’
               self-assertions among a community of “powerful male authority figures.” In finding
               commonality between these seemingly disparate works, Levine proposes that <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em> are “two variations on the same plot and the same central character.”</p>
            <p>The second section, “Text, Circulation, Image,” opens with Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s
               essay, “Love in the First Degree: <em>Manfred</em>, Byron, and Incest,” in which she reads <em>Manfred</em> alongside Byron’s letters and <em>Don Juan</em>. In doing so, Bernhard-Jackson considers Byron’s skepticism on the subject of incest.
               She makes the provocative case that <em>Manfred</em>, rather than being a work about Manfred’s guilt, is about his lack of guilt. As Bernhard-Jackson
               sees it, though <em>Manfred</em> provided Byron with a “confessional medium,” the subjects of incest and torment must
               be disentangled from one another. While Manfred (and Byron) feels deeply for his (half)-sister,
               his commitment to both rationalism and liberation keeps him from feeling remorse.
               Highlighting the “ambivalent registers of [Byron’s] apologetic gestures,” Bernhard-Jackson
               contends that incest was a way for Byron to challenge inhibiting social structures.</p>
            <p>In “Dark Prometheus: <em>Manfred</em> and the Last Infirmity of Evil,” Andrew Stauffer closely examines an enigmatic seven-line
               passage in the first act to argue that Manfred’s character is the anti-heroic version
               of the protagonist that Percy Shelley later created in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: a “dark twin” who embodies “existential Romantic heroism.” Tracing this idea back
               to John Milton’s “Lycidas,” Stauffer concentrates on a particular phrase, “the last
               infirmity of evil,” asking whether it suggests Manfred’s superlative embrace of evil
               or, rather, his desire to purge the traces of evil in himself. He ultimately settles
               on a third reading, proposing instead that Manfred, in reaching the “summit of evil”
               and standing on “the dizzy brink of complete amorality,” moves beyond the limits of
               “self-justification.” Stauffer’s Manfred is one who, immediately prior to his own
               death, transcends his own limits by reaching a sense of calm and equanimity.</p>
            <p>Jane Stabler offers another close reading of <em>Manfred</em> by analyzing the text’s inclusion of Byron’s signature punctuation—the dash. In “The
               Dashes in <em>Manfred</em>,” she interrogates Byron’s persistent use of the dash in his manuscripts as well
               as how his editors translated them into print. Distinguishing between the em dash
               and the long dash in <em>Manfred</em>, she argues that Byron’s usage creates the effect of a complex “musical score” that,
               in transgressing rules of grammar, shapes the way readers “hear” the work’s extensive
               range of voices and silences. For Stabler, the Byronic dash can be “a sigh, an intake
               of breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent.” In <em>Manfred</em>, the affect suggested by the dashing ranges from ludic interruption to wonder to
               gothic agony. To complement her analysis, Stabler supplies her readers with several
               images of Byron’s manuscripts and early printed editions from the National Library
               of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The section closes with Ghislaine McDayter’s investigation of the reception history
               of <em>Manfred</em>, focusing on the way artists and illustrators rendered the play in the nineteenth
               century. In “The Iconography of Forgiveness: <em>Manfred</em>’s Astarte,” McDayter analyzes a series of illustrated editions of both <em>The Giaour</em> and <em>Manfred</em> in order to highlight a trend in the play’s reception. Examining portrayals of each
               work’s hero and their love interests, Leila and Astarte in particular, she demonstrates
               how these interpretations are more concerned with Byron and his scandals than with
               the works themselves. McDayter proposes that a study of the depictions of these heroines
               offers “a window into the public view of the poet himself.” McDayter accompanies her
               analysis with reproductions of the various illustrations that she explores.</p>
            <p>The third section, “Voice, Performance, Adaptation,” begins with Diego Saglia’s look
               at the function and problem of voice in <em>Manfred</em>. In “Voice in <em>Manfred</em>: Sign, Symbol, and Performance,” Saglia demonstrates how voice in the play is simultaneously
               a “vehicle for authorial power” and a representation of an “unstable force.” Saglia
               argues that voice in <em>Manfred</em> serves an “oscillatory function.” It operates on the threshold between several domains,
               including that between transcendence and materiality, page and stage, drama and melodrama,
               theater and metatheater, absence and presence, the real and imaginary, the embodied
               and disembodied, and the visible and invisible. At the same time, Saglia highlights
               the relevance of unstable voices on the Romantic-era stage, suggesting that Byron
               wrote <em>Manfred</em> with “questions of theatrical performance” in mind. In producing these “transdimensional
               interconnections,” voice in <em>Manfred</em> becomes one of the major elements behind the play’s textual and performative distinctiveness.
               The play is “one of the major Romantic texts on the power and meaning of uttering
               words.”</p>
            <p>Saglia’s analysis of the liminality of voice sets the stage, as it were, for my own
               essay, “Between Page and Stage: The Happy Medium for Romantic Drama,” in which I consider
               the performative possibilities of <em>Manfred</em>, a “dramatic poem” that generally emphasizes high poetic language above dramatic
               action. Despite a long history of skepticism about its performability, dating back
               to Byron’s own comments about his reluctance to it being staged, I argue that <em>Manfred</em> does indeed belong on the stage as a performance. By basing my findings on the recent
               New York City performances of <em>Sardanapalus</em> (2012), <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (2013), and <em>Manfred</em> (2017), I argue that these kinds of hybrid Romantic works, which have typically been
               considered closet dramas, can benefit from a special kind of performance and performer:
               a staged reading produced by a professional director and actors. I propose that the
               staged reading offers what I call a “happy medium,” a form of compromise between the
               page and the stage that produces a pragmatic and rewarding method for encountering
               these works as performances. I contend that such an experience offers an alternate
               interpretive space for the text, a performative mode that responds directly to the
               challenges of closet drama, and a mutually beneficial opportunity between literary
               critics and theater professionals.</p>
            <p>In the spirit of the theatrical possibilities of <em>Manfred</em>, Jeffrey Cox’s and Michael Gamer’s “<em>Manfred</em> and Melodrama” follows my own with an unexpected adaptation of the conventional article
               format. Emulating their presentation of it at the April 2017 symposium, they offer
               a dialogue that not only places <em>Manfred</em> in conversation with the tradition of melodrama but also attempts to understand “Romantic
               cultural consumption and appropriation” more broadly. In their reading, Byron reverses
               the usual order of things by consuming that most consuming of nineteenth-century genres,
               melodrama. <em>Manfred</em>’s heterogeneous style and “melodramatic roots,” they show, are most evident in the
               rejected third act, which is (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.manning.html">as Manning points out</a>) what Alfred Bunn drew on for his Covent Garden staging of <em>Manfred</em> in 1834. </p>
            <p>Frederick Burwick closes the section with “Staging <em>Manfred</em>” by focusing on Bunn’s production of <em>Manfred</em> at Covent Garden with Henry Denvil performing in the titular role, music by Henry
               Rowley Bishop, and scenery by Thomas and William Grieve. In examining reviews and
               first-hand accounts of the staging, Burwick argues that all the stage elements, including
               the scenery, the music, and the acting, created a spectacular effect that invoked
               Byron’s own biography. Burwick proposes that Bunn “succeeded in adapting <em>Manfred</em> as a spectacular musical production,” yet maintains that Bishop’s libretto “deprived
               the audience of much of Byron’s dramatic poem.” Burwick enriches his study with fascinating
               materials, including a copy and an original performance of Bishop’s musical score,
               “The Witches Carnival,” which Bishop inserted into the finale of the Witch of Alps
               scene (Act II, scene two). These materials, along with two stage adaptations of <em>Manfred</em>, can be found in this volume’s Table of Contents (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/manfred">Section V. Supplementary Materials</a>)</p>
            <p>This volume culminates with an adapted version of Jerome McGann’s keynote address,
               “<em>Manfred</em>, a Play of Language; or, Intimations of Mortality from Recollections of Erring Manhood,”
               in which he symbolically returns to the material with which he launched his distinguished
               career several decades ago with <em>Fiery Dust</em> (1969). McGann revisits not only the subject of his groundbreaking scholarship but
               also his interest in the performance of Romantic drama, as he was one of the founding
               members of Cain’s Company in Chicago in the late 1960s, a theater group that dedicated
               itself to staging neglected dramas, including Byron’s <em>Cain</em>. In his essay, McGann offers a close reading of the text and its patterns of versification
               that neither insists on a single approach nor authoritative interpretation. Instead,
               he begins by assuming a position of negative capability, in the process underscoring
               how <em>Manfred</em> is a “very strange work” that is replete with enigma and ambiguity. Through his explorations
               of the text, McGann echoes the volume’s other contributors, pointing out the intricacies
               of the various influences that make up <em>Manfred</em>. His interrogation of several passages leads him to an important conclusion. Being
               of “rich and cryptic linguistic particulars,” <em>Manfred</em> is indeed a “play”: a play of words, of “language in which secrets lie about everywhere,
               awaiting—seeking—discovery.” <em>Manfred</em> recasts the Faustian legend as <em>comedy</em> in part through a style that intimates the tongue-in-cheek mode that Byron realized
               most maturely with <em>Beppo</em> and <em>Don Juan</em>.</p>
            <p>McGann has played an invaluable role in helping to make the present volume possible.
               Back in December 2015, when Stuart Curran announced that the Keats-Shelley Association
               of America and the Byron Society of America were accepting proposals to sponsor events
               in commemoration of the Romantic Bicentennials, I imagined that a work of the reach
               and scope of <em>Manfred</em> needed a celebration that was attentive to its ambition and originality. I therefore
               proposed an event that would fuse both scholarship and performance—one that would
               bring Byron scholars from around the globe together with New York City's singularly
               brilliant theatrical community. McGann agreed to partner with me to realize a modern
               production of <em>Manfred</em> on stage. The <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.redbulltheater.com/manfred">dramatic reading</a>, which was produced by Red Bull Theater, took place on Thursday, April 20, 2017 at
               the Loreto Theater of the Sheen Center on Bleecker Street (a review of it can be found
               online <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/reviews-blog/lord-byron%E2%80%99s-manfred-stage-new-york-city-rare-and-rewarding-experience-reviewed-lee">at <em>Romantic Circles</em></a>). Both McGann and I assumed roles as resident dramaturges, offering the actors and
               the rest of the production team important background and context of the play during
               rehearsals. The curtain rose with a nearly sold-out crowd in a theater with a 220-seat
               capacity. McGann also delivered the keynote address, <a class="link_ref" href="https://k-saa.org/manfred-event-follow-up-jerome-mcganns-keynote-lecture-at-manfred-symposium-april-21/">“Manfred: The Long Disease of my Life,”</a> at the bicentenary symposium that took place the following day, which convened the
               present scholars from the U.S., Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia. In
               honor of the celebratory occasion, moreover, Broadview Press agreed to publish a <a class="link_ref" href="https://broadviewpress.com/product/manfred/">special bicentenary edition of <em>Manfred</em></a> and offer complimentary copies of it to all our presenters.</p>
            <p>I would like to thank Jerry McGann—first and foremost—for joining me on this journey.
               I am also indebted to this volume’s many authors for partaking of the two-day event
               in New York City back in April 2017 as well as for developing these new and fascinating
               readings of <em>Manfred</em>. I am grateful to the NYU Department of English, the University of Virginia Department
               of English, the Byron Society of America, the Keats-Shelley Association of America,
               and Broadview Press for their generous support. Thank you to the <em>Romantic Circles</em> team, including Neil Fraistat, Paul Youngquist, Orrin Wang, David Rettenmaier, and
               Jeffrey Moro, for their assistance with producing this Praxis edition of many essays
               and supplementary materials—a hybrid volume that seems appropriate to me for an edition
               dedicated to <em>Manfred</em>. Finally, I would like to recognize my research assistant, Hailey Pope, whose dedication,
               precision, and talent have helped to elevate this volume to its current state.</p>
            <p>As this volume marks the bicentenary of <em>Manfred</em>’s publication, it indirectly commemorates the 200-year milestone of its critical
               reception. The present essays have, on one hand, drawn significantly on the criticism
               from the foregoing two centuries in order to develop their own interesting and surprising
               claims. On the other hand, these critics have carved out new and refreshing possibilities
               for Byron’s first drama and, in so doing, have pointed auspiciously toward the future
               of Byron studies. In preparing the way for new readings of the play, they have also
               highlighted the fundamental place of <em>Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</em> within Byron’s oeuvre.</p>
