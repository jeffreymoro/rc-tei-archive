            <p class="noCount">This essay suggests that Byron’s <em>Manfred</em> contains not an expression of Byron’s guilt about his incest with his half-sister
               Augusta Leigh, as previous critics have suggested, but rather considerable evidence
               of his lack of guilt. It argues that the play displays incest and torment, but in
               fact does not link the two, instead displaying Manfred’s love for Astarte as deeply
               felt without regrets. The essay then argues that one finds the same combination of
               deep love and lack of regret in Byron’s remarks about his relationship with his half-sister,
               as well as in the representations of incest in his other works. It suggests that this
               acceptance of incest links to Byron’s commitment to rational thinking and personal
               freedom, and it invites future criticism to explore this connection in more detail.</p>

               <p><em>Manfred</em> has incest and guilt at its core. Manfred has committed incest, and he is obsessively
                  guilty. Two hundred years' worth of critics and scholars have considered the significance
                  and inter-relationship of these two, and most agree that Manfred expresses guilt for
                  having committed incest with his sister, Astarte. Moreover, many acknowledge that
                  Manfred's incest is a mirror of Byron’s incestuous relationship with <em>his</em> sister, Augusta Leigh, and suggest that Manfred's guilt is an expression of Byron’s
                  own.

                  </div> Without question, incest is a central concern in <em>Manfred</em>, and a central concern to the Byron who wrote <em>Manfred</em>. I would argue, however, that <em>Manfred </em> the text and Manfred the character show not Byron's guilt over his incest with Augusta
                  Leigh, but rather his lack of guilt. Furthermore, this is a lack that Byron continues
                  to display in various ways in his later work, and one for which he has larger intellectual
                  reasons.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Byron plants the seeds of Manfred's lack of guilt in the character's opening monologue.
               Here Manfred proclaims: "Good or evil, life, / Powers, passions, all I see in other
               beings, / Have been to me as rain unto the sands, / Since that all-nameless hour"
               (I.i.21-4). This is a time-honored dramatic maneuver, a proleptic announcement that
               keeps the audience in suspense until a text reveals all at a later time. In <em>Manfred</em>, however, that time never comes. In the course of the play, "that hour" remains literally
               "all-nameless": no one ever explains when or what it was. The closest anyone comes
               is in the exchange between Manfred and the Witch of the Alps in the second scene of
               the second act:</p>

            <p> Once unpicked, this deeply unclear clarification reveals the source of Manfred's
               guilt to be not incest but Astarte's death and his role in causing it. A rough paraphrase
               of these lines would be,</p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Although the play does not make explicit a connection between "that all-nameless
               hour" and "that hour" (and note that in the second case, too, "that" is a floating
               referent, referring back to nothing), in this passage "that hour" appears to link
               back to the moment when Astarte's "blood was shed— / I saw—and could not staunch it,"
               not to the moment when Manfred and Astarte had sexual relations.</p>
            <p>The text goes on to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Manfred has committed
               incest, and it persistently establishes that he is tormented, but it never actually
               connects the two. In fact, the construction of Manfred's revelation to the Witch figures
               his motive for incest not as lust or as a desire to do evil, but as love: "I loved
               her, and destroy'd her!" His soliloquy after she departs reiterates this:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">If I had never lived, that which I love</div>
                  <div class="l">Had still been living; had I never loved,</div>
                  <div class="l">That which I loved would still be beautiful—</div>
                  <div class="l">Happy and giving happiness. (II.ii.193-6)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Even when he confronts the Phantom of Astarte, he seeks not expiation for incest
               but reassurance that she does not hate him and is not suffering: "Say that thou loath'st
               me not—that I do bear / This punishment for both" (II.iv.125-6). Manfred makes no
               reference to a sense of guilt here, only to an imposed punishment and an overwhelming
               love.</p>
            <p>But <em>Manfred</em> does not limit itself to repeated evidence that Manfred does not regret his sexual
               relationship with Astarte. It also emphasizes Byron's lack of compunction about <em>his</em> incest. It achieves this in part by Manfred's declarations of love for Astarte, in
               part by the strength of his lack of regret, and in part by the play's obsessive avoidance
               of naming the act of incest. If this last sounds counterintuitive, that is because
               it is. It needs to be. As D.L. MacDonald has pointed out, Byron could scarcely announce
               his love affair with his sister to the public, but <em>Manfred</em> nonetheless refers to it "obsessively, but by aposiopesis," as well as by persistent
               lacunae and allusions that draw attention to the act rather than disguising it (37).
               Manfred tells the Chamois Hunter that they loved each other as they "should not love"
               (II.i.27); he later informs the Witch that his beloved "was like me in lineaments"
               (II.ii.105); the servant Manuel is significantly interrupted just at the right moment
               in his description of Astarte,</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">her, whom of all earthly things</div>
                  <div class="l">That lived, the only thing he [Manfred] seemed to love,—</div>
                  <div class="l">As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,</div>
                  <div class="l">The lady Astarte, his—</div>
                  <div class="indent2">Hush, who comes here? (III.iii.44-7)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Just in case there should be any doubt, Manfred reminds the Phantom of Astarte that
               "it were / The deadliest sin to love as we have loved" (II.iv.123-4): not many kinds
               of love fit that bill. In fact, the play's very existence is a demonstration of Byron's
               absence of remorse. According to a statement drawn up by Lady Byron in 1816, rumors
               of Byron's sexual connection to Leigh had "become current in the World" before his
               departure from England (qtd. in Marchand 589), and when a man suspected of incest
               publishes a verse drama about a man who seems to have committed incest, pangs of conscience
               do not appear to have played a role in either the incest or the publication.</p>
            <p>Reviewers certainly understood precisely what was not being named. Francis Jeffrey
               deplored the "painful and offensive nature of the circumstance" on which the play's
               "distress was ultimately founded" (140). In the <em>British Review</em>, William Roberts wrote that Manfred's love "appears to have been of the sort that
               lies under a natural interdict" (86), while the <em>Day and New Times</em> put it more plainly, explaining that Manfred "committed incest!" In fact, the <em>Day and New Times</em>, at least, knew what had occurred outside the text as well as in: its announcement
               of Manfred's incest was followed by the assertion, "Lord Byron has coloured Manfred
               into his own personal features" (130).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is not unreasonable to suggest that an author who wants to keep a secret should
                  be more secretive, nor to suggest that an author who is not terribly secretive might
                  not want to keep his secret. Byron was fully aware of the public horror and censure
                  that would attend upon any clear revelation that his hero and his hero's sister, or
                  he and his own half-sister, had committed incest. It is significant that Manfred takes
                  care to clarify that he alone is responsible for what transpired with Astarte: "What
                  is she now?—a sufferer for my sins" (II.ii.96-7). In an 1814 letter Byron exhorted
                  Lady Melbourne, his confidant in the matter, not to reproach Leigh for having sex
                  with him: "it was not her fault—but my own <em>folly</em>" (<em>BLJ</em> IV:27, Byron’s emphasis).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For more on contemporaneous responses to and beliefs about incest, see James Twitchell,
                           Forbidden Partners: The Incest Taboo in Modern Culture (Columbia UP, 1989).</span></div>
                  </div> But his awareness of risk did not stop him from publishing a work that he knew would
                  be widely read as confessional, featuring as its main character a version of himself
                  who demonstrated no regret for what he had done. All this suggests that, while he
                  may have been concerned about public reaction, he, like Manfred, did not regret the
                  act itself.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In fact, Byron's justification for his actions also mirrors Manfred's, except that
               while Manfred cries his love, Byron confided it. He wrote to Lady Melbourne that Leigh
               was "twined round my heart in every possible manner—dearest &amp; deepest in my hope &amp;
               my memory" (<em>BLJ</em> IV:69). Still, for both creator and created, this love is rendered legitimate by
               reason of its uniqueness and the great gap it fills. "I have wandered o'er the earth,
               / And never found thy likeness" (II.iv.144-5) Manfred tells Astarte, while Byron wrote
               to Leigh, "we—at least—I—am by a crowd of circumstances removed from the only being
               who could ever have loved me, or whom I can unmixedly feel attached to" (<em>BLJ</em> V:95).</p>
            <p>In light of this quotation, it seems significant that Byron was as reluctant as his
               hero to stop referring to his forbidden relationship. Even before <em>Manfred</em>, he inserted a reference in <em>Childe Harold</em> III, where the waters of Lake Leman "sound sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved"
               (95). More interesting, however, is a very carefully encoded reference in <em>Don Juan</em> two years later, in the passage in which Donna Julia is excusing her way toward adultery:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">She now determined that a virtuous woman</div>

                  <div class="l">Should ever give her heart the least sensation;</div>

                  <div class="l">But then they only seem so many brothers. (I.77)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> As Byron points out, <em>Don Juan</em> contains "much which could not be appreciated / In any manner by the uninitiated,”
               and in this stanza the reference to his personal experience may go unnoticed by those
               not on the look-out (XIV.22). But for those aware of the facts of Byron's personal
               life, it is difficult to read the seemingly innocuous last line of this passage without
               finding it considerably less than innocuous. Byron, after all, knew how some women
               act toward their brothers. What's more, in a passage that pulls the rug out from under
               each of Julia's virtuous stratagems, revealing them as merely excuses to edge toward
               sin, such sly acknowledgement that the fraternal can turn—indeed, in one particularly
               relevant case has turned—into something more makes perfect sense. Julia, <em>Don Juan</em> is telling its initiated readers, is fooling herself about the asexuality of brothers.</p>
            <p>Jerome McGann has written that the job of <em>Juan</em>'s reader is not so much to "decipher the text" as to "describe and retrace" Byron's
               "acts of encipherment,” and Gary Dyer has built on this to suggest that one might
               fruitfully focus on both the encipherment and its context and meanings (207; 573).
               Indeed, what is most fascinating about this moment in which incest is enciphered is
               the meaning of its existence in its context: the fact that, given contemporaneous
               notions of morality, Byron chose to include it in a published work at all. Literature
               is not thick with joking references to incest, because incest is not something authors
               or audiences usually take lightly. But Byron does. Now, it is true that the Byron
               of <em>Don Juan</em> takes pretty much everything lightly. That aspect, however, was precisely what most
               repulsed reviewers: William Hazlitt complained of the poem that "Our enthusiasm for
               genius or virtue is . . . turned into a jest by the very person who has kindled it
               . . . It is not that Lord Byron is sometimes serious and sometimes trifling, sometimes
               profligate and sometimes moral; but when he is most serious and most moral, he is
               only preparing to mortify the unsuspecting reader by putting a pitiful hoax upon him"
               (162). Hazlitt and others objected to this facet of <em>Don Juan</em> because to joke about morals is to suggest their insignificance, to announce that
               they are foolish enough to be the subject of jokes. By inserting his sly joke—that
               a woman may feel a preference for men "who are pleasanter than others, / But then
               they only seem so many brothers"—Byron suggests that the idea that brothers are, naturally,
               sexually off-limits is laughable, that sibling incest (not least his own, which is
               the basis for the joke in the first place) is something harmless enough to be the
               root of a joke. The meaning of this moment, then, is Byron's own casual relationship
               with incest and its prohibition.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, this revelation is only accessible to the initiated: those readers who
               know Byron's past and make the connection. By the time he writes <em>Cain</em> in 1821, however, Byron has decided to declare his feelings more openly than he did
               in either <em>Juan</em> or <em>Manfred</em>. As Heather Stansbury has recently pointed out, this final Byronic portrayal of incest
               represents it not as something to be condemned, "but, rather, entirely natural" (25).
               Astounded by Lucifer's revelation that brother-sister love will one day be a sin "in
               your children" (I.ii.361), Cain's wife and sister, Adah, asks rhetorically,</p>

            <p> Incest here is not merely natural but logical.</p>
            <p>In addition, <em>Cain</em> portrays the incestuous love of a sister as the prop that outlasts all others. Exiled
               from the Garden of Eden, separated from his family and the life he has known, Cain
               goes forth hand in hand with Adah, who will join him both in sorrow and in peopling
               the world: "Now, Cain! I will divide thy burden with thee . . . Lead! thou shalt be
               my God, and may our God / Be thine! Now let us carry forth our children" (III.i.551-5).
               Stansbury writes that Byron "describes the product of incest," Adah and Cain's son
               Enoch, "as a means of strengthening the family bond," but Byron also shows sibling
               incest itself as a means of strengthening that bond (25). Cain's mother, Eve, calls
               down "the eternal Serpent's curse" on him for killing Abel (III.i.403); his father
               banishes him (III.i.444-5). Only the sister who is also his wife cleaves to him. Byron
               even goes so far as to transfer into Adah’s mouth the plea for mercy that Cain makes
               in the Bible. The Bible passage, "And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment <em>is</em> greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of
               the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
               in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <em>that</em> every one that findeth me shall slay me" (<em>King James Bible </em>, Gen. 4.13-14), becomes in Byron’s play:</p>

            <p> Allowing one character to ventriloquize another is perhaps the clearest endorsement
               of their relationship that an author can offer.</p>
            <p>The deeper question raised by all this discreet and indiscreet support for incest
               is “Why?” Why produce works that extol incest as love and that extol that love as
               the greatest support in life? Why hint at, make jokes about, and eventually openly
               approve sibling incest, when it would be much easier, safer, and more generous to
               the sister you say you love to keep quiet about having participated in that act?</p>
            <p>The answer is both simple and complex, grounded in both Byron's psyche and his ethic.
               First, Byron liked being seen to be bad. He wanted and expected <em>Manfred</em> to cause some sort of scandal. In a surely unique combination of (hopefully) unconscious
               appropriateness and irony, he wrote to Augusta Leigh in March of 1818 asking if the
               publication of the drama had caused "a pucker" (<em>CPW</em> IV:466) Hints of incest more than ensured that pucker.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Second, there is the effect of distance. Just as his time in Europe had made Byron
                  less aware of the habits and mores of English society, it may be that it had made
                  the society and people he knew there less real to him.

                  </div> In 1819 he wrote ruefully to Leigh, "Three years absence—&amp; the total change of scene
                  and habit make such a difference—that we have now nothing in common but our affections
                  &amp; our relationship" (<em>BLJ </em> VI:129). The loss of immediacy brought by distance would explain why he was not held
                  back by the potential harm his revelations might cause to Leigh.

            <p>Finally, he may simply never have considered what harm he might do, or he simply might
               not have cared. Daniel McVeigh argues that Byron's "hints about their incest would
               have been unconscionable had he perceived a real threat against" Leigh (611). But
               Byron <em>did</em> perceive a threat, as evidenced by his remarks to Lady Melbourne, about "my . . .
               folly" and, later, of his "misery . . . on <em>her</em> account" (<em>BLJ</em> IV:69, Byron’s emphasis). Perhaps the potential damage to Leigh did not outweigh
               his own wishes. Empathy for individuals was never Byron's strong suit.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It would do a disservice to Byron, however, to suggest that these were his only reasons
                  for choosing to write what he did. He also had strong philosophical reasons for doing
                  so. As Evan Gottlieb observes, Byron was highly rational, and predominantly interested
                  in society, particularly in the structures and masks society imposed (99-100). Byron's
                  personal experience would have given him empirical evidence that the incest prohibition
                  was one of these imposed structures, not least because he began his liaison with his
                  sister with a certain sense that what he was doing was wrong, but that sense quickly
                  vanished. On August 11, 1813, when the affair was still in its early stages, he commented
                  to Lady Melbourne that "I should have been glad of your advice how to untie two or
                  three '<em>Gordion</em> knots' tied round me . . . some are rather closely twisted round my heart" (<em>BLJ</em> III:87-88, Byron’s emphasis), and on August 22, he wrote to Thomas Moore, "I am, at
                  this moment, in a far more serious, and entirely new, scrape than any of the last
                  twelve months—and that is saying a good deal” (<em>BLJ</em> III: 96).

                           is not entirely unusual: in order to make Byron’s letters palatable to a wide audience
                           (one that would include women), Moore replaced with asterisks numerous passages that
                           he deemed unacceptable to such readers. Unfortunately for scholarship, Moore’s published

                  people &amp; topics—which can be in no degree interesting—to me who see nothing in England
                  but the country which holds <em>you</em> . . .

                  feelings or hopes—which have not more or less a reference to you. (<em>BLJ</em> VI:129-30)’</span> In fact, Byron's connection to Leigh seems to have brought him the deepest, most
               frank, and longest-lasting love of his life (although what exactly "love" meant for
               Byron is difficult to say).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When one considers Byron’s own experience, then, as well as his more general philosophical
                  stance that any certainty and knowledge beyond the most basic are subjective, his
                  skepticism about the incest prohibition seems more understandable. In response to
                  Adah's astonishment that incest might be deemed a sin, <em>Cain</em>'s Lucifer responds that it "cannot be a sin in you—whate'er / It may seem in those
                  who may replace ye in / Mortality" (I.ii.375-7), yet later on he declares to Cain,
                  "Evil and Good are things in their own essence" (II.ii.657). If both of these are
                  true—and <em>Cain </em>endorses both, and it appears to offer Byron's own opinions—then it stands to reason
                  that the incest prohibition is not good "in its own essence," but rather is a taboo
                  imposed for certain reasons. Thus, for Byron, it is open to question. Byron's relationship
                  with Leigh, like Manfred's with Astarte, is a sexual connection between people of
                  equal age, non-coercive, and apparently without issue.

                           "subsequent 'abandon', and in an 1819 letter to Augusta makes it plain that he ceased
                           their sexual connection when she requested it: "we may have been very wrong—but I
                           repent of nothing except that cursed marriage—&amp; your refusing to continue to love
                           me as you have loved me" (BLJ IV:110; BLJ VI:129). As for children, at one point Byron
                           was concerned that Augusta was pregnant by him and might give birth to a damaged baby,

                  Yet Byron's deduction is based on a standard empirical model. Like any good Enlightenment
                  scientist, he has done the experiment then drawn the conclusion based on concrete
                  experience (his own), rather than on the abstraction and assumption that is conventional
                  morality.

                           advancing career, for Hume argued that morality was originally a social construct
                           rooted in the practical advantages it brought to those who practiced it. Here one
                           might also consider Claude Levi-Strauss's theory of incest and exogamy in The Elementary
                           Structures of Kinship (Beacon, 1969). On the other hand, in his Treatise Hume warns
                           against the kind of inductive reasoning Byron uses.</span></div>
                  </div> The flaw in his conclusion, however, is that he reasons inductively, from particulars
                  (himself) to generalities (the majority of people), assuming that his general readership
                  feels, or could feel, as he does. On the other hand, <em>Cain</em> shows that part of what underlies Byron's view on incest is a belief that the generality
                  labor under morals that have been impressed on them. This, too, has validity: both
                  the Romantics and contemporary scholars wrestle with the question of the degree to
                  which morals are innate and the degree to which they are imposed. Byron's thinking

                  is that it offers scholars many layers of thought to unfold. Nowhere does this complexity
                  seem more true than in the case of his thinking about incest. The topic features even
                  more frequently in Byron's writing than it does in Romantic texts generally,

                  </div> and, in virtually every work in which it appears, it is portrayed positively, or at
                  least not negatively: <em>The Bride of Abydos</em>, <em>Parisina</em>, <em>Epistle to Augusta</em>, <em>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</em> III, <em>Manfred</em>, <em>Cain</em>. Both this repetition and this portrayal suggest that for Byron incest is the expression
                  of something central to his understanding of how the world should be. It is up to
                  us to discover what that something is. Some twenty years ago, D. L. MacDonald suggested
                  that examination of Byron's incest and its use in his works might yield fruitful results
                  (37). That fruit remains ripe for the plucking.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">A passage did follow this announcement, but Moore put asterisks in its place. This
               is not entirely unusual: in order to make Byron’s letters palatable to a wide audience
               (one that would include women), Moore replaced with asterisks numerous passages that
               he deemed unacceptable to such readers. Unfortunately for scholarship, Moore’s published
               versions of these letters are now the only ones that exist. Because of this, it is
               impossible for us to guess what Byron added here.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase “for the sake of Augusta” is crossed out in the original document. It is
               impossible to know how Melbourne originally intended it to connect to what remains.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Quotations from <em>BLJ</em> III:87-8, 96; Gross 171; <em>BLJ</em> IV:104.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Although Byron wrote to Lady Melbourne that Augusta "was not to blame...she was not
               aware of her own peril—till it was too late," in the same letter he refers to her
               "subsequent '<em>abandon</em>', and in an 1819 letter to Augusta makes it plain that he ceased their sexual connection
               when she requested it: "we may have been very wrong—but I repent of nothing except
               that cursed marriage—&amp; your refusing to continue to love me as you have loved me"
               (<em>BLJ</em> IV:110; <em>BLJ</em> VI:129). As for children, at one point Byron was concerned that Augusta was pregnant
               by him and might give birth to a damaged baby, but that concern vanished with the
               birth; "it [the baby] is not an ape," he wrote to Lady Melbourne (<em>BLJ</em> IV:104). In fact, the Byrons had already practised a more acceptable form of interbreeding
               that nonetheless led to less obvious damage: their habit of marrying their cousins
               ensured replication of a mania and manic depression that haunted the family.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">In this way, Byron continues the alliance with David Hume that is a hallmark of his
               advancing career, for Hume argued that morality was originally a social construct
               rooted in the practical advantages it brought to those who practiced it. Here one
               might also consider Claude Levi-Strauss's theory of incest and exogamy in <em>The Elementary Structures of Kinship</em> (Beacon, 1969). On the other hand, in his <em>Treatise</em> Hume warns against the kind of inductive reasoning Byron uses.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
