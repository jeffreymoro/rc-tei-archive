      <div type="abstract"> 
        <p rend="noCount">In May 1820 Byron encountered Goethe’s remarks on <title type="m">Manfred</title> which, as translated by Hoppner, began:
        <quote>Byron’s tragedy, <title type="m">Manfred</title>, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular
        intellectual poet has taken my <title type="m">Faustus</title> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his
        hypochondriac humour.</quote>
        Goethe simultaneously demotes Byron to a derivative of himself and diverts attention from the most sensational instance of “hypochondriac
        humor” in the eighteenth century, his own autofiction, <title type="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>. This essay pursues the textual
        histories through which the authors sought to distance themselves from protagonists too close to themselves, the revisions Goethe made in
        successive editions of <title type="m">Werther</title> and Byron’s suppression of the original third act of <title type="m">Manfred</title>, 
        which Goethe could not have known. The original third act, however, was preserved in the seventeen-volume
        edition of Byron’s works published by John Murray in 1832-33. Attention to the activities of the editor, John Wright, in the construction of
        that edition, drawing upon unpublished materials in the John Murray Archive of the National Library of Scotland, reveals the interplay between
        the desires to establish posthumously the standing of Byron and to enhance the commercial value of Murray’s property, and the dissemination of
        the rejected “hypochondriac” materials. Wright’s preservation made them available for Alfred Bunn’s melodramatic presentation of 
        <title type="m">Manfred</title> at Covent Garden in 1834. Wright’s less notorious but more significant editorial intervention came when he
        inserted into his preface to <title type="m">Marino Faliero</title> Byron’s withdrawn dedication of the play to Goethe, responding directly to
        the charges of 1820. In highlighting the arc from the rejected third act of <title type="m">Manfred</title> in 1817 to the historical drama of
        1821 Wright brings forward Byron’s ongoing exploration, across multiple and different genres, of the conditions that give rise to the
        obsessions of his protagonists.</p>

      <p>On May 25, 1820 Byron reported to Richard Belgrave Hoppner, the British consul at Venice, that he had been sent “heaven knows why several
        Deutsche Gazettes of all which I understand neither word nor letter.” In them he found what “appear[ed] to be . . . Goethe’s [remarks] upon
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” begging Hoppner to translate them (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:106). Hoppner complied, and on June 7
        Byron sent the German original, Hoppner’s version, and an Italian one to John Murray, proudly telling him “to keep them all in your archives”
        because “the opinion[s] of <emph>the</emph> Greatest man of Germany. . . whether favourable or not are always interesting—and this
        is moreover favourable” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:113). Hoppner opens:</p>
        <quote>Byron’s tragedy, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular
        intellectual poet has taken my <title level="m">Faustus</title> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his
        hypochondriac humour.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Hoppner’s translation may be found in Appendix
        II, “Goethe and Byron,” <title level="m">LJ,</title> 12: 503-21. The quoted passages occur on p. 506.</note></quote>
       <p>Byron had initially inferred that “the word <emph>‘hypocondrish’</emph> [is] any thing but favourable” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:106), 
        and it is on that word that I want initially to focus. The prototypical hypochondriacal hero is the
        protagonist of <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>, the work that made Goethe famous at twenty-five in 1774, which he omits
        entirely from his response. Manfred’s cry to the Witch of the Alps, “My pang shall find a voice,” signals the extravagant self-involvement and
        willfulness of both Manfred and Werther, a condition the authors then seek to disavow, or at least from which they seek to stand apart
        (II.ii.50)<note place="foot" resp="editors">All quotations from  <title level="m">Manfred</title> taken from <emph>CPW</emph>.</note></p>
       <p>Already in his late sixties, Goethe read <title level="m">Manfred</title> shortly after its appearance in 1817; his remarks date from that
        period, though not published until 1820. “Ten years” after the publication of <title level="m">Werther</title>, Goethe “still marvelled at its
        ‘white-hot expression of pain and joy, irresistibly and internally consuming themselves’” (Boyle 124). Already by the second “genuine” edition
        of <title level="m">Werther</title> in 1775, Goethe had sought to forestall any simple identification of himself and his suicidal creation,
        adding the first quatrain of a poem to the title page of Book I that begins “Ev’ry youth for love’s sweet portion sighs, / Ev’ry maiden sighs
        to win man’s love,” but concludes on the title-page of Book II: "Be a Man, nor seek to follow Me."<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">“Genuine” is my translation of the “Ächte” on the title-page; that is, from Weygand in Leipzig, the publisher of the first 1774 
        edition. A digital copy of the edition, with the poems and vignettes on the title-pages, may be found at

        Goethe subsequently omitted the poem, but in the revised edition of 1787 the reader’s sympathy for Werther is further distanced by the increased role
        of the editor who frames Werther’s accounts of his situation by his own addresses to the reader. In addition, Goethe inserts new episodes
        specifically designed to widen the gap between Werther and the reader. In one added episode a young peasant falls in love with his widowed
        employer, and, when he tries to force himself upon her and is dismissed by the family, murders the hired hand whom he imagines as his rival.
        In the editor’s narrative, Werther is shown to have “put himself so completely in . . . [the] place” of the young peasant that he becomes the
        defender of a would-be rapist and murderer.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
        <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>, tr. and ed. Stanley Corngold, 74. The translation is supple and accessible to
        current students, for whom the surrounding materials are useful. Hereafter cited parenthetically as Corngold.</note> A
        portrait of Werther’s beloved Lotte that is less innocent and more complicitly seductive than in the first version is intensified by a second
        interpolated tale, in which Werther encounters a madman hunting for flowers to give his beloved, only to discover a day later that the man
        “was a clerk in the office of Lotte’s father, and it was a passion for her, which he nourished, concealed, revealed, and for which he was
        dismissed, that drove him mad” (Corngold 71).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The comparison of the
        first and the revised edition of the novel has a substantial history. See, for example, T. P. Saine and Deirdre Vincent.</note></p>
      <p>These devices enable the reader to see Werther’s limitations and excesses, and so to see the degree to which the “<emph>hypocondrisch</emph>” 
        is the product of historically specific conditions: the cultural emphasis on sensibility, on the heart, a moment at
        which Homer, Werther’s first ideal, is contested by the moody Ossian, who “has driven Homer from [Werther’s] heart,” the naive by the
        sentimental, to use Schiller’s only slightly later terms (Corngold 63).<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors"><title level="a">On Naive and Sentimental Poetry,</title> 1795.</note>  
        Most seriously, the hypertrophied inwardness is enforced by the paucity of careers open
        to Werther: he finds the ambassador for whom he works pedantic, and his way forward is blocked by the aristocratic prejudices of the petty
        principalities that made up eighteenth-century Germany. Once he asks for his dismissal from court the logic of withdrawal leads swiftly to his
        declaration: “It is settled, Lotte, I want to die, and I tell you this without romantic excesses, with composure, on the morning of the day
        when I will see you for the last time” (Corngold 80). </p>
      <p>Goethe’s elevation of autobiography into resonant cultural diagnosis—the “me/not me” of literature—was not always grasped by the readers
        who turned <title level="m">Werther</title> into a Europe-wide fad and lionized him. “[I]t had never occurred to me,” he recalled in 1824,<quote>
        that an intolerable torment was vouchsafed for me by sympathizing, well-meaning souls: for instead of someone’s saying something nice to me
        about my little book, just as it was, they all wanted to know, once and for all, how much of the whole affair was actually true, whereupon I
        would become very upset and generally say something rude. For to answer this question, I would have had to pluck apart my little book, to
        which I had devoted so much thought for so long, so as to give its many elements a poetic unity, in the process destroying the form and
        causing the actual components, if they were not altogether destroyed, at least to be jumbled and scattered.
         (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Aus Meinem Leben, Dichtung and Wahrheit</foreign></title>, qtd. Corngold 119)</quote>
      The events of 1772 in Wetzlar—his relationship to Charlotte Buff and her fiancé Johann Christian Kestner and the suicide of Karl Wilhelm
        Jerusalem, who had accompanied Goethe when he met Charlotte, and whose death, Kestner reported, was attributed to love for a married woman
       —Goethe insisted had been transmuted into a representative fiction, a strong contrast with his response to <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
        Irked as he was by those who retrojected his novel onto his life, he did the same to Byron.</p>
        <p>As he continues his remarks Goethe reduces <title level="m">Manfred</title> to gossip:
      <quote>He has often enough confessed what it is that torments him. He has repeatedly pourtrayed it; and scarcely any one feels any compassion for
        this intolerable suffering, over which he is ever laboriously ruminating . . . When a bold and enterprising young man, he won the affections
        of a Florentine lady. Her husband discovered the amour, and murdered his wife; but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street,
        and there was no one on whom any suspicion could be attached. Lord Byron removed from Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his life
        after. (<title level="m">LJ</title> XII:506)</quote>
        Goethe sidesteps any recognition that <title level="m">Werther</title> had involved him in similar misprisions. For example, Kestner found it
        difficult to grant the novel independence from the events he and Lotte Buff had lived through with Goethe; he objected to the portrayal of
        Lotte, insisting that “Lotte’s sharing of Werther’s passion was a dishonourable trait which was not and could not be found in Lotte Kestner,”
        and his protest at seeing himself resurface in Albert, or at seeing himself seen by others as Albert, is concise: 
      <quote>did Albert have to be such a blockhead, “just so that you can swagger up to him and say ‘look what a fine
        fellow <emph>I</emph> am?’”</quote>
      Kestner himself turns for solace in this charged situation to the third person and the buffer of a foreign language in quoting a friend’s
        letter to him: “<foreign xml:lang="fr">il est dangereux d’avoir un auteur pour ami</foreign>” (Boyle 185-6).<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">I compress here the account of Boyle (pp. 185-86), who is quoting from Wilhelm Bode, 
        <title level="m">Goethe in vertraulichen Briefen seiner Zeitgenossen</title>, rev. R. Otto and P.-G. Wenzlaff (Berlin
        and Weimar, 1979), and thus guided I have checked the 1922 publication of Bode’s work.</note>
        The authorial imperialism that enabled Goethe to control and reshape the events of his life into his fiction without regard for the effect 
        on other actors in the events Byron repeats in transforming Augusta Leigh, who remained in England to confront the same questions of truth to
        experience that Goethe acknowledged and Kestner and Lotte Buff face, into the mythical Astarte.<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">As Ghislaine McDayter emphasizes in <title level="a">The Iconography of Forgiveness: 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s Astarte</title> in this volume.</note>
        Goethe objects that in <title level="m">Manfred </title>“the gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last oppressive
        to us” but he concedes: “Yet is the dissatisfaction we feel connected always with esteem and admiration.”</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the tantalizing hints of a confession of incest, <title level="m">Manfred</title> should not, as Jeffrey Cox has recently
        persuasively argued in <title level="m">Romanticism in the Shadow of War</title>, be wholly inserted into the kind of erotic entanglements that
        Goethe retails. In both <title level="m">Werther</title> and <title level="m">Manfred,</title> the convergence of the poet’s life and the cultural
        moment is striking. The emptiness of time Manfred suffers catches the mood of a post-Congress of Vienna, post-Waterloo moment. Byron was not
        alone in feeling that peace had come but with the restoration of the old regimes revolutionary energies had departed. In Switzerland in 1816,
        Byron was not only temporally and geographically between Augusta and Annabella and the erotic profusion of Italy and the stability of Teresa
        Guiccioli; he was also between engagement in Regency politics—Parliamentary speeches on the Frame-breakers, opposition to the Regent—and
        the rejuvenation offered by joining the Carbonari against Austria and then the Greek Revolution. Manfred’s flamboyant withdrawal from the
        world acts out the uncertainty of his creator facing a world that failed to inspire commitment.</p>
      <p>The textual history that marks Goethe’s effort to cast critical distance on his self-absorbed protagonist has a counterpart in 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>, though not in the 1817 text that Goethe read. Much of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was
        drafted by September 1816, but the play was not completed when Byron left Switzerland for Italy. Acts I and II were sent to John Murray by
        March 9, 1817, when the original fair copy of Act III was also sent.<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">A compression of McGann’s account of the composition and publication of the play.</note>
        Self-deprecating comments accompanied the transmissions: “I have no great opinion of this piece of phantasy” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170), 
        “a drama as mad as Nat. Lee’s Bedlam tragedy” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:179), and, finally, “I have really &amp; truly no notion whether 
        it is good or bad— . . .You will submit it to Mr. G[iffor]d &amp; to whomsoever you please besides” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185). 
        Byron’s submission to the rejection of Act III by William Gifford, Murray’s literary advisor, grew from an earlier relationship. Gifford had been 
        an early model for Byron, who invokes his couplet satires, the <title level="m">Maeviad</title> and the <title level="m">Baviad</title>, in 
        <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title>; in 1813, after the overwhelming success of the first two cantos of 
        <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, Byron was still addressing him as a lowly acolyte: “I feel greatly at a loss how to write
        to you at all—still more to thank you as I ought.—If you knew the veneration with which I have ever regarded you long before I had the most 
        distant prospect of becoming your acquaintance literary or personal—my embarrassment would not surprize you” 
        (<title level="m">BLJ</title> III:63-4). More than thirty years older than
        Byron, the former editor of the conservative <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin</title> and then of the Tory <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>,
        Gifford epitomized the established values and tastes that Byron’s poetry subverted, but, as late as his time in Missolonghi, Byron angrily
        rebutted to his banker and friend Douglas Kinnaird the rumor that he was the author of an attack on Gifford, who was rich in enemies: “It is
        not true that I ever <emph>did—will—would—could—</emph>or <emph>should </emph> write
        a <emph> satire</emph> against Gifford—or a hair of his head—and so tell Mr. Murray.——I always considered
        Gifford as my <emph> literary</emph> father and myself as his
        ‘<emph>prodigal</emph> Son’” (emphases in original: <title level="m">BLJ </title>XI:117).
        When Gifford approved of the first two acts of <title level="m">Manfred</title> but did “not by any Means like the Conclusion,” Murray managed
        the dilemma by sending the assessment with a cover letter that attributed the condemnation to the “paternal interest” Gifford took in Byron’s
        “literary well being” (Nicholson 219). </p>
      <p>Fathers, however, do not fare well in Byron’s poetry, or rather they fare all too well, habitually crushing the rebellious Byronic hero, and
        so it is with <title level="m">Manfred</title>. In the original third act, Manfred reacts to the Abbot who menaces him, unless he repents and
        gives his lands to the monastery, by having him carried off by the demon, Ashtaroth, singing.<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">The name of Byron’s male demon “Ashtaroth” appears in the Bible as derived from the worship of the Phoenician
        goddess Ishtar, or Astarte: a fitting extension of the transgression of orthodoxy in Manfred’s forbidden love of Astarte. See Quinlan,
        who, however, reads his evidence differently. Elsewhere in this volume Alan Richardson illuminates the connection of the Zoroastrian
        thread of Byron’s drama to the use made of the doctrine in contemporary radical discourse.</note>
        Gifford was contemptuous:
      <quote>The Friar is despicable, &amp; the servants uninteresting. The scene with the Friar ought to be imposing, &amp; for that purpose the Friar
        should be a real good man—not an idiot.—More dignity should be lent to the catastrophe . . . Manfred should not end in this feeble way -
        after beginning with such magnificence and promise—and the demons should have something to do in the scene. (Nicholson 220)</quote>
     Byron wholly capitulated, telling Murray:
      <quote>The third act is certainly d-----d bad . . . It must on no account be published in its present state;—I will try &amp; reform it—or
        re-write it altogether—but the impulse is gone—&amp; I have no chance of making anything out of it. I would not have it published as it is
        on any account. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:211)</quote>
      Within a month Byron had composed a new third act, acceding to Gifford’s strictures point by point: “The Abbot is become a good man—and the
        Spirits are brought in at the death—you will find I think some good poetry in this new act here &amp; there—&amp; if so print it—without
        sending me further proofs—<emph>under Mr. G[iffor]d’s correction</emph>” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:219). In making the Abbot a
        good man, Byron at once severed himself from the Gothic, of which a corrupt and usually lustful monk was a staple, severing himself also from
        the play’s roots in “an unfinished Witch drama” begun years before and from his experience on the managing committee of Drury Lane Theatre and
        the hundreds of plays he had read during his tenure (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:463). In revising, Goethe had similarly ringed 
        <title level="m">Werther</title> with
        complicating perspectives; Byron’s excision, under pressure from Gifford, is more like repression, and, though it accelerated a shift in
        Byron’s mode, it came at a cost. In contrast, another stalwart of the <title level="j">Quarterly</title>, J. W. Croker, after reading the first
        two acts of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, urged Murray to “do all you can to induce Lord Byron to go on with his tragedy—for such I
        suppose it is to be. Its wildness, or if you will, its extravagance, is to me its first recommendation” (Nicholson 224). Croker, the author of
        the notorious review of Keats’s <title level="m">Endymion</title>, was in general no fan of the younger poets, but, in singling out Byron’s
        “extravagance,” he points to a strength Gifford could not recognize, and which the chastening and elevating of the third act sacrificed. At
        the close Manfred defeats the demons who have come for him by asserting his superiority—“Thou hast no power upon me, <emph>that</emph> 
        I feel; / Thou never shalt possess me, <emph>that</emph> I know”—and in this triumph of the will
        can then quietly die (III.iv.125-6). The new calm for which Byron strove, countering the Titanism of the earlier acts, suffuses his final
        speech: “Old man! ‘tis not so difficult to die” (III.iv.151). When Byron saw that the 1817 first edition had dropped the speech, he forcefully
        protested: “You have destroyed the whole effect &amp; moral of the poem by omitting the last line of Manfred’s speaking” 
        (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170). In their quest for a grander conclusion, neither Gifford nor Murray had comprehended the significance of 
        the deliberate understatement, an intertextual rebuke to Werther’s elaborate staging of the suicide in which his succumbing to despair climaxes.<note place="foot" 
        resp="editors">Murray to Byron August 29, 1817: “[You] will find that I am absolutely incapable of doing any thing which 
        I did not think you would approve—or at any rate that concealment—is totally out of the question—Mr Gifford after consulting me omitted 
        your close of the Drama from no other motive than because he thought that the words you allude too [sic]—lessened the effect—&amp; I was 
        convinced of this myself” (Nicholson 241).</note></p>
        <p>After Byron’s death in 1824, Murray obtained the copyrights of the poems that had been too scandalous for him to publish in the poet’s
        lifetime and brought out in 1832-33 a canon-fixing <title level="m">Works of Lord Byron with his Letters and Journals</title> in seventeen
        handsome volumes, of which the first six were filled by Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Life</title>, previously published in 1830.
        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is in volume 11.

      The driving force behind the edition was its editor, John Wright, in whose hands a publication announced on the title page as “in fourteen
        volumes” when it began to appear <emph>seriatim</emph> in 1832 reached seventeen volumes when it concluded in 1833. Wright was
        convinced “that the new management of the Poetry, with the explanatory Notes, etc. will do more for the character of the Lord [Byron] than all
        the writings respecting him that have hitherto appeared.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter from John Wright to John Murray, 15 May 1832.

        He persuaded Murray to extend <title level="m">Don Juan</title> into a third volume: “I now find it will be quite impossible to do justice 
        to the work, if you persist in compressing the 
        <title level="m">Don Juan</title> into two volumes . . . the Notes, critical, historical, moral, and religious are <emph>very
        numerous</emph>, and of a most interesting and fascinating description. I therefore intreat you to allow me another volume for the Poetry.” He
        failed, however, despite detailed pleading of the commercial advantages, to win Murray’s assent to the proposition that “the work ought to
        consist of <emph>eighteen</emph>” volumes (November 1832, MS. 41309). Wright tirelessly sought out those whose lives were
        entwined with Byron’s, and who might share precious texts. Having obtained manuscripts from Augusta Leigh, he proceeded to Teresa Guiccioli:
        the Countess, he reported, “feels very sore and angry with Moore, and with reason” and so gave him two volumes of Moore’s <title level="m">
        Life</title> with corrections (October 8, 1832), emboldening him to propose that Murray intimate to her that
        <quote>The Countess would also be rendering a service to the memory and character of Lord Byron, if she would permit me to look over the original
        manuscripts of Marino Faliero, Sardanapalus, the early cantos of Don Juan, and any other poems that she may have.</quote>
        Wright then unabashedly offered Teresa an enticement: if she were to look over
      <quote>Medwin, Hunt, Blessington, and the rest, and mark in the margin such misrepresentations respecting <emph>herself</emph> and Lord
        B, as she may wish to have set right . . . I could turn them to good account. (MS. 41309)</quote>
        Turning the publisher, his employer, into his intermediary, Wright offers him too a “good account,” the possibility of what on a later
        occasion he frankly called “a little sensation . . .[to] add a thousand or two to the sale of the work” (Dec. 3, 1832, MS. 41309).</p>
      <p>I have digressed from <title level="m">Manfred</title>, but only to show the editorial practice that shaped the dress in
        which Byron appeared for the remainder of the century. Wright was the kind of editor who could declare with pride, and perhaps even glee, that
        he had gone over the fifth canto of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> “and have extracted matter for at least thirty notes” (MS. 41309). I am
        only partly joking when I comment that his practice is simultaneously that of the Oxford Wordsworth, committed to the author’s final text, and
        that of the Cornell Wordsworth, committed to the earliest, often manuscript, version. The aim of the set was to establish Murray’s prize poet,
        but in addition to printing the corrected 1818 text of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and surrounding it with encomia from Francis Jeffrey and
        Professor Wilson attesting to its <emph>gravitas</emph>, the edition prints the correspondence in which Gifford condemned the
        original third act—and the rejected act itself, as in this example:
      <figure>
        <graphic url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/manning/manning_image2Thumb.jpeg" rend="inline"/>
        <figDesc>Figure 2: Act III first ms. as printed</figDesc>
      </figure>
      The consequence is that the calm of the final text achieved on the page is continuously disrupted by the return of the
        repressed in the notes below: an edition intended to monumentalize Byron instead preserves the <emph>hypocondrish </emph> turmoil from which it 
        emerged. Other traces of the gestation of the drama remain. Declaring in 1820 that he had never read Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> but 
        acknowledging that “Matthew Monk Lewis in 1816 at Coligny translated most of it to me <emph>viva voce</emph>,” Byron maintained that “it was the 
        <title level="m">Staubach</title> &amp; the <title level="m">Jungfrau</title>—and something else—much more than Faustus that made me write 
        <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:113). The “something else” has usually been understood as the hinted incest 
        with Augusta, which makes the edition’s note in Act I showing the closeness of the drama to excerpts from “the Journal of his Swiss tour, which 
        Lord Byron transmitted to his sister,” perhaps indelicate (21n1). Murray was “much struck with your description of pastoral life in the Alps - 
        wch [<emph>sic</emph>] I hope you do not omit &amp; indeed as much of the first impressions made by the Scenery will be given as you can - all 
        the world has been there &amp; will be delighted to tread the Air again in imagination” (Nicholson 217). The Alpine sublime was a commercial 
        imperative on which Murray did not fail to capitalize in the frontispiece to the volume by J. M. W. Turner.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Even more than Murray, Wright understood that as most of the poetry had been previously published, the success of the
        edition depended on the added value of the apparatus and especially the illustrations. He wrote Murray that even when they pictured familiar
        places, such as Venice, “they may be so varied as to give them an air of novelty” (MS. 41310). Every volume had not one but two frontispieces.
        On Monday, November 26, 1832, Wright implored Murray: “Turner should be induced to do something very striking for the 14<hi rendition="#sup">
        th</hi> volume. This is, I assure you, of great importance” (MS. 41309). In the first frontispiece, Turner, working from a sketch by W.
        Page, provides a bland view of Parnassus and the Castalian Spring, in the second a dramatic view of the Battle of Waterloo from the
        perspective of Hougoumont, appropriate to the review of the end of Napoleon’s career and the Congress of Vienna in “The Age of Bronze,”
        contained in the volume.</p>

      <p>I rehearse these familiar materials to suggest that, when Alfred Bunn decided in 1834 to produce at Covent Garden a stage version of the
        drama that Byron claimed he had “rendered . . .<emph>quite impossible</emph> for the stage,” he did not have
        to look far for the materials of sensational stage display (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:170).

        </figure>
      As Margaret Howell’s study of the acting version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain reveals, the settings and words were predominantly Byron’s
        own—incorporating the original rejected third act (Howell ch. 3). The product was less “<title level="m">Manfred Transformed</title>,” as 
        Howell titles her chapter, than “<title level="m">Manfred Restored</title>”: what Gifford excised and the <title level="m">Works</title> 
        preserved but degraded to the apparatus, Bunn raised into his script. The exception was the hint of incest, which
        theatrical censorship forbid representing on stage, and which had been duly removed. Bunn, Howell writes, made “Astarte Manfred’s cousin and
        ultimately his redeemer, an alteration clearly influenced by Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>”—that too seems a return of the influence
        Byron denied (98). In this stage version Manfred neither dies defiantly nor with calm dignity: Astarte reappears to announce, “I do forgive
        thee!” and, the stage direction indicates, Manfred “<emph>breaks from the Abbot, rushes toward her — falls &amp; dies</emph>”
        (Howell 103). Thereupon, reports the playbill, all was “Borne down by a violent THUNDER STORM” [see Fig. 6]. In his
        reminiscences, Bunn recalled, amid the general enthusiastic reception, a particular consequence probably made possible by the interdiction of
        the theme of incest:
      <quote>It was eminently successful—applauded by a crammed auditory, lauded, with but one exception, by the press, and witnessed with an inward
        satisfaction and delight by the poet’s sister, the Honourable Mrs. Leigh. In a letter from this accomplished lady, she says, “<title level="m">
        Manfred</title> was splendidly got up, and Miss Ellen Tree’s Witch of the Alps I shall dream of!” (Bunn I:146) </quote></p>
      <p>In sending the revised third act to Murray, Byron commented “I certainly am a devil of a mannerist—&amp; must leave off” (<title level="m">
        BLJ</title> V:185). As the proliferating cantos of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> demonstrate, “leaving off” was not Byron’s truest mode,
        especially when “leaving off” was initiated by a senior figure of authority. The contradictory impulses of the 1832 edition are faithful to
        Byron insofar as they present him divided between earlier and later versions of himself. The effect produced by editorial intervention in 1832
        parallels the break in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> between the arrested figure of Juan, who bears the traces of Byron’s childhood and
        scandalous separation, othered into a young Spaniard, and the narrator, who “rattle[s] on exactly as I’d walk . . . born for opposition,”
        fully engaged with, and brilliantly and sardonically commenting on, postwar Europe (XV.19-22). Goethe became the sage devoted to renunciation
        invoked by Carlyle in <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title>, contemporary with Bunn’s production of <title level="m">Manfred: “</title>Close thy
        <emph>Byron</emph>; open thy <emph>Goethe</emph>” (Carlyle 153). <emph>Byron </emph>could
        not close Byron; in one of his forecasts of the development of Juan, he told Murray: “I meant to have made him a Cavalier Servente in Italy
        and a cause for a divorce in England—and a Sentimental ‘Werther-faced man’ in Germany—so as to show the different ridicules of the society
        in each of those countries,” not maturing into wisdom but “gradually gaté and blasé as he grew older—as is natural (<title level="m">
        BLJ</title> VIII:78).
        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Marchand notes that the phrase “Werther-faced man” is mediated through Thomas Moore’s <title level="m">Fudge 
        Family in Paris</title>.</note> “I want a hero, an uncommon want,” he opened <title level="m">Don Juan</title>: “I’ll
        therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan, / We all have seen him in the pantomime / Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time” (I:1). Byron’s
        nominal hero is a stock figure whose metamorphoses become the instrument to “show the different ridicules of the societies in each of those
        countries,” not a settled sage or aspirant to the status of “<emph>the</emph> Greatest man of [Europe].” Byron theatricalizes; if
        the production travestied him, it also caught qualities integral to him—without, however, the two voices of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
        or of Wright’s edition.</p>
      <p>The zeal of Wright preserved a Byron that Murray, on the advice of Gifford, had initially repudiated; it also disseminated an exchange
        between Byron and Goethe over the review of <title level="m">Manfred</title> by producing a literary history that never happened. On February
        25, 1817, in the same letter that Byron announced to Murray from Venice that he had sent him “the other day some extracts from a kind of 
        drama—which I had begun in Switzerland—&amp; finished here,” he requested a favor:
      <quote>Look into ‘Moore’s (Dr. Moore’s) view of Italy’ for me—in one of the volumes you will find an account of the <title level="m">Doge
        Valiere</title> (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy—or the motives of it—get it transcribed for me &amp; send it in a letter to me
        soon—I want it—&amp; can not find so good an account of that business here—though the veiled portrait—&amp; the place where he was
        once crowned—and afterwards decapitated still exists—&amp; are shown. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:173-4)</quote>
        Five weeks later he repeated to Murray that “This was the thing that most struck my imagination in Venice” (<title level="m">BLJ</title>
        V:203). The chronological conjunction indicates the closeness of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>,
        though the latter tragedy was not completed until 1820. One grows from a “Witch drama” in a Gothic setting, and the other marks a determined
        program to quit the extravagant “manneris[m]” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185) that Gifford condemned. “It appears to
        me,” Byron declared to Murray as the tragedy approached publication,
      <quote>that there is room for a different style of the drama . . . good English—and a severer approach to the rules—might combine something not
        dishonourable to our literature, I have also attempted to make a play without love.——And there are neither rings—nor mistakes—nor starts—nor outrageous ranting villains—nor melodrame [<emph>sic</emph>]—in it. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VIII:78)</quote>
        Yet the two plays share the thematic of a world emptied of significance, figured in <title level="m">Manfred</title> by the death of Astarte
        and in <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> by the failure of the Venetian aristocracy adequately to punish the perpetrator of a slander
        against Angiolina, the wife of Faliero. That failure undermines the authority of which he, as Doge, is the emblem, driving him “into
        conspiring against the State of which he was the actual reigning Chief,—the last circumstance,” as Byron hyperbolically put it, “makes it
        the most remarkable—&amp; only fact of the kind in all history of all nations” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:174). Manfred’s confession,
        “From my youth upwards / My spirit walk’d not with the sons of men,” presents his withdrawal into icy seclusion in general terms (II.ii.50-1);
        Faliero’s turning from a long lifetime of service to tormented alliance with disaffected plebeians against his class is painfully particular.
        In the revised third act, Manfred justifies his abandonment of the “noble aspirations in my youth, / To make my own the mind of other men, /
        The enlightener of nations” by boastfully proclaiming
     <quote><lg style="stanza"> 
      <l>I could not tame my nature down; for he </l>
      <l>Must serve who fain would sway—and soothe—and sue—</l>
      <l>And watch all time—and pry into all place—</l>
      <l>And be a living lie. (III.i.105-20) </l></lg></quote>
        Faliero experiences himself as having been turned into a “living lie” by the refusal of the Forty to respect ducal authority; both
        protagonists display the self-destructive pride of the Byronic hero—and of the narrator of Cantos III and IV of <title level="m">Childe
        Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, whose teasing at the borders of fiction and autobiographical revelation is extended into the oblique but
        recognizable domestic details of Byron’s childhood, marriage, and separation in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, which had reached Canto V by
        1821.</p>
      <p>Despite his disdain for political activity in the soliloquy that opens the fourth scene of the revised third act, Manfred is overcome by a
        memory of having once “stood within the Colosseum’s mighty wall, / ‘Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome . . .”
      <quote><lg style="stanza">     
      <l rendition="#indent2"> . . . till the place</l>
      <l>Became religion, and the heart ran o’er</l>
      <l>With silent worship of the great of old!—</l>
      <l>The dead, but sceptered sovereigns, who still </l>
      <l>Rule our spirits from their urns. (III.iv.10-41)</l></lg></quote>
          The imperial model of “almighty Rome” in <title level="m">Manfred</title> yields to a parallel nearer to Britain in <title level="m">Marino
          Faliero</title>, the maritime power of Venice, now sunk from glory to a place of Carnival and the intrigues and <emph>contretemps</emph> 
            that fill Byron’s contemporary life, letters, and <title level="m">Beppo</title> (written the same year as
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> was completed). The degradation of authority Faliero experiences, as many commentators
        have noted, corresponds with the shift in political force in England from the reforming aristocratic liberals of the late eighteenth and early
        nineteenth century to working-class radicals such as Cobbett and Orator Hunt. The involvement of Hobhouse with the radicals, leading to his
        imprisonment, profoundly discomfited Byron, and despite the <foreign xml:lang="fr">éclat</foreign> of his entry into the Greek
        Revolution (and death at Missolonghi), Byron was aware that the aristocratic status he flaunted was ceding political effectiveness to
        organized movements.</p>
          <p>Byron framed <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> with a Preface summarizing his sources, and an Appendix in which he
        printed extracts from them, in the original languages and in translation. These Wright curtailed to a dozen pages set in tiny type, but
        together they demonstrate the care Byron took to establish the cultural and historical context in which his characters act. The paratexts are
        integral to the design of the volume as a whole and connect directly to one of Wright’s most telling editorial interventions. On October 17,
        1820, roughly seven months after seeing Goethe’s critique of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and two months after the completing the copy of 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, Byron sent Murray his “dedication of” the drama “to Goethe" (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII:206), 
        countermanding his request on January 19, 1821: “<emph>Omit</emph> the Dedication to Goethe” (<title level="m">LJ</title> VIII:66). In his 
        <title level="m">Life of Byron</title> (1830), republished in the 1832-1833 edition of the
        <title level="m">Works</title>, Moore printed an expurgated text of the “never before published . . . very singular Dedication . . . written 
        in the poet’s most whimsical and mocking mood” (V:356). Notwithstanding its previous appearance, Wright, while rebuking Moore for his excisions, 
        reprinted Moore’s text in his preface to <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, positioning it to lead directly into Byron’s Preface and play. 
        <note place="foot" resp="editors">Wright regretted the omissions (attacks on Wordsworth and Southey) from the text because the “MS. having since
        been lost,” they cannot be repaired. The MS. was subsequently found in the Goethe Archiv, Weimar, and printed by Alois Brandl in 1899,
        and may be found transcribed in  <title level="m">CPW</title> (4:544-47). Barry Weller and Jerome McGann there observe that it “meant to
        respond to the criticisms” but the effect on readers of Wright’s printing and placing it as he did is rightly outside their editorial
        concerns (523). E. M. Butler narrates in full the misadventures that befell the intention to dedicate a drama to Goethe: Byron wrote a
        shorter and uncontroversial dedication for <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (1821), but it was not printed until the separate edition
        of the play in 1823; a still shorter dedication to Goethe is affixed to <title level="m">Werner</title> (1823).</note>
        The reader of Wright’s text, and those derived from it across the nineteenth century, thus apprehends, with greater or lesser self-consciousness, 
        the play as part of the sequence <title level="m">Manfred</title> =&gt; Goethe on <title level="m">Manfred</title> =&gt; Byron’s Dedication to 
        Goethe =&gt; <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>. The exchange we experience did not happen: Goethe did not receive the Dedication until 1831, 
        by which time Byron had been dead for seven years. Goethe died in 1832, before the appearance of the twelfth volume, containing 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, of the <title level="m">Works.</title></p>
      <p>In transmitting the Dedication to Murray, Byron enclosed
        <quote>an Italian abstract of the German translation of <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s appendix in which you will perceive quoted what Goethe
        says of the <emph>whole body</emph> of English poetry (&amp; <emph>not</emph> of one in particular) on this the Dedication is founded as you will 
        perceive—though I had thought of it before for I look upon him as a Great Man. (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VII: 206)</quote>
        Even if Goethe had not aimed solely at Byron the stricture quoted in the Dedication that “the predominant character of the whole body of the
        present English poetry is a <emph>disgust</emph> and <emph>contempt for life</emph>,” it provided him the occasion for a
        riposte against the criticisms aroused by <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Moreover, the layout of Wright’s edition enfolds <title level="m">
        Manfred Faliero</title> in the riposte.</p>
      <p>Byron continues, exposing the point that Goethe had obscured by speaking of <title level="m">Manfred</title> only in
        relation to <title level="m">Faust</title>:
      <quote>But I rather suspect that by one single work of <emph>prose, you</emph> yourself have excited a greater contempt for life, than all
        the volumes of English poesy ever written. Madame de Staël says, that “Werther has occasioned more suicides than the most beautiful woman”;
        and I really believe that he has put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon himself,—except in the way of his profession. 
        (<title level="m">Works</title> XII:51).</quote>
        If the reply is only a witty <foreign xml:lang="la">tu quoque</foreign>, it also hints that a writer who had struggled to distance himself from his
        “white-hot expression of pain and joy,” as Goethe had in the post-publication embarrassments of <title level="m">Werther</title>, might have
        been more sympathetic to the urgencies of <title level="m">Manfred</title> than Goethe had been, and less ready to spread unfounded scandal
        about the poet’s life. The drama to which the Dedication was to be attached deepens the reply. Goethe had charged that Byron “repeatedly
        pourtrayed” his torment, to the point that “scarcely anyone feels compassion for this intolerable suffering, over which he is laboriously
        ruminating” (<title level="m">LJ</title> XII:506). <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> demonstrates
        that Byron’s preoccupations could be turned outward into a very different world, into “Venetian history and manners” (Wright’s terms, 
        <title level="m">Works</title> XII:45) of the fourteenth century, creating a “regular” drama in “good English” (Byron’s terms, qtd. in
        <title level="m">Works </title>XII:49) that unmistakably cast light on the shifting political conditions of a Britain that
        was not only post-Napoleon but also post-Peterloo. Devotees of “the Byronic” were disappointed, as Byron anticipated that they would be.
        Wright prints Francis Jeffrey’s verdict in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> that Byron fails because he chose
        a story “which not only gives no scope to the peculiar and commanding graces of his genius, but runs continually counter to the master
        currents of his fancy” (qtd. in <title level="m">Works</title> XII:46). In the drama, the passionate plaints of a <title level="m">Manfred</title>
        yield to the goal of provoking readers to critical thinking about the civic and the personal—but the oppositions are inadequate. 
        <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> demonstrates—to Goethe and others—that imagination can turn personal history and Venetian history
        alike into a work of art, one that shows, as Goethe claimed for <title level="m">Werther</title>, the cultural situations that produce the
        self-involved protagonist. In what seems like an offhand P.S. to the Dedication, Byron writes:
       <quote>I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call
        <emph>“Classical”</emph> and “<emph>Romantic”</emph>—terms which were not subjects of classification
        in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. (<title level="m">Works</title> XII:52)</quote>
        The sentence seems a mere statement of fact, or a bemused reflection. It applies, however, to the
        entire sequence of Byron’s own productivity from <title level="m">Manfred</title> to <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title>, 
        continuous but shifting in form, not subject to a (single) classification.</p>
