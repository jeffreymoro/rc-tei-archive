                <p rend="noCount">As Manfred glimpses “the last infirmity of evil” from his
                    position on the Jungfrau, he confronts a post-moral order dependent on a
                    particular kind of relinquishment, the obverse of the forgiveness that
                    Shelley’s Prometheus attains at the outset of his play. He claims prematurely,
                    “I have ceased / To justify my deeds unto myself,” and his pursuit of such a
                    mental and moral state in fact determines the action of the remainder of the
                    play, just as his initial voiced desire for “forgetfulness” and “self-oblivion”
                    must be achieved. At this early point in the play, Manfred’s solitude is
                    “peopled with the furies,” just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tortured on his rock
                    by Jupiter’s “hounds of hell.” Both heroes have something to get
                    over: Prometheus, his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. Going (like
                    Nietzsche) beyond good and evil, Manfred represents an existential Romantic
                    heroism in sharp contrast to Shelley’s messianic version; his humor is the
                    golden laughter of a careless god.</p>

                <p>I want to begin with Manfred on the Jungfrau, one of the poem’s key moments of
                    reckoning in which Byron’s hero struggles to apprehend the trajectory of his own
                    fall and end, literally and figuratively. Contemplating a leap from the
                    precipice to his death on the rocks below, he also meditates Satanically on the
                    vector of his moral degeneration and the death-in-life that it has entailed:
                            <quote><lg type="stanza">
                            <l>There is a power upon me which withholds,</l>
                            <l>And makes it my fatality to live;</l>
                            <l>If it be life to wear within myself</l>
                            <l>This barrenness of spirit, and to be</l>
                            <l>My own soul’s sepulchre, for I have ceased</l>
                            <l>To justify my deeds unto myself—</l>
                            <l>The last infirmity of evil. (I.ii.23-9)</l>
                        </lg></quote> This essay amounts essentially to an extended footnote to
                  those lines—and particularly to those final clauses: “for I have ceased to
                    justify my deeds unto myself—the last infirmity of evil.” I hope to expose
                    some unresolved energies or faultlines in this passage that divide the moral
                    vision of the play. As the driving action throughout, Manfred pursues a certain
                    kind of cessation or relinquishment, the dark twin or obverse of the repentance
                    and recalled curse that determines Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>. Manfred tells the Witch of the Alps that his solitude is
                    “peopled with the Furies” (I.ii.131), just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tormented
                    on his rock by Jupiter’s “tempest-walking hounds,” who show him visions of his
                    own terrors (<title level="m">Promtheus Unbound</title> I.331). That is, both
                    heroes are tortured by furies that are also interior anxieties and fears (one
                    might say that the various scenes of supernatural aggression in both works are
                    essentially records of panic attacks). Both heroes have something to get over:
                    Prometheus, his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> the play offers a mordant, Byronic version of the thesis
                    that Shelley will also advance in his philosophical psychodrama: you become a
                    demi-god by giving things up. In relinquishing his anger, Shelley’s hero
                    regenerates the cosmos and also makes himself oddly irrelevant: his
                    Puff-the-Magic-Dragon-like retreat to a cave where he will sit with Asia “as the
                    world ebbs and flows” (III.iii.24) marks both his ascension and retreat into
                    pair-bonded solipsism. Manfred’s quest is more ostentatiously self-centered, and
                    yet he pursues a form of emptying out that might negate the self entirely.
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a dead reckoning of the negative
                    way.</p>
              <p>So, to begin: how do we gloss these lines? The interpretive problem starts with
                    the quadruple negative, further destabilized by one of Byron’s ambiguous dashes:
                    “I have <emph>ceased</emph> / To justify my deeds unto myself— / The <emph>last
                        infirmity</emph> of <emph>evil</emph>.” Two primary questions arise. First,
                    is it the <emph>justification</emph> of one’s ill deeds, or the
                        <emph>cessation</emph> of that justification, that Byron intends as “the
                    last infirmity of evil”? The dash makes it possible for the final phrase to
                    govern either the infinitive (“To justify my deeds unto myself”) or the entire
                    preceding clause (“<emph>I have ceased</emph> to justify my deeds unto myself”).
                    Second, by “the last infirmity of evil,” does Byron mean the <emph>ultimate
                        stage </emph>of evil, or the <emph>last remaining flaw</emph> in evil’s
                    otherwise-perfect constitution? </p>
                <p>Maybe Milton can help. Byron’s “last infirmity” phrasing adapts a passage from
                    “Lycidas”: <quote><lg type="stanza">
                            <l><emph>Fame</emph> is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise</l>
                            <l>(That last infirmity of Noble mind)</l>
                            <l>To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes. (70-3)</l>
                        </lg></quote> For Milton, “last infirmity” means the final remaining
                    weakness after all other errors have been purged. “Fame is the spur,” but it
                    also remains a recognizable flaw in a “Noble mind” that should be above concerns
                    for applause and praise. Moreover, Milton himself is here adapting a line from
                    Tacitus’s <title level="m">Histories</title> (IV.6): “<foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >etiam sapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur</foreign> (the desire
                    for glory is the last thing relinquished, even by wise men). So, as Byron
                    inherited the phrase, “last infirmity” meant the final weakness to be overcome
                    or shed, the longest-lived flaw. But “last infirmity of evil” complicates the
                    question—since evil itself can be thought of as infirmity, and thus the “last
                    infirmity” would be in fact the crowning weakness, the consummate infirmity, the
                    final summit or stage of descent into pure evil.</p>
                <p>We are left with two options so far: whatever the phrase “the last infirmity of
                    evil” modifies, that thing is either the last grace, the final scrap of goodness
                    that mitigates evil (a “last infirmity” in the mode of Milton and Tacitus),
                        <emph>or</emph> the last step on the ladder of degeneracy, the ultimate
                    state of sin. So, what does the phrase modify? Well, again we have two primary
                    opposing choices: either the claim “I have <emph>ceased</emph> to justify my
                    deeds unto myself” or the infinitive “to justify my deeds unto myself”—that
                    is, either self-justification or the cessation of it. These oppositions, then,
                    ultimately resolve into two primary interpretive choices, once you cancel out
                    the positives and negatives: self-justification is either the worst thing or the
                    last hope in the moral vision of Byron’s play.</p>
                <p>Jerome McGann has indicated that he sees <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a
                    critique of hypocrisies and an exposure of self-deceptions. He writes in <title
                        level="m">Byron and Romanticism</title>: “We are sinners who want to cover
                    our sins, to mitigate their depth. This desire is precisely ‘the last infirmity
                    of evil’ that Byron wrote his play to engage” (92). In this view,
                    self-justification arises from a guilty conscience, and manifests itself in a
                    dangerous sense of righteousness. Plenty of evidence suggests that this was
                    Byron’s view, particularly around the time of the composition of <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title>, when he was angry at Lady Byron and her allies
                    and raging over the hypocrisies of English society. The “Incantation” from
                        <title level="m">Manfred </title>is precisely an
                    “In-<emph>cant</emph>-tation,” a curse on cant and an excoriation of the “false
                    tears,” “serpent smile,” “unfathomed gulfs of guile,” and the “shut soul’s
                    hypocrisy” that were at once Annabella’s, her maid Mary Jane Clermont’s, and
                    Byron’s own—not to mention those of Castlereagh and Romilly, whom he hated
                    (I.i.201-71). Those who justify their deeds unto themselves adopt an essentially
                    Satanic moral posture, reversing the polarities of good and evil—“Evil be thou
                    my Good” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> IV.110)—something like James
                    Hogg’s <title level="m">Justified Sinner</title>, who is far more dangerous, far
                    more evil, because of his sense of righteousness. Robespierre and the Terror
                    stand somewhere in the near distance. As Alan Liu writes of the French
                    Revolution, <quote>Thus where the plot of the Revolutionary tragedy might have
                        remained the angry sentence, “war demands sacrifice,” Justice at last
                        legitimized demand to make the sentence read, with an assurance and dignity
                        so supernal that we might well think of the angel-interpreter comforting
                        Hagar: “war <emph>justifies</emph> sacrifice.” (159)</quote> In other words,
                    to justify evil is to weaponize it, to make it active as not only necessary, but
                    “good.” In such a view, to cease in this self-righteous activity and admit one’s
                    hypocrisies would be a prelude to confession: self-justification becomes the
                    worst stage of evil, while its cessation is the first step and the last grace
                    that might lead to redemption.</p>
                <p>The problem with this reading, of course, is that Manfred hardly appears redeemed
                    on the Jungfrau. Quite the contrary, he feels a “barrenness of spirit” as if he
                    has become his “own soul’s sepulchre” (I.ii.26-7). The general thrust of the
                    passage suggests a state of dejection and acedia, as if Manfred has yielded up
                    moral questions in despair. He has ceased to justify his deeds, ceased to
                    provide morally or ethically inflected accounts of his actions, even to himself,
                    and thus attained the summit of evil, having given in to the “last infirmity” in
                    “this long disease my life,”—to allude to the title of McGann’s keynote
                    address, and to Pope (Pope, “Epistle” 132). In such a state, Manfred hears no voice of
                    conscience, not even a perjured one: he just gives up and does what he 
                    wants—except he only wants what he can’t have: forgetfulness, oblivion, forgiveness,
                    Astarte. In this view, self-justification is the last grace, and its abandonment
                    signifies a descent into the slough of sin’s infirmity. Yet Manfred still
                    glimpses evil from where he stands: he has not yet moved to a place where “evil”
                    as such ceases to exist—his conscience is not totally gone. Making this
                    statement, he voices a judgment on himself, meaning he has not stepped beyond
                    moral calculation, even though he finds himself on the dizzy brink of complete
                    amorality. He still wants to forget, which means he still remembers; and he will
                    soon plead Astarte for forgiveness, which means he still feels guilt and
                    remorse. It’s not over yet: on the Jungfrau, Manfred is not yet beyond good and
                    evil.</p>
                <p> In his opening soliloquy, Manfred asserts a post-mortal perspective, claiming

                        </lg></quote> In this comprehensive devaluation of “all I see in other
                    beings”—good, evil, life, powers, passions—and of his own feelings for
                    earthly things—dread, fear, hopes, wishes, and love—Manfred asserts a cold
                    impermeability to human existence. But there are two things he has not
                    renounced: nature and himself—or, more accurately, the beauty of the external
                    world and his own tormented conscience. Getting over these things will occupy
                    him for the rest of the play. We observe a series of encounters with natural
                    scenes—from the Jungfrau, to the personified Witch of the Alps, to his
                    farewell to the sun, and finally, to his address to the moon shining on the
                    mountains—all of which involve varying degrees of longing and admiration. He
                    says on the Jungfrau, “Beautiful! how beautiful is all this visible world,” but
                    he rejects the Witch of the Alps whose beauty might have redeemed him in a
                    Wordsworthian vein, and he concludes his thoughts on the Coliseum remembering
                    how the moonlight left <quote><lg type="stanza">

                    (moonlight on the Coliseum) and thence to “silent worship of . . . / The dead”
                    marks a transition away from external beauty to internal experience, in a
                    recognizably Byronic mode of transfiguration (III.iv.39-40).</p>
                <p> In admitting that other spirits rule his spirit, Manfred edges closer to the
                    final renunciation the drama requires. Despite the ostensible defiance and
                    willfulness of the last scene, he undergoes his final relinquishment:
                    essentially, he gets over himself. And his last gesture—to reach for the hand
                    of another human (either Manuel or the Abbot, depending on the version)—suggests
                    a last abandonment of his walled interior stronghold. Perhaps now
                    finally, truly giving up on self-justification, he moves past evil to another
                    order—and I am thinking here of Nemesis saying of Astarte, “She is not of our
                    order” (II.iv.115). In an entry on “applause” in <title level="m">The Gay
                        Science</title>, Nietzsche has occasion to quote the Tacitus passage on the
                    desire for glory: <quote>The thinker does not need applause or the clapping of
                        hands, provided he be sure of the clapping of his own hands: the latter,
                        however, he cannot do without. Are there men who could also do without this,
                        and in general without any kind of applause? I doubt it: and even as regards
                        the wisest, Tacitus, who is no calumniator of the wise, says: <foreign
                            xml:lang="la">quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima
                            exuitur</foreign> -- that means with him: never. (sec. 330, p.
                        144)</quote> Here we glimpse the case of Manfred, beyond self-justification
                    and beyond Nietzsche’s limits, one who believes he can do without the clapping
                    even of his own hands: “I have ceased to justify my deeds unto myself,” even
                    though that renunciation is always the <foreign xml:lang="la">novissima
                        exuiter</foreign>, the last thing to go. To escape his self-imposed
                    torments, the bite of conscience, Manfred must also abandon his self-regard:
                    only then, as a kind of stoic empty vessel, can he achieve the calmness of his
                    passing. </p>
                <p>As I suggested at the outset of this talk, much of <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> might be understood as the record of a panic attack or
                    nervous breakdown, with the last lines as aftermath. The same thing happens to
                    Prometheus in the first act of Shelley’s drama: one of the Furies says to him,
                    “we will rend thee . . . nerve from nerve, working like fire within” (I.475-6)
                    before she and her sisters torment him with scenes of his worst fears and causes
                    for despair. To triumph over these attacks, Prometheus and Manfred both have to
                    let it go: the past, the struggle, the violently-defended self. For Manfred,
                    this means a move from the murky Gothic “witch-drama” he has been inhabiting
                    towards the high equipoise of classical tragedy. As the play progresses, Manfred
                    seems less of a Shakespearean and more of a Sophoclean or Senecan protagonist,
                    quoting the last words of Nero to the Abbot—“It is too late” (III.i.98)—and
                    thinking of the Roman Coliseum shortly before his death. 
                    <note place="foot" resp="author"> As McGann notes, Byron “applies Suetonius’
                        account of the death of Nero (<title level="m">Lives of the Caesars</title>,
                        VI. Chapter 49) to the suicide of Otho, Rome’s sixth emperor,” in Manfred’s
                        conversation with the Abbot (III.i). Manfred’s self-identification with the
                        stoic suicide of a noble Roman indicates an affinity with Classical tragic
                        heroism. His famous meditation on the Roman Coliseum occurs at the beginning
                        of Act III, scene four.</note> His final words, “Tis not so difficult to
                    die” (III.iv.151), strike a distinctly classical note, the culmination of this
                    trend. In partial confirmation, a contemporary reader of <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> made marginal pencil notes in Greek in an 1817 copy of the
                    second edition (Figure 1). The lines are from Sophocles’ <title level="m"
                        >Ajax</title>, which our reader heard echoed in Manfred’s farewell address
                    to the sun in Act III, scene two: <quote><lg type="stanza">
                            <l>And you that drive your chariot up the steep</l>
                            <l>Of Heaven, Lord Helios . . . you,</l>
                            <l>Sweet gleam of daylight now before my eyes,</l>

                            <l>For this last time and never any more.</l>
                            <l>O radiance, O my home, and hallowed ground (II.845-6, 856-9)</l>
                        </lg></quote> Or, as Manfred says in part, “thou dost rise, / And shine, and
                    set in glory. Fare thee well! / I ne'er shall see thee more” (III.ii.23-5).
                    Taking his leave of nature and his place among the noble minds of classical
                    antiquity, giving into or finally shedding his last infirmities, Manfred becomes
                    a hero by losing himself, for good…and evil.</p>
