            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">Alfred Bunn’s production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (Covent Garden, October
                    29,1834 to February 18, 1835) maintained a successful season and was regularly
                    performed during subsequent years. The major constituents, however, were in
                    unfortunate competition. Stage lighting gave emphasis to the immense paintings by
                    Thomas and William Grieve. The playbill forewarned the audience that “Chandeliers
                    around the Front of the Boxes will not be used on the Evenings of the Performance of
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title>.” The backdrop paintings were crucial to Bunn’s
                    production. “In order to produce the necessary effects of Light and Shade,”
                    downstage action took place in the shadows. Henry Gaskell Denvil in the lead role as
                    Manfred sought to impersonate the author, though dead and gone, reanimating himself
                    as the character condemned to an internal vigil. His performance was intended as
                    another stage enactment of Lord Byron and his personal scandal, representing on
                    stage an impersonation of Byron performing the role of the Byronic character. The
                    impersonations had become more familiar to London audiences than any of the fading
                    memories of the poet. As Byron himself confessed, Edmund Kean was exceptionally
                    skilled in his impersonations. When Denvil took on the role of Manfred at Covent
                    Garden, his performance was burdened by expectations that he would not simply
                    impersonate Byron in that role, but also reprise Edmund Kean’s well-known
                    impersonations of Byron. Also competing with Denvil’s performance as a voice in the
                    shadows beneath the vast backdrop paintings, was the full orchestral score by Henry
                    Rowley Bishop, who rearranged lyrics as popular opera with elaborate solos and
                    choruses. Among the most striking alterations was the retention of the song of the
                    witches (“As the raven sits / On the raven stone”) from the concluding scene of
                    Byron’s original version. Bishop has transformed the song for Ellen Tree, with
                    chorus, at the close of her scene as the Witch of the Alps. Bishop also altered
                    Byron’s revised conclusion, substituting a song made of lines from 
                    <title level="m">The Giaour</title> (“This—as the stream and ocean greet”). Bunn succeeded in
                    adapting <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a spectacular musical production, but
                    Bishop’s abbreviated and rearranged libretto deprived the audience of much of
                    Byron’s dramatic poem. </p>

            <p>Opening with a Faustian scene in which Manfred abjures his previous studies that “did
                not avail” (I.i.12), Byron introduces the time-conscious “vigil,” the compulsive
                need to “watch” and “to look within” (I.i.7-8). In each of the successive
                encounters, the temporality of “watching” is modulated in accord with a scheme other
                than the familiar course of earthbound time. With the spirits of earth and air, as
                with the demons of the Hall of Arimanes, Manfred shares an unconstrained vista of
                universal time and space. “The lightning of my being,” he tells the Seven Spirits,
                “is as bright, / Pervading, and far darting as your own” (I.i.155-6). Affirming his
                lot outside of normal mortality, he tells the Chamois Hunter “Look on me.”
                (II.i.42). “Look on me / Or watch my watchings,” he tells the Witch of the Alps
                (II.ii.128-9). To the Phantom of Astarte, he says, “Look on me!” (II.iv.119). To the
                Abbot of St. Maurice, the request is again repeated: “Look on me!” (III.i.138) and
                “Look upon me!” (III.i.149). While keeping watch upon the tower, Manuel relates to
                Herman how Astarte was once “companion of his wanderings / And watchings”
                (III.iii.43-4). Even as he prepares to die, Manfred defies the demons who come to
                fetch him. Unlike his Faustian prototype, Manfred has made no pact with the devil.
                He owes his mastery of dark powers to his “superior science” and “length of
                watching” (III.iv.116).</p>
            <p>The staging of <title level="m">Manfred</title> might have readily realized the motif
                of <emph>watching</emph> by implicating the audience in the different
                modes of witnessing Manfred as dominant character from scene to scene. Instead,
                Alfred Bunn’s premier production of the play at Covent Garden (October 29, 1834 to
                February 18, 1835) decentred the role of the title character with the theatrical
                enhancements of lighting, setting, and music. To take advantage of the poetic
                contexts of the demonic and sublime, Bunn commissioned a series of immense theatre
                paintings by the Grieves. Henry Gaskell Denvil was expected to perform the character
                of Manfred in the established manner of impersonating Byron performing the role of
                the Byronic character. Bunn was persuaded by Francis Jeffrey to accept that
                “obscurity is part of its grandeur.” This entailed a pretence of secrecy regarding
                “the painful nature of the circumstances,” which Jeffrey declared arose “from the
                disappointment or fatal issue of an incestuous passion on which its distress is
                founded” (Jeffrey 122). The hints of brother-sister incest in Manfred’s relation to
                Astarte were understood to be Byron’s own confession of his illicit relationship
                with his half-sister, Augusta Mary Byron. On August 17, 1807, Augusta married her
                cousin, Colonel George Leigh, and had a number of children by him, but Byron was
                acknowledged as father of her daughter, Elizabeth Medora Leigh, born in 1814. Two
                years later, Byron’s marriage to Annabelle Milbank had failed and he departed from
                England amidst rumours of incest with his half-sister (<title level="m">Broadview
                </title>13-4).</p>
            <p>Among Bunn’s entrepreneurial ploys to insure a sensation on opening night at Covent
                Garden was the invitation of a special guest. There was an electric buzz of
                excitement as the audience waited for the curtain to rise on the premier performance
                of <title level="m">Manfred</title> (29 October 1834). The buzz was hushed when the
                audience witnessed one last spectator take her place in one of the central boxes.
                The Honorable Augusta Leigh had arrived to watch the play that fueled the stories of
                incest (Tunbridge 212-36). Twenty years had passed since the
                birth of their daughter (April 15, 1814), and ten years since the poet’s death at
                Missolonghi (April 19, 1824), but the old
                scandals were as lively as ever. During the conjuration of Astarte (II.iv), heads
                were twisting back and forth in the attempt to judge the reactions to the events on
                stage by the lady in the box seat.</p>
            <p>The impersonations of Byron had become more familiar to London audiences than any of
                the fading memories of the poet. As Byron himself confessed, Edmund Kean was
                exceptionally skilled in his impersonations of Byron. Kean’s impersonations were
                only mildly embarrassing when performed in private. They were far too convincing
                when performed publicly, as in Kean’s performance as Salim in <title level="m">The
                    Bride of Abydos</title> (Drury Lane, February 5, 1818). When Denvil took on the
                role of Manfred at Covent Garden, his performance was burdened by expectations that
                he would not simply impersonate Byron in that role but also reprise Edmund Kean’s
                well-known impersonations of Byron.</p>
            <p>At odds with his own denial of any ambitions for theatre performance, Byron achieved
                a far more extensive stage presence than any other playwright of the Romantic era.
                He attained this prominence in spite of the limited and belated success of his own
                dramatic works. The popularity of the Byronic character seemed to follow inevitably
                from the partially autobiographical revelations developed in his literary
                protagonists. Many years ago, David Erdmann observed a closely related paradox that
                Byron should declare his purpose “to reform the stage” yet repeatedly deny his
                intentions to have his plays performed (Erdman 5-6). Upon submitting 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> to his publisher, John Murray, Byron confessed “an
                invincible repugnance” of the stage (March 9, 1817, <title level="m">BLJ</title>
                V:185). In a letter to Douglas Kinnaird, he declared that 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is “the very Antipodes of the stage and is meant to be so—it is
                all in the Alps &amp; the other world—and as mad as Bedlam—I do not know that it
                is even fit for publication—the persons are all magicians—ghosts—&amp; the
                evil principle — with a mixed mythology of my own” (March 25, 1817,
                <title level="m"> BLJ</title> V:194-195). </p>
            <p>One week later, Byron wrote again to Kinnaird to offer yet another reason why
                “success on the stage is not to me an object of ambition.” The reason is much like
                the one he borrowed from Milton’s Satan and gave to Manfred: “’Tis better to reign
                in Hell than to serve in Heaven” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, I.254-5;
                III.i.73). Neither success nor failure in serving the fickle audiences of London
                would bring any satisfaction. “Unless I could beat them all—it would be nothing”
                (March 31, 1817, <title level="m">BLJ</title> V:196). At odds with his disclaimers,
                Byron expressed again and again his thoughts on how his plays might be successfully
                performed (Erdman 219-43). The argument whether Byron’s works were to be relegated
                to the sub-genre of “closet drama” is rendered specious and irrelevant by the
                repeated success of the plays when revived on stage following the poet’s death.</p>
            <p>Of Byron’s eight plays, <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> was the only one
                performed during his lifetime, and Byron protested vehemently against that
                performance. In the Preface to the play, he wrote “I have had no view to the stage.”
                As principle reason, he cited his doubt in the competency of an audience to judge
                his work for better or worse: “Were I capable of writing a play which could be
                deemed stage worthy, success would give me no pleasure, and failure great pain. It
                is for this reason that even during the time of being one of the committee of one of
                the theatres, I never made the attempt, and never will” (<title level="m">Poetical
                    Works</title> 407-8). The performance of 
                <title level="m">Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice</title> (Drury Lane, April 25, 1821) featured John
                Cooper in the title role. The aged Doge is first angered by Steno’s taunts about the
                infidelity of his young wife, then enraged by the refusal of the Council to punish
                the perpetrator, and finally driven in frenzy to a conspiracy to overthrow his own
                government. Partly because Robert Elliston, manager at Drury Lane, had cut the
                scenes of the psychological self-torment, and partly because Cooper as an actor was
                incapable of expressing that capacity of an Othello to be his own Iago, the play
                closed after five performances (Murray 195-6). Elliston’s abbreviated version
                stripped away the subtle increments of the Doge’s frustration and infuriation, and
                Cooper’s performance of the character offered few of the attributes of Byronic
                temperament that might excite a gossip-craving audience.</p>
            <p>Several actors, including Edmund Kean (Manning 188-206) and William Charles Macready
                (Barker 342-4), sought to make the most of Byron’s autobiographical presence in the
                Byronic character. Responding to the public celebration of the virtuoso performer,
                actors engaged a rivalry in performing Byronic roles. Needing much more than simply
                enacting the spirit of the Byronic character, the actors had to make it appear as if
                Byron himself were on stage performing that character. Parallel to the double role
                that Byron assigns himself as narrator and character in <title level="m">Childe
                    Harold</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, the doubleness was also
                manifest in the stage performance (Burwick, “Subinsinuation” 98-110). Peter Cochran
                was among the first to give close attention to the staging of Byron’s plays (Cochran
                “Byron and Drury Lane” 1-34, 201-2). To the staging of Byron’s plays must be added
                the stage adaptations of such romances as <title level="m">The Corsair</title> and 
                <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>. Too, the appraisal of a stage Byron
                ought to include the stage adaptations of novels featuring the most notorious
                representations of Byron: Lord Glenarvon Ruthven in Lady Caroline Lamb’s 
                <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (1816) and Lord Ruthven in John Polidori’s 
                <title level="m">The Vampire</title> (1819). William Barrymore’s stage adaptation of
                    <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (Coburg, July 13, 1819) featured Henry Kemble
                as the Byronic Lord Glenarvon. J. Amherst’s version of 
                <title level="m">Glenarvon</title> (Coburg, December 3, 1821) cast H. H. Rowbotham as Ruthven
                Glenarvon. Both Kemble and Rowbotham turned the role into a studied impersonation of
                Lord Byron (Burwick, “Playing” 71-86). James Robinson Planché, in 
                <title level="m">The Vampire</title> (English Opera House, August 9, 1820), brought John Polidori’s
                short story to the stage. He retained the now-familiar sinister name of Lord
                Ruthven, performed as a stage Byron by Thomas Potter Cooke (Burwick, 
                <title level="m">Romantic Drama</title> 230-57). The best of the Byron impersonators
                was Kean, who exercised that ability effectively as Selim in <title level="m">The
                    Bride of Abydos</title> (Drury Lane, February 5, 1818), adapted for the stage by
                William Dimond. When Charles Dibdin, Jr. prepared the staging of 
                <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (Sadler’s Wells, August 1, 1814), he gave Conrad all the poses
                and situations popularly associated with Byron (Burwick and Powell 59-72). </p>
            <p>Given its antecedents, the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title> at Covent
                Garden on October 29, 1834 was anticipated as another stage enactment of Lord Byron
                and his personal scandal (Playbill <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Covent Garden,
                1834). With scenery by Thomas and William Grieve (Grieve Theatre Designs) and music
                by Henry Rowley Bishop (Corder 78-97; Caldwell 179-80), stage-manager Alfred Bunn
                intended a spectacular production of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Denvil would be
                performing as Byron performing as Manfred, or as Kean performing as Byron performing
                as Manfred. Performing before Grieves’ imposing scenery, Denvil confronted the
                challenge of being upstaged magnificently by the stage itself. Several reviews
                appraised Denvil’s performance from the perspective of his audience. Bunn, as
                manager of Covent Garden, communicated the high expectations he had for his young
                tragedian (Bunn 214-7). William Macready’s account expressed cynicism masked as pity
                and the <foreign xml:lang="fr">noblesse oblige</foreign> of an experienced senior actor
                (Macready I:165-6, 187, 269-70). Planché, who had introduced Denvil to Bunn, assumed
                the role of a concerned mentor but also as playwright offering advice on performing
                an unusually challenging text (Planché I:213-4.).</p>
            <p>In spite of delivering with gusto those lines in which Manfred commanded the Chamois
                Hunter, the Witch of the Alps, Astarte, the Abbot of St. Maurice to look upon him,
                Denvil found it difficult to step out of the shadows. Determined to represent a
                reincarnated Byron/Manfred in the grips of a succession of passions, Denvil’s
                efforts were effectively stifled by an artistic exposition of the Byronic sublime in
                which Denvil served only as tour guide. According to one reviewer, the great
                attraction was neither Byron’s poetry nor Denvil’s acting, but rather “the beauty of
                the scenery, its music, and its mechanical and scenic effects, which are equal, if
                not superior, to any thing ever yet seen” (<title level="m">Observer</title>, qtd. in
                Meisel 175). The review continues: “The Messrs. Grieve have exhibited some of the
                most beautiful specimens of their art; the Jungfrau Mountains, the Cataract of the
                Lower Alps, and a Terrace of Manfred’s Castle are exquisite pictures, &amp; the Hall
                of Arimanes, a copy of Martin's Pandemonium was terrifically grand” (Meisel 175).
                The reviewer in the <title level="m">London Literary
                    Gazette</title> objected to the mistake of rendering the spiritual as physical, and
                expecting more of Denvil than the monologue provided. “To avoid the ridiculous was a
                great point, and in that he succeeded” (rpt. in <title level="m">Broadview
                </title>127-8).</p>
            <p>Planché’s main reason for introducing Denvil at Covent Garden was “the old obstacle,
                the want of a singer who could act.” Covent Garden was without “a popular
                melo-dramatic performer,” who could sing (Planché I:214). Although Planché made it
                clear that Denvil was to be reserved for those singing roles in melodrama, “Bunn,
                fancying he had secured a second Edmund Kean, insisted on Denvil making his first
                appearance as Shylock.” Reviewers attacked Denvil for his presumption. Denvil, for
                his own part, knew he was being cast in roles beyond his experience. “He is putting
                me,” were his words, “on a pinnacle to break my neck: but what can I do? I have, for
                weeks past, walked Kensington Gardens without a dinner, in order that my wife and
                little ones should not lose a crumb by me. Mr. Bunn offers me five pounds per week,
                which is affluence to us and salvation! How can I refuse?” (Planché I:214). Denvil
                did his best to fulfil the demanding Shakespearean roles, then at the end of October
                came the rehearsals for the grand spectacle of the season. On the evening of October
                29, Denvil stood alone in the dark. Literally. The playbill forewarned the audience
                that “Chandeliers around the Front of the Boxes will not be used on the Evenings of
                the Performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title>.” The backdrop paintings were
                crucial to Bunn’s production. “In order to produce the necessary effects of Light
                and Shade,” downstage action took place in the shadows. A voice in the shadows, a
                voice in the vastness (as rebuilt in 1809 Covent Garden seated 2,800 with no amplification), 
                Denvil’s Manfred was further constrained
                by a musical score in which Manfred was silenced by the series of solos and
                choruses. Denvil was a strong tenor—as Planché declared, he could sing as well as
                act. Nevertheless, he was given no opportunity to sing in Henry Bishop’s score.</p>
            <p>Denvil was so conscious of performing the character as an incarnation of Byron that
                he seemed to leave him but half resurrected from the tomb. In part that effect was
                owing to the breathy quality of Denvil’s voice. He seemed as much a supernatural
                being as Astarte or any of the characters conjured in the court of Arimanes (Planché
                I:213-5). Denvil rose to the challenge of performing multiple roles in the character
                of Manfred. He was the poet exiled in scandal and returned as a vampire from the
                grave; he was the tormented lover longing for the forgiveness of his lost Astarte;
                he was the defiant apostate fearing neither demons nor death. Singled out for
                special praise was the scene with the Witch of Alps performed by Ellen Tree (Planché
                I:214). </p>
            <p>As Planché explained, Bunn cast Denvil in a succession of demanding roles, as
                Shylock, as Richard III, and as Bertram. Not surprisingly, the critics blamed the
                actor for an overeager ambition:
                <quote>
            The diversity of opinion, not only as to the extent of his abilities, but respecting
                almost every scene of his performance, is, perhaps, scarcely to be equaled in the
                annals of criticism. After three performances with the same result; the conflicting
                evidence of the <title level="m">Times</title>, <title level="m">Herald</title>, 
                    <title level="m">Chronicle</title>, and <title level="m">Morning Post</title> being most
                amusingly summed up by the <title level="m">True Sun</title> in the evening. In these,
                and other characters, he had to endure comparison with Edmund Kean; but in Lord
                Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which was subsequently produced, he had the
                advantage of an original part, and united the suffrages of the critics. (Planché
                I:213-5).</quote>
            But it was not an original part, for Denvil once again was cast in a role in which he
                had to follow Kean as an impersonator of Byron. Denvil was a boy of twelve years
                when Byron left England. As an actor now aged thirty, Denvil knew Byron only at
                second-hand, through the poetry and through the acting of Kean and Macready. From
                neither could he receive any direction or practical counsel.</p>
            <p>When <title level="m">Manfred</title> opened at the end of October, William Macready
                was on tour and performing at Dublin. The audience reception
                remained sufficiently strong throughout the first season to sustain the run for
                thirty-six performances. Macready read the reviews and expressed his opinions in his
                letters to Bunn, who several months earlier had urged Macready to “perform Manfred,
                postponing for that purpose my Dublin engagement.” Macready told Bunn that it would
                be impractical to prepare for Manfred in advance of his visit to Dublin. In his
                diary, however, he recorded his conviction that there was “no chance for the success
                of Manfred—it is . . . not a monodrama, but a monologue; splendid as the poetry
                is, it is not at all dramatic.” Macready had already gained acclaim for bringing to
                the stage both <title level="m">Werner</title> (Drury Lane, December 15, 1830) 
                and <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (Drury Lane, April 10, 1834), roles that he
                would reprise during his Dublin engagement (Macready, 1:165).</p>
            <p>When Bunn engaged Denvil for the 1834-1835 season, Macready watched with interest the
                criticism in the <title level="m">Examiner.</title> From “his repetition of Shylock
                and his announcement to-morrow for Richard III,” John Forster, the respected
                literary reviewer, saw a flaw in Bunn’s confidence in Denvil, “whose exact place in
                the scale of actors he seems unable to determine” (Macready I:187). Based on
                additional reports, Macready’s estimation is similarly reserved: “he has, from what
                I have read of him, a mind above the common theatrical level and the intellectual
                material to furnish forth an artist.” Unable to anticipate the consequences of
                Bunn’s aggressive use of Denvil’s talent, Macready concludes, “What will come of it
                is in the will of other powers” (Macready I:187). A generous review of Denvil’s
                Shakespearean roles prompted Macready to denounce the <title level="m">Times
                </title> as a “base and profligate paper” guilty of “dirty malignity” for praising
                others and ignoring him (Macready I:189).</p>
            <p>Lamenting Denvil’s “brief career and his ill-treatment by Bunn, and melancholy exit
                from the stage of life,” Planché wrote as if Denvil were burdened with hardship and
                failure following his performance as Manfred. “Under a more judicious management”
                than Bunn had offered, Denvil might have been “permanently established in the higher
                position which . . . he had attained.” In spite of Planché’s gloomy pronouncement,
                Denvil fared well in his subsequent career. As soon as the season at Covent Garden
                ended, Denvil accepted an invitation from John Farrell at the Pavilion Theatre to
                perform as Manfred for the week of July 20, 1835. At the Pavilion in 1835, and in
                years following, Denvil’s performances as Manfred were no longer diminished by
                Bishop’s grand score, nor by the imposing scenes of the Grieves. Edward Woolf
                composed the new music, and scenery on a more modest scale was constructed by the
                Gordons, father and son, with sublime vistas by Brunning (Playbill, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Pavilion, 1835).</p>
            <p>In January 1836, Denvil was in Bristol playing Macduff opposite Macready’s Macbeth,
                and Iago opposite Macready’s Othello. In what may have been a warning, Denvil told
                Macready of pitching a fellow actor “from a height of eighteen feet” during a
                performance. Macready also complained of being “very much inconvenienced and
                embarrassed” by Denvil, as Iago, repeatedly upstaging him (Macready I:269-70). In
                addition to one character tormenting the other, the audience witnessed one actor
                tormenting the other. When Bunn ceased casting Macready in leading roles, leaving
                him to play only in an afterpiece, Macready lost his temper, called Bunn a “damned
                scoundrel,” and punched him in the face. Bunn defended himself by biting Macready’s
                little finger (April 29, 1836, Macready I:301-2).</p>
            <p>Denvil accepted an invitation from Park Theatre, New York, where he repeated the
                roles of his first season at Covent Garden, with his “début . . . in October, 1836,
                as Shylock. Which he followed up with Richard III, and Manfred, returning to England
                in 1837” (Adams 392-3). Denvil returned to performing the singing roles in
                melodrama, the roles for which Planché had said he was best suited. On one occasion
                (June 1, 1840) Denvil played the lead in <title level="m">The Pirate of
                    Manfredonia</title>, adapted from Maturin’s <title level="m">Bertram</title>, a role
                that he had played for Bunn during the fall of 1834. As
                evident from his appearances in New York, he had not utterly abandoned the
                Shakespearean roles Bunn had imposed upon him. At the City of London Theatre in 1843
                he appeared again as Shylock in <title level="m">The Merchant of Venice</title>, and
                as Rolla in Sheridan’s <title level="m">Pizarro</title>. </p>
            <p>Jointly with his wife, Alice Matilda, Denvil was managing and performing at the
                Pavilion Theatre in Whitechapel Road during the 1840s. Alice Matilda Denvil not only
                acted but also authored several of their plays, and by 1842 Master Manfred Denvil
                was on stage for the interlude performing a sailor’s hornpipe. On August 21, 1857,
                Charles Kean, lessee of Princess’s Theatre, signed an agreement for the engagement
                of Alice Matilda Denvil (Memorandum, Y.d.380, Folger Library, Manuscript). Planché’s
                reference to Denvil’s “melancholy exit from the stage of life,” suggested a gloomy
                fate for Denvil’s latter career. In spite of financial difficulties Denvil enjoyed a
                period of relative success at the Pavilion.</p>
            <p>Theatre critic Westland Marston began his account of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                by describing not Denvil but Ellen Tree:
                <quote>
            Miss Ellen Tree (whom I then saw for the first time) declaimed the lines allotted to
                the Witch of the Alps, lines which are not only few, but almost devoid of dramatic
                force, serving only to draw out Manfred's long and gloomy retrospect. Nevertheless,
                in her appearance, as she stood within the arch of a rainbow in her garments, which
                seemed woven of aerial colours touched by the sun, and in her voice, the tones of
                which, though sweet, were remote and passionless, she realized all the weird charm
                of a genius of lake and mountain. There was something glacial in her unsubstantial
                loveliness, something that belonged to the forms of sleep rather than those of
                common day. (Marston, 13-4)</quote>
            The scene with the Witch’s declamation, “Son of Earth! I know thee!” also impressed
                Augusta Leigh, who wrote: “Miss Ellen Tree's Witch of the Alps I shall dream of”
                (Marston, 14). Manfred’s lines on Astarte — “She was like me in lineaments, . . .”
                (II.ii.106-18)—Denvil delivered “with an intensity of horror and remorse that no
                actor could well have surpassed” (Marston 15). Marston remarked specifically on
                Denvil’s ability to mould his face to capture the moods of “the haughty and
                mysterious hero of the drama.” Marston was especially impressed by “the look of
                self-recoil” that contorted his face during the pause in saying, “I loved her, —and
                destroyed her!” (II.ii.118). Denvil had some measure of poetic feeling, and
                considerable power of facial expression.
                <quote>
            General praise was accorded to his Manfred . . . his pale, almost spectral face,
                thrown out by his dark garb, and a haughty isolation and melancholy in tone, look,
                and gesture that well conveyed the mingled pride and remorse of one who, though
                racked by the sense of a hidden crime, has won commerce with supernatural beings.
                (Marston 14)</quote>
            In spite of his positive appraisal of Denvil’s acting, Marston is still left with a
                puzzle: “Why an actor should be fairly successful in Richard the Third and Shylock,
                really fine in Manfred, and yet fail totally in Othello, is not at once obvious”
                (Marston 15-6). The fault lay, Marston suggested, in the actor’s failing to separate
                the acting of serious tragedy from that of popular melodrama. Denvil allowed his
                acting to degenerate “into the worst style of provincial rant.” As Manfred he had
                sustained “the ease, refinement, and poetic appreciation and quick insight into
                character and motive.” That higher order of acting was undermined by frequent
                performance in melodrama: “Distorted features, violence of gesture, and strain of
                lung were all the resources left to him” (Marston 15-6).</p>
            <p>Denvil’s impersonation of Byron as Manfred at Covent Garden was accompanied by a
                burlesque at the Strand Theatre ridiculing Bishop’s score, mimicking other
                composers, as fitting accompaniment to Denvil’s mimicking Byron and Kean (Tunbridge
                212-36). Gilbert Abbott à Beckett’s <title level="m">Man-Fred</title> (December 26,
                1834) amused the crowds with Mitchell’s impersonation of Denvil’s impersonation of
                Byron as Manfred (à Beckett ix.6). According to the reviewer in the
                    <title level="m">Times</title>, the best scene in the burlesque involved
                Mitchell’s mimicking “the attitude in which Mr Denvil lately astonished the visitors
                at one of the patent theatres, and in which he is represented in the shop windows”
                (December 27, 1834). That Manfred in Byron’s tragedy was perceived as needing a
                comic counterpart in burlesque is reconfirmed when <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                was revived thirty years later (Drury Lane, October 14, 1863) with Samuel Phelps in
                the lead role as Manfred. No time was lost in bringing forth Manfred’s madcap double
                in Martin Dutnall’s <title level="m">Mad Fred</title> at the Royal Surrey Theatre 
                (<title level="m">Times</title>, November 20, 1863). </p>
            <p>The opening scene in the Grieves’ “Gothic gallery” provided Denvil with a comfortably
                enclosed stage space, and presented the audience with a scene already familiar.
                Billed as “Goethe’s Terrific Drama of <title level="m">Faustus</title>” (Coburg, June
                7, 1824), the partial translations by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe
                Shelley were woven together by Henry M. Milner (Burwick, <title level="a">The 
                <title level="m">Faust</title> Translations</title> 30-42). Better known and more 
                often performed was Marlowe’s <title level="m">Doctor Faustus</title> 
                (1594, published 1604), which also opened with
                a scene of abjuration. “Settle thy studies Faustus,” Marlowe’s character tells
                himself, “and beginne / To sound the depth of that thou wilt professe.” Aristotle’s
                Analytics, Galen’s Medicine, Justinian’s Law, are put aside, for Faustus will now
                devote his mind to mastering necromancy (Marlowe 164, 166). Goethe’s Faust similarly
                dismisses his study of the traditional disciplines—Philosophy, Law, Medicine,
                Theology—as having failed to bring him closer to the knowledge he seeks 
                (<title level="m">Faust</title> ll.354-9). The abjuration scene occurs in other early
                plays. In Robert Greene’s <title level="m">Bacon Friar and Friar Bungay</title>
                (1594), the faculty charges Friar Bacon for having turned to magic, a trespass he
                readily confesses:

                </lg></quote>
            Manfred’s abjuration of philosophy and science is preceded by his declaration of his
                ceaseless watching, a vigil which is a leitmotif in all his subsequent encounters.
                The abjuration of all previous endeavors which “availed not,” is followed by the
                conjuration of the spiritual powers of the universe.
                <quote><lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The lamp must be replenished, but even then</l>

                    <l>To look within . . . (I.i.1-7)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            Manfred’s vigil is a mode of introspection, a constant monitoring of thought and
                feeling. As noted in my opening paragraph, Manfred seeks to enlist into this vigil
                each of those whom he meets in the ensuing scenes. The grandly insistent egocentrism
                in which Manfred commands all others to look on him could not be realized on the
                stage at Covent Garden, certainly not by the relatively inexperienced Denvil,
                probably not by Kean himself. Bunn, after all, had cut much of Manfred’s monologues,
                and had ordered a shadowy stage.</p>
            <p>Left with only pieces of monologue, Denvil’s Manfred was nevertheless able to abjure
                outmoded disciplines with a broad indictment of arcane knowledge. In the Hall of
                Arimanes, the First Destiny declares that Manfred’s aspirations have taught him the
                wisdom of hell: “That knowledge is not happiness” (II.iv.59-62). Recognizing the
                importance of Manfred’s opening monologue in establishing character, Denvil was able
                to lay claim Manfred’s ethical independence in the opening lines when he reframes
                the words of Genesis (2:9, 17) to define the futility and fatality of knowing.
                <quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Sorrow is Knowledge: they who know the most</l> 
            <l>Must mourn the deepest o’er the fatal truth,</l>
            <l>The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life. (I.i.10-2)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            Manfred is less concerned with knowing good and evil as the consequence of eating the
                forbidden fruit, as he is with the revelation of forbidden knowledge. Manfred
                dismisses the three major endeavors of his life: first, the mastery of “Philosophy
                and science, and the springs / Of wonder and wisdom of the world.” Even though his
                mind had the “power to make these subject to itself . . . they avail not.” So too
                the consequences of good works “availed not,” and the ability to vanquish foes with
                military power “availed not.” In this limbo of ineffectuality, there remains no
                moral constancy or stability. “Good, or evil, life, / Power, passions, all I see in
                other beings,” have “since that all-nameless hour” (I.i.13-25) lost their meaning.
                That hour, as Manfred reveals in ensuing scenes, was the hour of Astarte’s
                death.</p>
            <p>The three-part abjuration is followed by three attempts at conjuration: first he
                conjures with a “written charm,” and then by the “sign, / Which makes you tremble.”
                When neither charm nor sign arouse the spirits, he utters a third incantation “By
                the strong curse which is upon my soul” (I.i.28-49). This spell succeeds, calling
                forth the spirits (I.i.50-131), whose respective songs are accompanied by full
                orchestra. The spirits of the four elements sing in succession. Air descends from
                the cloud, Earth from the mountain, Fire from the volcano, and Water from “the blue
                depth.” Then come the three powers: “the rider of the wind,” the “stirrer of the
                storm,” “the shadow of the night.” Next would come light, “The star which rules thy
                destiny,” but Bunn has omitted the role of the seventh spirit, who has no song, no
                lines, no place among the <foreign xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</foreign>. Instead, Bunn’s
                score moves directly into the chorus, where all seven are listed: “Earth, ocean,
                air, night, mountains, winds, thy star, / Are at thy beck and bidding” (I.i.132-3).
                To Manfred’s request for “forgetfulness,” the spirits reply that they “can but give
                thee that which we possess.” The forgetfulness that Manfred desires is an end to his
                unrelenting vigil, the image of “that which is most within me” (I.i.137). When he
                then calls upon the spirits to assume some form that he may behold them, the
                otherwise absent seventh spirit, played by Miss Clifton, appears and disappears in
                the form of Astarte:
                <quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Oh God! if it be thus, and <emph>thou</emph></l>
            <l>Art not a madness and a mockery,</l>
            <l>I might yet be most happy, I will clasp thee,</l>
            <l>And we again will be— [<emph>The figure vanishes</emph>.] (I.i.189-92)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            Manfred faints, and a voice recites an incantational curse, “I compel / Thyself to be
                thy proper hell!” (I.i.250-2). Bishop’s songs for the spirits were fully adequate to
                overpower Manfred. </p>
            <p>In Act I, scene ii of Bunn’s production Manfred is transported to “A Wild Rocky
                Pass,” where Denvil lies on the scaffolding while the spirits sing their
                incantation, “When the moon is on the wave, And the glow-worm in the grass”
                (I.i.193-4). In the original text, the incantation continued for sixty-nine lines.
                Bishop has reduced the song to the first two ten-line strophes. When Manfred awakens
                from the trance, he must acknowledge the inefficacy of his conjuration.
                <quote><lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The spirits I have raised abandon me, </l>

                    <l>The remedy I recked of tortured me. (I.ii.1-3)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            They too have “avail’d not.” Worse, he has been taunted by the phantom of Astarte. </p>
            <p>In the next scene (I.iii in Bunn’s production), the dimensions of the Grieves’
                settings become evident. Denvil is poised on the concealed scaffolding half way up
                the face of “the Mountain of the Jungfrau,” sufficiently high above the stage to
                lend credibility to his reflections on a suicidal leap. The Chamois Hunter was
                played by John Cooper, who thirteen years earlier was “the young actor doubly
                damned” by Byron for his performance in the title role of <title level="m">Marino
                    Faliero</title> (Bunn 154). As a transition to the scene with the Witch of the
                Alps, Denvil must again fall into a trance as Bishop introduces two more ten-line
                strophes from the Invocation, now adapted as a Malediction, “And a magic voice and
                verse / Hath baptized thee with a curse” (I.i.223-32, 253-62).</p>
            <p>Cutting the dialogue and rearranging the scenes, Bunn explained, was necessary to
                take advantage of Byron’s “vast contribution of the ‘marvellous’ and the
                ‘improbable’.” “By favoring us with little plot, little action, and few characters,”
                Bunn further argued, “the noble poet did his utmost to render his progeny unfit for
                representation.” By condensing the text, and enhancing the performance with grand
                set designs and appropriate music, Bunn was able to overcome the presumed dramatic
                deficiency. The resulting production “was eminently successful — applauded by a
                crammed auditory, lauded, with but one exception, by the press” (Bunn 215). That
                “one exception” was the reviewer in the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle
                </title>(October 30, 1834). </p>
            <p>Denvil was dwarfed by the grand backdrops painted by the Grieves, and the reviewer of
                the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> said so. Bunn expressed his anger over
                this review in his correspondence with J. P. Collier, proprietor of the 
                <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title>. Bunn accused Collier’s newspaper with
                having “belaboured the production of Manfred (as it had done all the preceding
                efforts of the season) unmercifully.” Among the “preceding efforts,” Bunn referred
                particularly to the vilification of Joseph and Mary Anne Wood 
                (<title level="m">Memoir</title> 15-8), whom Bunn had engaged for their performance in Rossini’s 
                <title level="m">Cinderella</title> (Covent Garden, October 1834). Bunn made it clear
                that he blamed the “theatrical reporter, and believed by me to be my theatrical
                opponent.” He wrote,
                <quote>
            My complaint to the Proprietor of the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> did
                not refer to <title level="m">Manfred</title> alone, but to the tissue of falsehood
                and nonsense which has appeared about <title level="m">Cinderella</title> and other
                pieces from time to time in that paper, and which has rendered it, in that
                particular department, the ridicule of all its readers. (Bunn 217)
                </quote>
            As described by the reviewer, Denvil was hindered in standing forth prominently as an
                empowered protagonist, but appeared rather as “little more than the showman of a
                series of splendid scenes painted by the GRIEVES; and as the
                house was kept in darkness, the effect was quite dioramic” (October 30, 1834). Other
                reviews had been more positive, but the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title> was
                not alone in objecting to Denvil having to deliver abbreviated passages on a
                darkened stage. Henry Crabb Robinson, noting that Denvil had been deprived of the
                best of Manfred’s monologues, wrote that the production afforded no “pleasure except
                from the splendid scenery.” For that reason, “it should be called a show in which
                grand pictures are explained by words” (Robinson 145).</p>
            <p>Surviving in the performance script were Manfred’s lines repeating Satan’s
                declaration in <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> (1664) that “The mind is its own
                place, and it itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven” 
                (<title level="m">PL</title> I.254-5), lines already echoed in the incantation,
                “Thyself to be thy proper hell!” In the scenes with the Chamois Hunter, Byron
                defines the Swiss sense of liberty with allusions to Wilhelm Tell (Giddey 179-90;
                Piccitto 168-82). For the scene with the Witch of the Alps Byron drew from the
                legend of Tannhäuser, the celebrated medieval minnesinger who was captivated by the
                Venus of the Mountain (Grimm 246-7). For the scene in the Hall of Arimanes Byron may
                again have drawn from Milton’s description of Satan with the fallen angels in
                Pandemonium, but Milton introduced no mortal interloper defying Satan’s reign.</p>
            <p>Until Bunn decided to trim the monologues, half the lines in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> belonged to Manfred himself. The other characters, including
                Astarte, had no abiding presence in the plot, appear only in one or two scenes, and
                function to reveal aspects of Manfred’s character. Each scene thus functioned
                separately from the others, a division that was rendered more emphatic by the
                gallery-like exhibition of the massive canvases painted by the Greives. The
                Chamois-Hunter, living at one with the sublimity of Alpine nature, represents the
                Swiss spirit liberty and independence and the ethos of patience in adversity. At a
                distance he perceives in Manfred one who is “Proud as a free-born peasant,” but on
                closer approach recognizes a “madman” about to leap from the cliff. Aggressive
                intervention is necessary to halt the suicidal leap of Manfred, whom the
                Chamois-Hunter seizes with the chastising words, “Stain not our pure vales with thy
                guilty blood” (I.ii.111). Manfred confesses, as he will again and again, the origin
                of that guilt:
                <quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l rendition="#indent1"> . . . my blood! the pure warm stream</l> 
                <l>Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours</l>
                <l>When we were in our youth, and had one heart,</l>
                <l>And loved each other as we should not love,</l>
                <l>And this was shed: but still it rises up, </l>
                <l>Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from Heaven,</l> 
                <l>Where thou art not---and I shall never be. (II.i.24-30)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            Recognizing Manfred as the victim of “some half-maddening sin,” the Chamois-Hunter
                urges him to exercise “heavenly patience.” When Manfred scorns the advice as useful
                only for “brutes of burden,” the Chamois-Hunter replies that he would not share
                Manfred’s order “for the free fame / Of William Tell,” and whatever his sin, “it
                must be borne, and these wild starts are useless” (II.i.31-41). “Look on me,”
                Manfred answers. He bears his pain by maintaining his vigil, and watching his own
                thoughts, “I look within.” (II.i.42, 72). </p>
            <p>Confessing his fatal embrace and the injuries that befell those who loved him
                (I.i.84-7), Manfred departs from the Chamois Hunter and descends to the foot of an
                Alpine waterfall. Beneath the sunbow hovering in the mists of the cataract arises
                the Witch of the Alps, to whom he again confesses the loss of Astarte, and from whom
                he once more requests forgetfulness. John Martin’s
                    painting, <title level="m">Manfred and the Witch of the Alps</title> (1837),
                is a painting of a painting, preserving the appearance of Denvil and Ellen Tree in
                the scene painted by the Grieves. In relating his love for Astarte, Manfred reveals
                a narcissistic fascination with the mirrored image he perceives in the traits and
                features of his female companion. Astarte, Manfred declares, “was like me in
                lineaments—her eyes, / Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone / Even of her
                voice . . . were like to mine.” She had the “same lone thoughts and wanderings, /
                The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind / To comprehend the universe”
                (II.ii.105-11). This most harmonious of all possible heterosexual relationships is
                undermined by cultural taboos and familial or social opposition: “I loved her, and
                destroy’d her! / Not with my hand, but heart—which broke her heart”
                (II.ii.111-21).</p>
            <p>The rumored incest seemed to be confirmed in <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (published June 16, 1817) in the implied incestuous relationship between the Count
                and Astarte (Glass 211-26). The titillating gossip was repeatedly revived. Just as
                    <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                attracted attention for their presumed autobiographical revelations, the character
                of Manfred was deemed to be a thinly disguised dramatization of a forbidden love
                between Byron and his half-sister. </p>
            <p>Reiterating his need for spectator participation in his suffering, Manfred tells the
                Witch of the Alps to “look on me in my sleep, / Or watch my watching”
                (II.ii.129-30). She assures him that she can secure the forgetfulness that he
                desires, but it will require “obedience to my will” and a surrender to her bidding.
                Manfred scorns the offer. In his soliloquy that closes the scene, Manfred declares
                his intention to call the dead, as David had the Witch of Endor summon the ghost of
                Samuel or Pausanias had his priests call the spirit of Cleonice so that he could ask
                her forgiveness. The reviewer for the <title level="m">Observer</title> (November 2,
                1834) wrote that Denvil lost his dramatic leverage in these scenes. Instead of the
                living interrogating the spirits, Denvil presented the dead shuffling among the
                dead. In the brief scene on the summit of the Jungfrau Mountain, the Destinies and
                Nemesis anticipate the night of “our great festival” (II.iii.15), an event that
                suggests a parallel to the Walpurgis Night in Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>
                (Chew 174-8). Nemesis was played by Miss Taylor, who had previously performed as
                Rebecca in Thomas John Dibdin’s <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> and as Zapolya, in
                Dibdin’s adaptation of Coleridge’s play. Tree’s best moment was her dynamic speech,
                “Son of Earth! I know thee.” Following Denvil’s moving rendition of the monologue,
                “We are fools of time and terror” (II.ii.165), the scene closed with “The Witches
                Carnival,” in which Bishop developed Byron’s lyric as a Walpurgis-like revel.</p>
            <p>Bishop was ingenious in rescuing the song from the canceled version of Act III and
                placing it at the end of the scene with the Witch of the Alps. The comic grotesque
                of Byron’s lyrics and Bishop’s melodic shifts effectively prepare for the arrival at
                the Hall of Arimanes, yet it is also worthwhile to recall the satirical charge of
                the original context. In the first version, Byron exposes the Abbot’s piety as a
                mask for greed. “Charity, most reverend father,” Manfred tells him, “Becomes thy
                lips so much more than this menace.” The Abbot promises to refrain from malediction,
                unless Manfred “dost not all devote thyself / To penance, and with gift of all thy
                lands / To the Monastery.” In response, Manfred offers a gift
                to the Abbot—a demonic jack-in-the box. “There is a gift for thee within this
                casket,” he says, and opening it, out pops the demon Ashtaroth, singing the song of
                the raven and the Witches’ Carnival.

            Peter Cochran argued this discarded song was “the one detail of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> lifted directly from <title level="m">Faust</title>.” 
                (Cochran, <title level="m">Manfred</title> n36). Ben Hewitt analyzes the textual parallels:
                first the brief scene (<title level="m">Faust</title> 4399-404) in which Faust asks
                what is occurring at the raven stone (<emph>Rabenstein</emph>, a gallows),
                and Mephistopheles answers that a witches coven has gathered, but he know not what
                they cook and brew; and second the “raging magic song” (<foreign xml:lang="de">wütender
                    Zaubergesang</foreign>) sung by the witches who have gathered for their demonic orgy
                on Walpurgis Night (<title level="m">Faust</title> 3958-4015). Hewitt also observes
                that Byron “echoes Goethe’s use of quatrains” (83-4). The significant difference is
                that Ashteroth’s song is in tetrameters, combining iambs and anapests and a
                scattering of internal rhymes (as in: “The fetters creak—and his ebon beak”). The
                pecking beat of the first ten line gives way to the rhythmic dance of the latter ten
                lines.</p>
            <p>The realm of evil into which Manfred intrudes, as already noted, borrows indirectly
                from Milton’s Pandemonium. As observed by two reviewers (<title level="m">Times
                </title>and <title level="m">Morning Chronicle,</title> October 30, 1834), the setting
                replicates John Martin’s <title level="m">Satan Presiding at the Infernal
                  Council</title> (1823-27). Martin’s later version, 
                    <title level="m">Pandemonium</title> (1841), bears the influence of the Grieves. The emphasis is
                rather on the bold defiance of the presumed sovereignty of Arimanes. Manfred, like
                Prometheus defying Jupiter, refuses to “Bow down and worship” (II.iv.29-49).
                Arimanes, who speaks but one word, grants the request to call up the dead. Nemesis
                calls forth the spirit of Astarte. “Look on me,” he tells her, but thrice repeats
                his more urgent plea, “Speak to me!” (II.iv.117-50). Like Pausanias calling the
                spirit of Cleonice, Manfred wants Astarte’s forgiveness, and like Cleonice, Astarte
                replies with the revelation of his impending death. Thrice she utters his name;
                thrice she bids him farewell. Her sole message: “Tomorrow ends thine earthly ills”
                (II.iv.150-7). In the songs of Nemesis, the Destinies, and the Spirits (II.iii and
                iv), Bishop sought to fulfill his operatic aspirations with compositional hints of
                the aria sung by the Queen of the Night in Mozart’s <title level="m">Die
                    Zauberflöte</title>.</p>
            <p>Byron adhered to the three-act format that distinguished melodrama from the
                traditional five-act structure of comedy and tragedy. Bishop further reduced the
                structure by combining Acts II and III. Act I, scene v presented Manfred’s
                reflection on the <emph>kalon</emph> as transitory illusion. He is visited
                by the Abbot of St. Maurice, who comes to save Manfred’s soul. This is a very
                different Abbot than the one in the manuscript version who represented the
                corruption of the Catholic Church. As staged at Covent Garden in 1834, the Abbot was
                played by James Prescott Warde, known for his role as Cassius in Shakespeare’s 
                <title level="m">Julius Caesar</title> and as Mortimer in <title level="m">The Iron
                    Chest</title>, adapted from William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                by George Colman the Younger. This revised Abbot is free of greed and corruption but
                still constrained by dogma. Manfred tells him that there is no charm in prayer, no
                purification in penitence. As Milton’s Satan declared, the mind can “make a hell of
                heaven.” His fate, Manfred insists, is a matter exclusively between himself and
                heaven, and he wants neither church nor priest as his mediator. To behold one who
                has aged more than a mortal life time, he instructs the Abbot, “Look on me!” And to
                observe one who has experienced a full range of the maladies of fate. “Look on me!”
                (III.i.138, 149). </p>
            <p>In the next short scene, Manfred watches the sinking sun and declares himself ready
                to follow. Then in the third scene, the servants Herbert and Manuel recall former
                days --Manfred’s youth and his devotion to Astarte:
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
            <l>The sole companion of his wanderings</l>

                 </quote>
            The word “sister” remains, as it does throughout the play, unspoken.</p>
            <p>In the final scene, the Abbot returns, but again his offer of prayer is spurned. When
                the spirits come to claim Manfred’s immortal soul, the Abbot makes a futile effort
                to exorcise them. Manfred, however, rejects their claim. His power, he tells them,
                “Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,” rather by his own “length of watching,
                strength of mind, and skill” (III.iv.114-6). “Back to thy hell!” he commands them,
                “Thou hast no power upon me.” Just as he rejected the mediation of church and
                priest, he denies the claims of hell’s minions. The declaration of Milton’s Satan
                that “The mind is its own place, and it itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell
                of Heaven” (<title level="m">PL</title>I.254-5), as I have previously observed, has
                already been echoed in the lines, “I call upon thee! and compel / Thyself to be thy
                proper hell!” (I.i.252), and again in the lines, “The innate tortures of that deep
                Despair, / Which is Remorse without the fear of hell, / But all in all sufficient to
                itself / Would make a hell of Heaven (III.i.70-3). The words of Milton’s Satan are
                repeated for the third time:
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
            <l>The Mind which is immortal makes itself</l> 
            <l>Requital for its good or evil thoughts,—</l>
            <l>Is its own origin of ill and end---</l> 
            <l>And its own place and time—(III.iv.129-32)</l>
                    </lg>
                </quote>
            The demons are driven off. The Abbot remains at Manfred’s side, still urging him to a
                final prayer. Instead, Manfred bids farewell with a simple statement: “Old man! ’tis
                not so difficult to die.” (III.iv.151).</p>
            <p>Although Manfred declares himself ready to kneel with Arimanes to “The overruling
                Infinite—the Maker” (II.iv.48), and the Abbot expresses his faith in Heaven, Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers no further confirmation of a divine
                paradise. The existence of Hell is sustained by the reign of Arimanes and by the
                demons who seek to take possession of Manfred’s soul. From beginning to end the play
                never questions a spiritual afterlife. With the song of the Witch’s Carnival revived
                and reinserted at the end of the scene with the Witch of the Alps, Bishop recognized
                that another song was needed for the finale following Manfred’s death.</p>
            <p>Following the witches’ song at the end of Act I, Bunn’s altered Act II opens with the
                Manfred atop the Jungfrau, where the spirits and destinies sing prior to Manfred
                entrance into the Hall of Arimanes. The spirits’ song of “The Captive Usurper” was
                the most political of the play, and its account of the fall and resurrection of
                Napoleon had a powerful resonance when Manfred was published in 1817.

            At the time of the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834, Napoleon
                was no longer himself a threat. The possibility that, having escaped from Elbe, he
                might escape again from St. Helena no longer existed. He died in 1821. But a
                Napoleonic legacy still prevailed, and the added song predicts a second return to
                power. With the evocation of the “July Monarchy” of France in 1830, that prediction
                was not entirely false. In 1834 a spirit of resistance persisted. Byron had not
                anticipated the need for a second song calling for a second revolt against
                monarchical greed, but Bunn’s production needed a reaffirmation of political unrest.
                In <title level="m">The Giaour</title> Bishop found the lyrics for his concluding chorus.
                Manfred utters his last words, “Old man! ’tis not so difficult to die.” The Abbot
                declares that “his soul hath ta’en its earthless flight.” Then Ashtaroth, who sang
                the song of the raven and witches in the deleted Act III, is reinstated to lead the
                spirits, witches, and destinies in the Finale. The Grieves had prepared the scene
                for an Alpine avalanche, and Bishop introduced the song with the booming roar of
                percussion to evoke the “Glaciers of the Upper Alps, partly borne down by a Violent
                Thunder Storm” (<title level="m">Programme</title> 12):

            During the previous year, F. Sutton played the island
                    dweller Attoo, who led the native resistance against the mutineers in
                Richard Brinsley Peake’s <title level="m">Neuha's Cave; or, The South Sea
                    Mutineers</title> (Adelphi, April 8, 1833-April 23,1833).
                    For Bunn that was experience enough to cast Sutton as the rebel spirit
                    Astheroth. In political keeping with the song on Napoleon’s captivity, the lines from 
                <title level="m">The Giaour</title> provided a finale that in 1834 might well be
                perceived as a response to events in France following the
                    July Revolution of 1830 and the new
                    Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Starting with the overthrow of the conservative government
                    of Charles X and the House of Bourbon, this was supposed to be a liberal constitutional
                    monarchy under Louis Philippe I. Calling himself King of the French, rather than King 
                    of France, he proclaimed himself a
                    populist and leader of the people’s party. He promised to follow the 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">juste milieu</foreign>, the
                    middle way between radical liberalism and arch-conservatism, the stream and the
                    ocean. It soon became clear, however, that his government was supported by
                    wealthy bourgeoisie and many of those who had been
                    prominent in the conservative court of Charles X. The prophecy of a re-emergence
                    of a “Captive Usurper” is realized when the stream and Ocean greet, / With 
                    waves that madden as they meet.” The “groan of war,” as the song predicts, would be heard again
                    in the revolution of 1848.</p>
            <p>The supernatural scenes dealt with an order of demonic spiritualism that had little
                in common with the ghosts and demons in the Gothic melodrama of the times. The
                visual dominance of the paintings may have been at fault, but so too was Denvil’s
                Manfred as a resuscitated Byron, an entity of a physical afterlife. Bishop’s music
                may have been more disruptive than conducive to the competing notions of time.
                Seventeen years after it was written, ten years after the poet’s death, Bunn’s
                production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was self-disrupting, omitting much of
                the dialogue crucial to developing Manfred’s character 
                (<title level="m">Programme</title>).</p>
            <p>Bishop’s music may have complemented, or even enhanced, the sublime settings by the
                Grieves, but they also created obstacles for Denvil’s role. Byron’s Manfred
                challenged the eternal time of heaven, hell, and mythic realms as well as the
                personal time of suffering or merciful forgetting. Bunn’s production further
                required that the actor conjure the phantom of the poet in a sequence of moods and
                tempers. Neither Bunn, nor the Grieves, nor Bishop made Denvil’s task easier. In
                spite of Planché’s dire pronouncement of Denvil’s “melancholy exit from the stage of
