            <p rend="noCount">Drawing on three collaborations between New York
                    City’s Red Bull Theater and the New York University Department of English—the
                    staging of Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), Percy Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), and Lord Byron’s 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017)—I argue that Romantic closet plays
                    can benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a staged reading
                    by professional actors and directors. I contend that this type of performance
                    offers what I call a happy medium: a compromise between a full staging and a
                    private reading, which is suitable to the needs of this particular genre of
                    minimal dramatic action, heightened poetic language, and metaphysical or
                    “mental” subject matter. As a happy medium, the staged reading blurs the rigid
                    binary between the stageable and the unstageable, permitting a means of bringing
                    to performative light works typically limited to solitary or classroom reading
                    practices. In addition, this type of performance provides a heuristic through
                    which to explore the theatricality of these works, thereby carving out a new
                    interpretive space for expanding our critical discourse on Romantic drama,
                    theater, and performance.</p>

            <p>Despite Lord Byron’s claim that he “rendered [<title level="m">Manfred</title>] 
                quite impossible for the stage,” his
                    “dramatic poem” is actually a work that contains dramaturgically rich scenes 
                    (<title level="m">BLJ</title> IV:52-5). Among these is the exchange between
                    Manfred and the Chamois Hunter on the Jungfrau, which includes the moment that
                    Manfred’s plans to plunge to his death are thwarted by the hunter who restrains
                    him. The second act, in particular, offers most of the play’s theatricalizing
                    potential with the rapid, intense exchanges between Manfred and the spirits in
                    the Hall of Arimanes, the collective chanting that occurs during its
                    introductory hymn, and the mysterious, climactic dialogue between Manfred and
                    the Phantom of Astarte. The play closes with the appearance of the haunting
                    “infernal god” who brings Manfred presumably upon his death to the nether
                    regions from where the spirit originated (III.iv.63). Such portrayals suggest
                    that Byron invested his drama with scenes that invited theatrical
                    presentation.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the play presents
                    dramaturgical challenges. It contains several extended soliloquies, many of
                    which reveal Manfred’s private thoughts through elevated and often dense poetic
                    language. Such lengthy monologues take up far more of the play than any of its
                    dramatic action. The play’s unusual narrative sequence poses yet another
                    challenge, as <title level="m">Manfred</title> lacks a traditional plot scheme of clear
                    exposition and rising action. The classic elements of tragedy, such as agnorisis
                    and peripeteia, have already happened, and therefore Byron denies the audience
                    the conventional experience of catharsis. For these and other reasons, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is typically considered an unstageable play.
                    Byron even proposed that his work was “of a very wild—metaphysical—and
                    inexplicable kind” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:169-70); Byron later used the term
                “metaphysical” to describe his experimental drama, <title level="m">Cain</title> (1821).
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> was part of a genre that Byron called “mental
                    theatre,” a term for a special class of poetry that, as Alan Richardson has
                    contended, became a dominant mode of writing among many Romantic writers
                    (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VIII:186-7).<note place="foot" resp="author">See
                    Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">A Mental Theater: Poetic Drama and
                    Consciousness in the Romantic Age</title> (University Park:
                    Pennsylvania State University Press, 1988).</note> The play was seemingly intended for the
                    theater of Manfred’s mind, as it were, rather than the actual stages of
                    prominent London theaters such as Covent Garden or Drury Lane.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Frederick Burwick’s essay in this volume, <title level="a">Staging 
                                <title level="m">Manfred</title>,</title> examines Alfred Bunn’s 1834 production of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> at Covent Garden.</note></p>
                <p>In this essay, I wish to propose that, despite
                    its limited performance history since its publication 200 years ago, 
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> can be staged successfully. A case in point is
                    Red Bull Theater’s <ref target="http://www.redbulltheater.com/manfred">April 2017 
                    staging</ref> of the drama in New York City. What made this
                    production “playable” is owed in part to the atypical nature of the performance
                    method employed. It was not a full-on staging of elaborate sets; there were no
                    displays of intricately tailored costumes or arrangements of professional
                    lighting and musical ensembles. Neither was the play experienced as a silent,
                    private, individual reading of text. Instead, the performance was a hybrid
                    experience, a mixed theatrical event that wed the page to the stage. On the
                    bicentenary of its original publication, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                    was performed on the NYC stage by bringing the printed text together with trained
                    actors who dramatically read its lines aloud from scripts. This was achieved
                    through the rare collaboration between a professional director, professional
                    actors, and literary scholars, who served as resident dramaturges during
                    rehearsals.</p>
            <p>In what follows, I draw on three collaborations
                    between NYC’s Red Bull Theater and the NYU Department of English—Lord Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus 
                        Unbound</title> (2013) and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                (2017)—to argue that these ostensibly
                    unplayable Romantic dramas, which have typically been referred to as closet
                    plays, can indeed benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a
                    staged reading specifically implemented by professional actors and directors. I
                    contend that this type of performance provides a “happy medium”: a compromise
                    between a full staging (with set designs, costumes, elaborate lighting, and
                    rehearsed movements and gestures) and a private reading, which is suitable to
                    the needs of this particular genre of minimal dramatic action, heightened poetic
                    language, and metaphysical or “mental” subject matter. As a happy medium, the
                    staged reading collapses the binary between the stageable and the unstageable,
                    permitting such works typically limited to solitary or classroom reading
                    practices to become performances in their own right. Moreover, it provides a
                    heuristic through which to explore the theatricality of these works, thereby
                    carving out a new interpretive space for expanding our critical discourse on
                    Romantic drama, theater, and performance. </p>

            <p>I will begin by briefly contextualizing the history of these scholarly-artistic
                    collaborations. In the Fall of 2011, a couple of my colleagues and I sought out
                    Red Bull Theater to co-produce a fully-staged performance of Lord Byron’s
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>.<note place="foot" resp="author">I owe enormous debt to Randie
                            Sessler and Veronica Goosey, who joined me on this endeavor in its early
                            phases and have remained invaluable interlocutors on the subject.
                            Without them, neither this collaborative project nor this essay would
                            have been possible. I also wish to thank the Department of English at
                            New York University for generously co-funding this initiative over the
                            years.</note> We wished to
                    reexamine the theatrical potential of period plays by conducting a type of
                    research outside of the academy beyond
                    what a classroom or library could offer. This aspiration drew on the work
                of scholars such as Frederick Burwick, Jerome McGann, and Murray Biggs who had
                overseen stagings of these plays over the decades.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                Scholars have previously turned to the stage to examine questions of
                        “performability,” especially for period plays with little or no performance
                        history. For example, Jerome McGann’s theater group, <title level="m">Cain’s
                            Company</title>, brought Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title> and 
                    <title level="m">Heaven and Hell</title> to the theater in the 1960s. Murray
                        Biggs’s 1988 production of Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Borderers</title>
                    gave the poet’s only drama a performance history. His later production
                        of Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> at Yale University in March
                        1990 for an international conference on Romantic drama gave Byron’s play a
                        long overdue revival among literary scholars. In 2000, Charles Rzepka
                        produced two performances of <title level="m">Obi; or Three-Finger'd
                            Jack</title> at Playwrights Theater at Boston University in July and at the
                        conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism
                        (NASSR) in August at the University of Arizona. Rzepka’s NASSR production
                        marked the first of what has now become a tradition of staging Romantic
                        dramas at these conferences; this performance was directed by Jerrold Hogle.
                        Furthermore, Frederick Burwick has also directed a number of Romantic plays,
                        including works by Hannah Cowley, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Joanna Baillie. In
                        2001, he directed a production of Thomas Beddoes’s <title level="m">Death’s
                            Jest Book</title> whose adapted script was created by Jerome McGann and was
                        performed at the NASSR conference, as well. Finally, it should be noted that
                        readings of plays have occurred at many literary scholarly conferences, as
                        well, including at the NASSR and the Wordsworth Summer Conferences. A
                        reading of Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title>, for instance, took place
                        at the 2010 NASSR conference, <title level="m">Romantic Mediations</title>.</note> 
                We reached out to Red Bull Theater
                because they expressed interest in the “rediscovery of neglected classics” (Red Bull
                Theater). The fact that these plays had been so rarely performed attracted the Red
                Bull team to this project; they were also intrigued by the kind of critical debates
                that these plays fostered. </p>
            <p>Rather than investing in full productions, however, they proposed co-producing staged
                readings as part of the company’s Obie award-winning Revelation Reading Series.
                According to their website, Red Bull’s series provided “a unique opportunity to hear
                these plays performed by many of the finest actors in New York” (Red Bull Theater).
                Through this option, actors do not memorize their lines but rather use music stands
                to read aloud from scripts. Though I was disappointed by the less ambitious option,
                the viability of this low-risk and low-budget alternative was not simply pragmatic,
                as the cost of hiring professional actors for a full production would have been
                challenging to fund. This decision also led to the fortuitous discovery of an
                alternate and promising medium for interpreting these plays. Throughout the
                five-year relationship, we co-produced five dramas: Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                (2012), Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), Joanna Baillie’s 
                <title level="m">De Montfort</title> (2014), Frances Burney’s <title level="m">The Woman Hater</title>
                (2015), and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017).</p>

            <p>The staging of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> in 2012 launched the collaboration
                with Red Bull by bringing one of Byron’s dramas to 42nd Street
                for the first time. The rehearsal and performance of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> 
                took place on November 12, 2012, at the Peter Jay Sharp
                Theater. Though this play is not typically considered unstageable, its limited performance history made it an appropriate choice for our co-production.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Jeffrey Cox and Michael Gamer have commented on the performance history of 
                    <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>: “<title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> 
                    apparently had its first performance in
                        Brussels in January 1834. It opened in London in a production by Macready at
                        Drury Lane on 10 April 1834. With fine sets and great scenic effects, the
                        play was a success, running for twenty-three nights. Drawing upon recent
                        excavations in Nineveh and Babylon for his settings, Charles Kean revived
                        the play in 1853 in a production that achieved ninety-three performances in
                        two seasons; another production in 1875 was performed more than two thousand
                        times across England within two years” (Cox and Gamer 262).</note> In
                this section, I will briefly discuss how this first experience laid the groundwork
                for the collaborations that ensued.</p>
            <p>During the five-hour rehearsal, which took place immediately before the performance,
                my colleagues and I were introduced to the theater team as literature researchers,
                and we expected to play a minor background role. As rehearsals progressed, however,
                the actors and director relied increasingly on us, instead of one of their own
                in-house professional dramaturges, for textual expertise. The Red Bull actors and
                director sought us out for contextual knowledge about the plays, including
                information about Byron’s biography and what they suspected might be its pivotal
                relation to the play’s content and themes; they also inquired about 
                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s reception history and about general background
                on the time period in which Byron wrote it. When we told them about Byron composing
                the play from Italy while in self-imposed exile, the actor playing King
                Sardanapalus, Amir Arison, drew connections between Byron’s biography and
                Sardanapalus’s lines on feeling alienated and “misplaced upon the throne—misplaced
                in life” (IV.332). Encouraged by their engagement with the text, we made some
                connections explicit for the team of actors. This included explaining the links
                between Byron’s philhellenism and his counter-imperialist leanings; this is made
                particularly evident, we stressed, through Byron’s choice in making the king’s lover
                a Greek (Myrrha) and slave to a despotic imperial state. We also pointed out that
                the play’s backdrop of the imminent collapse of the Assyrian Empire could be read as
                Byron’s commentary on the Ottoman Empire or perhaps what he saw as the future of the
                British Empire. In addition to seeking historical information from us, the cast and
                director turned to us for textual clarifications. This included paraphrases of
                complicated lines, along with proper pronunciations of names (such as Pania,
                Beleses, and Semiramis), places (such as Nineveh and Chaldea), or unfamiliar terms
                (such as <emph>satrap</emph>). During breaks, <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s 
                    director, Gaye Taylor Upchurch, sought our approval for
                some of her dramaturgical decisions. Even though she was the expert in that space,
                she and the rest of the team placed significant value on our opinions. </p>
            <p>While sharing our knowledge with the actors and director, we conducted a form of
                ethnography that included observing the theater team’s impressions of and reactions
                to the text. First and foremost, Upchurch explained to us that, in order for 
                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> to succeed on stage, it had to be cut.<note place="foot" resp="author">It was no secret to
                            Upchurch and Red Bull’s directors that we initially resisted removing
                            any lines at all out of integrity and for our research purposes of
                            determining the theatricality of these plays based on how they were
                            created. In his 1990 production of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>
                            at Yale, Biggs also noted that “cutting [the text] was essential in
                            order to fit the play into the two-and-a-half hours beyond which a
                            student performance is apt to become intolerable. The 2833 lines of the
                            original were trimmed to 2128, but by a process of surreptitious
                            thinning rather than lopsided and visible excision. No cuts were made,
                            moreover, except by trial and error some way into rehearsal. The lines
                            least playable (by our cast) were the ones to go, but only after they
                            had entered fully into the company’s awareness of the author’s complete
                            undertaking” (Biggs, <title level="a">Notes on Performing 
                            <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title></title> 379.).</note> Several of the actors,
                including Arison, expressed similar concerns about adapting the play’s lengthy,
                unwieldy verse passages for the stage. Upchurch eliminated what she classified as
                extended poetic descriptions and unnecessary repetitions that she thought stalled
                the play’s dramatic momentum. Upchurch also informed us that her priority was to
                keep the audience’s attention through a reasonable performance time. In the process,
                she hoped to deliver a clear plot sequence, while cutting down on passages of dense,
                allusive verse. See Figure 1 for a sample of such edits, displaying two of
                Upchurch’s major line cuts from Act IV in which King Sardanapalus recounts his
                stirring dream to Myrrha:
            <figure n="1">
                    <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/miranda-image1Thumb.png"/>
                <figDesc>Sample of cuts made by Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch</figDesc>
                </figure>
            In the first major cut on the left, Myrrha’s speech is truncated half way through
                line 56. In order to preserve the iambic pentameter, therefore, Sardanapalus’s
                response in line 64 is cut, too. The adjustment maintains the poetic rhythm, while
                removing complex images, metaphors, and philosophical meditations. The second cut on
                the right follows this approach, eliminating one of Myrrha’s multiple avowals to the
                King and other less substantive phrases and hesitations that stand in the way of
                Sardanapalus’s retelling of his dream. Though not all edits maintained this type of
                continuity, Upchurch succeeded in most cases in ensuring smooth transitions between
                actors’ lines and preserving Byron’s poetic form. </p>
            <p>When the twelve-actor performance commenced later that evening, which included one
                actor who read Byron’s stage directions, Upchurch’s line cuts proved warranted, as
                the show still ran to a two-hour, twenty-minute performance (including one
                fifteen-minute intermission). The over 120 attendees responded enthusiastically.
                Many of them told us either during intermission or after the performance that the
                play presented an array of gripping elements: suspense, humor, romance, and themes
                of friendship and fidelity. According to audience members, some noteworthy moments
                included the pathos of Zarina’s loyalty to Sardanapalus as his wife and queen,
                despite the king’s betrayal and estrangement from her. Other absorbing elements
                included the heated and cross-cultural romance between the Assyrian king and his
                Greek lover as well as the play’s tragic yet spectacular finale: when Sardanapalus
                and Myrrha escape capture by the rebels by immolating themselves. Overall, the
                performance fostered the kind of responses—such as laughter and enthusiasm—that
                a talented cast and director were able to make possible.<note place="foot" resp="author">In 
                Biggs’s notes on the production of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>, he explains how he initially
                            sought out a “seasoned New York actor” for the role of the king, since
                            none of his “student actors seemed ready for it” (<title level="a">Notes of Performing
                                <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title></title> 380.). He settled on hiring
                            Brian Price, a trained actor in his mid-twenties who Biggs described as
                            having “a high and somewhat querulous voice and an inconspicuous
                            physique. Not obviously an auspicious choice; yet he proved a
                            revelation.” Biggs attributes his finding to Price’s “spontaneity,” an
                            attribute of comedy and levity that he believes Byron wrote into the
                            lines and character of the king. For Biggs, King Sardanapalus appears to
                            “be improvising his text as the character is improvising his rule,” and
                            we believe that Arison also seized upon the improvisational effects that
                            inhered in the Byronic text.</note> As King Sardanapalus,
                Arison generated laughter through amusing, hyperbolic poses in front of the mirror
                that suggested the king’s vanity (III.163-4). Arison commented that, despite his
                impotence as a monarch, incapacity to unite a divided Assyrian kingdom, and
                preference for soirees and libations instead of defending his realm and people from
                attack, the king’s character comes across sympathetically. </p>
            <p>Approximately thirty audience members remained for the post-show discussion, with
                many interested to find out about the benefits achieved through the partnership
                between a university English department and a theater company. They also asked
                questions about <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>’s production and reception
                history as well as about specific contextual issues such as the political parallels
                between the play’s ancient setting and the concerns of Byron’s own day. In an email
                to Upchurch and the actors the day after the performance, Red Bull’s Associate
                Artistic Director, Craig Baldwin, wrote:

            Overall, it became clear that besides the superb acting Upchurch’s line cuts were
                theatrically effective. I suspect that both the dramatic reading and post-show
                discussion may have enticed some of them to explore more about Byron and his works
                in their own time. </p>

            <p>The unexpected success of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> solidified the
                relationship between Red Bull and the NYU Department of English, making a staged
                reading of a Romantic drama an annual New York City event from 2012 to 2017. The
                positive reception prompted us to raise the stakes the following year by choosing
                Shelley's lyrical drama, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, a play that has
                not only been mostly confined to print—with only a handful of copies even making
                it to the press in Shelley’s lifetime—but has also been brought to the stage only
                a handful of times (Barcus 3).<note place="foot" resp="author">Here Barcus 
                    explains: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no
                            more than 20 copies, and John Gisborne remarked that
                           <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> was never intended for more than five or
                            six persons” (3). In April 1998, Rude Mechanicals, a renowned theater
                            company in Austin, Texas, put on what they claim to be the “original
                            world premiere” of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as a full
                            staged production at the University of Texas in Austin. It was directed
                            by Madge Darlington and produced by Theresa M. Kelley and Michael
                            Simpson. (<ref target="http://www.rudemechs.com/"
                                >www.rudemechs.com</ref>)</note> In his preface to the 1820
                edition of the drama, Shelley suggested that he did not intend it for performance,
                writing that its “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” were best suited for “the
                highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers” (209).
                The implication is that his drama demands a special “reader” instead of spectator.
                Indeed, Shelley’s inclusion of supernatural content, representations of cosmic-wide
                revolution, dense poetic effusions and images, and complex allusions present
                formidable challenges to staging it. The political allegorical heft and network of
                classical references of Shelley’s text are challenging enough to read: I wondered,
                therefore, how it would fare before a live audience.</p>
            <p>The conversations leading up to—and during—rehearsals resembled those from the
                previous year, with the exception that Craig Baldwin decided to direct
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> personally. In an interview prior to the
                show, he reminisced about his Juilliard “voice and speech class” days in which his
                instructor would require his students to perform Asia’s “enchanted Boat” song from
                Act II, scene five, as an exercise in reciting “expressive” and “rich” language and
                sound (Personal Interview). Even though that experience was Baldwin’s first and only
                exposure to the play prior to our collaboration, he welcomed the chance to direct it
                for two major reasons. The first was the draw of what he considered Shelley’s
                “ecstatically appealing” verse and ambitious attempt “to describe the
                indescribable.” Baldwin noted his interest in the play’s reach “for greater and
                greater transcendence . . . [through] massive and multilayered ideas and images”
                (Personal Interview). The second reason was Baldwin’s fascination with what he
                considered Shelley’s prescience about late 20th and early 21st century 
                advances in theatrical technology. According to
                Baldwin, “Shelley liberated himself from writing in a theatrical tradition [of his
                contemporaries] and made precocious innovations” (Personal Interview). Baldwin
                argued that today’s elaborate technology used in Broadway or West End sets could
                bring many of the play’s spectacles to life, presenting features like Asia’s
                radiating light from Act II or the inter-animating visions of celestial bodies of
                Act IV as impressive visual effects. He also suggested that the play imagines what
                we would recognize today as a “Batman-like shadow world” with characters like
                Demogorgon as a “proto-Terminator” and the Phantasm of Jupiter arising from the
                lower depths like “scenes from <title level="m">X-Men</title>.” He even suggested that
                Shelley’s drama could adapt well as a film or even opera-musical.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In his brief exposure to the full
                            text, Baldwin came to conclusions about (unbeknownst to him) the
                            dramaturgical potential of Shelley’s play that some literary scholars
                            have already identified elsewhere. Jacqueline Mulhallen, for instance,
                            has analyzed Shelley’s lyrical dramas, both <title level="m">Prometheus
                                Unbound</title> and <title level="m">Hellas</title>, as “rooted in actual
                            theatrical practices” (Mulhallen, <title level="m">Theater</title> 16).
                            According to her, Shelley’s lyrical drama “accord[s] with his theory of
                            drama sufficiently to suggest that he thought them performable."
                            Mulhallen’s book aims to show Shelley as an effective dramatist for the
                            play’s “song, scenic effect, or suggestions of dance.” Jeffrey Cox has
                            also argued that the play “is insistently directed toward dramatic
                            traditions . . . [with an] entire range of drama from tragedy to
                            melodrama” (<title level="m">Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School:
                            Keats, Shelley, Hunt, and Their Circle</title>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
                            1998, 142). In their writing about Romantic mediality, moreover, Celeste
                            Langan and Maureen McLane have recognized the play’s “stunning
                            materiality,” “outsoarings,” and fascination with “conveyance” (<title level="a">The
                                Medium of Romantic Poetry</title> in <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion
                                to British Romantic Poetry</title>, ed. James Chandler and Maureen N.
                            McLane, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, 256). They argue:
                            “Shelley’s imagined revolution . . . was incessantly audiovisualized,
                            its movements virtually kinesthetic, propelling spirits and readers ever
                            onward in a shared dream in an optative mode . . . [the drama] pictures
                            revolution as a stunning sound-and-light show: curses, songs, ringing
                            voices, personified voices in the air, visions rolling on brains, light
                            illuminating reconstructed man” (257-8).</note></p>
            <p>As we expected, Baldwin admitted that the play would offer its share of staging
                difficulties. He particularly felt that the long poetic passages and minimal stage
                directions suggested that Shelley wrote it—not as an unstageable play 
                but—without any idea of how to stage it. As with <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>,
                the text needed cutting, perhaps even more ruthlessly, in fact. Baldwin suggested
                considerably trimming the drama’s second half during the extended celebrations
                across the cosmos.<note place="foot" resp="author">While
                            Baldwin made substantial line cuts, he compromised with me by
                            re-inserting particular passages that I believed were crucial to
                            understanding Shelley’s work. Some of these re-insertions included the
                            Furies’ visions of French Revolutionary terror from Act I and the Spirit
                            of the Hour’s observations on women’s new-found equality in the new
                            Promethean universe at the end of Act III.</note> In lieu of
                dramatic action, however, Baldwin determined to be crafty with what he considered
                Shelley’s “beautiful lyricism and musicality” (Personal Interview). One of his
                strategies for heightening the play’s sonoric experience included positioning actors
                beyond the stage throughout the entire space of the theater. During the actual
                performance, actors were positioned all across the stage as well as in the aisles.
                For example, in Act IV, while the actors playing Panthea and Ione described the
                redeemed world’s “inter-transpicuous” marvels from the stage, the dialogue between
                the Earth and the Moon took place throughout the orchestra aisles with audience
                members sitting directly between the speaking characters (IV.134). </p>
            <p>Baldwin also divided Shelley’s lengthy choruses to heighten the play’s dramatic
                effects. He split the lines up between several actors who would recite them either
                individually or in tandem from the aisles. See Figure 2 for an example of one of
                Baldwin’s adapted choruses, which I have positioned beside Shelley’s original
                text:
            <figure n="2">
              <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/miranda-image2Thumb.png"/>
                <figDesc>An Example of one of Craig Baldwin’s adapted
                    scenes of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title></figDesc>
                </figure>
            Baldwin divided Shelley’s song among the characters in order to make the poetic text
                more dramatic. In doing so, he transformed the chorus into a style reminiscent of
                the witch scenes in <title level="m">Macbeth</title>, creating a call-and-response
                effect. Yet such a choice simultaneously raised a paradox. Baldwin interpreted
                Shelley’s lack of stage directions as license for creating a precise design for the
                dialogue, “binding” back <title level="m">Prometheus</title>, as it were, to a rigid
                structure. Perhaps this interpretive choice was antithetical to Shelley’s authorial
                intent. Nevertheless, the positioning of these characters in the aisles invoked
                their liminal status as spirits not fully within the material world. Moreover,
                Baldwin felt his choice created an opportunity for making a rich theatrical
                experience possible. </p>
            <p>The staged reading took place on November 18, 2013 at the Lucille Lortel Theater in
                New York City’s West Village. Despite the drama’s complexities, it appealed to 
                many—though not all—attendees, as I discovered from speaking to audience members
                during intermission and after the show. Surprisingly, despite starting the
                performance with a full house of approximately 200 persons (maybe a record-breaking
                number in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s limited performance history),
                the play resumed post-intermission with approximately half of its initial audience.
                Perhaps this was because of the density of Shelley’s poetry or what appeared to be
                the resolution of dramatic action before intermission at the end of Act II. In an
                email following the show, Baldwin wrote that the house appeared divided: “Many of
                them seemed bored by the incessant and complicated imagery and the long poetic
                tracts, quite a few even left at intermission. Others stayed the whole time and
                seemed very excited about it at the talkback” (Baldwin, <title level="u">"Re: Questions"</title>). After much
                deliberation, I also came to the conclusion that the audience members—especially
                those unfamiliar with the play—might have believed that the second act’s dramatic
                conclusion was, in fact, the play’s finale. Despite the exodus at the interval, the
                number of dedicated attendees who remained perhaps reinforces Shelley’s caution
                about the play’s suitability for only a “select classes of poetical readers.”</p>
            <p>In addition to sparking a lively post-show discussion that explored both the
                challenges and opportunities of Baldwin’s adaptation, the event received positive
                reviews. On behalf of the Keats-Shelley Organization of America, Suzanne Barnett
                described the show as a “rare and unexpected delight” and “a lively and nuanced
                performance that was especially impressive given that the cast had only a single
                rehearsal that same afternoon” (Barnett). She elaborated:
                <quote>
            The experience of hearing the choruses and semichoruses chant their intermingled
                lines from either side of the theater was both appropriate to the musicality of the
                source text and a canny solution to the limitations of a reading, as opposed to a
                full staging. It was also a delightful sensory experience, and it felt like a
                decision Shelley himself would have endorsed.
                </quote>
            Despite the limited rehearsal time indeed, Baldwin succeeded at finding a cast
                talented enough to deliver Shelley’s complex artistic portrayals and rich language
                effectively. One of the best examples of this occurred during the Moon’s speech in
                the last act’s cosmic rejoicing, a high point that Barnett also noted. Adam Green
                (The Moon) read his lines so powerfully that Myra Lucretia Taylor (The Earth) broke
                out of her character to say “You just took my breath away!” before resuming her own
                speech (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>). While scholars generally consider Act IV as both narratively and dramatically problematic, the performance appeared to succeed because of its emphasis on the aural pleasures of the poetry. In so doing, the production culminated with a depiction of Promethean cosmic renewal that also celebrated Shelley’s language in memorable ways.<note place="foot" resp="author">Michael Ferber

            <p>The <title level="m">Manfred</title> staging reinforced many of the lessons learned a
                few years previously with <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. In
                commemoration of the bicentenary of the play’s publication, it took place on the
                evening of Thursday, April 20, 2017 at the Loreto Theater at the Sheen Center of New
                York City.<note place="foot" resp="author">For many parts of my analysis
                        of the performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, I draw on my interview
                        with Keats-Shelley Association of America, which was published on their <ref
                            target="https://k-saa.org/manfred-follow-up-omar-f-miranda/">site</ref>
                    on August 3, 2017 (<title level="a">Manfred Follow Up</title>).</note> During rehearsals,
                Jerome McGann and I served as resident dramaturges, working in collaboration with
                the play’s director, Michael Barakiva, who <ref target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/supplementals/MANFRED_RedBullScript_4-15-17.pdf">adapted the script</ref> to accommodate a
                12-actor cast. </p>
            <p>Barakiva was inspired by the many challenges posed by <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
                    He remarked at the onset of rehearsals that
                    “the problem with the script dramaturgically is that we don’t get to see the
                    relationship with Astarte.” He suggested that, in order to create a more
                    “playable” drama, he would have instructed Byron to change the first act by
                    including either additional plot action or more speeches that give background
                    details. Yet Barakiva said that Byron’s language in <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                is “thick like a good sauce,” noting not only its Shakespearean
                registers in lines such as “We are the fools of time and terror” (II.i.164), but
                also the “dramatic upheavals” of Byron’s usage of dashes throughout.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Jane Stabler’s <title level="a">The Dashes in
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title></title> in this volume for a thorough discussion on
                        the subject.</note> Like his predecessors (Upchurch and Baldwin),
                Barakiva cut the play substantially, producing a short performance that lasted
                approximately 50 minutes. He wanted to create the most playable version of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> possible and therefore removed most of its dense
                poetry. In making his cuts, unlike Upchurch and Baldwin, he paid no mind to
                preserving Byron’s patterns of versification. </p>
            <p>Despite deferring to Barakiva without protest, McGann and I noted some of the
                director’s arbitrary decisions. He changed the gender of Byron’s characters, for
                instance, making all the immortals female (including Arimanes, Nemesis, and the
                other spirits) to distinguish them from the mortal male characters. When asked why
                he had come to the decision, Barakiva stated that the matter was personal,
                clarifying that he believed in “the superiority of women.” My skepticism was
                slightly allayed, however, when I later observed the—perhaps unintended—results
                of what he had achieved. As the performance unfolded on stage, his vision spoke to
                the play’s content and context. By dividing the characters in this way, the set up
                accentuated Manfred’s estrangement from either camp. Neither mortal nor immortal,
                Manfred (played by Jason Butler Harner) stood isolated on the stage throughout the
                entire performance, which stressed his status as an outcast caught in a liminal
                space between the human and superhuman worlds. Throughout the show, while the
                mortals (the Chamois Hunter, the Abbot of St. Maurice, Manuel, and Herman) sat
                upstage right behind Manfred, the immortals (the Spirits, the Witch of Alps,
                Destinies, Nemesis, and Arimanes) were seated opposite them upstage left. All the
                while, the audience was made continuously aware that Manfred could neither identify
                nor connect with any other being—not even the Phantom of Astarte.</p>
            <p>The stage production also emphasized the text’s gothic aspects through the actors’
                use of vocal variation. A good example of this was in Act II, scene four when the
                Destinies, Nemesis, and Arimanes all appeared together on stage—aghast and
                indignant that Manfred, through the use of his supernatural power, had gained access
                into the Hall of Arimanes. When the actors read their lines either in unison or in rapid succession, the characters came across as a threatening and intimidating collective unit; whether the actors varied their tempo or pitch, they produced the haunting effect called for by the scene. Another moment that accentuated the text’s eerie features occurred when the actor who played Arimanes, Jacqueline Antaramian, uttered her first of only five words in the drama. In
                response to Nemesis, who asks “Great Arimanes, doth thy will avouch / The wishes of
                this mortal?” Antaramian sneered at Manfred for about ten seconds—in complete
                silence—before uttering “yea” in a prolonged, menacing, and chilling fashion
                (II.iv.80-1). Her manipulation of sound and facial expression as well as her
                distinctive delivery of the word itself signaled to me once again the benefits of
                translating this play from the page to the stage. Through her acting skill, she made
                evident that brevity can be as powerful on stage as one of Manfred’s lengthy
                monologues. </p>
            <p>Another Barakivan eccentricity included communal readings of the stage directions:
                instead of having one person solely charged with reading them aloud, he randomly
                assigned each of them among all the actors. I appreciated this decision, as it
                resonated with the instabilities of voice and voicing so central to 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> (as Diego Saglia has compellingly argued in <ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.saglia.html">his essay</ref>
                in this volume). Barakiva also had a triangle rung for any reference to Astarte. It
                was used, for instance, after the Shepherd’s pipe is “heard in the distance,” when
                Manfred confesses “Yet there was One” (II.ii.103). Such a choice worked well, since
                the consistency of the instrument’s sound emphasized Astarte’s significance to the
                plot whether she was present on stage or not.</p>

            <p>The co-productions of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus 
                Unbound</title>, and <title level="m">Manfred</title> were successful
                events for many reasons: the audience’s level of engagement, the fruitful
                collaboration between literary scholars and theater artists who came together
                through one common text of interest, and the opportunity to bring students in
                contact with these texts in innovative and exciting ways. These experiences also
                allowed the rare chance to hear the performance of Byron’s and Shelley’s poetry by
                professional actors who bring to life all theatrical aspects of the play, from the
                heated dialogue to the long, introspective monologues. </p>
            <p>During rehearsals and performances, the literary scholar assumed a different role
                outside the academy, becoming a resident dramaturge and textual expert in a local
                theater. We provided a service to both theater professionals during rehearsals as
                well as to members of the community who wished to know more about the dramas during
                the post-show discussion. As Baldwin noted after the performance of 
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, “it is certainly very helpful to artists
                to engage with scholars when dealing with classical text in the theater . . .
                [especially] for directors, whose understanding of the play has to extend to its
                context, the purpose for it being written, the other work being written at the time,
                the other work by that author, etc., in order to make choices about how the play is
                contextualized in production” (Baldwin, <title level="u">“Re: Questions”</title>). The collaboration also
                allowed for some professional crossover, as Baldwin incorporated into his vision one
                of my own dramaturgical suggestions. At the end of the performance, as the actor
                playing Demogorgon, Mark Dole, read the lyrical drama’s final line, “This alone is
                Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory,” all of the actors on stage read it aloud in tandem
                with him as a gesture symbolic of the newly unified Promethean society (IV.578).</p>
            <p>These rewards were indeed mutual, as this opportunity opened up a stimulating
                interpretive space. The professional actors bring out certain aspects of the prosody
                that might not come across as forcefully on the page, offering the audience a
                communal interpretation of these texts that is markedly different from a private
                reading. Moreover, we discovered that close reading can also happen on stage in
                illuminating ways. I was pleasantly surprised to learn, for instance, that Baldwin
                recognized opportunities for humor in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>.
                This occurs in Act I, for instance, when Mercury fails to persuade the obstinate
                Prometheus to succumb to Jupiter and reveal his secret knowledge to the god. For
                Baldwin, the actor playing Mercury’s minor, yet consequential, role could generate
                laughter by exaggerating his pitiable pleas and sense of self-defeat as the
                unsuccessful mediator between Prometheus and Jupiter. Baldwin pointed to the faun
                scene in Act II as another possibility for humor, particularly if the two actors
                emphasize the fauns’ fascination with the beautiful, ethereal, music-making spirits
                around them. Yet another opportunity for humor includes Jupiter’s lengthy monologue
                at the start of Act III, if the actor playing him succeeds at bringing out the
                melodramatic nature of the despot’s character. Baldwin offered Jupiter’s opening
                lines as an illustration of what he meant: “Ye congregated powers of heaven, who
                share / The glory and strength of him ye serve / Rejoice! Henceforth I am
                omnipotent” (III.1-3). He envisioned a talented actor reading these lines not only
                with a strong voice but also with an exaggerated “villainous laugh” to follow
                Jupiter’s ironic claims of omnipotence amid his crumbling empire. As a caricature of
                evil, according to Baldwin, Jupiter could offer the play’s greatest moment of comic
                relief with a skilled actor lending the appropriately hyperbolic inflections.<note place="foot" resp="author">Cox and other critics
                            have analyzed the features of masque and melodrama in Shelley’s play,
                            and such comedic effect would further support these lines of
                            inquiry.</note></p>
            <p>The <title level="m">Manfred</title> staging also highlighted the humor of Byron’s play, which
                    might appear surprising for a cosmic drama that centers on the agony of its
                    hero. A good illustration of this occurred during Manfred’s opening monologue,
                    when he, in his attempt to conjure the spirits of earth and air, fails to summon
                    them not just once but twice. Combine such writing with a talented actor who can
                    use silence and bedazzled facial expressions to his advantage to yield a comical
                    reaction from the audience. Consider also the moment in Act II when one of the
                    spirits in the Hall of Arimanes remarks that, “Had [Manfred] been one of us,” he
                    “would have made / an awful spirit” (II.iv.161-2). With this line, Byron perhaps
                    intended to signal the awe-inducing presence of his Faustian hero, in accordance
                    with the archaic meaning of the word, “awful.” Still, a contemporary audience
                    cannot help but hear the term’s more familiar modern resonance: had Manfred been
                    a spirit, in fact, he would have made a bad one. Needless to say, the crowd at
                    the Loreto Theater roared with laughter. Along with many other similar
                    opportunities, it became clear that the play has the capacity to be performed in
                    a way that brings out light-hearted, humorous moments. As an audience member,
                    rather than as a conventional reader, I took away from the experience that 
                    Byron—in addition to creating a “play” based on the scandalous affair with his half
                    sister, Augusta, which had seized the imagination of a continent—was having
                    fun with writing his drama. The performance pushed the generic expectations of
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> by
                    shedding light on its ambiguities as a hybrid work between the tragic and the
                    comic.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            As Alice Levine and Jerome McGann contend in
                                this volume, the play is not only a work of tragedy and stoicism but
                                also a comedy.</note></p>
            <p>Despite my initial skepticism about the limitations of
                    being a passive spectator—of being subjected to the directors’ and actors’
                    interpretation of the text—I have embraced such readings, however
                    idiosyncratic, as an opportunity. Even if I had disagreed with any particular
                    actor’s reading style, the experience of hearing
                    such an interpretation still proved fruitful, since it invited the immediacy of
                    varying reactions and responses. For instance, when Gisela Chípe, the actor
                    playing the Phantom of Astarte, read out her final word on stage, “Manfred,”
                    before leaving him and disappearing from the scene altogether, she uttered his
                    name with a heightened tone of desperation—as if she were beseeching Manfred
                    to join her on the other side among the dead. For me, this interpretation seems
                    to be a misreading. To my mind, the character of Astarte must exhibit both
                    calmness and detachment, for she models the kind of stoic disposition that
                    Manfred will fully acquire by the end of the play. Manfred and Astarte are,
                    after all, like each other in “lineaments” and share the “same lone thoughts and
                    wanderings” (II.ii.105-9). Nevertheless, the distinctive mode in which Chípe
                    read her line prodded me toward such reflection in the first place. Her reading
                    offered another way of interpreting Byron’s lines, inviting my reaction as well
                    as adding to our critical discourse.</p>

            <p>In addition to the foregoing benefits, I wish to highlight the rewards of making
                these Romantic-era dramas come performatively alive through a staged reading, an
                auspicious alternative when a full production is not feasible. Despite my initial
                hope back in 2012 of producing full stagings of these works, it was through this
                unintended and initially less desirable medium, in fact, that I discovered an
                apposite vehicle for realizing even the most unplayable of these dramas as
                successful theatrical experiences. The staged reading is unusual in that it fuses
                the conventions of silent, individual, and private reading practices with that of
                communal and public performance. The medium permits actors, readers, spectators, and
                auditors to intersect in a space where all groups experience the text simultaneously
                yet differently. Actors perform by dramatically reading their lines aloud, while
                using minimal gesturing to evoke action, interaction, and movement. They serve as
                the intermediaries between the text and the audience members who absorb the drama as
                spectators and auditors.</p>
            <p>While having actors read aloud from scripts might appear to restrict the suspension
                of disbelief that audience members might enjoy in more traditional theatrical
                milieus, the austere, minimalist format of this performance style heightens the
                reading experience in some ways. That is, without the spectacle of scenery,
                elaborate costuming, or other visual effects, the staged reading emphasizes the
                sound and substance of the text’s language, as the text is felt to be more present.
                Through a staged reading, all participants are invariably reminded that two distinct
                populations—actors and audience members (rather than characters in a drama)—have
                come together to “read” a script in different ways. By this I mean that audience
                members are permitted the benefits afforded to them in a conventional encounter with
                a text, as the silent, individual reading practice transforms into an enhanced
                communal experience in which texts are read physically, interpetively, and
                imaginatively. Without the distraction of visual effects or actors’ bodily movement,
                audience members also participate actively by collaborating creatively in the group
                process. As they envision the dramatic scenes in their minds, they conduct an
                interpretation of text within an alternate and stimulating site for reading and
                analysis outside of the classroom or the library. This reading community also has
                its pedagogical advantages by being a pragmatic way to invite students into the
                world of these difficult dramatic works. The staged reading allows students to enjoy
                the pleasures of poetic language and sound as well as the synergy generated by
                actors responding to the text’s dialogic structure. In animating the text in such a
                way, the experience draws students into each writer’s artistic vision. </p>
            <p>Beyond the benefits for these diverse groups, the staged reading offers new ways to
                confront old challenges that scholars have identified in thinking about closet
                dramas. Catherine Burroughs, for instance, has written that the genre is “hybrid,
                oscillatory, and ambiguous,” contending that closet plays from the entire Georgian
                period (1737—1832) generally “blur the lines between voice and body, reading and
                staging, and gesture and speech” (445).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        In our staged reading experiences, the actors would complement their speech
                        with gestures of action rather than engaging fully in codified
                        movements.</note> For her, these works are unsuitable for elaborate
                theatrical productions. In <title level="m">Poetry and Politics of the Cockney
                    School</title>, moreover, Jeffrey Cox argues that works such as Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> attempted to remake contemporary melodrama
                by locating a “generic site” that “draws upon a strong theatrical tradition to
                imagine a stage beyond the theater” (Cox 124). He argues that Shelley, by seeking to
                negotiate “a proper balance between word and stage effect,” needed a theater other
                than what existed in the early nineteenth century (Cox 129).  In other words,
                Shelley’s “visions of embodied possibility” comprise an “imaginative theater” that
                seemed unreal in his day but might be realized in ours (Cox 145).<note place="foot" resp="author">Agreeing with Cox, Quillin also
                        suggests: “the poetic form of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                        defines the dramatic action, making the reader complicit in a closet drama
                        that is nonetheless theatrical in origin” (21).</note></p>
            <p>As the actors performed by reading from their scripts during each Red Bull
                performance, they negotiated the balance between voice and gesture and between
                language and the body. They partook of an in-between or mediated space where speech
                and writing became interdependent. They employed a type of performance that
                addressed the needs of these generically hybrid and “oscillatory” works of poetic
                drama. What I am suggesting is that the staged reading converts theory into practice
                by transmuting this imaginative style of drama into the material reality of a
                theatrical space. It provides an alternative means of seeing these texts as
                performable objects, allowing for the integration of the hybrid “generic site” (that
                Cox identifies) into a <emph>cross-medial site</emph> between voice and
                print and between the stage and the page. As this mixed medium offers an experience
                between a private reading and the grandness of the full stage production, in which
                the spectator experiences the negotiation between “word and stage effect,” it allows
                such experimental, neglected works of theater to emerge with ease at long last from
                their closets. </p>
            <p>This take on the possibilities of the staged reading expands upon similar reflections
                recorded in the last few years with regard to other Byron productions. Writing about
                her own production of <title level="m">Cain</title> in 2010 at the University of
                British Columbia, Fannina Waubert de Puiseau has argued that the staged reading
                offered her production an opportunity to “look beyond the traditional stage” in
                order to inhabit a “transitional space between page and stage” (427). In his review
                of a ‘rehearsed reading’ of <title level="m">Manfred</title> at the King’s Head
                Theatre in London (performed on March 11, 2007), Michael Simpson noted that such a
                collective performance dramatizes the “act of reading a text” (44), while the
                spectator’s and reader’s “imagination [is] conducted within a collective world of
                print” (51). Simpson further suggests that this theatre of print “short-circuits the
                critical polarity of stage versus page” (48). In “theatricalizing text,” he
                contends, the rehearsed reading also “traces the glamorously infamous scene of
                reading” at Villa Diodati in the Summer of 1816 that gave rise not only to
                    Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> but also to Mary Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (and John Polidori’s <title level="m">The
                    Vampyre</title>): two works that Simpson argues are preoccupied with animation and
                resurrection. As it pays homage to the 1816 occasion that gave it life, the staged
                reading also reinforces the fact that Manfred is not simply “isolated in poses of
                egotistical sublime”; he is also “beset by external forces” (48). Byron’s text is a
                mixture of profound monologue and “intensely competitive dialogue,” as the staged
                reading honors the oscillation that, as Burroughs reminds us, is an integral part of
                the peculiarities of such dramas (48).</p>
            <p>In the end, the success of these staged readings
                became possible because of a series of negotiations and compromises between literary
                critics and theater experts. The Red Bull team showed that professional talent,
                direction, and even adaptation can animate even the most experimental and
                rhythmically dense among these dramas. The staged reading enabled us to meet on
                middle ground—to discover a happy medium between poetry and drama, theater artists
                and scholars, art and criticism, theory and practice, page and stage, and the public
                and private spheres. Through Red Bull’s commitment to staging “under-performed”
                plays, this joint project has permitted the New York City theatergoing community to
                experience Romantic works as performances rather than as poetry in a private reading
                or classroom: Romanticism on the stage rather than on the printed or digitized page.
                At the same time, this collaboration has drawn attention once again to the Romantic
                fascination with the mixing of genres. In the spirit of the period that gave us the
                lyrical ballad, the historical novel, and the lyrical drama, another hybrid form—the
                staged reading—can be included as both an interpretative and performative
                possibility for these dramatic works.</p>
