        <p>This volume of essays commemorates the 200<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> anniversary of one of the most popular and influential literary
          works of the nineteenth century, Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</title> (1817). In June 1817, when John Murray
          published the drama, it was no surprise that all 6,000 copies sold out rather quickly. A work about a tormented nobleman from the Swiss
          Alps, <title level="m">Manfred</title> captured the European imagination upon its publication for two major reasons. First, it dramatized
          one of the greatest scandals of the day: the allegations that Byron had committed incest with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, which forced
          him into exile from Britain the previous year. Second, in addition to addressing these rumors, the drama catered to the European-wide craze
          created by the wild popularity of his works and his consequent celebrity. With its publication, <title level="m">Manfred</title> delivered a
          new iteration of Byron’s best-selling product, the Byronic hero, a figure that he produced through the exploitation of his own public image.
          On one level, <title level="m">Manfred</title> fused the autobiographical elements of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>
          with the Orientalist flair of the heroes from his popular Turkish Tales, including the Giaour (<title level="m">The Giaour</title>), Conrad
            (<title level="m">The Corsair</title>), Alp (<title level="m">The Siege of Corinth</title>), Selim (<title level="m">The Bride of
            Abydos</title>), and Lara (<title level="m">Lara</title>). On another level, it transformed the Byronic hero into a philosophical thinker
          who possessed uncanny power and knowledge. </p>
        <p>Begun in Switzerland in 1816, <title level="m">Manfred</title> shares its genesis with another great literary achievement of the early
          nineteenth century, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Each work is an adaptation of the Faustian legend: both Victor
          Frankenstein and Manfred seek out forbidden sources of knowledge and are haunted by their ill deeds. Enduring a series of afflictions,
          including exile and the ruin of their loved ones, both end up seeking to forget their past and even contemplate suicide. <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>—along with John Polidori’s <title level="m">The Vampyre</title>—were conceived
          during the summer of 1816 in Geneva when Byron, the Shelleys, and Polidori exchanged ghost stories in a contest at Byron’s rented Swiss
          home, Villa Diodati. Byron’s contribution of a “fragment” on that legendary evening seemingly inspired him shortly thereafter to compose
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> as his first dramatic composition, which was written—like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>—in a
          gothic key.</p>
        <p><title level="m">Manfred</title> bears a number of literary influences, including Aeschylus’s <title level="m">Prometheus Bound</title>,
          William Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, John Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, Edward Young’s <title level="m"
            >The Revenge</title>, Johann von Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>, William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, and
          Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Alastor</title>. Shortly following <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication, the play was translated
          into several languages throughout Europe, including German, Russian, Polish, and French. Friedrich Nietzsche felt a personal connection to
          Byron’s title character, who partially inspired his concept of the<title level="m"> Übermensch</title> in <title level="m">Thus Spoke
            Zarathustra</title> (1883-91). The drama inspired many other notable works, as well, including Alexander Pushkin’s <title level="m">Eugene
            Onegin</title>, Alexandre Dumas’s <title level="m">The Count of Monte Cristo</title>, Ivan Turgenev’s <title level="m">Fathers and
            Sons</title>, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s <title level="m">Notes from Underground</title>, Thomas Pynchon’s <title level="m">The Crying of Lot
            49</title>, and Susanna Clarke’s <title level="m">Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell</title>. <title level="m">Manfred </title>is also a
          source for later Byronic heroes, including Heathcliff from <title level="m">Wuthering Heights</title>, Rochester from <title level="m">Jane
            Eyre</title>, Captain Ahab from <title level="m">Moby Dick</title>, Pechorin from <title level="m">A Hero of our Time</title>, Michael
          Corleone from <title level="m">The Godfather</title>, Eric Draven from <title level="m">The Crow</title>, and Bruce Wayne from <title
            level="m">Batman</title>.</p>
        <p>Like many Romantic dramas, <title level="m">Manfred</title> has rarely been performed as a full theatrical production on stage. Byron
          himself cautioned that his dramatic poem was not intended for the stage but rather belonged to a category of metaphysical drama that he
          called “mental theatre.” Nevertheless, an adaptation of the play directed by Alfred Bunn and set to music by Henry Rowley Bishop took place
          at Covent Garden in 1834. In 1848, Robert Schumann adapted <title level="m">Manfred</title> for musical performance, and it opened to much
          success at the <foreign>Gewandhaus</foreign> in Leipzig in 1852. Inspired by the 1834 Covent Garden production, Drury Lane theater presented
          another stage version of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in October 1863. In 1885, the Russian composer, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, turned
          the play into the <title level="m">Manfred Symphony</title>. More recently, the BBC produced the play as a radio drama in 1988. The
          broadcasting network revived <ref target="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087qh9w">the dramatic reading</ref> in January 2017 in honor of
          the <title level="m">Manfred</title> bicentenary. </p>
        <p>The authors in this volume, whose essays are based on original talks given at an <ref
            target="http://romantics200.org/event/byrons-manfred-dramatic-reading-symposium/">international bicentenary symposium</ref> dedicated to
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> at New York University on April 21, 2017, re-examine Byron’s drama from an array of angles. They
          interrogate issues related to its publication, circulation, and reception history, while also exploring matters of authorial intent. For
          instance, although biographical readings of <title level="m">Manfred</title> have pointed to the protagonist’s and Byron’s sense of remorse
          for “destroying” his sister, Astarte, <ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.bernhard-jackson.html">Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s provocative essay</ref>, “Love in the First Degree:<title level="m">
            Manfred</title>, Byron, and Incest,” suggests that the play offers evidence rather of Manfred’s and Byron’s lack of guilt. Several of the
          authors also propose that, in contrast to critics who, like Byron himself, maintained that the drama is unstageable, <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title> offers the dramaturgical potential to succeed on the stage as a performance in its own right. The play emerged at a
          defining moment in the history of theater and, despite its limited performance history, is rooted in the tradition of melodrama and revenge
          tragedy. Moreover, the present essays underscore the idea that <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s generic hybridity blurs several
          boundaries, styles, and tones. <title level="m">Manfred</title> is not only a tragedy but also a work of comedy that anticipates the humor
          and satire that Byron would eventually develop in <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. The readings even
          expand the range of cultural influences and source materials that have previously been connected with the play. With <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title> Byron created a work that fused his own celebrity myth with elements from various faiths, myths, and traditions across
          cultures and times. Byron fired the public imagination with a drama that, while based on his own personal scandal, moved well beyond its
          rootedness in a Swiss landscape and in his own biography. The drama transcends the limits of the personal and the local as an eccentric and
          eclectic work of global horizons.</p>
        <p>The first section of the volume, “Foundations, Influences, Intertexts,” proceeds chronologically, beginning with some of <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>’s oldest cultural and religious sources. In “Alpine Orientalism in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” Alan Richardson
          discusses <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s status as a culturally heterogeneous work whose “brazen commingling of Alpine setting and
          Orientalist lexicon” is saturated in signs and symbols associated with Zoroastrianism. According to Richardson, <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title> provides an unusual “mixture of local and exotic,” fusing elements of Christian tradition, Greek myth, and even European
          witchcraft with various “Oriental” religions. Richardson connects the drama’s incest plot to Montesquieu’s <title level="m">Persian
            Letters</title> (1721) and finds key links to William Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title> (1784)—both of which contain Zoroastrian
          elements themselves. He proposes that Byron’s hero, short of being a Magian himself, is at the least highly knowledgeable of the
          tradition given his curious speeches and practices. Richardson concludes by suggesting that, as “Byron gave a pronounced Orientalist edge to
          an Alpine Gothic play that programmatically refuses to declare its allegiances, religious, mythological, geographical, literary, or
          generic,” <title level="m">Manfred</title> is an “iconoclastic” work that still speaks meaningfully to our contemporary moment.</p>
        <p>In “Freemasonry and Mental Theatre in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” Jonathan Gross highlights the conglomeration of faiths and
          traditions evident in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. He extends Richardson's argument about Byron's debt to Montesquieu's <title
            level="m">Lettres Persanes</title> by tracing the similarity to Byron and Montesquieu's shared Masonic beliefs, pointing out crucial
          images of "Magisme" in Byron's play (the casket and key in Act III) that have not been previously discussed. He argues that the play draws
          on Byron’s own knowledge of Masonic societies, to which Byron’s father—“Mad Jack” Byron—also belonged. Gross concludes his essay by
            seeing <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s heterogeneous elements as a lesson in cultural tolerance and comparative religion rather than an
          instance of eco-criticism or twentieth-century existentialism.</p>
        <p>In “Redeemed from the Worm: <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s Celebrity Revenge Tragedy,” Clara Tuite expands on <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>’s conglomeration of styles, registers, and tones, as well as the complicated genealogy of the Byronic hero, which she
          proposes stems back to Hamlet. Tuite argues that <title level="m">Manfred</title> is Byron’s take on the revenge tragedy and that the
          eponymous hero has his origins in Zanga, the avenger from Edward Young’s <title level="m">The Revenge: A Tragedy</title> (1721), whom Byron
          played in a performance in his youth while a student at Harrow School. Tuite suggests that these roots are connected with Byron’s own
          scandals and what she calls the “fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power, and intimate publicity: celebrity.” She contends that
          the text, which serves as an allegory of Byron’s life, offers evidence of two kinds of “unfinished business.” The first is the emotional
          unfinished business pertaining to the scandals that prompted his exile from Britain. The second is <title level="m">Manfred</title> as an
          embodiment of unfinished textual business: as a synthesis of many drafts and reworkings of text, intertext, and paratext—including the
          revised third act at the demand of Gifford and Murray—in the months that Byron wrote it over the winter of 1816-17.</p>
        <p>Peter Manning then tracks a “<foreign>hypochondrisch</foreign>” textual history of “self-involved protagonists” by uncovering an unexpected
          connection between Goethe and Byron outside of the obvious Faustian link. In “‘My pang shall find a voice’: <title level="m">Manfred</title>
          and <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>,” Manning fittingly turns to the work that made Goethe famous to uncover not
          only the commonalities between Werther and Manfred as heroes but also biographical links between Goethe and Byron themselves. Through his
          archival work on the editorial manuscripts of the posthumously published 17-volume collected edition of Byron's works (1832-33), housed at
          the National Library of Scotland, Manning’s research probes the curious editorial practices of John Wright, Byron’s editor. He reveals a
          genealogy that ties <title level="m">Werther</title> to the rejected third act of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron’s five-act
          tragedy, <title level="m">Marino Faliero</title> (1821), and even the “sensational stage display” of Alfred Bunn’s Covent Garden performance
          of the drama in 1834. Manning’s discoveries show how Wright, in bringing the many exchanges and dedications between Goethe and Byron to
          light through his editing, emphasized the “hypochondriac” and melodramatic proclivities of the authors and, by extension, their characters.
          Manning demonstrates how the textual history that marks Goethe’s effort to “cast critical distance on his self-absorbed protagonist” is
          echoed by Byron’s similar impulses in his composition of <title level="m">Manfred</title> and beyond.</p>
        <p>The section ends with Alice Levine’s “<title level="m">Manfred</title>: Byron’s Other <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,” in which she
          challenges the conventional notion that <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> represent antithetical
          aspects of Byron’s writings. By examining Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> and other iterations of the legendary Hispanic
          libertine, Don Juan, Levine argues that <title level="m">Manfred</title>—contrary to the critical consensus—served as a foundational text
          for Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. For her, both works involve a form of “heterosexual transgression”; each culminates not only
          in the disappearance of female characters but also with the protagonists’ self-assertions among a community of “powerful male authority
          figures.” In finding commonality between these seemingly disparate works, Levine proposes that <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title
            level="m">Don Juan</title> are “two variations on the same plot and the same central character.” </p>
        <p>The second section, “Text, Circulation, Image,” opens with Emily Bernhard-Jackson’s essay, “Love in the First Degree: <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>, Byron, and Incest,” in which she reads <title level="m">Manfred</title> alongside Byron’s letters and <title level="m"
            >Don Juan</title>. In doing so, Bernhard-Jackson considers Byron’s skepticism on the subject of incest. She makes the provocative case
          that <title level="m">Manfred</title>, rather than being a work about Manfred’s guilt, is about his lack of guilt. As Bernhard-Jackson sees
          it, though <title level="m">Manfred</title> provided Byron with a “confessional medium,” the subjects of incest and torment must be
          disentangled from one another. While Manfred (and Byron) feels deeply for his (half)-sister, his commitment to both rationalism and
          liberation keeps him from feeling remorse. Highlighting the “ambivalent registers of [Byron’s] apologetic gestures,” Bernhard-Jackson
          contends that incest was a way for Byron to challenge inhibiting social structures.</p>
        <p>In “Dark Prometheus: <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the Last Infirmity of Evil,” Andrew Stauffer closely examines an enigmatic
          seven-line passage in the first act to argue that Manfred’s character is the anti-heroic version of the protagonist that Percy Shelley later
          created in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>: a “dark twin” who embodies “existential Romantic heroism.” Tracing this idea back to
          John Milton’s “Lycidas,” Stauffer concentrates on a particular phrase, “the last infirmity of evil,” asking whether it suggests Manfred’s
          superlative embrace of evil or, rather, his desire to purge the traces of evil in himself. He ultimately settles on a third reading,
          proposing instead that Manfred, in reaching the “summit of evil” and standing on “the dizzy brink of complete amorality,” moves beyond the
          limits of “self-justification.” Stauffer’s Manfred is one who, immediately prior to his own death, transcends his own limits by reaching a
          sense of calm and equanimity.</p>
        <p>Jane Stabler offers another close reading of <title level="m">Manfred</title> by analyzing the text’s inclusion of Byron’s signature
          punctuation—the dash. In “The Dashes in <title level="m">Manfred</title>,” she interrogates Byron’s persistent use of the dash in his
          manuscripts as well as how his editors translated them into print. Distinguishing between the em dash and the long dash in <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>, she argues that Byron’s usage creates the effect of a complex “musical score” that, in transgressing rules of grammar,
          shapes the way readers “hear” the work’s extensive range of voices and silences. For Stabler, the Byronic dash can be “a sigh, an intake of
          breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent.” In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, the affect suggested by the dashing ranges from ludic interruption to wonder to gothic agony. To complement her analysis, Stabler supplies her readers with
          several images of Byron’s manuscripts and early printed editions from the National Library of Scotland.</p>
        <p>The section closes with Ghislaine McDayter’s investigation of the reception history of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, focusing on the
          way artists and illustrators rendered the play in the nineteenth century. In “The Iconography of Forgiveness: <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>’s Astarte,” McDayter analyzes a series of illustrated editions of both <title level="m">The Giaour</title> and <title
            level="m">Manfred</title> in order to highlight a trend in the play’s reception. Examining portrayals of each work’s hero and their love
          interests, Leila and Astarte in particular, she demonstrates how these interpretations are more concerned with Byron and his scandals than
          with the works themselves. McDayter proposes that a study of the depictions of these heroines offers “a window into the public view of the
          poet himself.” McDayter accompanies her analysis with reproductions of the various illustrations that she explores. </p>
        <p>The third section, “Voice, Performance, Adaptation,” begins with Diego Saglia’s look at the function and problem of voice in <title
            level="m">Manfred</title>. In “Voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title>: Sign, Symbol, and Performance,” Saglia demonstrates how voice in
          the play is simultaneously a “vehicle for authorial power” and a representation of an “unstable force.” Saglia argues that voice in <title
            level="m">Manfred</title> serves an “oscillatory function.” It operates on the threshold between several domains, including that between
          transcendence and materiality, page and stage, drama and melodrama, theater and metatheater, absence and presence, the real and imaginary,
          the embodied and disembodied, and the visible and invisible. At the same time, Saglia highlights the relevance of unstable voices on the
          Romantic-era stage, suggesting that Byron wrote <title level="m">Manfred</title> with “questions of theatrical performance” in mind. In
          producing these “transdimensional interconnections,” voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> becomes one of the major elements behind the
          play’s textual and performative distinctiveness. The play is “one of the major Romantic texts on the power and meaning of uttering
          words.”</p>
        <p>Saglia’s analysis of the liminality of voice sets the stage, as it were, for my own essay, “Between Page and Stage: The Happy Medium for
          Romantic Drama,” in which I consider the performative possibilities of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, a “dramatic poem” that generally
          emphasizes high poetic language above dramatic action. Despite a long history of skepticism about its performability, dating back to Byron’s
          own comments about his reluctance to it being staged, I argue that <title level="m">Manfred</title> does indeed belong on the stage as a
          performance. By basing my findings on the recent New York City performances of <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (2012), <title level="m"
            >Prometheus Unbound</title> (2013), and <title level="m">Manfred</title> (2017), I argue that these kinds of hybrid Romantic works, which have typically been considered closet dramas, can benefit from a special kind of performance and performer: a staged reading produced by a professional director and actors. I propose that the staged reading offers what I call a “happy medium,” a form of compromise between the page and the stage that produces a pragmatic and rewarding method for encountering these works as performances. I contend that such an
          experience offers an alternate interpretive space for the text, a performative mode that responds directly to the challenges of closet
          drama, and a mutually beneficial opportunity between literary critics and theater professionals. </p>
        <p>In the spirit of the theatrical possibilities of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Jeffrey Cox’s and Michael Gamer’s “<title level="m"
          >Manfred</title> and Melodrama” follows my own with an unexpected adaptation of the conventional article format. Emulating their presentation of it at the April 2017 symposium, they offer a dialogue that not only places <title level="m">Manfred</title> in conversation with the tradition of melodrama but also attempts to understand “Romantic cultural consumption and appropriation” more broadly. In their reading, Byron
          reverses the usual order of things by consuming that most consuming of nineteenth-century genres, melodrama. <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>’s heterogeneous style and “melodramatic roots,” they show, are most evident in the rejected third act, which is (<ref target="/praxis/manfred/praxis.2019.manfred.manning.html">as
          Manning points out</ref>) what Alfred Bunn drew on for his Covent Garden staging of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834. </p>
        <p>Frederick Burwick closes the section with “Staging <title level="m">Manfred</title>” by focusing on Bunn’s production of <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title> at Covent Garden with Henry Denvil performing in the titular role, music by Henry Rowley Bishop, and scenery by Thomas
          and William Grieve. In examining reviews and first-hand accounts of the staging, Burwick argues that all the stage elements, including the
          scenery, the music, and the acting, created a spectacular effect that invoked Byron’s own biography. Burwick proposes that Bunn “succeeded
          in adapting <title level="m">Manfred</title> as a spectacular musical production,” yet maintains that Bishop’s libretto “deprived the
          audience of much of Byron’s dramatic poem.” Burwick enriches his study with fascinating materials, including a copy and an original
          performance of Bishop’s musical score, “The Witches Carnival,” which Bishop inserted into the finale of the Witch of Alps scene (Act II,
          scene two). These materials, along with two stage adaptations of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, can be found in this volume’s Table of Contents (<ref target="/praxis/manfred">Section V. Supplementary Materials</ref>)</p>
        <p>This volume culminates with an adapted version of Jerome McGann’s keynote address, “<title level="m">Manfred</title>, a Play of Language;
          or, Intimations of Mortality from Recollections of Erring Manhood,” in which he symbolically returns to the material with which he launched
          his distinguished career several decades ago with <title level="m">Fiery Dust</title> (1969). McGann revisits not only the subject of his
          groundbreaking scholarship but also his interest in the performance of Romantic drama, as he was one of the founding members of Cain’s
          Company in Chicago in the late 1960s, a theater group that dedicated itself to staging neglected dramas, including Byron’s <title level="m"
            >Cain</title>. In his essay, McGann offers a close reading of the text and its patterns of versification that neither insists on a single
          approach nor authoritative interpretation. Instead, he begins by assuming a position of negative capability, in the process underscoring how
            <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a “very strange work” that is replete with enigma and ambiguity. Through his explorations of the text,
          McGann echoes the volume’s other contributors, pointing out the intricacies of the various influences that make up <title level="m"
            >Manfred</title>. His interrogation of several passages leads him to an important conclusion. Being of “rich and cryptic linguistic
          particulars,” <title level="m">Manfred</title> is indeed a “play”: a play of words, of “language in which secrets lie about everywhere,
          awaiting—seeking—discovery.” <title level="m">Manfred</title> recasts the Faustian legend as <emph>comedy</emph> in part through a style
          that intimates the tongue-in-cheek mode that Byron realized most maturely with <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don
            Juan</title>. </p>
        <p>McGann has played an invaluable role in helping to make the present volume possible. Back in December 2015, when Stuart Curran announced
          that the Keats-Shelley Association of America and the Byron Society of America were accepting proposals to sponsor events in commemoration
          of the Romantic Bicentennials, I imagined that a work of the reach and scope of <title level="m">Manfred</title> needed a celebration that
          was attentive to its ambition and originality. I therefore proposed an event that would fuse both scholarship and performance—one that would
          bring Byron scholars from around the globe together with New York City's singularly brilliant theatrical community. McGann agreed to partner
          with me to realize a modern production of <title level="m">Manfred</title> on stage. The <ref target="http://www.redbulltheater.com/manfred"
            >dramatic reading</ref>, which was produced by Red Bull Theater, took place on Thursday, April 20, 2017 at the Loreto Theater of the Sheen
          Center on Bleecker Street (a review of it can be found online <ref
            target="https://romantic-circles.org/reviews-blog/lord-byron’s-manfred-stage-new-york-city-rare-and-rewarding-experience-reviewed-lee">at
              <title level="s">Romantic Circles</title></ref>). Both McGann and I assumed roles as resident dramaturges, offering the actors and the
          rest of the production team important background and context of the play during rehearsals. The curtain rose with a nearly sold-out crowd in
          a theater with a 220-seat capacity. McGann also delivered the keynote address, <ref
            target="https://k-saa.org/manfred-event-follow-up-jerome-mcganns-keynote-lecture-at-manfred-symposium-april-21/">“Manfred: The Long
            Disease of my Life,”</ref> at the bicentenary symposium that took place the following day, which convened the present scholars from the
          U.S., Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia. In honor of the celebratory occasion, moreover, Broadview Press agreed to publish a
            <ref target="https://broadviewpress.com/product/manfred/">special bicentenary edition of <title level="m">Manfred</title></ref> and offer
          complimentary copies of it to all our presenters. </p>
        <p>I would like to thank Jerry McGann—first and foremost—for joining me on this journey. I am also indebted to this volume’s many authors for
          partaking of the two-day event in New York City back in April 2017 as well as for developing these new and fascinating readings of <title
            level="m">Manfred</title>. I am grateful to the NYU Department of English, the University of Virginia Department of English, the Byron
          Society of America, the Keats-Shelley Association of America, and Broadview Press for their generous support. Thank you to the <title
            level="s">Romantic Circles</title> team, including Neil Fraistat, Paul Youngquist, Orrin Wang, David Rettenmaier, and Jeffrey Moro, for
          their assistance with producing this Praxis edition of many essays and supplementary materials—a hybrid volume that seems appropriate to me
          for an edition dedicated to <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Finally, I would like to recognize my research assistant, Hailey Pope, whose
          dedication, precision, and talent have helped to elevate this volume to its current state. </p>
        <p>As this volume marks the bicentenary of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s publication, it indirectly commemorates the 200-year milestone
          of its critical reception. The present essays have, on one hand, drawn significantly on the criticism from the foregoing two centuries in
          order to develop their own interesting and surprising claims. On the other hand, these critics have carved out new and refreshing
          possibilities for Byron’s first drama and, in so doing, have pointed auspiciously toward the future of Byron studies. In preparing the way
          for new readings of the play, they have also highlighted the fundamental place of <title level="m">Manfred: A Dramatic Poem</title> within
          Byron’s oeuvre. </p>
