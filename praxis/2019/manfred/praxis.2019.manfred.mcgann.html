               <p><em>Manfred</em> is a very strange work as Nietzsche, perhaps more than anyone, so well understood.
                  Partly it’s strange because it’s a genre mashup, “A Dramatic Poem” that, like Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, cultivates a medley of tones that constantly shift from grave and exacting reflection
                  to satire and comedy.

               </blockquote>
            <p> Each seems to me an apt comment on <em>Manfred</em>, which is a poem about open secrets, about strange things lying in plain sight. So
               it comes to us like a dream that illuminates the familiar exactly because the world’s
               familiarities estrange the world from us.</p>
            <p>An investigation of those matters might best start with <em>Manfred</em>’s signature problem, the poem’s greatest open secret: the scandalous reference to
               “the Lady Astarte, his—” (III.iii.55). Read biographically—privately—the missing word
               has always been supposed to be “sister” and Manfred’s “half-maddening sin” (II.i.31),
               incest. Everything about the historical context of <em>Manfred</em> supports that reading, which can, and I think should, be glimpsed in <em>Manfred</em>’s keyword: Astarte. We haven’t studied that word, listened to it, closely enough.
               Say it: Astarte. A star. Star is one of the poem’s most prominent motif words. Say
               the name again: Astarte. Augusta. Star. Gus. Once you see or hear that, the echo becomes
               irresistible. Byron called his sister “Gus.” The word Astarte is an exemplary instance
               of a private enigma in an open text. Byron casts Astarte as the traumatic sign for
               Manfred’s estrangement from himself and his world.</p>
            <p>But <em>Manfred</em> is replete with traumatic signs. Traumatic and dramatic. Remember that it is “A Dramatic
               Poem,” not “A Poetic Drama.” The description suggests why it’s so difficult to stage.
               It also suggests that we perhaps do best to approach it as a play of words, which
               is how we approach the plays of Gertrude Stein. The action is primarily in the ways
               the words behave, the plot that they are driven to execute. The simplicity of the
               poem’s surface, its rehearsal of the all-too-familiar Faust legend, is seriously deceptive.
               <em>Manfred</em> is a play full of secrets and, as such, a work whose dangerous words need to be watched
               closely. When we do we discover that its object is to dismantle the authority of the
               myth of Faust, one of the two great myths of Western civilization. Byron would soon
               undertake <em>Don Juan</em> to subject that other great Western myth to a similar critical investigation.</p>
            <p>So let’s look closely at <em>Manfred</em>. Consider three famous passages—first, this reflection on Astarte: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">What is she now?—a sufferer for my sins—</div>
                  <div class="l">A thing I dare not think upon—or nothing. (II.ii.196-7)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> What do we think of those three alternatives Manfred gives for his question “What
               is she now?” In point of fact, “a sufferer for my sins—A thing I dare not think upon—or
               nothing” are far from the only alternatives. But that’s all we get because that’s
               all Manfred at this point can think of. If we pay attention to exactly what Manfred
               says here we ought to be provoked.</p>
            <p>Or consider this exchange with Nemesis: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> What are we to make of the “dead” Astarte being described as “one without a tomb”?
               The remark gives one serious pause in at least two respects. First of all, in an obvious
               sense, it upends the question Nemesis asks. Uncharnel what? Uncharnel one without
               a tomb? But then we also have to wonder how Manfred knows she is tombless, and what
               exactly that could mean.</p>
            <p>The problems metastasize. Consider the action that immediately follows when Nemesis
               actually succeeds in calling up “The Phantom of Astarte.” Commanding her to speak,
               neither he nor Arimanes can manage it. Then Manfred tries with his spasmodic, insistent,
               and ultimately confused prayer since, as he admits, “I know not what I ask, nor what
               I seek: / I feel but what thou art, and what I am” (II.iv.131-2). When Astarte is
               finally induced—<em>prayed</em>—to speak, her words are cryptic, not least of all when Manfred makes his final desperate
               plea: “One word for mercy” (II.iv.154). The word turns out to be Manfred’s name. What
               does that <em>mean</em>?</p>
            <p>From the outset of the poem/play, Manfred has come before us as a person of consummate
               power, knowledge, and decision. But that image of Manfred is also being cunningly
               undermined from the very beginning. Recall, for instance, his move in Act I, scene
               one to summon the “spirits.” A sly comical tone pervades the scene where we watch
               him take three tries to succeed in his conjuration. He didn’t know exactly how to
               proceed. When he finally does hit on the correct formula, we discover something else
               that’s interesting. We see that Manfred didn’t know how those “subordinate” spirits,
               especially the Seventh Spirit, would play tricks on him. That happens because Manfred
               is mistaken when he tells the spirit that there is no “form on earth” he <em>would</em> find “hideous or beautiful” (I.i.184-5). Manfred has unaccountably forgotten that
               the “form” he at once fears and desires isn’t “on earth.” So when the Seventh Spirit
               conjures “The shape of a beautiful female figure,” Manfred falls down “senseless.”
               This is the “shape” or image of Astarte, not her phantom or ghost. “The Phantom of
               Astarte” won’t appear until much later.</p>
            <p>Or remember that he knew he wanted to leap from the crag but hadn’t imagined he would
               be prevented by a Chamois Hunter. Chance intervenes to prevent his suicide. But when
               he leaves the Chamois Hunter—let’s call him Wordsworth, another of <em>Manfred</em>’s secrets—he was free to resume what he began. But he doesn’t. So, we wonder: does
               he <em>really</em> want “Forgetfulness” and “Self-Oblivion”? Do we believe it when he says that he does?
               Does he even want to die? What exactly is Manfred after?</p>
            <p>Or remember that he says he can “call the dead / And ask them what it is we dread
               to be” (II.ii.178-9). But when he does this in Act II scene four, he doesn’t ask Astarte
               that question at all. His prayer to Astarte’s Phantom is largely a confession of his
               bewilderment (“I know not what I ask or what I seek”) until he stumbles at last to
               his desperate request for “One word for mercy.” What are we to make of the Phantom’s
               merciless-merciful answer, “Manfred”?</p>
            <p>Let’s run through some further provoking passages: </p>

            <p> Consider how freighted that final sentence is with the language of Christian theology.
               But here the remark has wrung out the theology that stands behind the words. Manfred
               politely declares how deeply he is in debt “for the grace accorded” to him by Nemesis,
               Arimanes, and the demons. But such creatures are not the agents of grace. Grace is
               accorded by God through Jesus Christ, and this grace then frees you of the debt of
               sin. For anyone—like myself—who has internalized the discourse of grace and debt and
               redemption, the passage is a piece of well-mannered blasphemy. It recalls nothing
               so much as the polite exchanges between Michael and Satan in <em>The Vision of Judgment.</em></p>
            <p>Or consider this remark in his final act of defiance against the authority of the
               demons who come to demand that he fulfill his bargain to live out the great myth of
               Faust. “I do not combat against Death, but thee / And thy surrounding angels” (III.iv.112-3).
               That is surely an odd thing to declare. Had he said, or had Byron written, “And thy
               surrounding <em>demons</em>” both the prosody and the myth would have been preserved intact. The word “angels”
               is seriously intrusive. Are the angels of God hanging around the action of <em>Manfred</em>? When the word comes in here we are flung back in thought to the time when the demons
               were simply rebellious angels “hurled from heaven for sinning” (<em>Don Juan</em> IV.1). That prehistorical event is much on Manfred’s mind throughout.</p>
            <p>These striking passages invite one to think again about what is perhaps <em>Manfred</em>’s greatest passage, the “Incantation” that climaxes and closes Act I scene one. Though
               it begs for a line by line examination, I will confine my comments to a few of the
               most salient passages. First off, recall how it is introduced to us: “A Voice is heard
               in the Incantation which follows.” That is surely far more a direction for reading
               than what it is formally, a stage direction. But it is indeed a stage direction for
               the play of language Byron has mounted. One can easily miss the plain meaning of those
               words: that we should be listening for “A Voice” within the incantation which follows.
               We hear and read an incantation as we hear and read for the subtext that is working
               somehow or other inside. The Incantation is double-talk, both “a magic voice <em>and</em> verse” that—<span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">mirabile dictu</span>—has “baptized [Manfred] with a curse” (I.i.223-4).</p>
            <p>In its most obvious register the Incantation is a curse laid upon Manfred by Manfred
               himself, as the astonishing sixth stanza makes clear: </p>

            <p> Manfred is the ultimate authority for the curse, just as earlier we saw that he could
               command the spirits because his life has been ruled by “a star condemn’d” (I.i.44).
               That would be “Astarte,” who “withered” when she “gazed on” Manfred’s “heart” (II.ii.119).
               It would also be Manfred, since Astarte is “The star which rules [his] destiny” (I.i.110).</p>
            <p>“Wither” is the key, the final word in the “Incantation.” But it is a word within
               which we hear another word, as becomes clear when we pluck each of them out of their

            <p> Wither/whither. That is one of the most provocative as well as one of the most decisive
               wordplays in <em>Manfred</em>. Decisive because it’s so plainly tied to the surface action, the plot as traditionally
               understood. Whither has the withered Astarte gone, whither is the wither-cursed Manfred
               going at the end of the poem? Unlike Manfred, who has pledged allegiance to the Kantian
               proverb, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapere aude</span>, the Abbot dreads to think about that because he can only imagine either heaven or
               hell. But an entirely different “Voice” may be heard in the unreferenced first-person
               pronouns that speak through the Incantation. It is the voice we can only call <em>Manfred</em>. Not Manfred, not Astarte, not even Byron. <em>Manfred</em>, the one word that matches the strange “mercy” being offered by the poem (or is it
               a play?).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Well, as we know, it <em>is</em> a play, a play of language that we are called to pay attention to. Some of the moments
                  announce themselves with an outrageous, comedic directness, as when a spirit says
                  of the “convulsed” Manfred after Astarte departs at the end of Act II: “He would have
                  made an awful spirit” (II.iv.162). Of course, that word means, first of all, “awe-inspiring,”
                  like God Almighty. But a ludic voice is heard in the spirit’s language that Byron
                  would soon let loose (1818) when he published <em>Beppo</em>, written shortly after <em>Manfred</em>. It is a vulgate meaning of “awful” that he received out of his Scots linguistic
                  heritage and that is now perhaps the primary meaning of the word.

                  </div> In <em>Beppo</em>, Byron again puns upon that word, or rather torques and <em>works</em> it, to skewer the pious poet Sotheby as “A stalking oracle of awful phrase” (LXXIV).</p>

            <p>Or consider the three times that <em>Manfred</em> calls up the image of a desert, the psychic place referenced in the contemporary
               lyric “Stanzas to Augusta”: “In the desert a fountain is springing” (45). In <em>Manfred</em> the word is carefully manipulated in order to effect its striking final transformation
               and transvaluation. Here is the word in its first two appearances: </p>

            <p> That spelling, unusual now, was still a common orthographic form in Byron’s time.
               But the word could be—and was by Byron—spelled both ways, and in <em>Manfred</em> Byron exploited the optional spelling to fine effect. The third usage comes in Manfred’s
               climactic act of defiance in the final scene. I shall quote the relevant passage at
               some length because it has some further, equally remarkable and equally salient, word
               plays. </p>

            <p> The pentameter line has, as throughout <em>Manfred</em>, an iambic base, and in this passage, we see that all the lines are quite regular
               until we come to the initial foot of “Born from the knowledge of its own desert.”
               The line opens with an inversion but then quickly resumes its iambic regularity. When
               we reach the final foot of the line, we would have another clear inversion <em>if</em> the word were spelled “desart,” as it was spelled twice before. But here it is spelled
               “desert” and the difference exposes a word play that Byron achieves through prosodic
               ambiguity. If the accent is left to fall on the word’s first syllable, then the line
               echoes the idea (and the word) of “In the desert a fountain is springing.” But if
               it is left to fall on the second syllable, filling out the iambic rhythm, then the
               word means something else. It means “dessert,” and we hear in the line an echo of
               Manfred coming at last to his just desserts.</p>
            <p>Is Byron also playing with the phrase “Born from”? It’s hard to think otherwise. And
               if we look closely at the next four lines, in particular the parallel syntax in the
               statement “I have been . . . my own destroyer and will be my own hereafter,” more
               games with language are in play. “Hereafter” is primarily an adverb and here, at first
               encounter so to speak, that is how we read it. But because the parallelism encourages
               one to read it simultaneously as a noun, the line is made to carry a virtually Nietzchean
               meaning. Note how the word “own,” under these pressures, also slightly shifts its
               meaning the second time around. </p>
            <p>Or what about the comment Nemesis makes after “The Phantom of Astarte” leaves: “She’s
               gone, and will not be recall’d” (II.iv.180). Actually, Astarte will never <em>not</em> be “recall’d” (remembered) exactly because she is, like Manfred himself at the play’s
               conclusion, “gone” forever. As such, she has become what the dead Leila is to the
               Giaour, “The Morning-star of Memory” (1130). This kind of Byronic loss operates according
               to a poetic formula laid out in a lovely little poem Byron wrote shortly after returning
               in 1811 from his Levantine sojourn. Though probably written with John Edleston specifically
               in mind, the verses recall as well three other keenly felt losses: John Wingfield,
               Charles Skinner Matthews, and his mother. </p>

            <p> These are only some of the language games that play about <em>Manfred</em>. I’ve noticed others, and I’ve no doubt that still others have escaped my attention.
               While I leave those to your discovery, it may be useful to recall that <em>Manfred</em>’s structure depends in great part on a handful of keywords like fear [9], mind [11],
               hour [12], “star” [14], voice [15], soul [18], come [31], power [39], earth [46].
               “Gone,” though less frequently repeated, is yet another since it is invoked at three
               of <em>Manfred</em>’s most significant moments: II.iv.155, III.ii.29, and III.iv.152-153. And, of course,
               “spirit” is everywhere, all of them, I believe, transformations of what Manfred calls
               “the inborn spirit” (III.ii.22)—to make a distinction with the spirit or soul of men
               created by God. Such words form a constellation of echoing motifs that recall the
               pervading presence of Manfred’s epipsyche, Astarte, whose being and absent presence
               is specifically linked to music (see I.i.175-9 and II.iv.134-5), as is Manfred’s:

               strangeness of one particular passage that we want to look at carefully. Coming after
               Manfred turns off the Witch of the Alps and her offer to help him gain what he “wishes”
               (II.ii.157), the passage is a kind of gloss on two enigmatic but crucial lines in
               the “Incantation”: “Though thy death shall still seem near / To thy wish, but as a

            <p> No one, I submit, can follow that passage and claim to understand what it is saying
               while it is being read. Even when we excavate its allusions it resists. Part of the
               difficulty is its odd juxtaposition of a mysterious biblical event with a recondite
               episode from Greek history. Perhaps even more obdurate are its rich and cryptic linguistic
               particulars. Consider as well how the fall of that arresting language follows upon
               a phrase—“if they answer not”—that floats in an ambiguous syntactic space. It comes
               at first as a hanging afterthought but then shifts to the opening of a sentence that
               is never completed, the words dissolving into the dark exempla of two men who (vainly)
               sought helpful knowledge from the dead.</p>
            <p>As if anticipating a reader’s puzzlement, Byron added an explanatory note to clarify
               the second of those exempla: <span class="quote">‘The story of Pausanias, king of Sparta, (who commanded the Greeks at the battle of
                  Platea, and afterwards perished for an attempt to betray the Lacedemonians) and Cleonice,
                  is told in Plutarch's life of Cimon; and in the Laconics of Pausanias the Sophist,
                  in his description of Greece. (<em>CPW</em> IV:473)’</span> Such a note only doubles down on the obscure verse. It has all the perversity, though
               none of the slapstick, of those wonderfully preposterous notes Byron attached to <em>The Giaour</em>. Reading this note, one wants to reprise what Byron wrote in <em>Don Juan</em> of Coleridge’s obscure “metaphysics”: “Explaining his poetics to the nation, / We
               wish he’d annotate his annotation” (see <em>Don Juan</em>, “Introduction” II).</p>
            <p>And we <em>could</em> annotate Byron’s annotation, as various editors have. But if we did, the original
               textual problems would scarcely be removed. All the words in the passage still preserve—indeed,
               they positively “fulfill”—their “dubious import.” Certainly, we recognize that Pausanias
               and Cleonice are being offered as types to Manfred’s and Astarte’s antitypes, but
               after we make that equation our reflections on the ancient historical episode that
               Byron elliptically lays out simply run free. “Dubious import”? I <em>guess</em> so! The two sources Byron cites, Plutarch and Pausanias the Sophist, tell very different
               versions of the story. As we pause over a glorious phrase like “Arcadian Evocators,”
               we might well think—or hear—the passage itself as <em>evocative</em>.</p>
            <p>Verse and note are alike seriously <em>pro</em>vocative, inviting us to search out the relevance of Byron’s recollected tale. But
               the language of the passage is such that it erects a kind of maze from its flagrant
               language. Where to begin researching those particulars? Suppose we bracket out everything
               but the central event, the murder of Cleonice, what do we get? This is what Byron’s
               records—not Byron’s note—tell us. Pausanias has taken Cleonice, a princess of Bithynia,
               for his mistress. When she comes at night to his chamber, she accidentally overturns
               the lamp that was burning at his bedside. In the darkness he awakes startled and,
               thinking she is an enemy, kills her with his sword, “unknowing what he slew” (II.ii.186).
               Although the scene vaguely recalls what we were told of Astarte’s death, it is the
               bedside lamp—unmentioned in Byron’s verse or prose note—that leaps to attention, taking
               one back to the very opening line of <em>Manfred</em>: “The lamp must be replenish’d”!</p>
            <p>To register that odd nexus, to make the connection that is at once hidden and invited,
               produces a seriously uncanny effect. Were the deaths of Cleonice and Astarte in some
               unrecognized sense Manfred’s fatality, the condition holding him—before the play or
               even his life began—to his “enduring” vigil? <em>Manfred</em> seems a play of language in which secrets lie about everywhere, awaiting—seeking—discovery.
               This passage fairly defines how <em>Manfred</em> repeatedly “send[s] us prying into the abyss” of its seductive intimations (<em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> IV.166).</p>
            <p>The first person to annotate Byron’s annotation was Goethe, who was interested because
               he knew <em>Manfred</em> had been composed with his own <em>Faust </em>(Part I) in mind. We’ve already heard Peter Manning’s brilliant remarks on Goethe’s
               misreading, but I return to Goethe now because his commentary illuminates why Byron
               found Goethe’s famous poem the perfect vehicle for roughing up the Western myth of
               Faust.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Goethe begins with fulsome praise for what he calls the “wonderful phenomenon” of <em>Manfred</em>, “Byron’s tragedy”: <span class="quote">‘This singular intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from
                     it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the
                     impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them
                     remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot enough admire
                     his genius. (qtd. in <em>Works</em> V:506-7) 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              to make a translation of it for him. It is printed by R. E. Prothero in his edition
                              of The Works of Lord Byron: Letters and Journals (London, 1901) V. 506-507.</span></div>
                     </div>’</span> Searching through “the alterations [Byron] has made” to his poem, Goethe recognizes
                  in <em>Manfred</em> “the quintessence of the most astonishing talent born to be its own tormenter.” Seeing
                  that, admiring it, he then confesses his “dissatisfaction” with <em>Manfred</em>, judging “that the gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last
                  oppressive to us.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>As Peter Manning has pointed out in his essay from this volume, however, Goethe’s
               view is based on a comically mistaken piece of gossip about Byron’s personal sin and
               guilt. Completely absorbed in Byronic mythology, Goethe writes that <span class="quote">‘When a bold and enterprising young man, he won the affections of a Florentine lady.
                  Her husband discovered the amour, and murdered his wife; but the murderer was the
                  same night found dead in the street, and there was no one on whom any suspicion could
                  be attached. Lord Byron removed from Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his
                  life after. ’</span> Guess what? That would be a mashup of the stories of <em>The Giaour</em>, <em>The Corsair</em>, and <em>Lara</em> set in Italy! Believing the Florentine tale to be true, Goethe goes on to argue that
               the Pausanias and Cleonice passage reflects Byron “select[ing] a scene from antiquity,
               appropriat[ing] it to himself, and burden[ing] his tragic image with it.” Byron was
               much amused by Goethe’s fantasy.</p>
            <p>Yet in one obvious sense, Goethe is correct. Byron did select and burden his poem
               and his hero with that tale from antiquity. But Goethe’s reading misfires not so much
               because it is so badly misinformed about Byron’s actual life. It misses its mark because
               <em>Manfred</em> is about as far from what Goethe repeatedly calls it, a “tragedy,” as that famous
               “Greatest Story Ever Told” hovering in <em>Manfred</em>’s background. Although guilt and suffering are the pivot points of both stories—Jesus
               is crucified and Manfred, like Ahab, has “a crucifixion in his face”—their finales
               are in the strictest sense comic.</p>
            <p>Many have understandably glossed <em>Manfred</em>’s climactic scene with the closing lines of his poem “Prometheus,” Byron’s pastiche
               of a chorus from Aeschylus’s lost play <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: “Triumphant where it dares defy / And making death a victory” (58-9). But <em>Manfred</em> does not actually conclude in a posture of triumphant defiance. That moment comes
               in the poem’s penultimate scene, when the demons are dismissed. The finale comes afterwards
               and centers in Manfred’s famous, even complacent, last words: “Old man! ’tis not so
               difficult to die.” After the fitful fevers of his life, Manfred expects to sleep well.</p>
            <p>Most telling, Manfred’s last words echo St. Paul’s gloss on the meaning of the life
               of Jesus, a tale whose argument is “that ye put off . . . the old man . . . and put
               on the new man” (Ephesians 4: 22-24). Christian theology regards the life, death,
               and resurrection of Jesus as a fundamentally comic action, a view gloriously represented
               in Dante’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la"><em>Divina Commedia</em></span>. <em>Manfred</em> is a comic action as well, but, being a kind of parody of the Christian story, it
               also involves a series of comical texts that help to build up the insidious, truly
               Nietzschean, joke on which <em>Manfred</em> concludes. The last state of Manfred is far different from the first.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>Manfred</em>, Goethe said, “closely touched me,” and it is easy to see that <em>Faust</em> Part II marshals an argument against the “unbounded and exuberant despair” that he
                  found so “oppressive” in <em>Manfred</em>. We know that in December 1816 Goethe had sketched out a plan for Part II, but that
                  plan did not indicate exactly how Part II would end. It seems that reading <em>Manfred</em> in 1817, which Goethe did, set him on his course to bring Faust to the redemption
                  he receives in Part II Act V when angels “bear Faust’s immortal essence” into heaven.
                  The redeemed Faust is exalted because his struggles have purified him: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="speaker">FAUST</div>
                     <div class="stanza">

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> As Goethe told Eckermann in 1831, he wanted Part II to move beyond the tragic action
                  of Part I—he saw Part I as a tragedy—to install a poetic conception that “harmonizes
                  perfectly with our religious views; according to which we can obtain heavenly bliss,
                  not through our strength alone, but with the assistance of divine grace.”

               <p>I bring up Goethe and Part II of <em>Faust</em> in order to spell out the sharp differences between their respective comedies. In
                  a late letter Goethe said that Part II was organized around a set of “very seriously
                  intended jests (<em>Scherzen</em>).”

                           reprinted in the first (1976) Norton Critical Edition of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's
                           Faust. A Tragedy, op. cit. ed., 603-615.</span></div>
                  </div> These enable the work’s economy of grace and the redemption of Faust. But the comedy
                  of <em>Manfred</em> is different—indeed, it is deeply irreverent. Manfred has no interest in either atonement
                  or redemption (“What I have done is done”). He rejects both as clearly as had Byron
                  throughout his life.</p>
            </div>
            <p>What has happened in Byron’s poem that has brought Manfred to his peaceful death?
               Consider again the Pausanias and Cleonice passage, in this case the opening lines:
               </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="speaker">MANFRED</div>

                  <div class="l">The sternest answer can but be the Grave,</div>
                  <div class="l">And that is nothing. </div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Though Manfred indeed has “no natural fear” (I.i.25), though he is proud and defiant
               in face of all circumstance, he is nonetheless wracked by fear. Indeed, he sees his
               life’s purpose not to overcome but exactly to “champion human fears” (II.ii.205).</p>
            <p>So, what <em>is</em> it “that we dread to be,” that Manfred dreads to be, and that he means to champion?
               He calls the dead, Astarte, to find out. The consequence of their interview at the
               end of Act II, and of Manfred’s fearfully tormented prayer to her, is the entirely
               untormented Act III. The psychic change in Manfred is dramatic. We know, we can see,
               what has happened: in the end, Manfred has no fears at all, natural or unnatural.
               We want to know why. What is it that we’re <em>not</em> seeing?</p>
            <p>It helps to recall that Astarte declares “Manfred” the “one word for mercy.” In addition,
               it helps to parse the cunning wordplays in “what it is we dread to be . . . that is
               nothing.” One can scarcely not think of Hamlet’s famous soliloquy and the “consummation
               devoutly to be wished” that Hamlet could not, however, commit to. Before his interview
               with Astarte, Manfred dreads to be mortal and therefore finally “nothing.” Manfred’s
               is the Faustian fear <em>to be</em> mortal, simply to be Manfred: unpurified, unatoned, unredeemed, and—finally—“gone”:
               “of the earth, earthy,” and then at last—to appropriate and shift the Abbot’s final
               word—“earthless.”</p>
            <p>A letter Byron wrote in 1819 to Richard Hoppner helps to gloss the meaning of the
               Byronic “mercy” exposed in <em>Manfred</em>. Visiting Bologna, he stopped at the Certosa Cemetery and was deeply moved by the
               epitaphs engraved on the tombs of Martini Luigi and Lucrezia Pinini: “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="ro" lang="ro">implora pace</span>,” “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="it" lang="it">implora eterna quiete</span>”. “It appears to me,” he wrote, “that these two and three words comprise and compress
               all that can be said on the subject—and then in Italian they are absolute Music” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:147). That would be the absolute music of, say, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, not the Music of the Spheres.</p>
            <p>The comedy of <em>Manfred</em> has set the agenda for the soon-to-be-written <em>Beppo</em> and <em>Don Juan.</em> One thinks of Byron’s cheeky reply to John Murray’s request to give up <em>Don Juan</em> and write “a great work,” something serious—an “epic”! <span class="quote">‘I'll try no such thing; I hate tasks. And then “seven or eight years!” God send us
                  all well this day three months, let alone years. . . . You have so many “divine” poems,
                  is it nothing to have written a human one? without any of your worn-out machinery?
                  (April 6, 1819, <em>BLJ</em> VI:105)’</span> <em>Manfred</em> has a lot of worn out poetical—and religious—machinery. Indeed, the whole point of
               <em>Manfred</em> was to give that machinery its final <em>quietus</em>. Reading it in 1817, Murray and his editorial committee were uneasy, and especially
               with the outrageous comedy of the original third act where the Abbot is manhandled
               by Astarte’s dark double, Ashtaroth, who carries him off singing a profane jingle.
               They begged him to rewrite it, and he did. But, by 1819, Byron was no longer open
               to such pleas, having seen the first two cantos of <em>Don Juan</em> expurgated without his knowledge or permission.</p>
            <p>And yet perhaps <em>Manfred</em> was improved by taking out those Monty Python hijinks. The work’s impious argument
               loses none of its force, or comic charm, for being better mannered.</p>
