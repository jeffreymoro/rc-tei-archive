            <p class="noCount">As Manfred glimpses “the last infirmity of evil” from his position on the Jungfrau,
               he confronts a post-moral order dependent on a particular kind of relinquishment,
               the obverse of the forgiveness that Shelley’s Prometheus attains at the outset of
               his play. He claims prematurely, “I have ceased / To justify my deeds unto myself,”
               and his pursuit of such a mental and moral state in fact determines the action of
               the remainder of the play, just as his initial voiced desire for “forgetfulness” and
               “self-oblivion” must be achieved. At this early point in the play, Manfred’s solitude
               is “peopled with the furies,” just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tortured on his rock
               by Jupiter’s “hounds of hell.” Both heroes have something to get over: Prometheus,
               his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. Going (like Nietzsche) beyond good and
               evil, Manfred represents an existential Romantic heroism in sharp contrast to Shelley’s
               messianic version; his humor is the golden laughter of a careless god.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p> This essay amounts essentially to an extended footnote to those lines—and particularly
               to those final clauses: “for I have ceased to justify my deeds unto myself—the last
               infirmity of evil.” I hope to expose some unresolved energies or faultlines in this
               passage that divide the moral vision of the play. As the driving action throughout,
               Manfred pursues a certain kind of cessation or relinquishment, the dark twin or obverse
               of the repentance and recalled curse that determines Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. Manfred tells the Witch of the Alps that his solitude is “peopled with the Furies”
               (I.ii.131), just as Shelley’s Prometheus is tormented on his rock by Jupiter’s “tempest-walking
               hounds,” who show him visions of his own terrors (<em>Promtheus Unbound</em> I.331). That is, both heroes are tortured by furies that are also interior anxieties
               and fears (one might say that the various scenes of supernatural aggression in both
               works are essentially records of panic attacks). Both heroes have something to get
               over: Prometheus, his vengeance and Manfred, his conscience. <em>Manfred</em> the play offers a mordant, Byronic version of the thesis that Shelley will also advance
               in his philosophical psychodrama: you become a demi-god by giving things up. In relinquishing
               his anger, Shelley’s hero regenerates the cosmos and also makes himself oddly irrelevant:
               his Puff-the-Magic-Dragon-like retreat to a cave where he will sit with Asia “as the
               world ebbs and flows” (III.iii.24) marks both his ascension and retreat into pair-bonded
               solipsism. Manfred’s quest is more ostentatiously self-centered, and yet he pursues
               a form of emptying out that might negate the self entirely. <em>Manfred</em> is a dead reckoning of the negative way.</p>
            <p>So, to begin: how do we gloss these lines? The interpretive problem starts with the
               quadruple negative, further destabilized by one of Byron’s ambiguous dashes: “I have
               <em>ceased</em> / To justify my deeds unto myself— / The <em>last infirmity</em> of <em>evil</em>.” Two primary questions arise. First, is it the <em>justification</em> of one’s ill deeds, or the <em>cessation</em> of that justification, that Byron intends as “the last infirmity of evil”? The dash
               makes it possible for the final phrase to govern either the infinitive (“To justify
               my deeds unto myself”) or the entire preceding clause (“<em>I have ceased</em> to justify my deeds unto myself”). Second, by “the last infirmity of evil,” does
               Byron mean the <em>ultimate stage </em>of evil, or the <em>last remaining flaw</em> in evil’s otherwise-perfect constitution?</p>
            <p>Maybe Milton can help. Byron’s “last infirmity” phrasing adapts a passage from “Lycidas”:
               </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l"><em>Fame</em> is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise</div>
                  <div class="l">(That last infirmity of Noble mind)</div>
                  <div class="l">To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes. (70-3)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> For Milton, “last infirmity” means the final remaining weakness after all other errors
               have been purged. “Fame is the spur,” but it also remains a recognizable flaw in a
               “Noble mind” that should be above concerns for applause and praise. Moreover, Milton
               himself is here adapting a line from Tacitus’s <em>Histories</em> (IV.6): “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">etiam sapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur</span> (the desire for glory is the last thing relinquished, even by wise men). So, as Byron
               inherited the phrase, “last infirmity” meant the final weakness to be overcome or
               shed, the longest-lived flaw. But “last infirmity of evil” complicates the question—since
               evil itself can be thought of as infirmity, and thus the “last infirmity” would be
               in fact the crowning weakness, the consummate infirmity, the final summit or stage
               of descent into pure evil.</p>
            <p>We are left with two options so far: whatever the phrase “the last infirmity of evil”
               modifies, that thing is either the last grace, the final scrap of goodness that mitigates
               evil (a “last infirmity” in the mode of Milton and Tacitus), <em>or</em> the last step on the ladder of degeneracy, the ultimate state of sin. So, what does
               the phrase modify? Well, again we have two primary opposing choices: either the claim
               “I have <em>ceased</em> to justify my deeds unto myself” or the infinitive “to justify my deeds unto myself”—that
               is, either self-justification or the cessation of it. These oppositions, then, ultimately
               resolve into two primary interpretive choices, once you cancel out the positives and
               negatives: self-justification is either the worst thing or the last hope in the moral
               vision of Byron’s play.</p>
            <p>Jerome McGann has indicated that he sees <em>Manfred</em> as a critique of hypocrisies and an exposure of self-deceptions. He writes in <em>Byron and Romanticism</em>: “We are sinners who want to cover our sins, to mitigate their depth. This desire
               is precisely ‘the last infirmity of evil’ that Byron wrote his play to engage” (92).
               In this view, self-justification arises from a guilty conscience, and manifests itself
               in a dangerous sense of righteousness. Plenty of evidence suggests that this was Byron’s
               view, particularly around the time of the composition of <em>Manfred</em>, when he was angry at Lady Byron and her allies and raging over the hypocrisies of
               English society. The “Incantation” from <em>Manfred </em>is precisely an “In-<em>cant</em>-tation,” a curse on cant and an excoriation of the “false tears,” “serpent smile,”
               “unfathomed gulfs of guile,” and the “shut soul’s hypocrisy” that were at once Annabella’s,
               her maid Mary Jane Clermont’s, and Byron’s own—not to mention those of Castlereagh
               and Romilly, whom he hated (I.i.201-71). Those who justify their deeds unto themselves
               adopt an essentially Satanic moral posture, reversing the polarities of good and evil—“Evil
               be thou my Good” (<em>Paradise Lost</em> IV.110)—something like James Hogg’s <em>Justified Sinner</em>, who is far more dangerous, far more evil, because of his sense of righteousness.
               Robespierre and the Terror stand somewhere in the near distance. As Alan Liu writes
               of the French Revolution, <span class="quote">‘Thus where the plot of the Revolutionary tragedy might have remained the angry sentence,
                  “war demands sacrifice,” Justice at last legitimized demand to make the sentence read,
                  with an assurance and dignity so supernal that we might well think of the angel-interpreter
                  comforting Hagar: “war <em>justifies</em> sacrifice.” (159)’</span> In other words, to justify evil is to weaponize it, to make it active as not only
               necessary, but “good.” In such a view, to cease in this self-righteous activity and
               admit one’s hypocrisies would be a prelude to confession: self-justification becomes
               the worst stage of evil, while its cessation is the first step and the last grace
               that might lead to redemption.</p>
            <p>The problem with this reading, of course, is that Manfred hardly appears redeemed
               on the Jungfrau. Quite the contrary, he feels a “barrenness of spirit” as if he has
               become his “own soul’s sepulchre” (I.ii.26-7). The general thrust of the passage suggests
               a state of dejection and acedia, as if Manfred has yielded up moral questions in despair.
               He has ceased to justify his deeds, ceased to provide morally or ethically inflected
               accounts of his actions, even to himself, and thus attained the summit of evil, having
               given in to the “last infirmity” in “this long disease my life,”—to allude to the
               title of McGann’s keynote address, and to Pope (Pope, “Epistle” 132). In such a state,
               Manfred hears no voice of conscience, not even a perjured one: he just gives up and
               does what he wants—except he only wants what he can’t have: forgetfulness, oblivion,
               forgiveness, Astarte. In this view, self-justification is the last grace, and its
               abandonment signifies a descent into the slough of sin’s infirmity. Yet Manfred still
               glimpses evil from where he stands: he has not yet moved to a place where “evil” as
               such ceases to exist—his conscience is not totally gone. Making this statement, he
               voices a judgment on himself, meaning he has not stepped beyond moral calculation,
               even though he finds himself on the dizzy brink of complete amorality. He still wants
               to forget, which means he still remembers; and he will soon plead Astarte for forgiveness,
               which means he still feels guilt and remorse. It’s not over yet: on the Jungfrau,
               Manfred is not yet beyond good and evil.</p>
            <p>In his opening soliloquy, Manfred asserts a post-mortal perspective, claiming that

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> In this comprehensive devaluation of “all I see in other beings”—good, evil, life,
               powers, passions—and of his own feelings for earthly things—dread, fear, hopes, wishes,
               and love—Manfred asserts a cold impermeability to human existence. But there are two
               things he has not renounced: nature and himself—or, more accurately, the beauty of
               the external world and his own tormented conscience. Getting over these things will
               occupy him for the rest of the play. We observe a series of encounters with natural
               scenes—from the Jungfrau, to the personified Witch of the Alps, to his farewell to
               the sun, and finally, to his address to the moon shining on the mountains—all of which
               involve varying degrees of longing and admiration. He says on the Jungfrau, “Beautiful!
               how beautiful is all this visible world,” but he rejects the Witch of the Alps whose
               beauty might have redeemed him in a Wordsworthian vein, and he concludes his thoughts
               on the Coliseum remembering how the moonlight left </p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The turn from nature (moonlight on the Alps) to memory (moonlight on the Coliseum)
               and thence to “silent worship of . . . / The dead” marks a transition away from external
               beauty to internal experience, in a recognizably Byronic mode of transfiguration (III.iv.39-40).</p>
            <p>In admitting that other spirits rule his spirit, Manfred edges closer to the final
               renunciation the drama requires. Despite the ostensible defiance and willfulness of
               the last scene, he undergoes his final relinquishment: essentially, he gets over himself.
               And his last gesture—to reach for the hand of another human (either Manuel or the
               Abbot, depending on the version)—suggests a last abandonment of his walled interior
               stronghold. Perhaps now finally, truly giving up on self-justification, he moves past
               evil to another order—and I am thinking here of Nemesis saying of Astarte, “She is
               not of our order” (II.iv.115). In an entry on “applause” in <em>The Gay Science</em>, Nietzsche has occasion to quote the Tacitus passage on the desire for glory: <span class="quote">‘The thinker does not need applause or the clapping of hands, provided he be sure
                  of the clapping of his own hands: the latter, however, he cannot do without. Are there
                  men who could also do without this, and in general without any kind of applause? I
                  doubt it: and even as regards the wisest, Tacitus, who is no calumniator of the wise,
                  says: <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima exuitur</span> -- that means with him: never. (sec. 330, p. 144)’</span> Here we glimpse the case of Manfred, beyond self-justification and beyond Nietzsche’s
               limits, one who believes he can do without the clapping even of his own hands: “I
               have ceased to justify my deeds unto myself,” even though that renunciation is always
               the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">novissima exuiter</span>, the last thing to go. To escape his self-imposed torments, the bite of conscience,
               Manfred must also abandon his self-regard: only then, as a kind of stoic empty vessel,
               can he achieve the calmness of his passing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As I suggested at the outset of this talk, much of <em>Manfred</em> might be understood as the record of a panic attack or nervous breakdown, with the
                  last lines as aftermath. The same thing happens to Prometheus in the first act of
                  Shelley’s drama: one of the Furies says to him, “we will rend thee . . . nerve from
                  nerve, working like fire within” (I.475-6) before she and her sisters torment him
                  with scenes of his worst fears and causes for despair. To triumph over these attacks,
                  Prometheus and Manfred both have to let it go: the past, the struggle, the violently-defended
                  self. For Manfred, this means a move from the murky Gothic “witch-drama” he has been
                  inhabiting towards the high equipoise of classical tragedy. As the play progresses,
                  Manfred seems less of a Shakespearean and more of a Sophoclean or Senecan protagonist,
                  quoting the last words of Nero to the Abbot—“It is too late” (III.i.98)—and thinking
                  of the Roman Coliseum shortly before his death.

                           conversation with the Abbot (III.i). Manfred’s self-identification with the stoic
                           suicide of a noble Roman indicates an affinity with Classical tragic heroism. His
                           famous meditation on the Roman Coliseum occurs at the beginning of Act III, scene

                  </div> His final words, “Tis not so difficult to die” (III.iv.151), strike a distinctly classical
                  note, the culmination of this trend. In partial confirmation, a contemporary reader
                  of <em>Manfred</em> made marginal pencil notes in Greek in an 1817 copy of the second edition (Figure
                  1). The lines are from Sophocles’ <em>Ajax</em>, which our reader heard echoed in Manfred’s farewell address to the sun in Act III,
                  scene two: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">And you that drive your chariot up the steep</div>
                        <div class="l">Of Heaven, Lord Helios . . . you,</div>
                        <div class="l">Sweet gleam of daylight now before my eyes,</div>
                        <div class="l">Sun-God, splendid charioteer, I greet you</div>
                        <div class="l">For this last time and never any more.<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        <div class="l">O radiance, O my home, and hallowed ground (II.845-6, 856-9)</div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Or, as Manfred says in part, “thou dost rise, / And shine, and set in glory. Fare
                  thee well! / I ne'er shall see thee more” (III.ii.23-5). Taking his leave of nature
                  and his place among the noble minds of classical antiquity, giving into or finally
                  shedding his last infirmities, Manfred becomes a hero by losing himself, for good…and
                  evil.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">As McGann notes, Byron “applies Suetonius’ account of the death of Nero (<em>Lives of the Caesars</em>, VI. Chapter 49) to the suicide of Otho, Rome’s sixth emperor,” in Manfred’s conversation
               with the Abbot (III.i). Manfred’s self-identification with the stoic suicide of a
               noble Roman indicates an affinity with Classical tragic heroism. His famous meditation
               on the Roman Coliseum occurs at the beginning of Act III, scene four.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
