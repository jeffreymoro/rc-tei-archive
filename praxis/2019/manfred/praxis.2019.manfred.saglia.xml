            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">Voice in Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a vehicle for authorial power, as
                well as representing an unstable force that may turn against those that wield it—and thus 
                primarily against the protagonist. Placed at the nexus of the physical and
                the spiritual, the human and the non-human, voice is a structural theme in the play,
                relating to spiritual and transcendental issues on the one hand, and questions of
                theatrical performance typical of the Romantic-period stage on the other.
                Multiplying the forms and meanings of utterance, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                foregrounds, explores, and valorizes voice, which in turn oscillates between a
                deceivingly singular denotation and an unstoppable process of proliferating
                connotations. In Byron’s dramatic poem, voice and voicing delineate a field of
                contacts, overlaps, and tensions, concentrating its questions about identity, power,
                authority, and control, as well as transcendental and social forms of
                interconnection or separation. This essay demonstrates that the process of
                transiting on which Byron’s play is predicated is crucially rooted in the dual
                nature of voice, its function as an instrument for conjuring and materializing, and
                its problematic relevance in the theater of the time.</p>

            <p>The earliest occurrence of “voice” in <title level="m">Manfred</title> appears in Act
                I, scene one where it resonates through the protagonist’s own voice as he invokes
                the spirits who will be carrying out his “task” (I.i.28):<quote>
                    <div type="poetry">
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>. . . Now by the voice of him</l>
                        <l>Who is the first among you—by this sign,</l>
                        <l>Which makes you tremble—by the claims of him</l>
                        <l>Who is undying,—Rise! appear!—Appear! (I.i.37-40)</l>
                    </lg></div></quote>
                Discussing this first mention of a “voice” in the text, Jerome McGann notes that:
                “This is one of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s keywords and should be tracked
                carefully through the poem. Ultimately, the ‘voice’ that ‘is the first among’ the
                spirits and the other characters in the poem, including Manfred himself, is Byron’s,
                the artificer of the entire imaginative work” (Byron <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                note to l.37). As Manfred carries out his first act of conjuring, the iteration of
                “by” informs the invocation and its mantra-like tone, its incremental repetition
                awarding a more than human authority to the protagonist’s speech and language of
                power based on explicit lexis (“power upon you,” [I.i.36]), vocatives (“Mysterious
                Agency,” [I.i.28]), and imperatives (“Rise! appear!” [I.i.36]). Ironically, however,
                all this is turned against Manfred later in the same Act and scene by the 
                “<emph>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</emph>” (<title level="m">CPW</title> 
                IV:60), which curses him in a similarly structured stanza (“By thy
                cold breast and serpent smile, / By thy unfathom’d gulfs of guile,” I.i.242-3). If
                voice stands for the power of authorship, it also represents an unstable force that
                may turn against those who wield it. At the same time, in both occurrences voice
                crucially functions as an interface between the physical and the spiritual, the
                human and the non-human.</p>
            <p>As James Mulholland suggests, a possible definition of “voice studies” pivots on
                their “use [of] voice as an analytic with which to understand the creation of
                literary texts and the process of reading in a sensate, aural world” (10-1), while
                their area of investigation focuses on forms of “textual virtualization” of voice
                that center on “the relationship among voice, self, and authority” (3, 13).
                Addressing these concerns, virtualizations of voice in Romantic-era literature
                function as a point of convergence of issues related to the production and reception
                of texts. In this respect, Susan Eilenberg has offered illuminating insights into
                Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetics by examining what happens “when a poet opens
                his mouth and somebody else’s voice comes out,” thus also raising questions about
                “the source of the poetic voice and the meaning of authorship” (3). Yet, questions
                of voice also present cultural implications that range beyond the perimeters of the
                text and bring into focus a whole range of issues of a corporeal, material, and
                ideological kind.</p>
            <p>In this light, the foregrounding of voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> points to
                another level of significance, one that is more prosaic than those listed so far, as
                well as a frequently overlooked one: voice is the highly problematic vehicle for
                theatrical performance in Romantic-period drama (Nuss 7-8). Indeed, it was a major
                concern for Joanna Baillie, the foremost dramatic and theatrical theorist of the
                age. In the “Introductory Discourse” to her first volume of <title level="m">Plays
                    on the Passions</title> (1798), she linked voice, power, and dramatic effectiveness
                by remarking that, when passions are made to “raise their voice, the power of
                distinguishing themselves has been taken away” (92). Later, in the Preface 
                <title level="a">To the Reader</title> to her third volume of 
                <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> (1812),
                she noted that: “The Public have now to choose between what we shall suppose are
                well-written and well-acted plays, the words of which are . . . heard but
                imperfectly . . . and splendid pantomime, or pieces whose chief object is to produce
                striking scenic effect” (<title level="m">Works</title> 231). A playtext in which
                these preoccupations coalesced in remarkably effective ways was Coleridge’s 
                <title level="m">Remorse</title>, the most successful stage tragedy of the period,
                which Byron knew and appreciated, and which seems to have left some traces in his
                own output (Cochran 70-2). The “splendid pantomime” in <title level="m">Remorse</title> 
                was its celebrated conjuring scene, which mixed magic, pantomime,
                voice (through an incantation, as in <title level="m">Manfred</title>), music, and a
                variety of visual effects. And this imbrication of voice inside a complex
                textual-performative continuum brings us back to <title level="m">Manfred</title>,
                which presents a similar array of practices and devices borrowed from the
                contemporary stage (Martin 107-16). In Byron’s “dramatic poem,” however, voice is
                also a specifically pre-eminent textual item (one of its key-words, as McGann says),
                structuring the play’s construction of a transcendental reality that mirrors and
                questions material reality.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    On the “spiritual” nature of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, see Byron’s letter 
                    to Thomas Moore of 25 March 1817, where he humorously calls it a “mad Drama” and 
                    a “Bedlam tragedy” in which, he exaggeratedly adds, “all the <emph>dram. pers.</emph> 
                    are spirits, ghosts, or magicians” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:188).</note> 
                In <title level="m">Manfred</title>, Byron problematizes this connection and its liminal 
                or transitional status by investing consistently in voice and voicing, which he knew 
                to be major issues for playwrights, actors, and audiences owing to the enormous sizes of 
                the main theaters and because of the increasing popularity and influence of melodrama, in 
                which voice is constantly on the point of being submerged by silence or music.</p>
            <p>In tracing the connections between <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the
                contemporary stage, Philip Martin defined the play as an attempt at “modernizing the
                Gothic drama” (107), whereas more recently Jeffrey Cox has interpreted it as a
                critical revision of melodrama, Gothic or otherwise (76-8). Cox pointedly reads 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> as “a response to the melodrama and its evocation of
                perpetual war” (60), the latter being his phrase for the state of continued tension
                in Europe and the world following the peace ostensibly decreed by Waterloo and the
                Congress of Vienna. A reaction to melodrama’s reactionary endorsement of a
                “restoration of order” (60), <title level="m">Manfred</title> is “an after-war play
                that challenges the main form of post-war drama, the melodrama, in order to suggest
                a quite different response to the post-Waterloo world” (67). Accordingly, from Cox’s
                perspective, Byron’s play was “the serious drama of the post-Waterloo moment that
                was missing from the 1815-1816 season” (67). As such, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                adopts and at the same time contests the distinctive features of melodrama, one of
                which is voice, since, as Peter Brooks remarks, the melodramatic mode is typically
                informed by a “desire to express all” (4). In melodrama, “nothing is left unsaid” as
                “characters stand on stage and utter the unspeakable, give voice to their deepest
                feelings” (4).</p>
            <p>Reworking these various premises and contexts, <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                multiplies the potential and import of utterance and, in doing so, foregrounds,
                explores, and valorizes them. In turn, voice and voicing take on a complex series of
                meanings that oscillate between a deceivingly singular denotation and an unstoppable
                process of proliferating connotations.</p>
            <p>After Manfred’s act of conjuring, “<emph>a voice is heard singing</emph>”
                (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:54), a voice that echoes and answers his own
                voice, yet is a bodiless and unlocated sound. As McGann highlights, this voice is
                unattributed (it is unclear whose voice it is) and unplaced (we do not know where it
                comes from). These complications are then compounded by the fact that “the stage
                direction signals that a social space exists in a dimension not explicitly present
                to the named characters,” so that the stage direction itself “emerges as a character
                who is aware of that social space, and who plays a major role in the action of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (Byron <title level="m">Manfred</title> note to
                ll.191-2). In addition, this bodiless and unlocated voice is a nod to the
                onstage/offstage dynamic typical of Romantic-period drama and especially Gothic
                drama, which constituted a major “location of in/visible actions and meanings” that
                “reinforce[d] and expand[ed] the tendency of Gothic theater to transgress the divide
                between on- and offstage, visible and invisible, real and imaginary” (Saglia
                “Theater” 362). A linking element shuttling between stage direction and dramatic
                text, voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> contributes to creating
                trans-dimensional interconnections, a process which is the play’s central textual
                concern as well as its distinctive performative trait.</p>
            <p>The connective function carried out by voice takes a variety of shapes from the
                outset. In the opening scene, it combines and contrasts sweetness and harshness,
                when Manfred blandishes the Spirits by saying: “‘I hear / Your voices, sweet and
                melancholy sounds, / As music on the waters’” (I.i.175-7). However, later in the
                same scene, the “<emph>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</emph>” adopts
                a very different tone, the angry invective of a curse, which encapsulates other, far

                Because the planes connected by voice are also those of power and disempowerment,
                Manfred’s use of voice as an instrument of authority in Act I, scene one is
                significantly short-lived, since it is immediately turned against him in this
                revision of the balance between the human and super-human. </p>
            <p>That the voice “<emph>in the Incantation</emph>” is one of the outstanding
                enigmatic features in Byron’s text is immediately visible from the very phrase 
                “<emph>in the Incantation</emph>,” seemingly intimating that the voice is
                inside the incantation it is uttering, that it not so much its source but rather an
                attribute or a feature of it. McGann sees <title level="m">Manfred</title> as “a
                crucial work in Byron’s career” and his ongoing contention with the Romantic
                imagination, since it “fully objectifies the self-destructiveness of this [betraying
                and betrayed] imagination” and promotes “the deconstruction of the self-deceived and
                self-destructive Romantic imagination” and its treacherously solipsistic
                propensities (“Brain” 64). McGann reads this process of deconstruction as deeply
                embedded in the Incantation, where the voice that “speaks the truth over the
                unconscious Manfred” is in fact “the silenced voice of Astarte,” a kind of audible
                absence conveying “her spectrous form of libido” as well as unveiling the betrayals
                of the imagination (64-5). From another perspective, Timothy Morton has drawn
                attention to the “offstage” quality of the voice “in the Incantation,” which
                “emanates from a hidden source” and constitutes what he terms an “acousmatic voice”
                (161). This mysterious voice works to convey “a sense of space that fills the
                auditorium” and is thus “necessarily synaesthetic”—a bridge between the play’s
                phantasmatic dimensions and its physical and material conditions of production, on
                the one hand, and its impact on reader or spectator, on the other (160).</p>
            <p>Although they pursue different interpretative agendas, these critical insights share
                an interest in how voice in <title level="m">Manfred</title> connects the material and
                the immaterial, functioning as a lynchpin between bodied and disembodied states.
                Aptly, therefore, Act I, scene two features a reference to voice, as Manfred
                expresses a wish to escape his own body:<quote>
                   <div type="poetry"><lg type="stanza">
                        <l>. . . Oh, that I were</l>

                        <l>A living voice, a breathing harmony,</l>
                        <l>A bodiless enjoyment—born and dying</l>
                        <l>With the blest tone which made me! (I.ii.52-6)</l>
                    </lg></div></quote>
                Here Byron explores the liminal zone between physical presence and evanescence
                through the imagery and medium of voice. On one side, this vision relates to the
                theme of physical dissolution that runs through the play and emerges in such potent
                formulations as “Earth! take these atoms!” (I.ii.109). On the other, it unveils the
                text’s connections with contemporary stage Gothic, which was a crucial cultural site
                for the elaboration of ideas of embodiment, as well as reflections on corporeality
                and its links to selfhood. Multiform and constantly renovating itself, stretching
                all the way from the 1760s to the 1820s and beyond (if we take Horace Walpole’s 1768 
                <title level="m">The Mysterious Mother</title> as its starting point), stage
                Gothic developed a complex series of engagements with physicality, ranging from the
                overwhelmingly material body of the villain to the dissolving body of the specter
                (Saglia “Staging” 166-7).</p>
            <p>Surfacing several times in the text, this doubleness is in full view in the Abbot’s
                description of Manfred’s confused condition in Act III: “an awful chaos—light and 
                darkness— / And mind and dust—and passions and pure thoughts / Mix’d, and contending 
                without end or order” (III.i.164-6). Yet, Byron most effectively translates 
                this binary couple of “excessively bodied” and
                “hauntingly disembodied” conditions through the couple Manfred-Astarte; and when the
                text awards a voice to the latter, it complicates further the already problematic
                status of the ghost in Gothic drama and its knot of aesthetic, cultural, and
                ideological stumbling blocks, such as how it should move, speak, and be dressed, or
                whether it should be represented on stage at all (Gamer 131-4; Saggini 166-7).
                Oscillating between presence and absence, the ghostly utterance in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> bestows a whole new range of meanings on voice, 
                placing it as a point of convergence between existence and non-existence. </p>
            <p>These preoccupations appear, in subtly allusive form, during Manfred’s exchange with
                the Chamois Hunter in Act II:<quote>
                   <div type="poetry"><lg type="stanza">
                        <l>MANFRED: Away, away! There’s blood upon the brim!</l>

                        <l>Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from heaven,</l>
                        <l>Where thou art not—and I shall never be. (II.i.21-30)</l></lg></div>
                    </quote>
                As the Chamois Hunter reacts by calling Manfred a “Man of strange words” and inviting
                him to show “patience,” Manfred replies: “Patience and patience! Hence—that word was
                made / For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!” (II.i.31-6).</p>
            <p>Manfred has just been rescued from jumping off the edge of the Jungfrau. He has been
                removed from a position of liminality and oscillation between solidity and
                dissolution (he was “<emph>in act to spring from the cliff</emph>” [<title level="m">
                    CPW</title> IV:66]), his atoms on the point of returning to the great
                whirlpool of cosmic matter. Through language and voice, however, he continues to
                exist within a state of oscillation between different dimensions. The Chamois Hunter
                interprets this uncertain condition prosaically, telling him bluntly “thy senses
                wander from thee” (II.i.23), and thus positing a dissociation between body and mind,
                the material and immaterial components of the human. Manfred, instead, reinforces
                the oscillation by expanding on the implications of “blood,” the prime substance of
                physical and physiological life, which immediately becomes a reference to the
                consanguinity between him and Astarte that caused their passion (also associated
                with blood) to become criminal. In all this, the blood that was “shed” and the blood
                “[c]olouring the clouds” are the visible as well as symbolic signs of the sin that
                excludes him from “heaven.” Finally, the sense of liminality is summed up in
                Manfred’s description of heaven as the place “[w]here thou art not—and I shall never
                be,” a sentence that conjures up Byron’s distinctive preoccupation with “not being”
                somewhere, which complements what Stephen Cheeke has identified as Byron’s triadic
                concern with “[b]eing there, being in-between, having been there” (14).</p>
            <p>With a subsequent move, the text brings these locational shifts back into the fold of
                language and voicing. The Chamois Hunter associates Manfred with unusual language
                (“strange words”), a remark that doubles as an assessment of his uttering and
                voicing: Manfred’s words are strange both semantically (they do not make sense
                according to customary logic) as well as performatively (they are emphatic,
                overcharged). The hunter reacts to Manfred with a word, “patience,” that invites him
                to curb his semantic and performative unruliness alike, and which Manfred scornfully
                rejects by conjuring up another dissociation (“brutes of burthen” as opposed to
                “birds of prey”) mirroring the oscillation between material and immaterial, or lofty
                and mundane, that informs the entire play.</p>
            <p>Astarte is, of course, central to this fraught exchange between Manfred and the
                Chamois Hunter. She is present in that “ours” (II.i.25) which is then developed into
                the image of the “one heart” (II.i.26) and the observation that they “loved each
                other as we should not love” (II.i.27). Astarte is a figure—perhaps <emph>the</emph> 
                figure—of oscillation in the play, and her spectral
                status is once again linked to voice in Act II. There, in the soliloquy following
                his fruitless interview with the Witch of the Alps, Manfred announces: “I have one
                resource / Still in my science—I can call the dead, / And ask them what it is we
                dread to be” (II.ii.177-9). “Calling” reprises one of Manfred’s distinctive uses of
                voice—the invocation, the act of conjuring up, and the naming that makes entities
                appear. Significantly, when Astarte appears in Act II, scene four, her phantom voice
                utters Manfred’s name, and this new connection between material and immaterial,
                human and non-human, reactivates his desire, while also inverting the pattern since
                Astarte calls Manfred from the world of immateriality. He implores the apparition:
                “Say on, say on—/ I live but in the sound—it is thy voice!” (II.iv.150-1). Yet,
                these words read as, or indeed, sound heavily, tragically ironic. They represent yet
                another of those moments when the play mocks its own High Romantic discourse and
                unmasks the traps and pitfalls of the imagination. For Astarte’s voice is in reality
                Manfred’s own voice, since he has just told the Witch of Alps that “[Astarte] was
                like me [ . . . ] to the very tone / Even of her voice” (II.ii.105-7). Inevitably,
                Manfred’s use of voice as a way of escaping his own body into Astarte’s disembodied
                presence cruelly, and humorously, collides with the hampering presence of himself,
                his own voice, and body.</p>
            <p>Unlike Acts I and II, the third act does not feature voice as a separate lexical
                element, yet presents a wide range of forms of uttering and speaking from the
                outset. It significantly begins with a serried list of references to language and
                acts of voicing: the Abbot wants to “confer” with Manfred (III.i.24); he informs him
                that “Rumours [ . . . ] are abroad” (III.i.29-30); tells him that the populace believe
                “thou holdest converse with the things / Which are forbidden to the search of man”
                (III.i.34-5); and yet he does not seek out Manfred to “speak of punishment” but
                “penitence and pardon” (III.i.57). Uniformly pertinent to the semantic field of
                sound and verbal communication, this list designs a crescendo that culminates in
                Manfred’s death in scene four. Aptly, the final scene also contains the
                protagonist’s last act of voicing—the tirade against the spirit and other demons,
                which constitutes his greatest, most movingly tragic expression of that free will
                and power which the voice in the incantation temporarily took away from him at the
                beginning and which have been constantly under threat from the other antagonistic
                forces in the play. At the start of this act of “unconjuring,” Manfred tells the
                main spirit:<quote>
                    <div type="poetry"><lg type="stanza">
                        <l> . . . Back to thy hell!</l>
                        <l>Thou hast no power upon me, <emph>that</emph> I feel;</l>
                        <l>Thou never shalt possess me, <emph>that</emph> I know:</l>
                        <l>What I have done is done (III.iv.124-7)</l>
                    </lg></div></quote>
                The expression “What I have done” doubles implicitly as “What I have said,” since, as
                should be clear by now, Byron in <title level="m">Manfred</title> makes doing and
                saying, or being and uttering, inextricable. Moreover, any temptation to read this
                last speech in a purely transcendental key, that is one which sees voice losing its
                oscillatory status between material and immaterial in favor of disembodiment and
                dissolution, is interrupted and belied by the insistent materiality of voice.</p>
            <p>As Manfred concludes his speech and the demons vanish, the Abbot addresses the
                protagonist and notes:<quote>
                    <div type="poetry"><lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Alas! how pale thou art—thy lips are white—</l>
                        <l>And thy breast heaves—and in thy gasping throat</l>
                        <l>The accents rattle—Give thy prayers to heaven— (III.iv.143-4)</l>
                    </lg></div></quote>
                With their charged language and staccato rhythm, these lines highlight the bleakly
                physiological materiality of Manfred’s final act of voicing. The reference to the
                protagonist’s “gasping throat” in which his “accents rattle” signals primarily the
                dissolution of his body: voice intimates an impending disembodiment. But they also
                hark back to the question of voice on the Romantic stage, as they refer to and make
                manifest, in metatheatrical fashion, the actual delivery of sound by the actor
                playing Manfred. In other words, the play’s conclusion returns to voicing as
                utterance and as a material, stage-bound act. The attention to tone and delivery in
                the Abbot’s remark, which resembles a stage direction embedded in the dialogue,
                reminds readers that this dramatic poem is a play, a textual artifact aimed at a
                performance that thrives on voice, its nuances, and effects.</p>
            <p>In <title level="m">Manfred</title> voice delineates a transitional space—between the
                physical and the evanescent, the material and the spiritual—that is also a field
                of contacts, overlaps, and tensions. It is a site of problems and questions about
                identity (who is speaking? who is the listener?); power, authority, and control
                (also, and especially, in terms of the text’s pivotal theme of “resistance to 
                power—or the network of power that situates and subjugates self and freedom” [An. 107]);
                and forms of interconnection or separation between dimensions and characters, from
                transcendental as well as social perspectives, as with the complex mediated verbal
                interactions in Act II between Manfred and the Chamois Hunter or Manfred and
                Arimanes. These shifts between dimensions and exchanges among the <emph>dramatis 
                personae</emph> ground the process of transiting on which the play is
                predicated and are rooted in the dual nature of voice, its ritual function as an
                instrument for conjuring and materializing, as well as the dual status of voice in
                the theater of the time. A significant portion of the meaning of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> lies on the cusp between the written and the spoken 
                word, the latter to be understood not just as the word vicariously uttered in the printed
                text, but also actually and physically uttered by voices on a stage.</p>
            <p>If Byron’s dramatic poem is unusual in problematizing voice to this extreme of
                complication and resonance, in this respect it is also recognizably Romantic. As a
                hybrid construct, <title level="m">Manfred</title> reflects the question of voice as a
                recurrent concern in theater, but also more generally in the poetry of the period,
                as is visible in the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Hemans, among others.
                Melynda Nuss has examined how, “[t]hrough his experiments with theatre, Wordsworth
                learns to position himself as both actor and spectator to create a unique and
                all-encompassing public voice” (11). Christopher Stokes explores in detail the
                “subtle, interesting, and intellectually challenging” features of Coleridge’s
                problematizing of voice in his output (10). And John Anderson has read Hemans’s 
                <title level="m">The Forest Sanctuary</title> (1825) as “a prolonged meditation on the
                idea of voice” (56) that “suggests destabilizing alternative approaches to
                established epic” (56) through “a chorus of male and female, dead and living voices
                together, dialogically creating worlds for those who have ears to hear” (73). These
                poets’ productions offer endless variations on voicing and utterance that contribute
                to delineating a complex metapoetic and metaliterary discourse within
                Romantic-period verse. In their works, voice variously functions as an interface
                between body and spirit, or thing and essence; a correlative of the “correspondent
                breeze” or the “Eolian harp;” or a locus of cultural identity and historical agency,
                as in the German Romantic notion, coined by Johann Gottfried Herder, of poetry as a
                powerful manifestation of the <foreign xml:lang="de">Volkstimme</foreign>, the “voice 
                of the people.” Byron in <title level="m">Manfred</title> partly subscribes to and partly
                deviates from investments in voice by contemporary poets, as well as contemporary
                playwrights. Most peculiarly, by multiplying and intersecting the various meanings
