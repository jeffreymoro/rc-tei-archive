               “<em>Manfred</em> and Melodrama”
               considers  <em>Manfred</em>’s—and Byron’s—relation to the dominant theatrical genre of his time, melodrama. We
               place melodrama’s facility in appropriating materials from other cultural forms alongside
               a less-acknowledged corollary: that the melodrama was also itself a major object of
               cultural consumption, enough so that a text like  <em>Manfred</em> stands in mutually defining relation to plays like <em>Bluebeard</em>, <em>A Tale of Mystery</em>, and <em>Rugantino</em>, both technically and thematically. Canvassing critical writing on consumption from
               Neil McKendrick and John Brewer to Colin Campbell and Timothy Morton, we argue for
               the melodrama as an exemplum for understanding Romantic cultural consumption and appropriation,
               fed as it is by popular forms like the gothic while yet providing a critique of consumption
               similar to those we associate with Romantic poetry.</p>

               <p class="noCount">We were both very pleased to be invited to join the special Romantic Bicentennials
                  Commemorative Event: Lord Byron’s <em>Manfred</em>: Performance and Symposium. Many thanks to Omar F. Miranda and Jerome McGann, as
                  well as everyone associated with the bicentennial project. It was a rare treat, indeed,
                  to be able to watch Red Bull Theater’s staged reading of Byron’s play, which brought
                  the text to life in exciting new ways. Once we saw an initial list of symposium topics,
                  it became obvious that we were taking up similar questions: Jeff had been thinking
                  about <em>Manfred</em> and melodrama for several years and had written about Byron’s play in his <em>Romanticism in the Shadow of War</em>; Michael had just talked on the topic at the MLA Convention in Philadelphia (2017).
                  Having worked together before, we agreed to co-author a piece. Our writing process
                  began with Jeff responding to Michael’s paper and then with both of us pursuing a
                  back and forth exchange, as we added new ideas and developed each other’s further;
                  by the end, we had a truly collaboratively-written talk. Then, given that this was
                  a performative celebration of Byron’s drama and, given the fact that we were scheduled
                  to speak late in the day, we decided we should do something a little performative
                  ourselves, dividing up the paper into what seemed to us logical sections or finding
                  what seemed to be good points for there to be a change in voice; we also decided to
                  read the quotations being cited during each other’s passages. What we present here
                  is a transcript of what we delivered, with a few corrections made and references added
                  in; we appear as the characters JC and MG. In the spirit of our own arguments, we
                  hope some consumer of this piece will be able to develop further than we could the
                  idea of melodramatic consumption.</p>

                  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> We take our epigraph from Michael’s recent talk at the 2017 MLA in Philadelphia: <span class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Consumption, in fact, might also be the best way to understand the hybridity both
                        of melodrama and of <em>Manfred</em>.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> Elsewhere I have argued that melodrama is a machine built for speed (Cox <em>Romanticism</em> 51). I now want to follow Michael and argue it is a machine built for speedy consumption—that
                     is, it is designed to absorb and to digest whatever is put in its way. And in this
                     way, melodrama became arguably the key dramatic form of the period, absorbing not
                     just other theatrical modes, but topical events, fads, ideas, and ideologies. To give
                     just one example: Thomas Holcroft's <em>Tale of Mystery</em>, performed at Covent Garden in 1802, was the first melodrama in English to be identified
                     by that generic marker. The play is a translation/adaptation of a French play, René-Charles
                     Guilbert de Pixérécourt’s <em>Coelina</em>, which itself was an adaptation of a novel for the stage. Just as Holcroft imported
                     a hot theatrical commodity from Paris, so had Pixérécourt sampled a wide range of
                     cultural goods, as James L. Smith reminds us: <span class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Almost everything in <em>Coelina</em> was borrowed, and not only from the romance of that title by Ducray-Duminil which
                        provided Pixérécourt with his first two acts. The rugged mountain scenery of Act Three
                        . . . was first built for [a production of] Schiller. Boulevard pantomime provides
                        the action-packed but almost wordless finale. The singing miller and clodhopping peasantry
                        appear by courtesy of Sedaine's music-drama. But the greatest debt is to the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">drame</span>, that genre of serious prose tragicomedy which derives its sentimentality from Cumberland
                        and its bourgeois didacticism from the horrible homilies of George Lillo. (Smith 3)</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> Pixérécourt, in many ways the father of classic melodrama, did not so much create
                     a form full-grown from his brow as cobble together a hybrid, an assemblage of all
                     the bits and pieces to hand.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Consuming everything in its path, the melodrama was also itself a major object of
                     cultural consumption. Comprehending this requires that we recall the melodrama’s dominance
                     within the cultural industry that was the Romantic-era theater. In France, there were
                     over 30,000 performances of Pixérécourt’s plays alone between 1797 and 1834. His counterpart,
                     Auguste von Kotzebue, dominated the German stage, so much so that even Goethe at his
                     theater in Weimar offered some 87 stagings of Kotzebue’s plays compared to 19 of his
                     own and 18 of Schiller’s. Kotzebue also, in the years leading up to the premiere of <em>A Tale of Mystery,</em> ruled over the London stage, accounting for nearly a quarter of all performances at
                     Drury Lane and Covent Garden between 1798 and 1800. It is for this reason that ten
                     of the nineteen plays in Benjamin Thompson’s <em>German Theatre</em> of 1800 are by Kotzebue; Goethe has but one play. Melodrama in both its parts and
                     wholes circulated throughout Europe and beyond, so that we have Holcroft adapting
                     Pixérécourt, Pixérécourt drawing on Kotzebue, and Kotzebue, as least according to
                     Coleridge, stealing from earlier English writers.

                  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Again, we need to stress the ability of the melodrama to absorb materials from just
                     about anywhere. The plot of a melodrama might be derived from myth or history, the
                     Bible, or the news. A play might be set in medieval Europe or roughly contemporary
                     America or some imagined South Seas locale—Pixérécourt's plays alone range from Robinson
                     Crusoe’s island to the mines of Poland. While perhaps not going as far as the pantomime
                     in its engagement with contemporary fashion—harlequinades, after all, were at the
                     cutting edge of product placement, with, for example, a card manufacturer paying for
                     a scene in Charles Farley’s <em>Harlequin and Fortune</em> (Covent Garden, 1815) to advertise his newly redesigned deck—melodramas were seen
                     as tackling the issues of the day, from absentee landlordism in Pocock’s <em>The Miller and his Men</em> (Covent Garden, 1813) to slavery in Fawcett’s <em>Obi; or Three Finger’d Jack</em> (Haymarket, 1800); they were read as taking up “fashionable,” if questionable, moral
                     theories, as Coleridge makes clear in his attack upon Maturin and Kotzebue in the <em>Biographia Literaria</em>; and they were experienced as representing the rhythms of contemporary life. While
                     we think of the melodrama as engaging in reductive exaggeration and faked emotion,
                     the <em>Times</em> (November 15, 1802) reviewer of Holcroft’s <em>Tale of Mystery</em> emphasized its ability to capture “real life,” arguing the play is <span class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> natural and characteristic . . . There is no extravagance of idea—no elaborate research
                        after simile and metaphor . . . the thought seems to arise from the moment, the words
                        appear to be suggested by the circumstances which pass under the eyes of the spectator.
                        (2)</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Much like the 1970s “Made for TV Movies” that were “ripped from the headlines,” the
                     melodrama convinced its audiences that it was mirroring their lives even if it was
                     through a glass not so much darkly as immediately sensational.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As a machine built for consumption, melodrama needs to be placed within the rise of
                     the consumer society that has been described by Neil McKendrick, John Brewer, and
                     J. H. Plumb, that has been theorized by Colin Campbell in relation to a “romantic
                     ethic,” and that has been seen by, for example, Tim Morton as a key to Romantic poetics,
                     what Morton identifies as a poetics of spice. Campbell follows the historians in seeing
                     the rise of a bourgeois consumer culture that is marked by the rise of the novel,
                     a cult of romantic love, and the creation of the modern fashion industry. He identifies
                     a distinctly modern hedonism grounded in dreams of desire, with individuals <span class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> not so much seek[ing] satisfaction from products, as pleasure from the self-illusory
                        experiences which they construct from their associated meanings. The essential activity
                        of consumption is thus not the actual selection, purchase, or even use of products,
                        but the imaginative pleasure-seeking to which the product image lends itself, "real"
                        consumption being largely a resultant of this "mentalistic" hedonism. (89)</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Having constructed this imaginative hedonism, Campbell then finds Romanticism, with
                     its exaltation of the imagination, as providing an ethos to support this spirit of
                     modern consumerism, as it locates in the imaginative creation of pleasure a counter-argument
                     against attacks on emotionalism and sentimentality.</p>
               </div>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> The Gothic novel appears in Campbell’s account as a particularly egregious example
                  of how literature can be put in the service of a consumerism that traffics in the
                  promulgation of day dreams and longings for the exotic, of desires that stand against
                  the routines of everyday life. But as anyone who has pondered the <em>Fate of Frankenstein</em> (<em>Presumption; Or, The Fate of Frankenstein;</em> English Opera House, 1823) knows, the Gothic novel was consumed, at least in part,
                  by the Gothic play. Horace Walpole's <em>Castle of Otranto</em> had been out of print for fourteen years when Robert Jephson first adapted it for
                  the stage as the <em>Count of Narbonne</em> for Covent Garden in 1781—and since then, Walpole's novel has never been out of print.
                  The suggestion here is one less of adaptation—novel to drama—than symbiosis. Walpole's
                  gothic novel may have given rise to Jephson's gothic play, but the adaptation in turn
                  renewed its original.</p>
               <p>Or, moving forward a decade or two, we might remember that Matthew Lewis wrote only
                  one <em>Monk</em> (1796), but that there existed no fewer than four adaptations of it by the turn of
                  the nineteenth century. Two were for the stage: Charles Farley's grand ballet of action,
                  <em>Raymond and Agnes</em> (Covent Garden, 1797), and James Boaden's <em>Aurelio and Miranda</em> (Drury Lane, 1798). These in turn inspired a chapbook version in 1798 and a ballad
                  retelling in <em>Tales of Terror</em> in 1801. And, if we're to believe Lewis's bibliographers, the success of these productions
                  in turn inspired Lewis—who, like Walpole and Maturin, was both a novelist and a dramatist—to
                  adapt from himself, producing a chap-book version of the Raymond and Agnes story and
                  then, later, a melodrama, <em>Raymond and Agnes: or, The Travellers Benighted</em>. As you probably already suspect, Lewis's melodramatic act of self-consumption was,
                  of course, consumed in turn—in this case, by H. W. Grosette, who produced what became
                  the standard dramatic version of Lewis's novel, <em>Raymond and Agnes, or the Bleeding Nun of Lindenberg, an interesting melodrama</em> (Norwich, 1811; Haymarket, 1811).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> What we haven't yet mentioned, however, is that most foundational aesthetic form that
                     melodrama consumed—music—especially music expressive of the action at hand. Looking
                     again to the <em>Times</em> review of <em>A Tale of Mystery</em>, we find in it a fairly startling pronouncement: <span class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> The hurry and the perturbation of the scene were forcibly depicted by the agitated
                        notes of the orchestra, and this new adjunct to the interest of the drama was immediately
                        felt by the whole audience. (2)</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Part of what made melodrama feel not just new but also more realistic for audiences
                     was its successful borrowing of incidental music from ballet and pantomime and applying
                     it to dramas of suspense. One might say that melodrama's composers discovered in such
                     music an uncomic potential, not just in expressing physical action but also underlying
                     mental anguish, as when, in <em>A Tale of Mystery</em>, to disquieting music, "<em>Bonamo reads the Letter to himself with great agitation</em>" (Busby 23), or "<em>Enter Fiametta, Alarmed</em>" (Busby 9). Such scenes feel incredibly old-fashioned to us, smacking as they do
                     of silent film; but to audiences at the turn of the nineteenth century, they constituted
                     a revolution in naturalism similar to that heralded by David Garrick half a century
                     earlier.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As we've noted, earlier studies of Romanticism and consumer culture have unearthed
                  an overarching interplay between a consuming society and a Romantic ethos (Campbell),
                  and a tendency to treat commodities simultaneously as material objects to be consumed
                  and as vehicles for creating a poetics of transumption (Morton). With melodramatic
                  music, we aren't far from both. The scores of melodramas were hot properties; composers
                  quickly converted them to sheet music for single instruments, usually piano forte,
                  and sold them at a premium to musical and theatrical amateurs keen for the newest
                  sounds—who then would transform these materials back into private performances, both
                  musical and theatrical. For <em>The Castle Spectre</em>, for example, the British Library holds no fewer than five separate musical publications,
                  most in multiple copies—of the overture, of individual popular songs, and of the celebrated
                  ghost scene, itself so popular that London publishers printed both it and its source
                  music, a chaconne of Jomelli, at great profit. With <em>A Tale of Mystery,</em> we see something even more innovative—not merely selections, as was traditional,
                  but the entire score, including overture, songs, book, and the incidental music.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> In our search for an exemplum of Romantic consumption, then, we wish to suggest that
                     the melodrama provides a better example than Campbell’s deluding novel or Morton’s
                     spicy poetry. Melodrama attends to both strands of Romantic consumption. At once fed
                     by and feeding the Gothic in all its forms, it provided a site for fashion and for
                     idealized love. Yet it also—at least in the hands of its greatest practitioners—provided
                     a critique of consumption similar to those Morton locates in Romantic poetry. And
                     so, in this twin spirit, let’s turn to one final site of melodramatic consumption—a
                     most gothic instance, the library—that place where Colin Jager, following Deidre Lynch,
                     finds writers tapping the <span class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> twin impulses, commercial and historical, of modernity . . . [where] acts of canon
                        creation are poised between the desire for the dead to be safely dead so that they
                        can be smoothly incorporated into a national heritage, and the need to reanimate the
                        dead, bring them back to life, so that the living will be haunted by the power of
                        the dead writers in whose tradition they stand (pp. 145, 144).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> Certainly at this point we are not far from <em>Manfred</em>, nor should we be surprised to find various melodramas, most conspicuously Grosette's <em>Raymond and Agnes</em>, opening in "A Gothic Library" in the Castle of Don Felix, where a bookish Raymond
                     is about to leave off book learning for the more dangerous realism of a very Gothic
                     world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>And if we move beyond literal libraries to other Gothic sites where books and texts
                  are encountered—through ubiquitous Gothic halls and Gothic laboratories to the Faustian
                  Gothic gallery of <em>Manfred</em>—we can see into the ways that melodrama—especially the early Gothic and Ghost melodrama
                  of Byron's time—thinks about its consumption of the past, its need both to destroy
                  and to purchase the cultural capital that underwrites it. And that may be in part
                  because early melodrama so frequently yokes the evocation of an imagined Gothic past
                  to the simulacra of the now offered by the melodrama.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Like the Gothic novels that Lynch and Jager discuss, <em>Manfred</em> is obsessed with its literary precursors—Shakespeare, Marlowe, Goethe, Lewis, Wordsworth,
                     and on and on. It is significant that in the first scene in the Gothic gallery, when
                     Manfred goes beyond Faust to summon up not a single <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Erdgeist</span> but a series of spirits, he does so on the basis of a “written charm / Which gives
                     me power upon you” (I.i.35-6). Given <em>Manfred</em>'s status as a closet drama, so far so good, and we half-expect Manfred to produce
                     a volume and read from it. But this is not the way the scene goes. His first command
                     not heeded, Manfred moves beyond texts to "sign[s]" (I.i.38) and again bids the spirits
                     appear—but in vain. Finally, he must abandon text and even written signs for spoken
                     incantation, calling on: <span class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><blockquote class="quote">

                     gothic markers of theatrical conspicuous consumption as Manfred's invocation is of
                     gothic imagery. For Manfred's "gothic gallery" recalls that most expensive of mechanized
                     theatrical sets, the famous "blue chamber" of George Colman the Younger's <em>Blue-beard</em> (Drury Lane, 1798). And the seven spirits Manfred summons harken back to the mixed
                     dramas of the 1790s and 1800s, and to the supernaturally crammed stages of John Philip
                     Kemble's revivals of <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Richard III</em>.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Still more remarkable is the spirits' collective response, which is preceded by the
                  following stage direction: "<em>A star is seen at the darker end of the gallery: it is stationary; and a voice is
                     heard singing</em>" (I.i.49).</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> Last night we were treated to <em>Manfred</em> performed; in the days leading up to that performance, both Jeff and I sought to
                  imagine what this first scene would be like, particularly this question of singing.
                  Would there be music? Should there be? If Byron's play had premiered at Drury Lane
                  during the 1815-16 season, how sumptuously would it have been staged, and with what
                  kind of incidental music? If we wish to follow melodrama's consuming practices to
                  that imagined premiere, we think that melodrama would have found its match in <em>Manfred</em>, whose opening scene declares its readiness to harness melodramatic spectacle and
                  tactics to turn them back into—nay, to revive—tragedy, even though its structure is
                  not the traditionally legitimate five acts, but melodrama's truncated three. Given
                  the success of Coleridge's <em>Remorse</em> three years earlier, we believe that Byron's play would have been the hit tragedy
                  he was looking for the year he sat on Drury Lane's governing board—the year he ransacked
                  yet another library, Drury's manuscript collection of fallow plays, looking for a
                  tragedy that could hold the stage. Imagine this first scene of <em>Manfred</em> melodramatically, with the spirits’ incantation (I.i.193-262) chanted or sung as
                  Manfred is overcome by his own grief. Add music expressive of both the words and of
                  Manfred's emotional turmoil. Finally, place it all in a cavernous gothic library—and
                  it's hard not to expect the melodrama to continue. All this in the opening scene of
                  a play that supposedly eschews theatricality generally and melodrama particularly.</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> If we had world enough and time we could go on to talk about other ways in which
                  <em>Manfred</em> offers a kind of transumption of melodramatic consumption. If the melodrama absorbs
                  the theatrical tactics of a myriad of forms from tragedy to pantomime, Byron’s play
                  takes on the music, spectacular sets, and supernatural machinery of the melodrama
                  to use it in the service of a new kind of tragedy. If the melodrama often explores
                  a family mystery that, once solved, allows a return to a conventional domestic order,
                  Byron regrounds family relations in the tragic sphere of incest. If the lead characters
                  of the melodrama, in the words of Hegel, pursue “spiritual conversion and surrender
                  of self" in order to reassert “ordinary morality” (92), Manfred repeatedly refuses
                  to give up the complexity of a selfhood he sees as standing beyond any morality, ordinary
                  or not. Byron consumes—completes and destroys—the melodrama in the name of Romantic
                  tragic drama.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But there is a final twist to this story of eating and being eaten: when Alfred Bunn
                     staged <em>Manfred</em> in 1834, he returned it to its melodramatic roots. The title page of the printed text
                     highlights the <span class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> “New Music, extensive Scenery, Machinery, Dresses and Decorations,”</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> along with the <span class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> “Transformations and Properties”</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> of the supernatural scenes. Any hint of incest is removed and Manfred and Astarte
                     are reunited at the close of the play. In the final act, we learn that the demon Astoreth <span class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">MG:</span> “rises and sings,”</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">JC:</span> only to be dismissed so that Manfred can reconcile with the Abbot.

                     </div> The play then moves out from Manfred’s gothic hall to the Alps, where not one but
                     three Chamois Hunters appear to sing a glee, as this musical drama—his <em>Melo-</em>drama—removes any vestige of tragedy, any hint of the radical potential of Byron’s
                     play. A machine built for consumption, the melodrama can in the theater consume even
