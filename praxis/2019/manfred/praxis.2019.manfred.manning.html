            <p class="noCount">In May 1820 Byron encountered Goethe’s remarks on <em>Manfred</em> which, as translated by Hoppner, began: <span class="quote">‘Byron’s tragedy, <em>Manfred</em>, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular
                  intellectual poet has taken my <em>Faustus</em> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac
                  humour.’</span> Goethe simultaneously demotes Byron to a derivative of himself and diverts attention
               from the most sensational instance of “hypochondriac humor” in the eighteenth century,
               his own autofiction, <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em>. This essay pursues the textual histories through which the authors sought to distance
               themselves from protagonists too close to themselves, the revisions Goethe made in
               successive editions of <em>Werther</em> and Byron’s suppression of the original third act of <em>Manfred</em>, which Goethe could not have known. The original third act, however, was preserved
               in the seventeen-volume edition of Byron’s works published by John Murray in 1832-33.
               Attention to the activities of the editor, John Wright, in the construction of that
               edition, drawing upon unpublished materials in the John Murray Archive of the National
               Library of Scotland, reveals the interplay between the desires to establish posthumously
               the standing of Byron and to enhance the commercial value of Murray’s property, and
               the dissemination of the rejected “hypochondriac” materials. Wright’s preservation
               made them available for Alfred Bunn’s melodramatic presentation of <em>Manfred</em> at Covent Garden in 1834. Wright’s less notorious but more significant editorial
               intervention came when he inserted into his preface to <em>Marino Faliero</em> Byron’s withdrawn dedication of the play to Goethe, responding directly to the charges
               of 1820. In highlighting the arc from the rejected third act of <em>Manfred</em> in 1817 to the historical drama of 1821 Wright brings forward Byron’s ongoing exploration,
               across multiple and different genres, of the conditions that give rise to the obsessions
               of his protagonists.</p>

               Venice, that he had been sent “heaven knows why several Deutsche Gazettes of all which
               I understand neither word nor letter.” In them he found what “appear[ed] to be . .
               . Goethe’s [remarks] upon <em>Manfred</em>,” begging Hoppner to translate them (<em>BLJ</em> VII:106). Hoppner complied, and on June 7 Byron sent the German original, Hoppner’s
               version, and an Italian one to John Murray, proudly telling him “to keep them all
               in your archives” because “the opinion[s] of <em>the</em> Greatest man of Germany. . . whether favourable or not are always interesting—and
               this is moreover favourable” (<em>BLJ</em> VII:113). Hoppner opens:</p>

               <p>Byron had initially inferred that “the word <em>‘hypocondrish’</em> [is] any thing but favourable” (<em>BLJ</em> VII:106), and it is on that word that I want initially to focus. The prototypical
                  hypochondriacal hero is the protagonist of <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em>, the work that made Goethe famous at twenty-five in 1774, which he omits entirely
                  from his response. Manfred’s cry to the Witch of the Alps, “My pang shall find a voice,”
                  signals the extravagant self-involvement and willfulness of both Manfred and Werther,
                  a condition the authors then seek to disavow, or at least from which they seek to
                  stand apart (II.ii.50)

               <p>Already in his late sixties, Goethe read <em>Manfred</em> shortly after its appearance in 1817; his remarks date from that period, though not
                  published until 1820. “Ten years” after the publication of <em>Werther</em>, Goethe “still marvelled at its ‘white-hot expression of pain and joy, irresistibly
                  and internally consuming themselves’” (Boyle 124). Already by the second “genuine”
                  edition of <em>Werther</em> in 1775, Goethe had sought to forestall any simple identification of himself and his
                  suicidal creation, adding the first quatrain of a poem to the title page of Book I
                  that begins “Ev’ry youth for love’s sweet portion sighs, / Ev’ry maiden sighs to win
                  man’s love,” but concludes on the title-page of Book II: "Be a Man, nor seek to follow
                  Me."

                  </div> Goethe subsequently omitted the poem, but in the revised edition of 1787 the reader’s
                  sympathy for Werther is further distanced by the increased role of the editor who
                  frames Werther’s accounts of his situation by his own addresses to the reader. In
                  addition, Goethe inserts new episodes specifically designed to widen the gap between
                  Werther and the reader. In one added episode a young peasant falls in love with his
                  widowed employer, and, when he tries to force himself upon her and is dismissed by
                  the family, murders the hired hand whom he imagines as his rival. In the editor’s
                  narrative, Werther is shown to have “put himself so completely in . . . [the] place”
                  of the young peasant that he becomes the defender of a would-be rapist and murderer.

                  later that the man “was a clerk in the office of Lotte’s father, and it was a passion
                  for her, which he nourished, concealed, revealed, and for which he was dismissed,
                  that drove him mad” (Corngold 71).

               <p>These devices enable the reader to see Werther’s limitations and excesses, and so
                  to see the degree to which the “<em>hypocondrisch</em>” is the product of historically specific conditions: the cultural emphasis on sensibility,
                  on the heart, a moment at which Homer, Werther’s first ideal, is contested by the
                  moody Ossian, who “has driven Homer from [Werther’s] heart,” the naive by the sentimental,
                  to use Schiller’s only slightly later terms (Corngold 63).

                  </div> Most seriously, the hypertrophied inwardness is enforced by the paucity of careers
                  open to Werther: he finds the ambassador for whom he works pedantic, and his way forward
                  is blocked by the aristocratic prejudices of the petty principalities that made up
                  eighteenth-century Germany. Once he asks for his dismissal from court the logic of
                  withdrawal leads swiftly to his declaration: “It is settled, Lotte, I want to die,
                  and I tell you this without romantic excesses, with composure, on the morning of the
                  day when I will see you for the last time” (Corngold 80).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Goethe’s elevation of autobiography into resonant cultural diagnosis—the “me/not me”
               of literature—was not always grasped by the readers who turned <em>Werther</em> into a Europe-wide fad and lionized him. “[I]t had never occurred to me,” he recalled
               in 1824,<span class="quote">‘that an intolerable torment was vouchsafed for me by sympathizing, well-meaning souls:
                  for instead of someone’s saying something nice to me about my little book, just as
                  it was, they all wanted to know, once and for all, how much of the whole affair was
                  actually true, whereupon I would become very upset and generally say something rude.
                  For to answer this question, I would have had to pluck apart my little book, to which
                  I had devoted so much thought for so long, so as to give its many elements a poetic
                  unity, in the process destroying the form and causing the actual components, if they
                  were not altogether destroyed, at least to be jumbled and scattered. (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Aus Meinem Leben, Dichtung and Wahrheit</span></em>, qtd. Corngold 119)’</span> The events of 1772 in Wetzlar—his relationship to Charlotte Buff and her fiancé Johann
               Christian Kestner and the suicide of Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who had accompanied Goethe
               when he met Charlotte, and whose death, Kestner reported, was attributed to love for
               a married woman —Goethe insisted had been transmuted into a representative fiction,
               a strong contrast with his response to <em>Manfred</em>. Irked as he was by those who retrojected his novel onto his life, he did the same
               to Byron.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As he continues his remarks Goethe reduces <em>Manfred</em> to gossip: <span class="quote">‘He has often enough confessed what it is that torments him. He has repeatedly pourtrayed
                     it; and scarcely any one feels any compassion for this intolerable suffering, over
                     which he is ever laboriously ruminating . . . When a bold and enterprising young man,
                     he won the affections of a Florentine lady. Her husband discovered the amour, and
                     murdered his wife; but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street, and
                     there was no one on whom any suspicion could be attached. Lord Byron removed from
                     Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his life after. (<em>LJ</em> XII:506)’</span> Goethe sidesteps any recognition that <em>Werther</em> had involved him in similar misprisions. For example, Kestner found it difficult to
                  grant the novel independence from the events he and Lotte Buff had lived through with
                  Goethe; he objected to the portrayal of Lotte, insisting that “Lotte’s sharing of
                  Werther’s passion was a dishonourable trait which was not and could not be found in
                  Lotte Kestner,” and his protest at seeing himself resurface in Albert, or at seeing
                  himself seen by others as Albert, is concise: <span class="quote">‘did Albert have to be such a blockhead, “just so that you can swagger up to him and
                     say ‘look what a fine fellow <em>I</em> am?’”’</span> Kestner himself turns for solace in this charged situation to the third person and
                  the buffer of a foreign language in quoting a friend’s letter to him: “<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">il est dangereux d’avoir un auteur pour ami</span>” (Boyle 185-6).

                  Buff face, into the mythical Astarte.

                           “The Iconography of Forgiveness: Manfred's Astarte”
                           in this volume.</span></div>
                  </div> Goethe objects that in <em>Manfred </em>“the gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last oppressive
                  to us” but he concedes: “Yet is the dissatisfaction we feel connected always with
                  esteem and admiration.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Notwithstanding the tantalizing hints of a confession of incest, <em>Manfred</em> should not, as Jeffrey Cox has recently persuasively argued in <em>Romanticism in the Shadow of War</em>, be wholly inserted into the kind of erotic entanglements that Goethe retails. In
               both <em>Werther</em> and <em>Manfred,</em> the convergence of the poet’s life and the cultural moment is striking. The emptiness
               of time Manfred suffers catches the mood of a post-Congress of Vienna, post-Waterloo
               moment. Byron was not alone in feeling that peace had come but with the restoration
               of the old regimes revolutionary energies had departed. In Switzerland in 1816, Byron
               was not only temporally and geographically between Augusta and Annabella and the erotic
               profusion of Italy and the stability of Teresa Guiccioli; he was also between engagement
               in Regency politics—Parliamentary speeches on the Frame-breakers, opposition to the
               Regent—and the rejuvenation offered by joining the Carbonari against Austria and then
               the Greek Revolution. Manfred’s flamboyant withdrawal from the world acts out the
               uncertainty of his creator facing a world that failed to inspire commitment.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The textual history that marks Goethe’s effort to cast critical distance on his self-absorbed
                  protagonist has a counterpart in <em>Manfred</em>, though not in the 1817 text that Goethe read. Much of <em>Manfred</em> was drafted by September 1816, but the play was not completed when Byron left Switzerland
                  for Italy. Acts I and II were sent to John Murray by March 9, 1817, when the original
                  fair copy of Act III was also sent.

                  </div> Self-deprecating comments accompanied the transmissions: “I have no great opinion
                  of this piece of phantasy” (<em>BLJ</em> V:170), “a drama as mad as Nat. Lee’s Bedlam tragedy” (<em>BLJ</em> V:179), and, finally, “I have really &amp; truly no notion whether it is good or bad—
                  . . .You will submit it to Mr. G[iffor]d &amp; to whomsoever you please besides” (<em>BLJ</em> V:185). Byron’s submission to the rejection of Act III by William Gifford, Murray’s
                  literary advisor, grew from an earlier relationship. Gifford had been an early model
                  for Byron, who invokes his couplet satires, the <em>Maeviad</em> and the <em>Baviad</em>, in <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em>; in 1813, after the overwhelming success of the first two cantos of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, Byron was still addressing him as a lowly acolyte: “I feel greatly at a loss how
                  to write to you at all—still more to thank you as I ought.—If you knew the veneration
                  with which I have ever regarded you long before I had the most distant prospect of
                  becoming your acquaintance literary or personal—my embarrassment would not surprize
                  you” (<em>BLJ</em> III:63-4). More than thirty years older than Byron, the former editor of the conservative <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> and then of the Tory <em>Quarterly Review</em>, Gifford epitomized the established values and tastes that Byron’s poetry subverted,
                  but, as late as his time in Missolonghi, Byron angrily rebutted to his banker and
                  friend Douglas Kinnaird the rumor that he was the author of an attack on Gifford,
                  who was rich in enemies: “It is not true that I ever <em>did—will—would—could—</em>or <em>should </em> write a <em>satire</em> against Gifford—or a hair of his head—and so tell Mr. Murray.——I always considered
                  Gifford as my <em>literary</em> father and myself as his ‘<em>prodigal</em> Son’” (emphases in original: <em>BLJ </em>XI:117). When Gifford approved of the first two acts of <em>Manfred</em> but did “not by any Means like the Conclusion,” Murray managed the dilemma by sending
                  the assessment with a cover letter that attributed the condemnation to the “paternal
                  interest” Gifford took in Byron’s “literary well being” (Nicholson 219).</p>

               <p>Fathers, however, do not fare well in Byron’s poetry, or rather they fare all too
                  well, habitually crushing the rebellious Byronic hero, and so it is with <em>Manfred</em>. In the original third act, Manfred reacts to the Abbot who menaces him, unless he
                  repents and gives his lands to the monastery, by having him carried off by the demon,
                  Ashtaroth, singing.

                           of orthodoxy in Manfred’s forbidden love of Astarte. See Quinlan, who, however, reads
                           his evidence differently. Elsewhere in this volume Alan Richardson illuminates the

                  </div> Gifford was contemptuous: <span class="quote">‘The Friar is despicable, &amp; the servants uninteresting. The scene with the Friar ought

                     dignity should be lent to the catastrophe . . . Manfred should not end in this feeble
                     way - after beginning with such magnificence and promise—and the demons should have
                     something to do in the scene. (Nicholson 220)’</span> Byron wholly capitulated, telling Murray: <span class="quote">‘The third act is certainly d-----d bad . . . It must on no account be published in
                     its present state;—I will try &amp; reform it—or re-write it altogether—but the impulse
                     is gone—&amp; I have no chance of making anything out of it. I would not have it published
                     as it is on any account. (<em>BLJ</em> V:211)’</span> Within a month Byron had composed a new third act, acceding to Gifford’s strictures
                  point by point: “The Abbot is become a good man—and the Spirits are brought in at
                  the death—you will find I think some good poetry in this new act here &amp; there—&amp; if
                  so print it—without sending me further proofs—<em>under Mr. G[iffor]d’s correction</em>” (<em>BLJ</em> V:219). In making the Abbot a good man, Byron at once severed himself from the Gothic,
                  of which a corrupt and usually lustful monk was a staple, severing himself also from
                  the play’s roots in “an unfinished Witch drama” begun years before and from his experience
                  on the managing committee of Drury Lane Theatre and the hundreds of plays he had read
                  during his tenure (<em>CPW</em> IV:463). In revising, Goethe had similarly ringed <em>Werther</em> with complicating perspectives; Byron’s excision, under pressure from Gifford, is
                  more like repression, and, though it accelerated a shift in Byron’s mode, it came
                  at a cost. In contrast, another stalwart of the <em>Quarterly</em>, J. W. Croker, after reading the first two acts of <em>Manfred</em>, urged Murray to “do all you can to induce Lord Byron to go on with his tragedy—for
                  such I suppose it is to be. Its wildness, or if you will, its extravagance, is to
                  me its first recommendation” (Nicholson 224). Croker, the author of the notorious
                  review of Keats’s <em>Endymion</em>, was in general no fan of the younger poets, but, in singling out Byron’s “extravagance,”
                  he points to a strength Gifford could not recognize, and which the chastening and
                  elevating of the third act sacrificed. At the close Manfred defeats the demons who
                  have come for him by asserting his superiority—“Thou hast no power upon me, <em>that</em> I feel; / Thou never shalt possess me, <em>that</em> I know”—and in this triumph of the will can then quietly die (III.iv.125-6). The new
                  calm for which Byron strove, countering the Titanism of the earlier acts, suffuses
                  his final speech: “Old man! ‘tis not so difficult to die” (III.iv.151). When Byron
                  saw that the 1817 first edition had dropped the speech, he forcefully protested: “You
                  have destroyed the whole effect &amp; moral of the poem by omitting the last line of Manfred’s
                  speaking” (<em>BLJ</em> V:170). In their quest for a grander conclusion, neither Gifford nor Murray had comprehended
                  the significance of the deliberate understatement, an intertextual rebuke to Werther’s
                  elaborate staging of the suicide in which his succumbing to despair climaxes.

                  been too scandalous for him to publish in the poet’s lifetime and brought out in 1832-33
                  a canon-fixing <em>Works of Lord Byron with his Letters and Journals</em> in seventeen handsome volumes, of which the first six were filled by Thomas Moore’s <em>Life</em>, previously published in 1830. <em>Manfred</em> is in volume 11.

                  </div> He persuaded Murray to extend <em>Don Juan</em> into a third volume: “I now find it will be quite impossible to do justice to the
                  work, if you persist in compressing the <em>Don Juan</em> into two volumes . . . the Notes, critical, historical, moral, and religious are <em>very numerous</em>, and of a most interesting and fascinating description. I therefore intreat you to
                  allow me another volume for the Poetry.” He failed, however, despite detailed pleading
                  of the commercial advantages, to win Murray’s assent to the proposition that “the
                  work ought to consist of <em>eighteen</em>” volumes (November 1832, MS. 41309). Wright tirelessly sought out those whose lives
                  were entwined with Byron’s, and who might share precious texts. Having obtained manuscripts
                  from Augusta Leigh, he proceeded to Teresa Guiccioli: the Countess, he reported, “feels
                  very sore and angry with Moore, and with reason” and so gave him two volumes of Moore’s <em>Life</em> with corrections (October 8, 1832), emboldening him to propose that Murray intimate
                  to her that <span class="quote">‘The Countess would also be rendering a service to the memory and character of Lord
                     Byron, if she would permit me to look over the original manuscripts of Marino Faliero,

                     respecting <em>herself</em> and Lord B, as she may wish to have set right . . . I could turn them to good account.
                     (MS. 41309)’</span> Turning the publisher, his employer, into his intermediary, Wright offers him too
                  a “good account,” the possibility of what on a later occasion he frankly called “a
                  little sensation . . .[to] add a thousand or two to the sale of the work” (Dec. 3,
                  1832, MS. 41309).</p>
            </div>
            <p>I have digressed from <em>Manfred</em>, but only to show the editorial practice that shaped the dress in which Byron appeared
               for the remainder of the century. Wright was the kind of editor who could declare
               with pride, and perhaps even glee, that he had gone over the fifth canto of <em>Don Juan</em> “and have extracted matter for at least thirty notes” (MS. 41309). I am only partly
               joking when I comment that his practice is simultaneously that of the Oxford Wordsworth,
               committed to the author’s final text, and that of the Cornell Wordsworth, committed
               to the earliest, often manuscript, version. The aim of the set was to establish Murray’s
               prize poet, but in addition to printing the corrected 1818 text of <em>Manfred</em> and surrounding it with encomia from Francis Jeffrey and Professor Wilson attesting
               to its <em>gravitas</em>, the edition prints the correspondence in which Gifford condemned the original third
               act—and the rejected act itself, as in this example: </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/manning/manning_image2Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 2: Act III first ms. as printed" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> The consequence is that the calm of the final text achieved on the page is continuously
               disrupted by the return of the repressed in the notes below: an edition intended to
               monumentalize Byron instead preserves the <em>hypocondrish </em> turmoil from which it emerged. Other traces of the gestation of the drama remain.
               Declaring in 1820 that he had never read Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> but acknowledging that “Matthew Monk Lewis in 1816 at Coligny translated most of
               it to me <em>viva voce</em>,” Byron maintained that “it was the <em>Staubach</em> &amp; the <em>Jungfrau</em>—and something else—much more than Faustus that made me write <em>Manfred</em>” (<em>BLJ</em> VII:113). The “something else” has usually been understood as the hinted incest with
               Augusta, which makes the edition’s note in Act I showing the closeness of the drama
               to excerpts from “the Journal of his Swiss tour, which Lord Byron transmitted to his
               sister,” perhaps indelicate (21n1). Murray was “much struck with your description
               of pastoral life in the Alps - wch [<em>sic</em>] I hope you do not omit &amp; indeed as much of the first impressions made by the Scenery
               will be given as you can - all the world has been there &amp; will be delighted to tread
               the Air again in imagination” (Nicholson 217). The Alpine sublime was a commercial
               imperative on which Murray did not fail to capitalize in the frontispiece to the volume
               by J. M. W. Turner.</p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/manning/manning_image3Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 3: Turner Bernese Alps" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p>Even more than Murray, Wright understood that as most of the poetry had been previously
               published, the success of the edition depended on the added value of the apparatus
               and especially the illustrations. He wrote Murray that even when they pictured familiar
               places, such as Venice, “they may be so varied as to give them an air of novelty”
               (MS. 41310). Every volume had not one but two frontispieces. On Monday, November 26,
               1832, Wright implored Murray: “Turner should be induced to do something very striking
               for the 14<span class="sup">th</span> volume. This is, I assure you, of great importance” (MS. 41309). In the first frontispiece,
               Turner, working from a sketch by W. Page, provides a bland view of Parnassus and the
               Castalian Spring, in the second a dramatic view of the Battle of Waterloo from the
               perspective of Hougoumont, appropriate to the review of the end of Napoleon’s career
               and the Congress of Vienna in “The Age of Bronze,” contained in the volume.</p>

            <p>I rehearse these familiar materials to suggest that, when Alfred Bunn decided in 1834
               to produce at Covent Garden a stage version of the drama that Byron claimed he had
               “rendered . . .<em>quite impossible</em> for the stage,” he did not have to look far for the materials of sensational stage
               display (<em>BLJ</em> V:170). </p>

            <p> As Margaret Howell’s study of the acting version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain
               reveals, the settings and words were predominantly Byron’s own—incorporating the original
               rejected third act (Howell ch. 3). The product was less “<em>Manfred Transformed</em>,” as Howell titles her chapter, than “<em>Manfred Restored</em>”: what Gifford excised and the <em>Works</em> preserved but degraded to the apparatus, Bunn raised into his script. The exception
               was the hint of incest, which theatrical censorship forbid representing on stage,
               and which had been duly removed. Bunn, Howell writes, made “Astarte Manfred’s cousin
               and ultimately his redeemer, an alteration clearly influenced by Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>”—that too seems a return of the influence Byron denied (98). In this stage version
               Manfred neither dies defiantly nor with calm dignity: Astarte reappears to announce,
               “I do forgive thee!” and, the stage direction indicates, Manfred “<em>breaks from the Abbot, rushes toward her — falls &amp; dies</em>” (Howell 103). Thereupon, reports the playbill, all was “Borne down by a violent
               THUNDER STORM” [see Fig. 6]. In his reminiscences, Bunn recalled, amid the general
               enthusiastic reception, a particular consequence probably made possible by the interdiction
               of the theme of incest: <span class="quote">‘It was eminently successful—applauded by a crammed auditory, lauded, with but one
                  exception, by the press, and witnessed with an inward satisfaction and delight by
                  the poet’s sister, the Honourable Mrs. Leigh. In a letter from this accomplished lady,
                  she says, “<em>Manfred</em> was splendidly got up, and Miss Ellen Tree’s Witch of the Alps I shall dream of!”
                  (Bunn I:146)’</span></p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In sending the revised third act to Murray, Byron commented “I certainly am a devil
                  of a mannerist—&amp; must leave off” (<em>BLJ</em> V:185). As the proliferating cantos of <em>Don Juan</em> demonstrate, “leaving off” was not Byron’s truest mode, especially when “leaving off”
                  was initiated by a senior figure of authority. The contradictory impulses of the 1832
                  edition are faithful to Byron insofar as they present him divided between earlier
                  and later versions of himself. The effect produced by editorial intervention in 1832
                  parallels the break in <em>Don Juan</em> between the arrested figure of Juan, who bears the traces of Byron’s childhood and
                  scandalous separation, othered into a young Spaniard, and the narrator, who “rattle[s]
                  on exactly as I’d walk . . . born for opposition,” fully engaged with, and brilliantly
                  and sardonically commenting on, postwar Europe (XV.19-22). Goethe became the sage
                  devoted to renunciation invoked by Carlyle in <em>Sartor Resartus</em>, contemporary with Bunn’s production of <em>Manfred: “</em>Close thy <em>Byron</em>; open thy <em>Goethe</em>” (Carlyle 153). <em>Byron </em>could not close Byron; in one of his forecasts of the development of Juan, he told
                  Murray: “I meant to have made him a Cavalier Servente in Italy and a cause for a divorce
                  in England—and a Sentimental ‘Werther-faced man’ in Germany—so as to show the different

                  pantomime / Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time” (I:1). Byron’s nominal hero is
                  a stock figure whose metamorphoses become the instrument to “show the different ridicules
                  of the societies in each of those countries,” not a settled sage or aspirant to the
                  status of “<em>the</em> Greatest man of [Europe].” Byron theatricalizes; if the production travestied him,
                  it also caught qualities integral to him—without, however, the two voices of <em>Don Juan</em> or of Wright’s edition.</p>

            <p>The zeal of Wright preserved a Byron that Murray, on the advice of Gifford, had initially
               repudiated; it also disseminated an exchange between Byron and Goethe over the review
               of <em>Manfred</em> by producing a literary history that never happened. On February 25, 1817, in the
               same letter that Byron announced to Murray from Venice that he had sent him “the other
               day some extracts from a kind of drama—which I had begun in Switzerland—&amp; finished
               here,” he requested a favor: <span class="quote">‘Look into ‘Moore’s (Dr. Moore’s) view of Italy’ for me—in one of the volumes you
                  will find an account of the <em>Doge Valiere</em> (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy—or the motives of it—get it transcribed
                  for me &amp; send it in a letter to me soon—I want it—&amp; can not find so good an account
                  of that business here—though the veiled portrait—&amp; the place where he was once crowned—and
                  afterwards decapitated still exists—&amp; are shown. (<em>BLJ</em> V:173-4)’</span> Five weeks later he repeated to Murray that “This was the thing that most struck
               my imagination in Venice” (<em>BLJ</em> V:203). The chronological conjunction indicates the closeness of <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Marino Faliero</em>, though the latter tragedy was not completed until 1820. One grows from a “Witch
               drama” in a Gothic setting, and the other marks a determined program to quit the extravagant
               “manneris[m]” (<em>BLJ</em> V:185) that Gifford condemned. “It appears to me,” Byron declared to Murray as the
               tragedy approached publication, <span class="quote">‘that there is room for a different style of the drama . . . good English—and a severer
                  approach to the rules—might combine something not dishonourable to our literature,
                  I have also attempted to make a play without love.——And there are neither rings—nor
                  mistakes—nor starts—nor outrageous ranting villains—nor melodrame [<em>sic</em>]—in it. (<em>BLJ</em> VIII:78)’</span> Yet the two plays share the thematic of a world emptied of significance, figured
               in <em>Manfred</em> by the death of Astarte and in <em>Marino Faliero</em> by the failure of the Venetian aristocracy adequately to punish the perpetrator of
               a slander against Angiolina, the wife of Faliero. That failure undermines the authority
               of which he, as Doge, is the emblem, driving him “into conspiring against the State
               of which he was the actual reigning Chief,—the last circumstance,” as Byron hyperbolically
               put it, “makes it the most remarkable—&amp; only fact of the kind in all history of all
               nations” (<em>BLJ</em> V:174). Manfred’s confession, “From my youth upwards / My spirit walk’d not with
               the sons of men,” presents his withdrawal into icy seclusion in general terms (II.ii.50-1);
               Faliero’s turning from a long lifetime of service to tormented alliance with disaffected
               plebeians against his class is painfully particular. In the revised third act, Manfred
               justifies his abandonment of the “noble aspirations in my youth, / To make my own
               the mind of other men, / The enlightener of nations” by boastfully proclaiming </p>

            <p> Faliero experiences himself as having been turned into a “living lie” by the refusal
               of the Forty to respect ducal authority; both protagonists display the self-destructive
               pride of the Byronic hero—and of the narrator of Cantos III and IV of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, whose teasing at the borders of fiction and autobiographical revelation is extended
               into the oblique but recognizable domestic details of Byron’s childhood, marriage,
               and separation in <em>Don Juan</em>, which had reached Canto V by 1821.</p>
            <p>Despite his disdain for political activity in the soliloquy that opens the fourth
               scene of the revised third act, Manfred is overcome by a memory of having once “stood

            <p> The imperial model of “almighty Rome” in <em>Manfred</em> yields to a parallel nearer to Britain in <em>Marino Faliero</em>, the maritime power of Venice, now sunk from glory to a place of Carnival and the
               intrigues and <em>contretemps</em> that fill Byron’s contemporary life, letters, and <em>Beppo</em> (written the same year as <em>Manfred</em> was completed). The degradation of authority Faliero experiences, as many commentators
               have noted, corresponds with the shift in political force in England from the reforming
               aristocratic liberals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century to working-class
               radicals such as Cobbett and Orator Hunt. The involvement of Hobhouse with the radicals,
               leading to his imprisonment, profoundly discomfited Byron, and despite the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</span> of his entry into the Greek Revolution (and death at Missolonghi), Byron was aware
               that the aristocratic status he flaunted was ceding political effectiveness to organized
               movements.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Byron framed <em>Marino Faliero</em> with a Preface summarizing his sources, and an Appendix in which he printed extracts
                  from them, in the original languages and in translation. These Wright curtailed to
                  a dozen pages set in tiny type, but together they demonstrate the care Byron took
                  to establish the cultural and historical context in which his characters act. The
                  paratexts are integral to the design of the volume as a whole and connect directly
                  to one of Wright’s most telling editorial interventions. On October 17, 1820, roughly
                  seven months after seeing Goethe’s critique of <em>Manfred</em> and two months after the completing the copy of <em>Marino Faliero</em>, Byron sent Murray his “dedication of” the drama “to Goethe" (<em>BLJ</em> VII:206), countermanding his request on January 19, 1821: “<em>Omit</em> the Dedication to Goethe” (<em>LJ</em> VIII:66). In his <em>Life of Byron</em> (1830), republished in the 1832-1833 edition of the <em>Works</em>, Moore printed an expurgated text of the “never before published . . . very singular
                  Dedication . . . written in the poet’s most whimsical and mocking mood” (V:356). Notwithstanding
                  its previous appearance, Wright, while rebuking Moore for his excisions, reprinted
                  Moore’s text in his preface to <em>Marino Faliero</em>, positioning it to lead directly into Byron’s Preface and play.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Wright regretted the omissions (attacks on Wordsworth and Southey) from the text because
                           the “MS. having since been lost,” they cannot be repaired. The MS. was subsequently
                           found in the Goethe Archiv, Weimar, and printed by Alois Brandl in 1899, and may be
                           found transcribed in CPW (4:544-47). Barry Weller and Jerome McGann there observe
                           that it “meant to respond to the criticisms” but the effect on readers of Wright’s
                           printing and placing it as he did is rightly outside their editorial concerns (523).
                           E. M. Butler narrates in full the misadventures that befell the intention to dedicate
                           a drama…</span></div>
                  </div> The reader of Wright’s text, and those derived from it across the nineteenth century,
                  thus apprehends, with greater or lesser self-consciousness, the play as part of the
                  sequence <em>Manfred</em> =&gt; Goethe on <em>Manfred</em> =&gt; Byron’s Dedication to Goethe =&gt; <em>Marino Faliero</em>. The exchange we experience did not happen: Goethe did not receive the Dedication
                  until 1831, by which time Byron had been dead for seven years. Goethe died in 1832,
                  before the appearance of the twelfth volume, containing <em>Marino Faliero</em>, of the <em>Works.</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>In transmitting the Dedication to Murray, Byron enclosed <span class="quote">‘an Italian abstract of the German translation of <em>Manfred</em>'s appendix in which you will perceive quoted what Goethe says of the <em>whole body</em> of English poetry (&amp; <em>not</em> of one in particular) on this the Dedication is founded as you will perceive—though
                  I had thought of it before for I look upon him as a Great Man. (<em>BLJ</em> VII: 206)’</span> Even if Goethe had not aimed solely at Byron the stricture quoted in the Dedication
               that “the predominant character of the whole body of the present English poetry is
               a <em>disgust</em> and <em>contempt for life</em>,” it provided him the occasion for a riposte against the criticisms aroused by <em>Manfred</em>. Moreover, the layout of Wright’s edition enfolds <em>Manfred Faliero</em> in the riposte.</p>
            <p>Byron continues, exposing the point that Goethe had obscured by speaking of <em>Manfred</em> only in relation to <em>Faust</em>: <span class="quote">‘But I rather suspect that by one single work of <em>prose, you</em> yourself have excited a greater contempt for life, than all the volumes of English
                  poesy ever written. Madame de Staël says, that “Werther has occasioned more suicides
                  than the most beautiful woman”; and I really believe that he has put more individuals
                  out of this world than Napoleon himself,—except in the way of his profession. (<em>Works</em> XII:51).’</span> If the reply is only a witty <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">tu quoque</span>, it also hints that a writer who had struggled to distance himself from his “white-hot
               expression of pain and joy,” as Goethe had in the post-publication embarrassments
               of <em>Werther</em>, might have been more sympathetic to the urgencies of <em>Manfred</em> than Goethe had been, and less ready to spread unfounded scandal about the poet’s
               life. The drama to which the Dedication was to be attached deepens the reply. Goethe
               had charged that Byron “repeatedly pourtrayed” his torment, to the point that “scarcely
               anyone feels compassion for this intolerable suffering, over which he is laboriously
               ruminating” (<em>LJ</em> XII:506). <em>Marino Faliero</em> demonstrates that Byron’s preoccupations could be turned outward into a very different
               world, into “Venetian history and manners” (Wright’s terms, <em>Works</em> XII:45) of the fourteenth century, creating a “regular” drama in “good English” (Byron’s
               terms, qtd. in <em>Works </em>XII:49) that unmistakably cast light on the shifting political conditions of a Britain
               that was not only post-Napoleon but also post-Peterloo. Devotees of “the Byronic”
               were disappointed, as Byron anticipated that they would be. Wright prints Francis
               Jeffrey’s verdict in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> that Byron fails because he chose a story “which not only gives no scope to the peculiar
               and commanding graces of his genius, but runs continually counter to the master currents
               of his fancy” (qtd. in <em>Works</em> XII:46). In the drama, the passionate plaints of a <em>Manfred</em> yield to the goal of provoking readers to critical thinking about the civic and the
               personal—but the oppositions are inadequate. <em>Marino Faliero</em> demonstrates—to Goethe and others—that imagination can turn personal history and
               Venetian history alike into a work of art, one that shows, as Goethe claimed for <em>Werther</em>, the cultural situations that produce the self-involved protagonist. In what seems
               like an offhand P.S. to the Dedication, Byron writes: <span class="quote">‘I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about
                  what they call <em>“Classical”</em> and “<em>Romantic”</em>—terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left
                  it four or five years ago. (<em>Works</em> XII:52)’</span> The sentence seems a mere statement of fact, or a bemused reflection. It applies,
               however, to the entire sequence of Byron’s own productivity from <em>Manfred</em> to <em>Marino Faliero</em>, continuous but shifting in form, not subject to a (single) classification.</p>

               worship of the Phoenician goddess Ishtar, or Astarte: a fitting extension of the transgression
               of orthodoxy in Manfred’s forbidden love of Astarte. See Quinlan, who, however, reads
               his evidence differently. Elsewhere in this volume Alan Richardson illuminates the
               connection of the Zoroastrian thread of Byron’s drama to the use made of the doctrine
               in contemporary radical discourse.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               doing any thing which I did not think you would approve—or at any rate that concealment—is
               totally out of the question—Mr Gifford after consulting me omitted your close of the
               Drama from no other motive than because he thought that the words you allude too [sic]—lessened

               the “MS. having since been lost,” they cannot be repaired. The MS. was subsequently
               found in the Goethe Archiv, Weimar, and printed by Alois Brandl in 1899, and may be
               found transcribed in <em>CPW</em> (4:544-47). Barry Weller and Jerome McGann there observe that it “meant to respond
               to the criticisms” but the effect on readers of Wright’s printing and placing it as
               he did is rightly outside their editorial concerns (523). E. M. Butler narrates in
               full the misadventures that befell the intention to dedicate a drama to Goethe: Byron
               wrote a shorter and uncontroversial dedication for <em>Sardanapalus</em> (1821), but it was not printed until the separate edition of the play in 1823; a
               still shorter dedication to Goethe is affixed to <em>Werner</em> (1823).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
