                <p rend="noCount"><title level="m">Manfred</title> is a very strange work as
                    Nietzsche, perhaps more than anyone, so well understood. Partly it’s strange
                    because it’s a genre mashup, “A Dramatic Poem” that, like Goethe’s <title
                        level="m">Faust</title>, cultivates a medley of tones that constantly shift
                    from grave and exacting reflection to satire and comedy.<note place="foot"

                        the medley style of <title level="m">Manfred</title> from my earlier
                        lecture/essay <title level="a">Byron and Wordsworth</title> (Nottingham:
                        Byron Foundation, U. Of Nottingham, 1999), reprinted in my selected essays

                        >Salome</title>, it is a work easier to illustrate than to stage, as Virgil
                    Burnett’s wonderfully sly drawing for <title level="m">Manfred</title>—done in
                    the manner of Beardsley—shows.</p>

                <p>An ironic and pitiless landscape, a seriously preposterous search, Byron’s
                    clubbed right foot, Ahab’s stump: there is a brief conspectus of the untrodden

                <p> The drawing captures the tone and attitude that a person ought to take when
                    venturing on a study of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. But it doesn't
                    actually show us how Byron fashioned his queer masterpiece. For that, I will
                    work from three quotations that supply another way of mapping the territory of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>.<lb/>
                    <quote>Enigma, made to be unresolved, affords the opposition of immersion, of
                        argument: it offers an opaque exterior; not offering entry or exit, it
                        posits (the generic trace of pleasure). The enigma, cued only to itself,
                        faces nothing. However, it is not bracketed. It is merely less loose among
                        particles more active. Though its delight is not extinguished, it has no
                        tendency. Its argument is that, it, is, here.<lb/> – Alan Davies, <title

                    <quote>The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because
                        of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice
                        something—because it is always before one’s eyes.)”<lb/> – Ludwig Wittgenstein,
                            <title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title></quote>
                    <quote>The continuing power of privacy in writing can make tangible what
                        otherwise seemed invisible: the world made strange so that we can see it, as
                        in a dream of the familiar become foreign.<lb/> – Charles Bernstein, <title
                            level="a">Thought’s Measure</title></quote> Each seems to me an
                    apt comment on <title level="m">Manfred</title>, which is a poem about open
                    secrets, about strange things lying in plain sight. So it comes to us like a
                    dream that illuminates the familiar exactly because the world’s familiarities
                    estrange the world from us.</p>
                <p>An investigation of those matters might best start with <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title>’s signature problem, the poem’s greatest open secret: the
                    scandalous reference to “the Lady Astarte, his—” (III.iii.55). Read
                    biographically—privately—the missing word has always been supposed to be
                    “sister” and Manfred’s “half-maddening sin” (II.i.31), incest. Everything about
                    the historical context of <title level="m">Manfred</title> supports that
                    reading, which can, and I think should, be glimpsed in <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title>’s keyword: Astarte. We haven’t studied that word, listened
                    to it, closely enough. Say it: Astarte. A star. Star is one of the poem’s most
                    prominent motif words. Say the name again: Astarte. Augusta. Star. Gus. Once you
                    see or hear that, the echo becomes irresistible. Byron called his sister “Gus.”
                    The word Astarte is an exemplary instance of a private enigma in an open text.
                    Byron casts Astarte as the traumatic sign for Manfred’s estrangement from
                    himself and his world.</p>
                <p>But <title level="m">Manfred</title> is replete with traumatic signs. Traumatic
                    and dramatic. Remember that it is “A Dramatic Poem,” not “A Poetic Drama.” The
                    description suggests why it’s so difficult to stage. It also suggests that we
                    perhaps do best to approach it as a play of words, which is how we approach the
                    plays of Gertrude Stein. The action is primarily in the ways the words behave,
                    the plot that they are driven to execute. The simplicity of the poem’s surface,
                    its rehearsal of the all-too-familiar Faust legend, is seriously deceptive.
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title> is a play full of secrets and, as such, a
                    work whose dangerous words need to be watched closely. When we do we discover
                    that its object is to dismantle the authority of the myth of Faust, one of the
                    two great myths of Western civilization. Byron would soon undertake <title
                        level="m">Don Juan</title> to subject that other great Western myth to a
                    similar critical investigation.</p>
                <p>So let’s look closely at <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Consider three famous
                    passages—first, this reflection on Astarte: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>What is she now?—a sufferer for my sins—</l>
                            <l>A thing I dare not think upon—or nothing. (II.ii.196-7)</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote> What do we think of those three alternatives Manfred gives for his
                    question “What is she now?” In point of fact, “a sufferer for my sins—A thing I
                    dare not think upon—or nothing” are far from the only alternatives. But that’s
                    all we get because that’s all Manfred at this point can think of. If we pay
                    attention to exactly what Manfred says here we ought to be provoked. </p>
                <p>Or consider this exchange with Nemesis: <quote>

                    </quote> 
                    What are we to make of the “dead” Astarte being described as “one
                    without a tomb”? The remark gives one serious pause in at least two respects.
                    First of all, in an obvious sense, it upends the question Nemesis asks.
                    Uncharnel what? Uncharnel one without a tomb? But then we also have to wonder
                    how Manfred knows she is tombless, and what exactly that could mean.</p>
                <p>The problems metastasize. Consider the action that immediately follows when
                    Nemesis actually succeeds in calling up “The Phantom of Astarte.” Commanding her
                    to speak, neither he nor Arimanes can manage it. Then Manfred tries with his
                    spasmodic, insistent, and ultimately confused prayer since, as he admits, “I
                    know not what I ask, nor what I seek: / I feel but what thou art, and what I am”
                    (II.iv.131-2). When Astarte is finally induced—<emph>prayed</emph>—to speak,
                    her words are cryptic, not least of all when Manfred makes his final desperate
                    plea: “One word for mercy” (II.iv.154). The word turns out to be Manfred’s name.
                    What does that <emph>mean</emph>?</p>
                <p> From the outset of the poem/play, Manfred has come before us as a person of
                    consummate power, knowledge, and decision. But that image of Manfred is also
                    being cunningly undermined from the very beginning. Recall, for instance, his
                    move in Act I, scene one to summon the “spirits.” A sly comical tone pervades
                    the scene where we watch him take three tries to succeed in his conjuration. He
                    didn’t know exactly how to proceed. When he finally does hit on the correct
                    formula, we discover something else that’s interesting. We see that Manfred
                    didn’t know how those “subordinate” spirits, especially the Seventh Spirit,
                    would play tricks on him. That happens because Manfred is mistaken when he tells
                    the spirit that there is no “form on earth” he <emph>would</emph> find “hideous
                    or beautiful” (I.i.184-5). Manfred has unaccountably forgotten that the “form”
                    he at once fears and desires isn’t “on earth.” So when the Seventh Spirit
                    conjures “The shape of a beautiful female figure,” Manfred falls down
                    “senseless.” This is the “shape” or image of Astarte, not her phantom or ghost.
                    “The Phantom of Astarte” won’t appear until much later.</p>
                <p>Or remember that he knew he wanted to leap from the crag but hadn’t imagined he
                    would be prevented by a Chamois Hunter. Chance intervenes to prevent his
                    suicide. But when he leaves the Chamois Hunter—let’s call him Wordsworth,
                    another of <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s secrets—he was free to resume
                    what he began. But he doesn’t. So, we wonder: does he <emph>really</emph> want
                    “Forgetfulness” and “Self-Oblivion”? Do we believe it when he says that he does?
                    Does he even want to die? What exactly is Manfred after?</p>
                <p>Or remember that he says he can “call the dead / And ask them what it is we dread
                    to be” (II.ii.178-9). But when he does this in Act II scene four, he doesn’t ask
                    Astarte that question at all. His prayer to Astarte’s Phantom is largely a
                    confession of his bewilderment (“I know not what I ask or what I seek”) until he
                    stumbles at last to his desperate request for “One word for mercy.” What are we
                    to make of the Phantom’s merciless-merciful answer, “Manfred”?</p>

                    Consider how freighted that final sentence is with the language of
                    Christian theology. But here the remark has wrung out the theology that stands
                    behind the words. Manfred politely declares how deeply he is in debt “for the
                    grace accorded” to him by Nemesis, Arimanes, and the demons. But such creatures
                    are not the agents of grace. Grace is accorded by God through Jesus Christ, and
                    this grace then frees you of the debt of sin. For anyone—like myself—who has
                    internalized the discourse of grace and debt and redemption, the passage is a
                    piece of well-mannered blasphemy. It recalls nothing so much as the polite
                    exchanges between Michael and Satan in <title level="m">The Vision of
                        Judgment.</title></p>
                <p>Or consider this remark in his final act of defiance against the authority of the
                    demons who come to demand that he fulfill his bargain to live out the great myth
                    of Faust. “I do not combat against Death, but thee / And thy surrounding angels”
                    (III.iv.112-3). That is surely an odd thing to declare. Had he said, or had
                    Byron written, “And thy surrounding <emph>demons</emph>” both the prosody and
                    the myth would have been preserved intact. The word “angels” is seriously
                    intrusive. Are the angels of God hanging around the action of <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title>? When the word comes in here we are flung back in thought
                    to the time when the demons were simply rebellious angels “hurled from heaven
                    for sinning” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title> IV.1). That prehistorical event
                    is much on Manfred’s mind throughout.</p>
                <p>These striking passages invite one to think again about what is perhaps <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title>’s greatest passage, the “Incantation” that
                    climaxes and closes Act I scene one. Though it begs for a line by line
                    examination, I will confine my comments to a few of the most salient passages.
                    First off, recall how it is introduced to us: “A Voice is heard in the
                    Incantation which follows.” That is surely far more a direction for reading than
                    what it is formally, a stage direction. But it is indeed a stage direction for
                    the play of language Byron has mounted. One can easily miss the plain meaning of
                    those words: that we should be listening for “A Voice” within the incantation
                    which follows. We hear and read an incantation as we hear and read for the
                    subtext that is working somehow or other inside. The Incantation is double-talk,
                    both “a magic voice <emph>and</emph> verse” that—<foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >mirabile dictu</foreign>—has “baptized [Manfred] with a curse”
                    (I.i.223-4).</p>
                <p>In its most obvious register the Incantation is a curse laid upon Manfred by
                    Manfred himself, as the astonishing sixth stanza makes clear: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>By thy cold breast and serpent smile, </l>
                            <l>By thy unfathom’d gulfs of guile, </l>
                            <l>By that most seeming virtuous eye, </l>
                            <l>By thy shut soul’s hypocrisy; </l>
                            <l>By the perfection of thine art </l>
                            <l>Which pass’d for human thine own heart; </l>
                            <l>By thy delight in others’ pain, </l>
                            <l>And by thy brotherhood of Cain, </l>
                            <l>I call upon thee! and compel </l>
                            <l>Thyself to be thy proper Hell! (I.i.252-61)</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote> Manfred is the ultimate authority for the curse, just as earlier we saw
                    that he could command the spirits because his life has been ruled by “a star
                    condemn’d” (I.i.44). That would be “Astarte,” who “withered” when she “gazed on”
                    Manfred’s “heart” (II.ii.119). It would also be Manfred, since Astarte is “The
                    star which rules [his] destiny” (I.i.110).</p>
                <p> “Wither” is the key, the final word in the “Incantation.” But it is a word
                    within which we hear another word, as becomes clear when we pluck each of them
                    out of their key locations in <title level="m">Manfred</title>:

                    Wither/whither. That is one of the most provocative as well as one of
                    the most decisive wordplays in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Decisive
                    because it’s so plainly tied to the surface action, the plot as traditionally
                    understood. Whither has the withered Astarte gone, whither is the wither-cursed
                    Manfred going at the end of the poem? Unlike Manfred, who has pledged allegiance
                    to the Kantian proverb, <foreign xml:lang="la">sapere aude</foreign>, the Abbot
                    dreads to think about that because he can only imagine either heaven or hell.
                    But an entirely different “Voice” may be heard in the unreferenced first-person
                    pronouns that speak through the Incantation. It is the voice we can only call
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Not Manfred, not Astarte, not even Byron.
                        <emph>Manfred</emph>, the one word that matches the strange “mercy” being
                    offered by the poem (or is it a play?).</p>
                <p> Well, as we know, it <emph>is</emph> a play, a play of language that we are
                    called to pay attention to. Some of the moments announce themselves with an
                    outrageous, comedic directness, as when a spirit says of the “convulsed” Manfred
                    after Astarte departs at the end of Act II: “He would have made an awful spirit”
                    (II.iv.162). Of course, that word means, first of all, “awe-inspiring,” like God
                    Almighty. But a ludic voice is heard in the spirit’s language that Byron would
                    soon let loose (1818) when he published <title level="m">Beppo</title>, written
                    shortly after <title level="m">Manfred</title>. It is a vulgate meaning of
                    “awful” that he received out of his Scots linguistic heritage and that is now
                    perhaps the primary meaning of the word. <note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Burns supplies good instances of the Scots usage—for instance in <title
                            level="a">Tam O’Shanter</title>, 141.</note> In <title level="m"
                        >Beppo</title>, Byron again puns upon that word, or rather torques and
                        <emph>works</emph> it, to skewer the pious poet Sotheby as “A stalking
                    oracle of awful phrase” (LXXIV). </p>
                <p> Or consider the three times that <title level="m">Manfred</title> calls up the
                    image of a desert, the psychic place referenced in the contemporary lyric
                    “Stanzas to Augusta”: “In the desert a fountain is springing” (45). In <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title> the word is carefully manipulated in order to
                    effect its striking final transformation and transvaluation. Here is the word in
                    its first two appearances: <quote>

                    </quote> That spelling, unusual now, was still a common orthographic form in
                    Byron’s time. But the word could be—and was by Byron—spelled both ways, and
                    in <title level="m">Manfred</title> Byron exploited the optional spelling to
                    fine effect. The third usage comes in Manfred’s climactic act of defiance in the
                    final scene. I shall quote the relevant passage at some length because it has
                    some further, equally remarkable and equally salient, word plays.

                    </quote> The pentameter line has, as throughout <title level="m"
                    >Manfred</title>, an iambic base, and in this passage, we see that all the lines
                    are quite regular until we come to the initial foot of “Born from the knowledge
                    of its own desert.” The line opens with an inversion but then quickly resumes
                    its iambic regularity. When we reach the final foot of the line, we would have
                    another clear inversion <emph>if</emph> the word were spelled “desart,” as it
                    was spelled twice before. But here it is spelled “desert” and the difference
                    exposes a word play that Byron achieves through prosodic ambiguity. If the
                    accent is left to fall on the word’s first syllable, then the line echoes the
                    idea (and the word) of “In the desert a fountain is springing.” But if it is
                    left to fall on the second syllable, filling out the iambic rhythm, then the
                    word means something else. It means “dessert,” and we hear in the line an echo
                    of Manfred coming at last to his just desserts. </p>
                <p> Is Byron also playing with the phrase “Born from”? It’s hard to think otherwise.
                    And if we look closely at the next four lines, in particular the parallel syntax
                    in the statement “I have been . . . my own destroyer and will be my own
                    hereafter,” more games with language are in play. “Hereafter” is primarily an
                    adverb and here, at first encounter so to speak, that is how we read it. But
                    because the parallelism encourages one to read it simultaneously as a noun, the
                    line is made to carry a virtually Nietzchean meaning. Note how the word “own,”
                    under these pressures, also slightly shifts its meaning the second time around. </p>
                <p> Or what about the comment Nemesis makes after “The Phantom of Astarte” leaves:
                    “She’s gone, and will not be recall’d” (II.iv.180). Actually, Astarte will never
                        <emph>not</emph> be “recall’d” (remembered) exactly because she is, like
                    Manfred himself at the play’s conclusion, “gone” forever. As such, she has
                    become what the dead Leila is to the Giaour, “The Morning-star of Memory”
                    (1130). This kind of Byronic loss operates according to a poetic formula laid
                    out in a lovely little poem Byron wrote shortly after returning in 1811 from his
                    Levantine sojourn. Though probably written with John Edleston specifically in
                    mind, the verses recall as well three other keenly felt losses: John Wingfield,
                    Charles Skinner Matthews, and his mother. <quote>

                    others have escaped my attention. While I leave those to your discovery, it may
                    be useful to recall that <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s structure depends in
                    great part on a handful of keywords like fear [9], mind [11], hour [12], “star”
                    [14], voice [15], soul [18], come [31], power [39], earth [46]. “Gone,” though
                    less frequently repeated, is yet another since it is invoked at three of <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title>’s most significant moments: II.iv.155, III.ii.29,
                    and III.iv.152-153. And, of course, “spirit” is everywhere, all of them, I
                    believe, transformations of what Manfred calls “the inborn spirit” 
                    (III.ii.22)—to make a distinction with the spirit or soul of men created by God. Such words
                    form a constellation of echoing motifs that recall the pervading presence of
                    Manfred’s epipsyche, Astarte, whose being and absent presence is specifically
                    linked to music (see I.i.175-9 and II.iv.134-5), as is Manfred’s:

                    significant demands on a reader’s attention. They underscore the aggressive
                    strangeness of one particular passage that we want to look at carefully. Coming
                    after Manfred turns off the Witch of the Alps and her offer to help him gain
                    what he “wishes” (II.ii.157), the passage is a kind of gloss on two enigmatic
                    but crucial lines in the “Incantation”: “Though thy death shall still seem near
                    / To thy wish, but as a fear” (I.i.256-7).

                    </quote> No one, I submit, can follow that passage and claim to understand what
                    it is saying while it is being read. Even when we excavate its allusions it
                    resists. Part of the difficulty is its odd juxtaposition of a mysterious
                    biblical event with a recondite episode from Greek history. Perhaps even more
                    obdurate are its rich and cryptic linguistic particulars. Consider as well how
                    the fall of that arresting language follows upon a phrase—“if they answer 
                    not”—that floats in an ambiguous syntactic space. It comes at first as a hanging
                    afterthought but then shifts to the opening of a sentence that is never
                    completed, the words dissolving into the dark exempla of two men who (vainly)
                    sought helpful knowledge from the dead. </p>
                <p>As if anticipating a reader’s puzzlement, Byron added an explanatory note to
                    clarify the second of those exempla: <quote> The story of Pausanias, king of
                        Sparta, (who commanded the Greeks at the battle of Platea, and afterwards
                        perished for an attempt to betray the Lacedemonians) and Cleonice, is told
                        in Plutarch's life of Cimon; and in the Laconics of Pausanias the Sophist,
                        in his description of Greece. (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:473) </quote>
                    Such a note only doubles down on the obscure verse. It has all the perversity,
                    though none of the slapstick, of those wonderfully preposterous notes Byron
                    attached to <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Reading this note, one wants to
                    reprise what Byron wrote in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> of Coleridge’s
                    obscure “metaphysics”: “Explaining his poetics to the nation, / We wish he’d
                    annotate his annotation” (see <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, “Introduction”
                    II).</p>
                <p> And we <emph>could</emph> annotate Byron’s annotation, as various editors have.
                    But if we did, the original textual problems would scarcely be removed. All the
                    words in the passage still preserve—indeed, they positively “fulfill”—their
                    “dubious import.” Certainly, we recognize that Pausanias and Cleonice are being
                    offered as types to Manfred’s and Astarte’s antitypes, but after we make that
                    equation our reflections on the ancient historical episode that Byron
                    elliptically lays out simply run free. “Dubious import”? I <emph>guess</emph>
                    so! The two sources Byron cites, Plutarch and Pausanias the Sophist, tell very
                    different versions of the story. As we pause over a glorious phrase like
                    “Arcadian Evocators,” we might well think—or hear—the passage itself as
                        <emph>evocative</emph>. </p>
                <p> Verse and note are alike seriously <emph>pro</emph>vocative, inviting us to
                    search out the relevance of Byron’s recollected tale. But the language of the
                    passage is such that it erects a kind of maze from its flagrant language. Where
                    to begin researching those particulars? Suppose we bracket out everything but
                    the central event, the murder of Cleonice, what do we get? This is what Byron’s
                    records—not Byron’s note—tell us. Pausanias has taken Cleonice, a princess
                    of Bithynia, for his mistress. When she comes at night to his chamber, she
                    accidentally overturns the lamp that was burning at his bedside. In the darkness
                    he awakes startled and, thinking she is an enemy, kills her with his sword,
                    “unknowing what he slew” (II.ii.186). Although the scene vaguely recalls what we
                    were told of Astarte’s death, it is the bedside lamp—unmentioned in Byron’s
                    verse or prose note—that leaps to attention, taking one back to the very
                    opening line of <title level="m">Manfred</title>: “The lamp must be
                    replenish’d”! </p>
                <p>To register that odd nexus, to make the connection that is at once hidden and
                    invited, produces a seriously uncanny effect. Were the deaths of Cleonice and
                    Astarte in some unrecognized sense Manfred’s fatality, the condition holding
                    him—before the play or even his life began—to his “enduring” vigil? <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title> seems a play of language in which secrets lie
                    about everywhere, awaiting—seeking—discovery. This passage fairly defines
                    how <title level="m">Manfred</title> repeatedly “send[s] us prying into the
                    abyss” of its seductive intimations (<title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                        Pilgrimage</title> IV.166).</p>
                <p>The first person to annotate Byron’s annotation was Goethe, who was interested
                    because he knew <title level="m">Manfred</title> had been composed with his own
                        <title level="m">Faust </title>(Part I) in mind. We’ve already heard Peter
                    Manning’s brilliant remarks on Goethe’s misreading, but I return to Goethe now
                    because his commentary illuminates why Byron found Goethe’s famous poem the
                    perfect vehicle for roughing up the Western myth of Faust.</p>
                <p>Goethe begins with fulsome praise for what he calls the “wonderful phenomenon” of
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>, “Byron’s tragedy”: <quote> This singular
                        intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the
                        strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the
                        impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of
                        them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot
                        enough admire his genius. (qtd. in <title level="m">Works</title> V:506-7)
                    <note place="foot" resp="author">Byron heard of Goethe’s 1820 review of

                    Searching through
                    “the alterations [Byron] has made” to his poem, Goethe recognizes in <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title> “the quintessence of the most astonishing talent
                    born to be its own tormenter.” Seeing that, admiring it, he then confesses his
                    “dissatisfaction” with <title level="m">Manfred</title>, judging “that the
                    gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at last oppressive to
                    us.” </p>
                <p> As Peter Manning has pointed out in his essay from this volume, however,
                    Goethe’s view is based on a comically mistaken piece of gossip about Byron’s
                    personal sin and guilt. Completely absorbed in Byronic mythology, Goethe writes
                    that <quote> When a bold and enterprising young man, he won the affections of a
                        Florentine lady. Her husband discovered the amour, and murdered his wife;
                        but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street, and there was
                        no one on whom any suspicion could be attached. Lord Byron removed from
                        Florence, and these spirits haunted him all his life after. </quote> Guess
                    what? That would be a mashup of the stories of <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>, <title level="m">The Corsair</title>, and <title level="m"
                        >Lara</title> set in Italy! Believing the Florentine tale to be true, Goethe
                    goes on to argue that the Pausanias and Cleonice passage reflects Byron
                    “select[ing] a scene from antiquity, appropriat[ing] it to himself, and
                    burden[ing] his tragic image with it.” Byron was much amused by Goethe’s
                    fantasy.</p>
                <p> Yet in one obvious sense, Goethe is correct. Byron did select and burden his
                    poem and his hero with that tale from antiquity. But Goethe’s reading misfires
                    not so much because it is so badly misinformed about Byron’s actual life. It
                    misses its mark because <title level="m">Manfred</title> is about as far from
                    what Goethe repeatedly calls it, a “tragedy,” as that famous “Greatest Story
                    Ever Told” hovering in <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s background. Although
                    guilt and suffering are the pivot points of both stories—Jesus is crucified
                    and Manfred, like Ahab, has “a crucifixion in his face”—their finales are in
                    the strictest sense comic. </p>
                <p>Many have understandably glossed <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s climactic
                    scene with the closing lines of his poem “Prometheus,” Byron’s pastiche of a
                    chorus from Aeschylus’s lost play <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>:
                    “Triumphant where it dares defy / And making death a victory” (58-9). But <title
                        level="m">Manfred</title> does not actually conclude in a posture of
                    triumphant defiance. That moment comes in the poem’s penultimate scene, when the
                    demons are dismissed. The finale comes afterwards and centers in Manfred’s
                    famous, even complacent, last words: “Old man! ’tis not so difficult to die.”
                    After the fitful fevers of his life, Manfred expects to sleep well. </p>
                <p>Most telling, Manfred’s last words echo St. Paul’s gloss on the meaning of the
                    life of Jesus, a tale whose argument is “that ye put off . . . the old man . . .
                    and put on the new man” (Ephesians 4: 22-24). Christian theology regards the
                    life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as a fundamentally comic action, a view
                    gloriously represented in Dante’s <foreign xml:lang="la">
                        <title level="m">Divina Commedia</title></foreign>. <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> is a comic action as well, but, being a kind of parody of
                    the Christian story, it also involves a series of comical texts that help to
                    build up the insidious, truly Nietzschean, joke on which <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> concludes. The last state of Manfred is far different from
                    the first. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Manfred</title>, Goethe said, “closely touched me,” and it is
                    easy to see that <title level="m">Faust</title> Part II marshals an argument
                    against the “unbounded and exuberant despair” that he found so “oppressive” in
                        <title level="m">Manfred</title>. We know that in December 1816 Goethe had
                    sketched out a plan for Part II, but that plan did not indicate exactly how Part
                    II would end. It seems that reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1817,
                    which Goethe did, set him on his course to bring Faust to the redemption he
                    receives in Part II Act V when angels “bear Faust’s immortal essence” into
                    heaven. The redeemed Faust is exalted because his struggles have purified him:

                    </quote> As Goethe told Eckermann in 1831, he wanted Part II to move beyond the
                    tragic action of Part I—he saw Part I as a tragedy—to install a poetic
                    conception that “harmonizes perfectly with our religious views; according to
                    which we can obtain heavenly bliss, not through our strength alone, but with the
                    assistance of divine grace.”<note place="foot" resp="author"><title

                <p> I bring up Goethe and Part II of <title level="m">Faust</title> in order to
                    spell out the sharp differences between their respective comedies. In a late
                    letter Goethe said that Part II was organized around a set of “very seriously
                    intended jests (<emph>Scherzen</emph>).” <note place="foot" resp="author">
                        The matter is discussed in Herman Meyer, <title level="a">'These Very
                            Serious Jests,'</title> reprinted in the first (1976) Norton Critical
                        Edition of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's <title level="m">Faust. A
                            Tragedy</title>, op. cit. ed., 603-615.</note> These enable the work’s
                    economy of grace and the redemption of Faust. But the comedy of <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> is different—indeed, it is deeply irreverent. Manfred has
                    no interest in either atonement or redemption (“What I have done is done”). He
                    rejects both as clearly as had Byron throughout his life. </p>
                <p> What has happened in Byron’s poem that has brought Manfred to his peaceful
                    death? Consider again the Pausanias and Cleonice passage, in this case the
                    opening lines:

                        </sp>
                    </quote> Though Manfred indeed has “no natural fear” (I.i.25), though he is
                    proud and defiant in face of all circumstance, he is nonetheless wracked by
                    fear. Indeed, he sees his life’s purpose not to overcome but exactly to
                    “champion human fears” (II.ii.205). </p>
                <p>So, what <emph>is</emph> it “that we dread to be,” that Manfred dreads to be, and
                    that he means to champion? He calls the dead, Astarte, to find out. The
                    consequence of their interview at the end of Act II, and of Manfred’s fearfully
                    tormented prayer to her, is the entirely untormented Act III. The psychic change
                    in Manfred is dramatic. We know, we can see, what has happened: in the end,
                    Manfred has no fears at all, natural or unnatural. We want to know why. What is
                    it that we’re <emph>not</emph> seeing?</p>
                <p>It helps to recall that Astarte declares “Manfred” the “one word for mercy.” In
                    addition, it helps to parse the cunning wordplays in “what it is we dread to be
                    . . . that is nothing.” One can scarcely not think of Hamlet’s famous soliloquy
                    and the “consummation devoutly to be wished” that Hamlet could not, however,
                    commit to. Before his interview with Astarte, Manfred dreads to be mortal and
                    therefore finally “nothing.” Manfred’s is the Faustian fear <emph>to be</emph>
                    mortal, simply to be Manfred: unpurified, unatoned, unredeemed, and—finally—“gone”:
                    “of the earth, earthy,” and then at last—to appropriate and shift the
                    Abbot’s final word—“earthless.”</p>
                <p>A letter Byron wrote in 1819 to Richard Hoppner helps to gloss the meaning of the
                    Byronic “mercy” exposed in <title level="m">Manfred</title>. Visiting Bologna,
                    he stopped at the Certosa Cemetery and was deeply moved by the epitaphs engraved
                    on the tombs of Martini Luigi and Lucrezia Pinini: “<foreign xml:lang="ro"
                        >implora pace</foreign>,” “<foreign xml:lang="it">implora eterna
                        quiete</foreign>”. “It appears to me,” he wrote, “that these two and three
                    words comprise and compress all that can be said on the subject—and then in
                    Italian they are absolute Music” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:147). That
                    would be the absolute music of, say, <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, not
                    the Music of the Spheres.</p>
                <p>The comedy of <title level="m">Manfred</title> has set the agenda for the
                    soon-to-be-written <title level="m">Beppo</title> and <title level="m">Don
                        Juan.</title> One thinks of Byron’s cheeky reply to John Murray’s request to
                    give up <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and write “a great work,” something
                    serious—an “epic”! <quote> I'll try no such thing; I hate tasks. And then
                        “seven or eight years!” God send us all well this day three months, let
                        alone years. . . . You have so many “divine” poems, is it nothing to have
                        written a human one? without any of your worn-out machinery? (April 6, 1819,
                            <title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:105) </quote>
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> has a lot of worn out poetical—and 
                    religious—machinery. Indeed, the whole point of <title level="m">Manfred</title> was to
                    give that machinery its final <emph>quietus</emph>. Reading it in 1817, Murray
                    and his editorial committee were uneasy, and especially with the outrageous
                    comedy of the original third act where the Abbot is manhandled by Astarte’s dark
                    double, Ashtaroth, who carries him off singing a profane jingle. They begged him
                    to rewrite it, and he did. But, by 1819, Byron was no longer open to such pleas,
                    having seen the first two cantos of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> expurgated
                    without his knowledge or permission. </p>
                <p>And yet perhaps <title level="m">Manfred</title> was improved by taking out those
                    Monty Python hijinks. The work’s impious argument loses none of its force, or
                    comic charm, for being better mannered. </p>
