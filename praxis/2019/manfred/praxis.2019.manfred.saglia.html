            <p class="noCount">Voice in Byron’s <em>Manfred</em> is a vehicle for authorial power, as well as representing an unstable force that
               may turn against those that wield it—and thus primarily against the protagonist. Placed
               at the nexus of the physical and the spiritual, the human and the non-human, voice
               is a structural theme in the play, relating to spiritual and transcendental issues
               on the one hand, and questions of theatrical performance typical of the Romantic-period
               stage on the other. Multiplying the forms and meanings of utterance, <em>Manfred</em> foregrounds, explores, and valorizes voice, which in turn oscillates between a deceivingly
               singular denotation and an unstoppable process of proliferating connotations. In Byron’s
               dramatic poem, voice and voicing delineate a field of contacts, overlaps, and tensions,
               concentrating its questions about identity, power, authority, and control, as well
               as transcendental and social forms of interconnection or separation. This essay demonstrates
               that the process of transiting on which Byron’s play is predicated is crucially rooted
               in the dual nature of voice, its function as an instrument for conjuring and materializing,
               and its problematic relevance in the theater of the time.</p>

            </header><br/><p>The earliest occurrence of “voice” in <em>Manfred</em> appears in Act I, scene one where it resonates through the protagonist’s own voice
               as he invokes the spirits who will be carrying out his “task” (I.i.28):</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">. . . Now by the voice of him</div>

                  <div class="l">Who is undying,—Rise! appear!—Appear! (I.i.37-40)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Discussing this first mention of a “voice” in the text, Jerome McGann notes that:
               “This is one of <em>Manfred</em>’s keywords and should be tracked carefully through the poem. Ultimately, the ‘voice’
               that ‘is the first among’ the spirits and the other characters in the poem, including
               Manfred himself, is Byron’s, the artificer of the entire imaginative work” (Byron
               <em>Manfred</em> note to l.37). As Manfred carries out his first act of conjuring, the iteration of
               “by” informs the invocation and its mantra-like tone, its incremental repetition awarding
               a more than human authority to the protagonist’s speech and language of power based
               on explicit lexis (“power upon you,” [I.i.36]), vocatives (“Mysterious Agency,” [I.i.28]),
               and imperatives (“Rise! appear!” [I.i.36]). Ironically, however, all this is turned
               against Manfred later in the same Act and scene by the “<em>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</em>” (<em>CPW</em> IV:60), which curses him in a similarly structured stanza (“By thy cold breast and
               serpent smile, / By thy unfathom’d gulfs of guile,” I.i.242-3). If voice stands for
               the power of authorship, it also represents an unstable force that may turn against
               those who wield it. At the same time, in both occurrences voice crucially functions
               as an interface between the physical and the spiritual, the human and the non-human.</p>
            <p>As James Mulholland suggests, a possible definition of “voice studies” pivots on their
               “use [of] voice as an analytic with which to understand the creation of literary texts
               and the process of reading in a sensate, aural world” (10-1), while their area of
               investigation focuses on forms of “textual virtualization” of voice that center on
               “the relationship among voice, self, and authority” (3, 13). Addressing these concerns,
               virtualizations of voice in Romantic-era literature function as a point of convergence
               of issues related to the production and reception of texts. In this respect, Susan
               Eilenberg has offered illuminating insights into Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetics
               by examining what happens “when a poet opens his mouth and somebody else’s voice comes
               out,” thus also raising questions about “the source of the poetic voice and the meaning
               of authorship” (3). Yet, questions of voice also present cultural implications that
               range beyond the perimeters of the text and bring into focus a whole range of issues
               of a corporeal, material, and ideological kind.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In this light, the foregrounding of voice in <em>Manfred</em> points to another level of significance, one that is more prosaic than those listed
                  so far, as well as a frequently overlooked one: voice is the highly problematic vehicle
                  for theatrical performance in Romantic-period drama (Nuss 7-8). Indeed, it was a major
                  concern for Joanna Baillie, the foremost dramatic and theatrical theorist of the age.
                  In the “Introductory Discourse” to her first volume of <em>Plays on the Passions</em> (1798), she linked voice, power, and dramatic effectiveness by remarking that, when
                  passions are made to “raise their voice, the power of distinguishing themselves has
                  been taken away” (92). Later, in the Preface 
                  “To the Reader”
                   to her third volume of <em>Plays on the Passions</em> (1812), she noted that: “The Public have now to choose between what we shall suppose
                  are well-written and well-acted plays, the words of which are . . . heard but imperfectly
                  . . . and splendid pantomime, or pieces whose chief object is to produce striking
                  scenic effect” (<em>Works</em> 231). A playtext in which these preoccupations coalesced in remarkably effective ways
                  was Coleridge’s <em>Remorse</em>, the most successful stage tragedy of the period, which Byron knew and appreciated,
                  and which seems to have left some traces in his own output (Cochran 70-2). The “splendid
                  pantomime” in <em>Remorse</em> was its celebrated conjuring scene, which mixed magic, pantomime, voice (through an
                  incantation, as in <em>Manfred</em>), music, and a variety of visual effects. And this imbrication of voice inside a
                  complex textual-performative continuum brings us back to <em>Manfred</em>, which presents a similar array of practices and devices borrowed from the contemporary
                  stage (Martin 107-16). In Byron’s “dramatic poem,” however, voice is also a specifically
                  pre-eminent textual item (one of its key-words, as McGann says), structuring the play’s
                  construction of a transcendental reality that mirrors and questions material reality.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On the “spiritual” nature of Manfred, see Byron’s letter to Thomas Moore of 25 March
                           1817, where he humorously calls it a “mad Drama” and a “Bedlam tragedy” in which,
                           he exaggeratedly adds, “all the dram. pers. are spirits, ghosts, or magicians” (BLJ
                           V:188).</span></div>
                  </div> In <em>Manfred</em>, Byron problematizes this connection and its liminal or transitional status by investing
                  consistently in voice and voicing, which he knew to be major issues for playwrights,
                  actors, and audiences owing to the enormous sizes of the main theaters and because
                  of the increasing popularity and influence of melodrama, in which voice is constantly
                  on the point of being submerged by silence or music.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In tracing the connections between <em>Manfred</em> and the contemporary stage, Philip Martin defined the play as an attempt at “modernizing
               the Gothic drama” (107), whereas more recently Jeffrey Cox has interpreted it as a
               critical revision of melodrama, Gothic or otherwise (76-8). Cox pointedly reads <em>Manfred</em> as “a response to the melodrama and its evocation of perpetual war” (60), the latter
               being his phrase for the state of continued tension in Europe and the world following
               the peace ostensibly decreed by Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna. A reaction to
               melodrama’s reactionary endorsement of a “restoration of order” (60), <em>Manfred</em> is “an after-war play that challenges the main form of post-war drama, the melodrama,
               in order to suggest a quite different response to the post-Waterloo world” (67). Accordingly,
               from Cox’s perspective, Byron’s play was “the serious drama of the post-Waterloo moment
               that was missing from the 1815-1816 season” (67). As such, <em>Manfred</em> adopts and at the same time contests the distinctive features of melodrama, one of
               which is voice, since, as Peter Brooks remarks, the melodramatic mode is typically
               informed by a “desire to express all” (4). In melodrama, “nothing is left unsaid”
               as “characters stand on stage and utter the unspeakable, give voice to their deepest
               feelings” (4).</p>
            <p>Reworking these various premises and contexts, <em>Manfred</em> multiplies the potential and import of utterance and, in doing so, foregrounds, explores,
               and valorizes them. In turn, voice and voicing take on a complex series of meanings
               that oscillate between a deceivingly singular denotation and an unstoppable process
               of proliferating connotations.</p>
            <p>After Manfred’s act of conjuring, “<em>a voice is heard singing</em>” (<em>CPW</em> IV:54), a voice that echoes and answers his own voice, yet is a bodiless and unlocated
               sound. As McGann highlights, this voice is unattributed (it is unclear whose voice
               it is) and unplaced (we do not know where it comes from). These complications are
               then compounded by the fact that “the stage direction signals that a social space
               exists in a dimension not explicitly present to the named characters,” so that the
               stage direction itself “emerges as a character who is aware of that social space,
               and who plays a major role in the action of <em>Manfred</em>” (Byron <em>Manfred</em> note to ll.191-2). In addition, this bodiless and unlocated voice is a nod to the
               onstage/offstage dynamic typical of Romantic-period drama and especially Gothic drama,
               which constituted a major “location of in/visible actions and meanings” that “reinforce[d]
               and expand[ed] the tendency of Gothic theater to transgress the divide between on-
               and offstage, visible and invisible, real and imaginary” (Saglia “Theater” 362). A
               linking element shuttling between stage direction and dramatic text, voice in <em>Manfred</em> contributes to creating trans-dimensional interconnections, a process which is the
               play’s central textual concern as well as its distinctive performative trait.</p>
            <p>The connective function carried out by voice takes a variety of shapes from the outset.
               In the opening scene, it combines and contrasts sweetness and harshness, when Manfred
               blandishes the Spirits by saying: “‘I hear / Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,
               / As music on the waters’” (I.i.175-7). However, later in the same scene, the “<em>voice . . . heard in the Incantation</em>” adopts a very different tone, the angry invective of a curse, which encapsulates
               other, far from soothing, voices:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">And a magic voice and verse</div>
                  <div class="l">Hath baptized thee with a curse;</div>
                  <div class="l">And a spirit of the air</div>
                  <div class="l">Hath begirt thee with a snare;</div>
                  <div class="l">In the wind there is a voice<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                  <div class="l">Shall forbid thee to rejoice;</div>
                  <div class="l">And to thee shall Night deny</div>
                  <div class="l">All the quiet of her sky (I.i.222-9)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Because the planes connected by voice are also those of power and disempowerment,
               Manfred’s use of voice as an instrument of authority in Act I, scene one is significantly
               short-lived, since it is immediately turned against him in this revision of the balance
               between the human and super-human.</p>
            <p>That the voice “<em>in the Incantation</em>” is one of the outstanding enigmatic features in Byron’s text is immediately visible
               from the very phrase “<em>in the Incantation</em>,” seemingly intimating that the voice is inside the incantation it is uttering, that
               it not so much its source but rather an attribute or a feature of it. McGann sees
               <em>Manfred</em> as “a crucial work in Byron’s career” and his ongoing contention with the Romantic
               imagination, since it “fully objectifies the self-destructiveness of this [betraying
               and betrayed] imagination” and promotes “the deconstruction of the self-deceived and
               self-destructive Romantic imagination” and its treacherously solipsistic propensities
               (“Brain” 64). McGann reads this process of deconstruction as deeply embedded in the
               Incantation, where the voice that “speaks the truth over the unconscious Manfred”
               is in fact “the silenced voice of Astarte,” a kind of audible absence conveying “her
               spectrous form of libido” as well as unveiling the betrayals of the imagination (64-5).
               From another perspective, Timothy Morton has drawn attention to the “offstage” quality
               of the voice “in the Incantation,” which “emanates from a hidden source” and constitutes
               what he terms an “acousmatic voice” (161). This mysterious voice works to convey “a
               sense of space that fills the auditorium” and is thus “necessarily synaesthetic”—a
               bridge between the play’s phantasmatic dimensions and its physical and material conditions
               of production, on the one hand, and its impact on reader or spectator, on the other
               (160).</p>
            <p>Although they pursue different interpretative agendas, these critical insights share
               an interest in how voice in <em>Manfred</em> connects the material and the immaterial, functioning as a lynchpin between bodied
               and disembodied states. Aptly, therefore, Act I, scene two features a reference to
               voice, as Manfred expresses a wish to escape his own body:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">. . . Oh, that I were</div>
                  <div class="l">The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,</div>
                  <div class="l">A living voice, a breathing harmony,</div>
                  <div class="l">A bodiless enjoyment—born and dying</div>
                  <div class="l">With the blest tone which made me! (I.ii.52-6)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Here Byron explores the liminal zone between physical presence and evanescence through
               the imagery and medium of voice. On one side, this vision relates to the theme of
               physical dissolution that runs through the play and emerges in such potent formulations
               as “Earth! take these atoms!” (I.ii.109). On the other, it unveils the text’s connections
               with contemporary stage Gothic, which was a crucial cultural site for the elaboration
               of ideas of embodiment, as well as reflections on corporeality and its links to selfhood.
               Multiform and constantly renovating itself, stretching all the way from the 1760s
               to the 1820s and beyond (if we take Horace Walpole’s 1768 <em>The Mysterious Mother</em> as its starting point), stage Gothic developed a complex series of engagements with
               physicality, ranging from the overwhelmingly material body of the villain to the dissolving
               body of the specter (Saglia “Staging” 166-7).</p>
            <p>Surfacing several times in the text, this doubleness is in full view in the Abbot’s
               description of Manfred’s confused condition in Act III: “an awful chaos—light and
               darkness— / And mind and dust—and passions and pure thoughts / Mix’d, and contending
               without end or order” (III.i.164-6). Yet, Byron most effectively translates this binary
               couple of “excessively bodied” and “hauntingly disembodied” conditions through the
               couple Manfred-Astarte; and when the text awards a voice to the latter, it complicates
               further the already problematic status of the ghost in Gothic drama and its knot of
               aesthetic, cultural, and ideological stumbling blocks, such as how it should move,
               speak, and be dressed, or whether it should be represented on stage at all (Gamer
               131-4; Saggini 166-7). Oscillating between presence and absence, the ghostly utterance
               in <em>Manfred</em> bestows a whole new range of meanings on voice, placing it as a point of convergence
               between existence and non-existence.</p>
            <p>These preoccupations appear, in subtly allusive form, during Manfred’s exchange with
               the Chamois Hunter in Act II:</p>

            <p> As the Chamois Hunter reacts by calling Manfred a “Man of strange words” and inviting
               him to show “patience,” Manfred replies: “Patience and patience! Hence—that word was
               made / For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!” (II.i.31-6).</p>
            <p>Manfred has just been rescued from jumping off the edge of the Jungfrau. He has been
               removed from a position of liminality and oscillation between solidity and dissolution
               (he was “<em>in act to spring from the cliff</em>” [<em>CPW</em> IV:66]), his atoms on the point of returning to the great whirlpool of cosmic matter.
               Through language and voice, however, he continues to exist within a state of oscillation
               between different dimensions. The Chamois Hunter interprets this uncertain condition
               prosaically, telling him bluntly “thy senses wander from thee” (II.i.23), and thus
               positing a dissociation between body and mind, the material and immaterial components
               of the human. Manfred, instead, reinforces the oscillation by expanding on the implications
               of “blood,” the prime substance of physical and physiological life, which immediately
               becomes a reference to the consanguinity between him and Astarte that caused their
               passion (also associated with blood) to become criminal. In all this, the blood that
               was “shed” and the blood “[c]olouring the clouds” are the visible as well as symbolic
               signs of the sin that excludes him from “heaven.” Finally, the sense of liminality
               is summed up in Manfred’s description of heaven as the place “[w]here thou art not—and
               I shall never be,” a sentence that conjures up Byron’s distinctive preoccupation with
               “not being” somewhere, which complements what Stephen Cheeke has identified as Byron’s
               triadic concern with “[b]eing there, being in-between, having been there” (14).</p>
            <p>With a subsequent move, the text brings these locational shifts back into the fold
               of language and voicing. The Chamois Hunter associates Manfred with unusual language
               (“strange words”), a remark that doubles as an assessment of his uttering and voicing:
               Manfred’s words are strange both semantically (they do not make sense according to
               customary logic) as well as performatively (they are emphatic, overcharged). The hunter
               reacts to Manfred with a word, “patience,” that invites him to curb his semantic and
               performative unruliness alike, and which Manfred scornfully rejects by conjuring up
               another dissociation (“brutes of burthen” as opposed to “birds of prey”) mirroring
               the oscillation between material and immaterial, or lofty and mundane, that informs
               the entire play.</p>
            <p>Astarte is, of course, central to this fraught exchange between Manfred and the Chamois
               Hunter. She is present in that “ours” (II.i.25) which is then developed into the image
               of the “one heart” (II.i.26) and the observation that they “loved each other as we
               should not love” (II.i.27). Astarte is a figure—perhaps <em>the</em> figure—of oscillation in the play, and her spectral status is once again linked to
               voice in Act II. There, in the soliloquy following his fruitless interview with the
               Witch of the Alps, Manfred announces: “I have one resource / Still in my science—I
               can call the dead, / And ask them what it is we dread to be” (II.ii.177-9). “Calling”
               reprises one of Manfred’s distinctive uses of voice—the invocation, the act of conjuring
               up, and the naming that makes entities appear. Significantly, when Astarte appears
               in Act II, scene four, her phantom voice utters Manfred’s name, and this new connection
               between material and immaterial, human and non-human, reactivates his desire, while
               also inverting the pattern since Astarte calls Manfred from the world of immateriality.
               He implores the apparition: “Say on, say on—/ I live but in the sound—it is thy voice!”
               (II.iv.150-1). Yet, these words read as, or indeed, sound heavily, tragically ironic.
               They represent yet another of those moments when the play mocks its own High Romantic
               discourse and unmasks the traps and pitfalls of the imagination. For Astarte’s voice
               is in reality Manfred’s own voice, since he has just told the Witch of Alps that “[Astarte]
               was like me [ . . . ] to the very tone / Even of her voice” (II.ii.105-7). Inevitably,
               Manfred’s use of voice as a way of escaping his own body into Astarte’s disembodied
               presence cruelly, and humorously, collides with the hampering presence of himself,
               his own voice, and body.</p>
            <p>Unlike Acts I and II, the third act does not feature voice as a separate lexical element,
               yet presents a wide range of forms of uttering and speaking from the outset. It significantly
               begins with a serried list of references to language and acts of voicing: the Abbot
               wants to “confer” with Manfred (III.i.24); he informs him that “Rumours [ . . . ]
               are abroad” (III.i.29-30); tells him that the populace believe “thou holdest converse
               with the things / Which are forbidden to the search of man” (III.i.34-5); and yet
               he does not seek out Manfred to “speak of punishment” but “penitence and pardon” (III.i.57).
               Uniformly pertinent to the semantic field of sound and verbal communication, this
               list designs a crescendo that culminates in Manfred’s death in scene four. Aptly,
               the final scene also contains the protagonist’s last act of voicing—the tirade against
               the spirit and other demons, which constitutes his greatest, most movingly tragic
               expression of that free will and power which the voice in the incantation temporarily
               took away from him at the beginning and which have been constantly under threat from
               the other antagonistic forces in the play. At the start of this act of “unconjuring,”
               Manfred tells the main spirit:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">. . . Back to thy hell!</div>
                  <div class="l">Thou hast no power upon me, <em>that</em> I feel;</div>
                  <div class="l">Thou never shalt possess me, <em>that</em> I know:</div>
                  <div class="l">What I have done is done (III.iv.124-7)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The expression “What I have done” doubles implicitly as “What I have said,” since,
               as should be clear by now, Byron in <em>Manfred</em> makes doing and saying, or being and uttering, inextricable. Moreover, any temptation
               to read this last speech in a purely transcendental key, that is one which sees voice
               losing its oscillatory status between material and immaterial in favor of disembodiment
               and dissolution, is interrupted and belied by the insistent materiality of voice.</p>
            <p>As Manfred concludes his speech and the demons vanish, the Abbot addresses the protagonist
               and notes:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Alas! how pale thou art—thy lips are white—</div>
                  <div class="l">And thy breast heaves—and in thy gasping throat</div>
                  <div class="l">The accents rattle—Give thy prayers to heaven— (III.iv.143-4)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> With their charged language and staccato rhythm, these lines highlight the bleakly
               physiological materiality of Manfred’s final act of voicing. The reference to the
               protagonist’s “gasping throat” in which his “accents rattle” signals primarily the
               dissolution of his body: voice intimates an impending disembodiment. But they also
               hark back to the question of voice on the Romantic stage, as they refer to and make
               manifest, in metatheatrical fashion, the actual delivery of sound by the actor playing
               Manfred. In other words, the play’s conclusion returns to voicing as utterance and
               as a material, stage-bound act. The attention to tone and delivery in the Abbot’s
               remark, which resembles a stage direction embedded in the dialogue, reminds readers
               that this dramatic poem is a play, a textual artifact aimed at a performance that
               thrives on voice, its nuances, and effects.</p>
            <p>In <em>Manfred</em> voice delineates a transitional space—between the physical and the evanescent, the
               material and the spiritual—that is also a field of contacts, overlaps, and tensions.
               It is a site of problems and questions about identity (who is speaking? who is the
               listener?); power, authority, and control (also, and especially, in terms of the text’s
               pivotal theme of “resistance to power—or the network of power that situates and subjugates
               self and freedom” [An. 107]); and forms of interconnection or separation between dimensions
               and characters, from transcendental as well as social perspectives, as with the complex
               mediated verbal interactions in Act II between Manfred and the Chamois Hunter or Manfred
               and Arimanes. These shifts between dimensions and exchanges among the <em>dramatis personae</em> ground the process of transiting on which the play is predicated and are rooted in
               the dual nature of voice, its ritual function as an instrument for conjuring and materializing,
               as well as the dual status of voice in the theater of the time. A significant portion
               of the meaning of <em>Manfred</em> lies on the cusp between the written and the spoken word, the latter to be understood
               not just as the word vicariously uttered in the printed text, but also actually and
               physically uttered by voices on a stage.</p>
            <p>If Byron’s dramatic poem is unusual in problematizing voice to this extreme of complication
               and resonance, in this respect it is also recognizably Romantic. As a hybrid construct,
               <em>Manfred</em> reflects the question of voice as a recurrent concern in theater, but also more generally
               in the poetry of the period, as is visible in the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge,
               and Hemans, among others. Melynda Nuss has examined how, “[t]hrough his experiments
               with theatre, Wordsworth learns to position himself as both actor and spectator to
               create a unique and all-encompassing public voice” (11). Christopher Stokes explores
               in detail the “subtle, interesting, and intellectually challenging” features of Coleridge’s
               problematizing of voice in his output (10). And John Anderson has read Hemans’s <em>The Forest Sanctuary</em> (1825) as “a prolonged meditation on the idea of voice” (56) that “suggests destabilizing
               alternative approaches to established epic” (56) through “a chorus of male and female,
               dead and living voices together, dialogically creating worlds for those who have ears
               to hear” (73). These poets’ productions offer endless variations on voicing and utterance
               that contribute to delineating a complex metapoetic and metaliterary discourse within
               Romantic-period verse. In their works, voice variously functions as an interface between
               body and spirit, or thing and essence; a correlative of the “correspondent breeze”
               or the “Eolian harp;” or a locus of cultural identity and historical agency, as in
               the German Romantic notion, coined by Johann Gottfried Herder, of poetry as a powerful
               manifestation of the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Volkstimme</span>, the “voice of the people.” Byron in <em>Manfred</em> partly subscribes to and partly deviates from investments in voice by contemporary
               poets, as well as contemporary playwrights. Most peculiarly, by multiplying and intersecting
               the various meanings of voice, he places it at center stage so that his dramatic poem
               about a “Child of Clay” (I.i.131), who is “[h]alf dust, half deity” (I.ii.40), ultimately
               stands out as one of the major Romantic texts on the power and meaning of uttering
               words.</p>
