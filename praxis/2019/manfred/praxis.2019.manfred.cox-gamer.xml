                    theatrical genre of his time, melodrama. We place melodrama’s facility in
                    appropriating materials from other cultural forms alongside a less-acknowledged
                    corollary: that the melodrama was also itself a major object of cultural
                    consumption, enough so that a text like  <title level="m">Manfred</title> stands
                    in mutually defining relation to plays like <title level="m"
                        >Bluebeard</title>, <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, and <title

                    critical writing on consumption from Neil McKendrick and John Brewer to Colin

                    understanding Romantic cultural consumption and appropriation, fed as it is by
                    popular forms like the gothic while yet providing a critique of consumption
                    similar to those we associate with Romantic poetry.</p>

                  <head>Headnote:</head> <p rend="noCount">We were both very pleased to be invited to join the special
                    Romantic Bicentennials Commemorative Event: Lord Byron’s <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title>: Performance and Symposium. Many thanks to Omar F. Miranda
                    and Jerome McGann, as well as everyone associated with the bicentennial project.
                    It was a rare treat, indeed, to be able to watch Red Bull Theater’s staged
                    reading of Byron’s play, which brought the text to life in exciting new ways.
                    Once we saw an initial list of symposium topics, it became obvious that we were
                    taking up similar questions: Jeff had been thinking about <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> and melodrama for several years and had written about
                    Byron’s play in his <title level="m">Romanticism in the Shadow of War</title>;
                    Michael had just talked on the topic at the MLA Convention in Philadelphia
                    (2017). Having worked together before, we agreed to co-author a piece. Our
                    writing process began with Jeff responding to Michael’s paper and then with both
                    of us pursuing a back and forth exchange, as we added new ideas and developed
                    each other’s further; by the end, we had a truly collaboratively-written talk.
                    Then, given that this was a performative celebration of Byron’s drama and, given
                    the fact that we were scheduled to speak late in the day, we decided we should
                    do something a little performative ourselves, dividing up the paper into what
                    seemed to us logical sections or finding what seemed to be good points for there
                    to be a change in voice; we also decided to read the quotations being cited
                    during each other’s passages. What we present here is a transcript of what we
                    delivered, with a few corrections made and references added in; we appear as the
                    characters JC and MG. In the spirit of our own arguments, we hope some consumer
                    of this piece will be able to develop further than we could the idea of
                    melodramatic consumption. </p>

                    <p><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> We take our epigraph from Michael’s recent talk at the 2017 MLA in
                    Philadelphia:
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Consumption, in fact, might also be the best way to understand the hybridity
                        both of melodrama and of <title level="m">Manfred</title>.</note>
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Elsewhere I have argued that melodrama is a machine built for speed (Cox
                    <title level="m">Romanticism</title> 51). I now want to follow Michael and argue it is a machine built
                    for speedy consumption—that is, it is designed to absorb and to digest
                    whatever is put in its way. And in this way, melodrama became arguably the key
                    dramatic form of the period, absorbing not just other theatrical modes, but
                    topical events, fads, ideas, and ideologies. To give just one example: Thomas
                    Holcroft's <title level="m">Tale of Mystery</title>, performed at Covent Garden
                    in 1802, was the first melodrama in English to be identified by that generic
                    marker. The play is a translation/adaptation of a French play, René-Charles
                    Guilbert de Pixérécourt’s <title level="m">Coelina</title>, which itself was an
                    adaptation of a novel for the stage. Just as Holcroft imported a hot theatrical
                    commodity from Paris, so had Pixérécourt sampled a wide range of cultural goods,
                    as James L. Smith reminds us: 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Almost everything in <title level="m"
                            >Coelina</title> was borrowed, and not only from the romance of that
                        title by Ducray-Duminil which provided Pixérécourt with his first two acts.
                        The rugged mountain scenery of Act Three . . . was first built for [a
                        production of] Schiller. Boulevard pantomime provides the action-packed but
                        almost wordless finale. The singing miller and clodhopping peasantry appear
                        by courtesy of Sedaine's music-drama. But the greatest debt is to the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fr">drame</foreign>, that genre of serious prose
                        tragicomedy which derives its sentimentality from Cumberland and its
                        bourgeois didacticism from the horrible homilies of George Lillo. (Smith
                        3)</note> 
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Pixérécourt, in many ways the father of classic melodrama,
                    did not so much create a form full-grown from his brow as cobble together a
                    hybrid, an assemblage of all the bits and pieces to hand.</p>
                <p>Consuming everything in its path, the melodrama was also itself a major object of
                    cultural consumption. Comprehending this requires that we recall the melodrama’s
                    dominance within the cultural industry that was the Romantic-era theater. In
                    France, there were over 30,000 performances of Pixérécourt’s plays alone between
                    1797 and 1834. His counterpart, Auguste von Kotzebue, dominated the German
                    stage, so much so that even Goethe at his theater in Weimar offered some 87
                    stagings of Kotzebue’s plays compared to 19 of his own and 18 of Schiller’s.
                    Kotzebue also, in the years leading up to the premiere of <title level="m">A
                        Tale of Mystery,</title> ruled over the London stage, accounting for nearly
                    a quarter of all performances at Drury Lane and Covent Garden between 1798 and
                    1800. It is for this reason that ten of the nineteen plays in Benjamin
                    Thompson’s <title level="m">German Theatre</title> of 1800 are by Kotzebue;
                    Goethe has but one play. Melodrama in both its parts and wholes circulated
                    throughout Europe and beyond, so that we have Holcroft adapting Pixérécourt,
                    Pixérécourt drawing on Kotzebue, and Kotzebue, as least according to Coleridge,
                    stealing from earlier English writers.<note place="foot" resp="author">See

                    <p><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Again, we need to stress the ability of the melodrama to absorb materials from
                    just about anywhere. The plot of a melodrama might be derived from myth or
                    history, the Bible, or the news. A play might be set in medieval Europe or
                    roughly contemporary America or some imagined South Seas locale—Pixérécourt's
                    plays alone range from Robinson Crusoe’s island to the mines of Poland. While
                    perhaps not going as far as the pantomime in its engagement with contemporary
                    fashion—harlequinades, after all, were at the cutting edge of product
                    placement, with, for example, a card manufacturer paying for a scene in Charles
                    Farley’s <title level="m">Harlequin and Fortune</title> (Covent Garden, 1815) to
                    advertise his newly redesigned deck—melodramas were seen as tackling the
                    issues of the day, from absentee landlordism in Pocock’s <title level="m">The Miller
                        and his Men</title> (Covent Garden, 1813) to slavery in Fawcett’s <title
                        level="m">Obi; or Three Finger’d Jack</title> (Haymarket, 1800); they were
                    read as taking up “fashionable,” if questionable, moral theories, as Coleridge
                    makes clear in his attack upon Maturin and Kotzebue in the <title level="m"
                        >Biographia Literaria</title>; and they were experienced as representing the
                    rhythms of contemporary life. While we think of the melodrama as engaging in
                    reductive exaggeration and faked emotion, the <title level="m">Times</title>
                    (November 15, 1802) reviewer of Holcroft’s <title level="m">Tale of
                        Mystery</title> emphasized its ability to capture “real life,” arguing the
                    play is 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> natural and characteristic . . . There is no extravagance of
                        idea—no elaborate research after simile and metaphor . . . the thought
                        seems to arise from the moment, the words appear to be suggested by the
                        circumstances which pass under the eyes of the spectator. (2)</note> 
                        <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Much like the 1970s “Made for TV Movies” that were “ripped from the headlines,”
                    the melodrama convinced its audiences that it was mirroring their lives even if
                    it was through a glass not so much darkly as immediately sensational.</p>
                <p>As a machine built for consumption, melodrama needs to be placed within the rise
                    of the consumer society that has been described by Neil McKendrick, John Brewer,
                    and J. H. Plumb, that has been theorized by Colin Campbell in relation to a
                    “romantic ethic,” and that has been seen by, for example, Tim Morton as a key to
                    Romantic poetics, what Morton identifies as a poetics of spice. Campbell follows
                    the historians in seeing the rise of a bourgeois consumer culture that is marked
                    by the rise of the novel, a cult of romantic love, and the creation of the
                    modern fashion industry. He identifies a distinctly modern hedonism grounded in
                    dreams of desire, with individuals 
                    <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> not so much seek[ing]
                        satisfaction from products, as pleasure from the self-illusory experiences
                        which they construct from their associated meanings. The essential activity
                        of consumption is thus not the actual selection, purchase, or even use of
                        products, but the imaginative pleasure-seeking to which the product image
                        lends itself, "real" consumption being largely a resultant of this
                        "mentalistic" hedonism. (89) </note> 
                    <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Having constructed this
                    imaginative hedonism, Campbell then finds Romanticism, with its exaltation of
                    the imagination, as providing an ethos to support this spirit of modern
                    consumerism, as it locates in the imaginative creation of pleasure a
                    counter-argument against attacks on emotionalism and sentimentality.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> The Gothic novel appears in Campbell’s account as a particularly egregious
                    example of how literature can be put in the service of a consumerism that
                    traffics in the promulgation of day dreams and longings for the exotic, of
                    desires that stand against the routines of everyday life. But as anyone who has
                    pondered the <emph>Fate of Frankenstein</emph> (<title level="m">Presumption;
                        Or, The Fate of Frankenstein;</title> English Opera House, 1823) knows, the
                    Gothic novel was consumed, at least in part, by the Gothic play. Horace
                    Walpole's <title level="m">Castle of Otranto</title> had been out of print for
                    fourteen years when Robert Jephson first adapted it for the stage as the <title
                        level="m">Count of Narbonne</title> for Covent Garden in 1781—and since
                    then, Walpole's novel has never been out of print. The suggestion here is one
                    less of adaptation—novel to drama—than symbiosis. Walpole's gothic novel may
                    have given rise to Jephson's gothic play, but the adaptation in turn renewed its
                    original.</p>
                <p>Or, moving forward a decade or two, we might remember that Matthew Lewis wrote
                    only one <title level="m">Monk</title> (1796), but that there existed no fewer
                    than four adaptations of it by the turn of the nineteenth century. Two were for
                    the stage: Charles Farley's grand ballet of action, <title level="m">Raymond and
                        Agnes</title> (Covent Garden, 1797), and James Boaden's <title level="m"
                        >Aurelio and Miranda</title> (Drury Lane, 1798). These in turn inspired a
                    chapbook version in 1798 and a ballad retelling in <title level="m">Tales of
                        Terror</title> in 1801. And, if we're to believe Lewis's bibliographers, the
                    success of these productions in turn inspired Lewis—who, like Walpole and
                    Maturin, was both a novelist and a dramatist—to adapt from himself, producing
                    a chap-book version of the Raymond and Agnes story and then, later, a melodrama,
                        <title level="m">Raymond and Agnes: or, The Travellers Benighted</title>. As
                    you probably already suspect, Lewis's melodramatic act of self-consumption was,
                    of course, consumed in turn—in this case, by H. W. Grosette, who produced what
                    became the standard dramatic version of Lewis's novel, <title level="m">Raymond
                        and Agnes, or the Bleeding Nun of Lindenberg, an interesting
                        melodrama</title> (Norwich, 1811; Haymarket, 1811).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> What we haven't yet mentioned, however, is that most foundational aesthetic
                    form that melodrama consumed—music—especially music expressive of the action
                    at hand. Looking again to the <title level="m">Times</title> review of <title
                        level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, we find in it a fairly startling
                    pronouncement: 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> The hurry and the perturbation of the scene were
                        forcibly depicted by the agitated notes of the orchestra, and this new
                        adjunct to the interest of the drama was immediately felt by the whole
                        audience. (2)</note> 
                        <hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Part of what made melodrama feel not just new but
                    also more realistic for audiences was its successful borrowing of incidental
                    music from ballet and pantomime and applying it to dramas of suspense. One might
                    say that melodrama's composers discovered in such music an uncomic potential,
                    not just in expressing physical action but also underlying mental anguish, as
                    when, in <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title>, to disquieting music,
                        "<emph>Bonamo reads the Letter to himself with great agitation</emph>"
                    (Busby 23), or "<emph>Enter Fiametta, Alarmed</emph>" (Busby 9). Such scenes
                    feel incredibly old-fashioned to us, smacking as they do of silent film; but to
                    audiences at the turn of the nineteenth century, they constituted a revolution
                    in naturalism similar to that heralded by David Garrick half a century
                    earlier.</p>
                <p> As we've noted, earlier studies of Romanticism and consumer culture have
                    unearthed an overarching interplay between a consuming society and a Romantic
                    ethos (Campbell), and a tendency to treat commodities simultaneously as material
                    objects to be consumed and as vehicles for creating a poetics of transumption
                    (Morton). With melodramatic music, we aren't far from both. The scores of
                    melodramas were hot properties; composers quickly converted them to sheet music
                    for single instruments, usually piano forte, and sold them at a premium to
                    musical and theatrical amateurs keen for the newest sounds—who then would
                    transform these materials back into private performances, both musical and
                    theatrical. For <title level="m">The Castle Spectre</title>, for example, the
                    British Library holds no fewer than five separate musical publications, most in
                    multiple copies—of the overture, of individual popular songs, and of the
                    celebrated ghost scene, itself so popular that London publishers printed both it
                    and its source music, a chaconne of Jomelli, at great profit. With <title
                        level="m">A Tale of Mystery,</title> we see something even more innovative—not
                    merely selections, as was traditional, but the entire score, including
                    overture, songs, book, and the incidental music.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> In our search for an exemplum of Romantic consumption, then, we wish to
                    suggest that the melodrama provides a better example than Campbell’s deluding
                    novel or Morton’s spicy poetry. Melodrama attends to both strands of Romantic
                    consumption. At once fed by and feeding the Gothic in all its forms, it provided
                    a site for fashion and for idealized love. Yet it also—at least in the hands
                    of its greatest practitioners—provided a critique of consumption similar to
                    those Morton locates in Romantic poetry. And so, in this twin spirit, let’s turn
                    to one final site of melodramatic consumption—a most gothic instance, the
                    library—that place where Colin Jager, following Deidre Lynch, finds writers
                    tapping the 
                        <note type="gloss" place="inline"><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> twin impulses, commercial and historical, of modernity . . .
                        [where] acts of canon creation are poised between the desire for the dead to
                        be safely dead so that they can be smoothly incorporated into a national
                        heritage, and the need to reanimate the dead, bring them back to life, so
                        that the living will be haunted by the power of the dead writers in whose
                        tradition they stand (pp. 145, 144).</note> 
                        <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> Certainly at this point we
                    are not far from <title level="m">Manfred</title>, nor should we be surprised to
                    find various melodramas, most conspicuously Grosette's <title level="m">Raymond
                        and Agnes</title>, opening in "A Gothic Library" in the Castle of Don Felix,
                    where a bookish Raymond is about to leave off book learning for the more
                    dangerous realism of a very Gothic world.</p>
                <p>And if we move beyond literal libraries to other Gothic sites where books and
                    texts are encountered—through ubiquitous Gothic halls and Gothic laboratories
                    to the Faustian Gothic gallery of <title level="m">Manfred</title>—we can see
                    into the ways that melodrama—especially the early Gothic and Ghost melodrama
                    of Byron's time—thinks about its consumption of the past, its need both to
                    destroy and to purchase the cultural capital that underwrites it. And that may
                    be in part because early melodrama so frequently yokes the evocation of an
                    imagined Gothic past to the simulacra of the now offered by the melodrama.</p>
                <p>Like the Gothic novels that Lynch and Jager discuss, <title level="m"
                        >Manfred</title> is obsessed with its literary precursors—Shakespeare,
                    Marlowe, Goethe, Lewis, Wordsworth, and on and on. It is significant that in the
                    first scene in the Gothic gallery, when Manfred goes beyond Faust to summon up
                    not a single <foreign xml:lang="de">Erdgeist</foreign> but a series of spirits,
                    he does so on the basis of a “written charm / Which gives me power upon you”
                    (I.i.35-6). Given <title level="m">Manfred</title>'s status as a closet drama,
                    so far so good, and we half-expect Manfred to produce a volume and read from it.
                    But this is not the way the scene goes. His first command not heeded, Manfred
                    moves beyond texts to "sign[s]" (I.i.38) and again bids the spirits appear—but
                    in vain. Finally, he must abandon text and even written signs for spoken
                    incantation, calling on: 
                    <note type="gloss" place="inline"><quote><lg type="stanza">

                    <hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> And only then do the spirits come. They do so, moreover, in a scene
                    as filled with gothic markers of theatrical conspicuous consumption as Manfred's
                    invocation is of gothic imagery. For Manfred's "gothic gallery" recalls that
                    most expensive of mechanized theatrical sets, the famous "blue chamber" of
                    George Colman the Younger's <title level="m">Blue-beard</title> (Drury Lane,
                    1798). And the seven spirits Manfred summons harken back to the mixed dramas of
                    the 1790s and 1800s, and to the supernaturally crammed stages of John Philip
                    Kemble's revivals of <title level="m">Macbeth</title> and <title level="m"
                        >Richard III</title>.</p>
                <p>Still more remarkable is the spirits' collective response, which is preceded by
                    the following stage direction: "<emph>A star is seen at the darker end of the
                        gallery: it is stationary; and a voice is heard singing</emph>"
                    (I.i.49).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">MG:</hi> Last night we were treated to <title level="m">Manfred</title> performed; in
                    the days leading up to that performance, both Jeff and I sought to imagine what
                    this first scene would be like, particularly this question of singing. Would
                    there be music? Should there be? If Byron's play had premiered at Drury Lane
                    during the 1815-16 season, how sumptuously would it have been staged, and with
                    what kind of incidental music? If we wish to follow melodrama's consuming
                    practices to that imagined premiere, we think that melodrama would have found
                    its match in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, whose opening scene declares its
                    readiness to harness melodramatic spectacle and tactics to turn them back into—nay,
                    to revive—tragedy, even though its structure is not the traditionally
                    legitimate five acts, but melodrama's truncated three. Given the success of
                    Coleridge's <title level="m">Remorse</title> three years earlier, we believe
                    that Byron's play would have been the hit tragedy he was looking for the year he
                    sat on Drury Lane's governing board—the year he ransacked yet another library,
                    Drury's manuscript collection of fallow plays, looking for a tragedy that could
                    hold the stage. Imagine this first scene of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                    melodramatically, with the spirits’ incantation (I.i.193-262) chanted or sung as
                    Manfred is overcome by his own grief. Add music expressive of both the words and
                    of Manfred's emotional turmoil. Finally, place it all in a cavernous gothic
                    library—and it's hard not to expect the melodrama to continue. All this in the
                    opening scene of a play that supposedly eschews theatricality generally and
                    melodrama particularly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">JC:</hi> If we had world enough and time we could go on to talk about other ways in
                    which <title level="m">Manfred</title> offers a kind of transumption of
                    melodramatic consumption. If the melodrama absorbs the theatrical tactics of a
                    myriad of forms from tragedy to pantomime, Byron’s play takes on the music,
                    spectacular sets, and supernatural machinery of the melodrama to use it in the
                    service of a new kind of tragedy. If the melodrama often explores a family
                    mystery that, once solved, allows a return to a conventional domestic order,
                    Byron regrounds family relations in the tragic sphere of incest. If the lead
                    characters of the melodrama, in the words of Hegel, pursue “spiritual conversion
                    and surrender of self" in order to reassert “ordinary morality” (92), Manfred
                    repeatedly refuses to give up the complexity of a selfhood he sees as standing
                    beyond any morality, ordinary or not. Byron consumes—completes and destroys—the
                    melodrama in the name of Romantic tragic drama.</p>
                <p>But there is a final twist to this story of eating and being eaten: when Alfred
                    Bunn staged <title level="m">Manfred</title> in 1834, he returned it to its
                    melodramatic roots. The title page of the printed text highlights the

                    out from Manfred’s gothic hall to the Alps, where not one but three Chamois
                    Hunters appear to sing a glee, as this musical drama—his
                    <emph>Melo-</emph>drama—removes any vestige of tragedy, any hint of the
                    radical potential of Byron’s play. A machine built for consumption, the
                    melodrama can in the theater consume even its strongest competitors.</p>
