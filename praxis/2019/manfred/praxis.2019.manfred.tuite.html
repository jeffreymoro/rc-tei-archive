            <p class="noCount">This essay considers <em>Manfred, A Dramatic Poem</em> (1817) as a form of revenge tragedy. It takes its cues from the text’s <em>Hamlet</em> epigraph, and from that primal text of Byronic hero-formation, Edward Young’s <em>The Revenge</em> (1721), whose avenger, Zanga, Byron performed at Harrow. In the wake of the separation
               of April 1816, and inspired by the recent memory of the 1815 London theatre season
               in which Edmund Kean and John Philip Kemble played Zanga, Byron returned to this ur-text
               of revenge, I argue, as he started work on <em>Manfred</em> in September 1816. Through the figure of Manfred the magician, the drama allegorizes
               Byron’s authorial agency as that fraught and intriguing form of social magic, power
               and intimate publicity: celebrity. In its mediation of the separation between Lord
               and Lady Byron of April 1816—as public scandal and private event—<em>Manfred</em> functions as a kind of celebrity revenge tragedy that attempts to move through revenge
               (if not past it) toward more mixed forms of intimate commemoration, thereby re-setting
               the “springs of wonder” that connect Byron’s authorial practice to his audience and
               “the wisdom of the world” (<em>Hamlet</em>).</p>

               <p>Signing off on one of several letters to John Murray between January and April that
                  accompanies the manuscript of <em>Manfred, A Dramatic Poem</em> (1817)—sent from Venice “at different times,” “piecemeal, by the post” (<em>BLJ</em> V:209, 188)—Byron delivers the poem’s epigraph: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">And this is your Motto</p> 
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">“There are more things in heaven &amp; earth, Horatio,</div>
                     <div class="l">Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”—</div>

               </blockquote>
               <p> The “Motto”—this ostentatiously laconic epigraph from <em>Hamlet</em>—sets a certain tone: (1) for framing the arrival of the Magician, within the play
                  and as a MS to Murray (about which Byron was anxious, having written the week before,
                  “Write to say whether or no my Magician has arrived with all his scenes spells &amp;c,”
                  [<em>BLJ</em> V:204]); (2) for reading the play in all its intense self-reflexivity; and (3) for
                  how Byron deals with literary predecessors, especially Shakespeare, quoted here with
                  a customary kind of droll offhandedness.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Shakespeare’s play famously starts <span class="foreign">in medias res</span> after the death of Hamlet’s father; so too does Byron’s epigraphed quotation come
                     in the middle of the dialogue between Hamlet and Horatio about the ghost of Hamlet’s
                     father, omitting Horatio’s response to the news that Hamlet has spoken to his father’s
                     ghost, who has revealed his uncle’s dire machinations: “O day and night, but this
                     is wondrous strange” (Shakespeare I.v.891). In Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet responds
                     to Horatio’s marking of the “wondrous strange” with “give it welcome” (I.v.893). Hamlet’s
                     comment, “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio / Than are dreamt of
                     in your philosophy,” announces a kind of enlightened disillusionment, as though Horatio
                     is a mere philosopher, without any access to the mysteries of heaven and earth, while
                     Hamlet has access to it all—all the darkness—and is no longer surprised by any of
                     it (I.v. 894-5).

                     </div> This invocation of Hamlet echoes Byron’s enlightened disillusionment at the revelation
                     that Lady Byron, Annabella Milbanke, has been through his letters: “I am past indignation,”
                     he wrote to Augusta Leigh, as he toured the Alps that were to feature as the setting
                     of <em>Manfred</em> (Sep. 14, 1816, <em>BLJ</em> V:93) and in the <em>Alpine Journal</em> that Byron wrote for Augusta.

                              at least since the first officially collected edition of Byron’s works, of 1832-3,
                              when highlights of the Journal accompanied the text, and when Byron’s correspondence
                              with Murray about the poem was presented as an aid to interpretation by being placed
                              for readers before the text of the poem (see Works, XI, 3-4).</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>The motto’s laconic disillusionment cues the hinterland of “bitterness” that informed
                  Byron’s life and writing after April 1816, when everything became mediated by the
                  memory of “the Separation;” this was particularly pronounced when Byron was writing
                  the first two acts of <em>Manfred</em> in Switzerland in September-October 1816 (<em>BLJ</em> V:104). As he writes to Augusta from the Diodati on September 8, 1816: “As for me
                  I am in good health—&amp; fair—though very unequal—spirits—but for all that—she—or rather—the
                  Separation—has broken my heart—I feel as if an Elephant had trodden on it—I am convinced
                  I shall never get over it—but I try . . . I breathe lead” (<em>BLJ</em> V:91). Writing “she—or rather—the Separation,” as though the thought of Lady Byron
                  might be easier to bear by turning the person (“she”) into the event of the separation,
                  Byron both separates and conflates the two.</p>
               <p>The <em>Hamlet</em> epigraph cues philosophy as the domain of the play’s protagonist, the magician Manfred,
                  who in the opening monologue invokes the epigraph’s recessed figure of wonder: </p>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> As Manfred laconically recites this list of things that do not avail themselves of
                  his power to subject them—“Philosophy and science,” “the springs of wonder,” and “the
                  wisdom of the world”—the poem thereby also ironically undercuts that very power, gaining
                  its own power through the force of this critique of Manfred, and, through it, Byron’s
                  public self-critique. For, as Jerome McGann has noted, “That Manfred is Byron’s surrogate
                  has never been in doubt” (192). Such gaining through the undercutting of power is
                  also suggested by Byron’s final salutation to Murray, when, having earlier requested
                  that Murray submit the play to William Gifford for his reactions, Byron sends his
                  love and thanks to Gifford (Murray’s chief literary adviser and Byron’s editor), for
                  having judged and found wanting the play’s original third act (which Byron agreed
                  was “d—d bad” [<em>BLJ</em> V:211]). Also registered in Manfred’s opening monologue as “the wisdom of the world”
                  is that strange, capricious prerogative by which audiences are both subject to the
                  celebrity-author’s powers but also free <em>not</em> to be subject to them. In this way, <em>Manfred</em> stages the rituals of celebrity culture and audience reception as objects of exploration.</p>
               <p>To link one paratextual space of <em>Manfred</em> (the drama’s epigraph) to another (the letter that sends it), the “Motto” makes a
                  direct address from Byron to Murray, enacting a pre-existing relationship between
                  Byron as Hamlet and Murray as Horatio that Murray initiated in 1814 when he signed
                  off on a letter in which he requested a portrait of Byron—“the Original to whose continued
                  friendship I owe so much”—with the salutation “I am my Lord ‘your poor servant ever’”
                  (Murray 99). As such, the epigraph (“your Motto”) can be read as an indirect reprimand
                  to Murray for having failed to properly appreciate the play, and for being backward
                  in coming forward to “give it welcome” with either praise or constructive critique;
                  Gifford, on the other hand, is conspicuously thanked for doing precisely that. To
                  Murray, his avowedly “poor servant ever,” Byron signs “Yours ever,” while to Gifford
                  he sends his “love and thanks.” This history of Shakespearean role-playing applies
                  a further paratextual twist to Byron’s reference to “your philosophy”: questioning
                  Murray’s self-identification as “your poor servant” and subtly impugning Murray’s
                  loyalty. After <em>Manfred</em>’s publication, Murray’s failure to report on the poem’s public reception became a
                  theme of Byron’s testy correspondence, intensely interested as Byron was in the public’s
                  reaction to a work that so clearly revisited the scandalous events that spurred his
                  departure from England in April 1816.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Vengeance is still alive</span></h2>
               <p>The <em>Hamlet</em> epigraph is also significant in cueing the genre of the Elizabethan revenge tragedy;
                  it is the conventions of the revenge genre, I argue, that Byron’s dramatic poem engages
                  with its own “springs of wonder.” The word “springs” works here in what we might call
                  an Alpine sense—meaning the places from which water and inspiration flow—but also
                  in the sense of tricks, surprises, contraptions, a form of machine, like Hamlet’s
                  play within a play: the mouse trap. (And Manfred is not a mouse, of course, but a
                  worm—“Thou worm!” [I.i.125],—though his maker <em>had</em> had his heart trodden on by an Elephant.) Where Hamlet traps the conscience of the
                  king, <em>Manfred</em> sets out to catch the conscience of its author. In his discussion of Byron’s revision
                  of the third act in the <em>Life</em>, Thomas Moore deploys “spring” with a similar ambiguity, as he marvels over “the
                  complete success with which, when his mind <em>did</em> make the spring, he at once cleared the whole space by which he before fell short
                  of perfection,” using the figure of <em>making the spring</em> to suggest Byron both making the mental leap and crafting the machine or device (<em>Life</em> IV:15).</p>
               <p>Engaging the play’s makings and re-makings of revenge’s “springs of wonder,” my essay
                  considers <em>Manfred</em> as a form of revenge tragedy—the vital if broken heart of a sustained post-separation
                  revenge fantasy that encompasses Byron’s letters and the <em>Alpine Journal</em>. It examines how <em>Manfred</em> allegorizes Byron’s authorial agency as that fraught and intriguing form of social
                  magic, power, and intimate publicity: celebrity. I argue that in its mediation of
                  the marital separation—as public scandal and in the forms of private commemoration—<em>Manfred</em> functions as a kind of celebrity revenge tragedy that seeks to re-set the “springs
                  of wonder” that connect Byron’s authorial practice to his audience and “the wisdom
                  of the world.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As the Elephant and the breathing of lead (which lined coffins) remind us, Byron had
                     a generous capacity to be refreshed by self-parody, which often took the turn of Gothic
                     pantomime and melodrama. For the Gothic mode cues pantomime, as Byron did explicitly
                     in the April 9 letter to Murray: “As for ‘Manfred’ . . . You must call it ‘a poem,’
                     for it is <em>no drama</em> (&amp; I do not choose it to be called by so Sothebyish a name)—a ‘poem in dialogue’ or—pantomime
                     if you will” (<em>BLJ</em> V:209). There is melodrama, too, which points the play’s intense self-reflexivity
                     in the direction of emotion. <em>Manfred</em>’s profuse Gothic intertexts are so many “membra” (<em>BLJ</em> V:208)—limbs, arms and legs, quoted, discarded, remade and recycled: Walpole’s <em>Otranto</em>, originator of the genre, and his melodrama <em>The Mysterious Mother</em>; <em>The Monk</em> (by “wonder-working Lewis,” as Byron put it in <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em>, l. 265); Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, that Lewis “translated . . . to me by word of mouth,” when he visited the Diodati
                     in mid-August (<em>BLJ</em> V:206), and from which, as Goethe himself put it, Byron’s play drew the “strangest
                     nourishment” (qtd. in Butler 33).

                     </div> A less remarked but no less vital, and specifically theatrical, generic intertext
                     for <em>Manfred</em> is the Elizabethan revenge tragedy. Mediating between eighteenth-century Gothic and
                     Elizabethan revenge tragedy is Marlowe’s <em>Tragical History of Dr Faustus</em> (1604) about a necromancer who sells his soul to the Devil—which Byron denied having
                     read or seen performed (<em>BLJ</em> V:268, 270). As a generic intertext, Elizabethan revenge tragedy literalizes <em>Manfred</em>’s play with dead bodies and threats of scattered limbs: “Crush the worm! / Tear him
                     in pieces!” (II.iv.49); “what ye take / Shall be ta’en limb from limb” (III.iv.104);
                     “I sent him all three acts piecemeal, by the post” (<em>BLJ</em> V:188). Thomas Kyd’s <em>Spanish Tragedy</em> (1592); Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> (1601, itself a revision of a lost play by Kyd); <em>Othello</em> (1602-4); and the anonymous <em>The Revenger’s Tragedy</em> (1607, attributed to Tourneur and Middleton), all bristle in the intertextual background,
                     as does the genre of Restoration tragedy cued by Byron’s comparison of <em>Manfred</em> with “Nat. Lee’s Bedlam tragedy” (<em>BLJ</em> V:179).</p>
               </div>
               <p>An even more vital intertext for <em>Manfred</em> is <em>The Revenge</em> (1721), by the graveyard poet Edward Young. To some extent a reworking of Shakespeare’s
                  <em>Othello</em>, Young’s <em>Revenge</em> was a primal text for Byron, who performed its central character, the avenging Moor,
                  Zanga, at Harrow Speech Day in 1805. As Paul Elledge memorably notes, “Zanga is a
                  patently juicy role, offering numerous openings for stagy exhibitionism, overstated
                  deviltry, especially to a boy prone to and notorious for mischief-making himself”
                  (129). Not only to a boy, but to that fully-fledged icon of serially elaborated notoriety
                  that Byron would become after the separation and his move into exile: “Consistently
                  [Byron] forced his readers to like and admire against their wills, to like and desire
                  the forbidden, to applaud the transgressive actions he lavished upon them. Zanga fostered
                  that impulse” (Elledge 129). Zanga is an early experiment in the Byronic Satanic hero,
                  the thrillingly ambivalent tragic hero who teeters on the brink of villainy. Thus
                  Byron reworks from Young’s reworking of Shakespeare’s <em>Othello</em> one of the key discoveries of the Elizabethan revenge play: that the revenger is
                  not a villain but a tragic protagonist. Within such a transformed conception of heroism,
                  the figure of Zanga had an enduring significance for Byron; as late as 1821 Zanga
                  crowns a canon of Satanic-tragic heroes, as Byron asks rhetorically: “Who is the hero
                  of ‘Paradise lost’? Why Satan,—and <em>Macbeth</em>, and <em>Richard</em>, &amp; <em>Othello</em> and <em>Pierre</em>, and <em>Lothario</em>, &amp; Zanga?” (<em>BLJ</em> VIII:115).</p>

                     </div> An early fan of Kean (“a wonder”), Byron wrote in February 1814: “There is a new Actor
                     named Kean come out—he is a wonder—&amp; we are yet wise enough to admire him—he . . .
                     will run Kemble hard—his style is quite new—or rather <em>renewed</em>—being that of Nature” (<em>BLJ</em> IV:67). That style of “Nature” was an emotional style, and Kean was most famous for
                     his powerfully impassioned outsider roles such as Richard III and Shylock, and his
                     capacity for turning villains into compelling tragic heroes. Given that <em>The Revenge</em> was such a formative event for Byron, far more significant in the role of Zanga than
                     either Kean and Kemble was “Master” Betty, the sensational child actor, William Henry
                     West Betty, also known as “the Young Roscius,” who performed Zanga in the 1805-6 season.

                     Hamlet five times at Drury Lane during Byron’s 1805 March schooltime (Elledge 108),
                     Master Betty was the object of an “urgent rivalry” conceived by Byron, Elledge intriguingly
                     speculates (121).</p>

               <p>In Young’s <em>The Revenge</em>, the central character, Zanga, is a captive Moor, son of a king, Abdalla, who was
                  killed in battle by Alonzo, now Zanga’s master. Unbeknown to Alonzo, Zanga harbours
                  against him an all-consuming passion “To catch the man I hate, and then devour” (27).
                  Having “toil’d, and groan’d for an occasion / Of ample vengeance” (9), Zanga decides
                  upon jealousy as his motive—“Oh, jealousy . . . Thou king of torments” (27), that
                  “Hydra of calamities” (26), “the jealous are the damn’d” (26)—and crafts an appropriately
                  intricate scheme to make Alonzo jealous of his wife, Leonora. With all the rich dramatic
                  irony that attends the genre, Alonzo enlists Zanga in his own plot of revenge against
                  Leonora (“Thou, Zanga, . . . call vengeance, call the furies, call despair” [67]);
                  and, as instructed, Zanga kills Carlos, Leonora’s alleged lover (“Poor mangled shade!”).
                  But then Alonzo’s plan of vengeance goes astray. As Alonzo confides his scheme to
                  meet Leonora in a leafy bower so as to confront her with her crime and kill her, the
                  play delivers up the sweet spot of Zanga’s “maze / Of gloomy thought and intricate
                  design” (27), with a striking (and strikingly Byronic) fantasy of sadistic bisexual
                  perversity in glorious blank verse, when Zanga responds to Alonzo’s plan—sotto voce—with
                  a vengeful curse: </p>

                  gender-slithery/gender-neutral pronouning (of Zanga kissing “them”—Alonzo and Leonora),
                  the spicy climax of Zanga’s curse, “And mingle kisses—such as I should give them,”
                  brazenly suggests, of course, the erotic kiss, but also, more indirectly, the fatal
                  kiss of death—the kiss “such as I should [like to] give them,” but can’t, but which
                  serpents <em>can</em> deliver. The serpents are thus in this fantasy scenario the romantic stand-ins that
                  carry out Zanga’s plots of desire and revenge. As it transpires, Alonzo and Leonora
                  do not meet their ends by being fatally hissed and kissed. Instead, when Alonzo is
                  poised to kill her with a dagger, Leonora wakes up, and Alonzo flees. Zanga then tells
                  Leonora of her husband’s jealousy; Leonora and Alonzo meet to try and resolve matters,
                  but then quarrel, at which point Leonora stabs herself. In the final explosive scene,
                  Zanga exultingly discloses himself to Alonso, defiantly confessing: “I hated, I despis’d,
                  and I destroy!” (82), before he “tramples on the body of his prostrate victim” (Hazlitt
                  228). For William Hazlitt, Kean played this in “an attitude . . . that was not the
                  less dreadful from its being perfectly beautiful” [Hazlitt 228]). This is the scene

                     </div> Zanga is a composite of the vengeful Iago and Othello as Moor to Alonzo’s reworking
                     of Othello as jealous lover. But unlike Iago, Zanga has a conscience (“Oh, the medley
                     / Of right and wrong! The chaos of my brain!” [68-9]). And his revenge is not just
                     personal but cultural, political and religious, responding to centuries of oppression
                     of Muslims by Catholic Spain: “I tread on haughty Spain, and all her kings” (82);
                     “Be propitious, / Oh! Mahomet, on this important hour, / And give at length my famish’d
                     soul revenge” (10). Zanga’s revenge also has a (proleptically Byronic) geopolitical
                     edge: “If cold white mortals censure this great deed, / Warn them, they judge not
                     of superior beings, / Souls made of fire, and children of the sun, / With whom revenge
                     is virtue” (84). Such righteous opposition by “children of the sun” to the “cold white
                     mortals” of England becomes an abiding trope of Byron’s post-exilic world. These “children
                     of the sun” are summoned again in Byron’s “speech of Manfred to the Sun”—one of <em>Manfred</em>’s many echoes of <em>The Revenge</em> (<em>BLJ</em> V:211).</p>

               <p> Young’s <em>Revenge</em> closes with the immortal line: “And each man finds a Zanga in his heart” (87). Byron
                  finds his inner Zanga in the wake of the separation, imaginatively deploying against
                  Lady Byron and the Milbanke family a powerfully personified vengeance that also fuels
                  the early work on <em>Manfred</em>. From Ouchy, on September 17, 1816, Byron writes to Augusta about Lady Byron and
                  the springs of vengeance: <span class="quote">‘Whatever my faults might or may have been—<em>She</em>—was not the person marked out by providence to be their avenger. One day or another
                     her conduct will recoil on her own head; <em>not</em> through <em>me</em>, for my feelings toward her are not those of Vengeance, but—mark—if she does not
                     end miserably <span class="foreign">tot ou tard</span>. She may think—talk—or act as she will . . .—but woe unto her—the wretchedness she
                     has brought upon the man to whom she has been everything evil . . . will flow back
                     into its fountain. (<em>BLJ</em> V:95).’</span> Indeed, Lady Byron is imagined here <em>as</em> the springs of vengeance. Avowing that his feelings “are not those of Vengeance,”
                  Byron nevertheless produces a pantomimic revenge fantasy that figures Lady Byron as
                  a fountain of wretchedness—like a fast-motion cartoon of the reversal of fortune whereby
                  Lady Byron’s vengeance is made to “flow back into its fountain” (Lady Byron herself)
                  and “recoil on her own head.” Revenger and victim are inextricably linked; the blame
                  for invoking vengeance is shared. So enmeshed is Byron in this revenge fantasy that
                  he projects onto Lady Byron a desire to be <em>his</em> avenger, even as he repudiates her claim, casting her as his avenger in order precisely
                  to repudiate her: “<em>She</em>—was not the person marked out by providence to be their avenger.” Byron ritualistically
                  invokes an impersonal providence, rhetorically inflating the animus against Lady Byron
                  (who is “everything evil”) and the discord between them. As in any revenge tragedy,
                  “revenge reproduces the injustice it abhors”—enacting what Francis Bacon called revenge’s
                  “wild justice” (Mullaney 147; qtd. in Mullaney, 147).</p>
               <p>A couple of weeks later, in an entry in the <em>Alpine Journal</em>, Byron again tries to will himself out of the desire for vengeance: “I am past reproaches—and
                  there is a time for all things—I am past the wish of vengeance” (Sep. 29, 1816, <em>BLJ</em> V:105). But he is not past it. Far from it. The statement is deeply ambiguous: even
                  disclaiming his own wish for vengeance, Byron keeps open the possibility of an impersonal
                  providence whose wish it might be to carry out that wish for vengeance on Byron’s
                  behalf. Sure enough, as Byron writes to Augusta as late as June 3-4, 1817, a couple
                  of weeks before <em>Manfred</em>’s publication in Byron’s homeland while he is abroad in exile, “sooner or later time
                  &amp; Nemesis will give me the ascendant” (<em>BLJ</em> V:232). But far from denying, Byron’s writings are self-reflexively alive to these
                  contradictions.</p>

                  <p>Such avowals-disavowals stage a dress rehearsal for what John Wilson (“Christopher
                     North”) called in his <em>Blackwood’s</em> review of <em>Manfred</em> the “wild Personifications” of “this extraordinary drama”: Byron has “burst into the
                     world of spirits” and “endeavoured to embody and call up before him their ministering
                     agents, and to employ these wild Personifications, as he formerly employed the feelings
                     and passions of man” (Wilson 290).

                     </div> Another critic who liked Byron’s “wildness” was John Wilson Croker, who reviewed for
                     the <em>Quarterly</em>, and urged Murray to encourage Byron to continue with the “extravagance.” “Its wildness
                     or, if you will, its extravagance, is to me its first recommendation” (Murray 225),
                     Croker wrote, supporting his case by quoting Voltaire on <em>Hamlet</em>: “amongst the beauties that sparkle in the midst of these terrible extravagances
                     the ghost of Hamlet’s father is one of the most striking pieces of theatre” (May 12,
                     1817, qtd. in Murray 226). Murray showed Croker’s letter to Byron, which would have
                     confirmed for Byron the strength and fitness of his use of the ghost of Hamlet’s father’s
                     as a structuring absence in the poem.

               <p>In the weeks after <em>Manfred</em> was published on June 16, Byron’s inner Zanga is still playing out in Byron’s letters:
                  <span class="quote">‘[I]f I can but live to tear down . . . that . . . Philistine family—I shall not have
                     lived in vain—&amp; if Time &amp; Nemesis but do their usual part—&amp; reverse the present tide
                     of human fortunes—see whether I leave one stone of their hearths upon another—or a
                     fibre of their hearts unscorched by fire. (Jul. 3, 1817, <em>BLJ</em> V:246).’</span> Having found his inner Zanga, and fired by vengeance’s charms, Byron fashions Nemesis
                  as a pervasive figure in his letters, journals and poetry, from the time of the separation
                  and the composition and publication of <em>Manfred</em>, and for long after.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And what of the play itself? In <em>Manfred</em>, Nemesis arrives with appropriate fanfare and a sense of expectation—“Behold she
                     cometh,” notes the Third Destiny—but also with an edge of drollery. Harried and late
                     (“I was detained repairing shattered thrones”), she nevertheless obliges Manfred by
                     conjuring Astarte, and with a rousing flourish: “Redeem from the worm. Appear!—Appear!—Appear!”
                     (II.iv.95-6). This flourish hosts an intertextual exorcism, as “Appear!—Appear!—Appear!”
                     gothically inverts Hamlet’s words to his father’s ghost: “Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit”
                     (I.5.909). However, much like all the other assembled Spirits and Demons, Nemesis
                     turns out to be somewhat disappointing. Commanding the spirit of Astarte to “speak”—“By
                     the power which hath broken/ The grave which enthrall’d thee”—Astarte refuses and
                     Nemesis is “baffled” (II.iv.106-7, 117). Nemesis’s final words to Manfred are vaguely
                     withholding; when he asks her will he meet her again on the earth, she replies officiously,
                     “That will be seen hereafter” (II.iv.166). This scene with Nemesis and Astarte can
                     also be read as a reworking of Germaine de Staël’s attempt to broker a reconciliation
                     between Lord and Lady Byron, in the early stages of the separation.

                     </div> Indeed, herself a fellow celebrity exile, de Staël is a significant protagonist in
                     the biographical events reworked in <em>Manfred</em>, and in the play’s paratextual background and critical reception. Jerome McGann’s
                     marvelous reading of <em>Manfred</em>, which celebrates Byron’s “spoiler’s art” and illuminates how “Byron’s play can only
                     succeed by attacking itself, satirizing and exposing itself to itself,” takes its
                     cues from de Staël’s reading of the deliberate “bad taste” of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> (McGann 194-5). The legitimator of deliberate bad taste, of bad taste as a strategy,
                     de Staël is also significant as the mediator of Byron’s first encounter with Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> (before Lewis’s oral translation at the Diodati), through what Thomas Medwin referred
                     to as her “sorry French translation” of parts of Goethe’s play in <em>D’Allemagne</em> (1813)—another form of unsuccessful mediation (Medwin 141).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The failed intercession by “our Lady of Coppet” (<em>BLJ</em> V:207) to effect a reconciliation between Lord and Lady Byron occurred just before
                  Byron commenced work on <em>Manfred</em> in September 1816. On August 24, in one of two brief letters to de Staël (of August
                  24 and 25) in which the separation and Byron’s feelings for Lady Byron are basically
                  the exclusive subject, Byron writes: “The separation may have been <em>my fault</em>—but it was <em>her</em> choice.——I tried all means to prevent—and would do as much &amp; more to end it,—a word
                  would do so—but it does not rest with me to pronounce it.——You asked me if I thought
                  that Lady B[yron] was attached to me—to that I can only answer that I love her . .
                  . I cannot conclude without thanking you once more for your kind disposition towards
                  me on this” (<em>BLJ</em> V:88). Here, Byron articulates a wish to “end” the separation. A letter shortly after
                  that to Augusta, of September 8, suggests that de Staël was helping him to do precisely
                  that: “Me. de Stael has been particularly kind &amp; friendly towards me—&amp; (I hear) fought
                  battles without number in my very indifferent cause” (<em>BLJ</em> V:92). De Staël’s well-meaning failure to broker a reconciliation with Lady Byron
                  is reworked in <em>Manfred</em> through the figuration of de Staël and Annabella as Nemesis and Astarte, respectively.
                  Astarte is, of course, a composite figure who represents both Augusta and Annabella
                  throughout the play; and while she is usually taken to represent Augusta (contemporary
                  readers, such as Annabella’s confidante, Mrs. Villiers, wrote of the resemblance between
                  Astarte and Augusta that “It is too barefaced for her friends to try to deny the allusion”
                  [qtd. in Lovelace 69]), at this moment in the play in the Hall of Arimanes (Act 2,
                  scene 4) she figures Annabella in her capacity as the former lover who might yet be
                  reunited with Byron.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Just as Our Lady of Coppet’s intercession on behalf of Byron and his “indifferent
                     cause” is unsuccessful, so too in the play an explicit reconciliation with and forgiveness
                     from Astarte does not come. Crucially, however, this withholding (from the baffled
                     Nemesis and the silent Astarte) is productive; it is part of the play’s experiment
                     in re-setting the tone, an attempt to move past the wish of vengeance as anger and
                     retribution and toward more mixed forms of the revenge genre, such as revenge farce
                     or “revenge comedy”—apt for a “baffled” Nemesis—and other hybrid forms of intimate
                     commemoration.

               <p>As befits the play’s allegorization of Byron’s poetic practice as a form of “Mysterious
                  agency!,” Manfred is often linked with the magician figures of Faust, Prospero, or
                  the Elizabethan occult philosopher Dr. John Dee (I.i.28). Another vital form of communing
                  with the dead is antiquarianism; and another figure of the practitioner of magic is
                  the antiquarian, such as John Weever, an historian of funeral monuments and church
                  inscriptions who travelled throughout Britain and Europe, collecting and transcribing
                  inscriptions on medieval tombs that were housed in dissolved monasteries. These were
                  published in 1631 in the vast, unfinished survey <em>Antient funeral monuments</em>, republished in 1767 by the Romantic antiquarian, William Tooke.</p>

               <p>Weever’s prefatory “The author to the reader” articulates an urgent sense of antiquarianism
                  as a form of remembering and honoring the dead: <span class="quote">‘Having seen, judicious reader, how carefully, in other kingdoms, the monuments of
                     the dead are preserved, and their inscriptions or epitaphs registered in their church-books;
                     and . . . also knowing withal how barbarously within these his majesty’s dominions,
                     they are (to the shame of our time) broken down, and utterly almost all ruinated,
                     their brazen inscriptions erazed, torn away, and pilfered; by which inhuman, deformidable
                     act, the honourable memory of many virtuous and noble persons deceased, is extinguished,
                     and the true understanding of divers families in these realms (who have descended
                     of these worthy persons aforesaid) is so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance
                     is thereby partly interrupted: grieving at this insufferable injury, offered as well
                     to the living as the dead, out of the respect I bore to venerable antiquity, and the
                     due regard to continue the remembrance of the defunct to true posterity; I determined
                     with myself to collect such memorials of the deceased, as were remaining as yet undefaced;
                     as also to revive the memories of eminent worthy persons entombed or interred, either
                     in parish, or in abbey churches; howsoever some of their sepulchres are at this day
                     no where to be discerned; neither their bones and ashy remains in any place to be
                     gathered. (Weever)’</span> Here, practices of cultural memory are inextricably linked to burial practices; the
                  dearly departed “sepulchres” that Weever so keenly wishes to discern bear inscribed
                  “memorials” as well as “bones and ashy remains.” The monuments, inscriptions, and
                  epitaphs mark out the place where such remains are to be collected and preserved.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Weever’s account reminds us of the etymological link between epigraph and epitaph.
                     It was not until the eighteenth century that the practice of attaching epigraphs to
                     the head of a literary work became common. Samuel Johnson’s <em>Dictionary</em> (1755) defines “epigraphe” as “an inscription on a statue” such as a tombstone (Johnson
                     I:309). The forerunner of the modern epigraph was the authorial coat of arms (Genette
                     144). Hence Byron’s use of the conventional term “motto,” which traditionally referred
                     to the text of the coat of arms that accompanied its “device” or emblem, the visual
                     design.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Johnson defines “motto” as “a sentence or word added to a device, or prefixed to any
                              thing written” (II, 69).</span></div>
                     </div> The coat of arms was a central feature of the design of funeral monuments; and religious
                     monuments became, in turn, museums of armorial bearings—another form of memorial that
                     Weever laments with the destruction of religious monuments.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In an 1819 letter to Murray about “the beautiful Cimetery of Bologna” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:148), Byron imagines his own epitaph. Musing upon epitaphs he had seen at nearby
                  Ferrara, he is particularly struck by the words “Implora pace”: “Can anything be more
                  full of pathos? those few words say all that can be said or sought—the dead have had
                  enough of life—all they wanted was rest—and this they ‘<em>implore</em>’. . . . ‘<em>implora pace’</em>. I hope, whoever may survive me and shall see me put in the foreigners’ burying-Ground
                  at the Lido . . . will see those two words and no more put over me” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:149). With “those two words,” like the earth, “put over me,” Byron marks the epitaph’s
                  function as both symbolic and material. The sheltering words have as much materiality
                  and protective agency as the earth itself. And of course Byron’s peace will only be
                  found in foreign ground: “I am sure my Bones would not rest in an English grave .
                  . . I would not even feed your worms—if I could help it.——So—as Shakespeare says of
                  Mowbray . . . that he after fighting . . . retired himself / To Italy; and there at
                  <em>Venice</em>, gave / His body to that <em>pleasant</em> Country’s Earth” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:149). So Byron returns to Shakespeare, who he opens the letter with—transplanting
                  Shakespeare to Italian soil, as he had transplanted himself—explaining how at Bologna
                  he “found besides the Superb Burial Ground—an original of a Custode who reminded me
                  of the grave-digger in Hamlet” (<em>BLJ</em> VI: 148). As Byron affectionately details, this Shakespearean Custode “had the greatest
                  attachment to . . . his dead people” and a collection of skulls to help remember them
                  and the “joy” they dispensed (<em>BLJ</em> VI: 149, 148). The grave-digger, then, is another kind of custodian (“Custode”),
                  like the antiquarian, who communes with the dead.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Manfred asks Nemesis to “call up the dead,” and Nemesis replies, “Whom wouldst
                     thou / Uncharnel?” Byron uses a word that had particular significance at the time
                     of the Elizabethan revenge tragedies (I.iv.82). “Uncharnelling” referred to the digging
                     up and disinterring of the bones of the dead from the charnel house of St Paul’s in
                     1549, an act of desecration and memorial spoliation.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> “Uncharnel” has an ambiguous significance, then, meaning to raise from the dead, but
                     also to deprive of proper memory. Hence the revenge tragedy’s remit of calling in
                     honor’s debts in order to avenge such desecration, as Zanga, the righteous Moor, rhetorically
                     asks as he avenges the Christian desecration of his proud Moorish race and Muslim
                     culture: “What is revenge, but courage to call in / Our honour’s debts?” (Young 10).
                     Weever was moved by a similar spirit of avenging desecration, describing his work
                     as being to “preserve” “the monuments of the dead . . . knowing withal how barbarously
                     within these his majesty’s dominions [Charles I], they are (to the shame of our time)
                     broken down, and utterly almost all ruinated, their brazen inscriptions erased” (Weever).
                     The widespread iconoclasm that marked the time of Charles I involved the same impulse
                     that cleared the ossuary of St. Paul’s in 1549, both part of the ongoing cultural
                     trauma that marked the Protestant reformation.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Like Weever, Byron in <em>Manfred</em> conjures diverse forms of commemoration and “monuments of the dead.” In a letter to
                     Murray, topped and tailed with queries about the whereabouts of the MS of <em>Manfred</em>, Byron referred to his marriage as a funeral: “You talk of ‘marriage’—ever since
                     my own funeral, the word makes me giddy—&amp; throws me into a cold sweat—pray don’t repeat
                     it” (Apr. 2, 1817, <em>BLJ</em> V:204). Writing from Ravenna, on New Year’s Eve, 1819, he made the same association,
                     in a letter to Lady Byron herself: “This time five years [ago] . . . I was on my way
                     to our funeral marriage.—I hardly thought then that your bridegroom as an exile would
                     one day address you as a stranger, and that Lady and Lord Byron would become bye words
                     of division” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:260). In its working through and as a commemoration of the “funeral marriage” and
                     the separation, <em>Manfred</em> functions as a kind of funeral monument, as well as a form of revenge tragedy, a genre
                     that explores the process of accounting for the dead (even—especially—when those dead
                     to the heart are still alive). <em>Manfred</em> is a funeral monument, then, that commemorates the death of the marriage, the wreck
                     of the broken heart: it is the “casket”—fittingly, “a small wooden box for cremated
                     ashes”—that Byron fashions for this wreck of the broken heart (III.i.5).

                  <p>In commemorating the wreck of the broken heart, <em>Manfred</em> allegorizes how the private event of the author’s broken heart is relentlessly mediated
                     by and as a public celebrity scandal. The “clankless chain” of memory is bound tighter
                     by the echoing publicity of celebrity culture, so that Manfred-Byron is doomed not
                     only to confront these memories, but also to do so before the public eye, for better
                     and worse, for pain and pleasure—doomed but reveling drolly in bringing them into
                     the light (I.i.259). Simultaneously invited and spurned, a key adversary of Byron’s
                     play against which it prosecutes revenge is Byron’s public and the celebrity it bestows.
                     Manfred’s being condemned to eternal life dramatizes Byron’s scandalous celebrity,
                     and a sense of being inescapably before the public eye in a blaze of publicity—obsessively,
                     interminably: “thy spirit shall not sleep.” Hence the “vigil,” a ritualized occasion
                     of remaining awake, in prayer, reflection or keeping watch, of being accountable to
                     a public, during the time one usually spends in private: “There is a power upon me
                     which withholds / And makes it my fatality to live” (I.ii.23-4). A vigil of the heart, <em>Manfred</em> is also a drama of conscience, about coming to terms with the knowledge that knowledge
                     of one’s private acts cannot remain private but will circulate in the “public imagination”
                     (<em>BLJ</em> V:186), especially when these private acts are submitted to the public in the form
                     of a play at the height of Byron’s infamy. As Byron writes to Thomas Moore, “I suppose
                     now I shall never be able to shake off my sables in public imagination, more particularly
                     since my moral ** [Clytemnestra?] clove down my fame” (Mar. 10, 1817, <em>BLJ</em> V:186). Byron’s recently coined post-separation code-name for Lady Byron, Clytemnestra,
                     is the classical embodiment of revenge, driven by jealousy on account of her husband’s
                     infidelity and fury at the sacrifice of her daughter.

                              lord” (37). As McGann notes, this poem was written shortly after the collapse of de
                              Staël’s attempt to reconcile Lord and Lady Byron (CPW IV, 460).</span></div>

               <p>The social magic of authorial agency reaps ambivalent rewards and pleasures, in those
                  strange solicitations of intimate publicity that animate celebrity culture; celebrity
                  brings company (“My solitude is solitude no more”) and sympathy to “watch my watchings,”
                  but also the sting of a capricious public that does not always avail itself of the
                  choice to subject itself to the celebrity author’s powers, but sometimes chooses instead
                  to repudiate and spurn, conspiring in the cleaving down of fame (II.ii.129-30). Hence
                  the author’s impulse to avenge himself on his public. Revenge is one form of “calling
                  in honour’s debts” to the dead; another form of honoring the dead is posthumous fame,
                  immortal social life. Posthumous fame, that heroic form of fame Weever refers to as
                  “true posterity,” is a way of being “redeemed from the worm;” celebrity is a different
                  kind of fame: contemporary with life, it can disturb the chronological order of life
                  and death, for better and worse. Such temporal disturbance is engaged in Manfred’s
                  address to Astarte: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">

                     <div class="l">A future like the past. I cannot rest. (II.iv.128-31)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> This figure of shrinking from immortality dramatizes the uneasy temporal aspects
                  of celebrity as a form of contemporary fame that pre-empts posthumousness, a form
                  of premature—unnatural—immortality: a kind of posterity out of joint.</p>
               <p>But then again, the poem swerves to Manfred’s identification <em>with</em> the immortal, in his famous “mind which is immortal” speech: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> This is Manfred’s inner Zanga—or the backward anticipation of Zanga’s “Manfredian
                  defiance”—a reworking of Zanga’s shameless rebuke to Alonso preparing the rack for
                  him: “The fix’d and noble mind / Turns all occurrence to its own advantage; / And
                  I’ll make vengeance of calamity” (Elledge 131; Young 85). Both Manfred and Zanga also
                  channel the immortal lines of Milton’s Satan: “The mind is its own place, and in itself
                  / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven” (<em>Paradise Lost</em> I.254-55). This audacious claiming of “its own place and time” enunciates the revenger’s
                  desire to reintroduce a sense of spatio-temporal order. For Nemesis is about introducing
                  a sense of order, putting things in their proper resting place, ceasing the haunting.
                  Temporal disturbance, “time . . . out of joint,” is a key feature of revenge tragedy
                  (<em>Hamlet</em> I.v.915). Revenge and retribution are ways of turning back time. The revenger’s mission
                  is to restore proper order, but the requirement of the genre is that this mission
                  only succeeds with the death of the revenger himself.</p>
               <p>While (satanically) redeeming Milton’s lines, <em>Manfred</em> is not so much about redemption as about unfinished business: to redeem from the
                  worm means to attend to unfinished business. <em>Manfred</em> is about the unfinished emotional business that is the desire for revenge, but also
                  about the unfinished textual business of first drafts, recycled work, such as “the
                  Incantation,” written, according to Thomas Moore, “soon after the last fruitless attempt
                  at reconciliation,” and originally published in <em>The Prisoner of Chillon and Other Poems</em> (Dec. 1816) as “a Chorus in an unfinished Witch drama, which was begun some years
                  ago” (I.i.192-261; <em>Works</em> III:288; qtd. in <em>CPW</em> IV: 463). Byron, then—much like the antiquary—is finding a place, preserving “The
                  Incantation” by repurposing it as a strange, disembodied, multi-tasking curse upon
                  Lady Byron and Manfred-Byron (recoiling on his own head). Burying the precious text
                  under faint praise and disavowals of interest (“you may put it in the fire if you
                  like—&amp; Gifford <em>don’t</em> like”), Byron both preserves the precious inscription and gives it a kind of ambivalent
                  “uncharnelling,” digging it up, moving it from one poem to another, giving it a new
                  site, a new use, and adding new lines (<em>BLJ</em> V:193).</p>
               <p>The famous redrafting of Act III on Gifford’s advice is part of this process and an
                  ongoing saga of the correspondence with Murray. In a spectacular letter written en
                  route from Florence to Rome, Byron tells Murray he must “wait” for <em>Manfred</em> to be finished, and refers to the unfinished manuscript (and the revisions of the
                  third act yet to be completed) at the end of an inspired rant about unfinished funeral
                  monuments: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">I also went to the Medici Chapel—fine frippery in great slabs of various expensive
                     stones—to commemorate fifty rotten carcasses—it is unfinished &amp; will remain so. The
                     church of “Santa Croce” contains much illustrious nothing—the tombs of Machiavelli—Michael
                     Angelo—Galileo Galilei and Alfieri—make it the Westminster abbey of Italy.—I did not
                     admire <em>any</em> of these tombs—beyond their contents. That of Alfieri is heavy—and all of them seem
                     to me overloaded—what is necessary but a bust &amp; a name?—and perhaps a date?—the last

                     worse than the long wig of English numskulls upon Roman bodies in the statuary of

               </blockquote>
               <p> Here, as the particular figure of Charles returns us to Weever, the whole passage
                  suggests an unwitting iconoclastic parody of Weever’s moving tribute to lost funeral
                  monuments. In contrast to the absent monuments so lovingly elegized by Weever—“broken
                  down, utterly almost all ruinated,” “at this day nowhere to be discerned”—Byron exuberantly
                  details an infernal surfeit of “overloaded” monuments, of “fine frippery in great
                  slabs of various expensive stones—to commemorate fifty rotten carcasses.” This caustic
                  recital has a leveling effect, neutralizing sectarian religious sentiment by making
                  the “fine frippery” and “illustrious nothing” of Italian Catholicism as equally preposterous
                  as “the long wig of English numskulls upon Roman bodies in the statuary of the reigns
                  of Charles—William—and Anne”—grotesque English hybrids mimicked in turn by the grotesque
                  hybridity of Santa Croce as the “Westminster abbey of Italy.”</p>
               <p>Byron’s identification with “the unchronological” emphasizes the importance of chronology:
                  “the unchronological” are prone to forget dates, so they need to be reminded. Byron
                  explains: “The <em>context</em> will show you <em>the sense</em>” (<em>BLJ</em> V:218). The context for both topics (Florentine funeral monuments and <em>Manfred</em>) is provided by that historical drama of religious conflict and its legacies of cultural
                  trauma, brilliantly satirized—but commemorated too—in Byron’s rendition of these ecumenically
                  bizarre funeral monuments. This broader historical context connects to another, more
                  personal context—Byron’s desire for Nemesis to do its work. The context of revenge
                  as a form of commemoration informs “the unchronological” as an ominous figure of the
                  terrible power of memory, suggesting how memory can play havoc with a proper sense
                  of place and time. Byron as “the unchronological” emphasizes the need for a date,
                  intoning—like any committed revenge hero—that repeated formula of “Time &amp; Nemesis”
                  (<em>BLJ</em> V:246). The revenger <em>is</em> the unchronological, poised in that limbo of “sooner or later.”</p>
               <p>The texts, intertexts and paratexts of <em>Manfred</em> calibrate so much unfinished business. The revenger’s unfinished emotional business
                  links with the unfinished business of commemoration (“a bust &amp; a name?—and perhaps
                  a date?”) and the business of unfinished manuscripts; just as the play’s mechanisms
                  of self-reflexivity facilitate reflection on different forms of fame, so too, in the
                  letter to Murray that sends the epigraph for <em>Manfred</em>, does Byron engage these different forms of fame, joking about his own posthumousness:
                  <span class="quote">‘You tell me to “take care of myself—” faith and I will <a id="Hlk509508425"><!--anchor--></a>—I won't be posthumous yet if I can help it—notwithstanding—only think—what a “Life
                     &amp; adventures”—while I am in full scandal—would be worth—together with the “membra”
                     of my writing-desk—the <em>sixteen</em> beginnings of poems never to be finished—(Apr. 9, 1817, <em>BLJ</em> V:208)’</span> Not that anyone’s counting. But Byron assesses the current state of his celebrity
                  and its commercial value, in a canny evaluation of the relationship between posthumous
                  fame and celebrity. His swaggering suggestion that Murray consider how much an account
                  of his life would be worth “—while I am in full scandal—” links celebrity to commodity
                  culture, making himself over as a commodity, while distinguishing between posthumous
                  fame and contemporary scandalous celebrity and their differential economic returns.</p>
               <p>But even this playful celebration of Byron’s posthumousness and celebrity soon recurs
                  to a blackly comic revenge fantasy—the seemingly interminable revenge fantasy that
                  Byron unspools across <em>Manfred</em>, the <em>Alpine Journal</em> and the letters: <span class="quote">‘Do you think I would not have shot myself last year—had I not luckily recollected
                     that Mrs. Clermont [Lady Byron’s maid and confidante, former governess and nurse]
                     &amp; Lady Noel [Lady Byron’s mother] &amp; all the old women in England would have been delighted
                     . . . ? Be assured—that <em>I would live</em> for two reasons—or more—there are one or two people whom I have to put out of the
                     world—&amp; as many into it—before I can “depart in peace” if I do so before—I have not
                     fulfilled my mission. (<em>BLJ</em> V:208)’</span> What is that “mission”? It is to put “one or two people” into the world, to populate
                  and “repeople” the world with new creations (as Byron’s narrator is soon to put it
                  in <em>Childe Harold</em> IV). It is that often painful business of submitting himself and his vigil of the
                  heart “in full scandal” to the public and contending with its reception, as Byron
                  writes in that letter to Moore: “I suppose now I shall never be able to shake off
                  my sables in public imagination. (<em>BLJ</em> V:186). And if never able to shake off the sables, nor for that matter was Byron
                  ever able to shake off the public imagination. “However,” Byron adds, “nor that, nor
                  more than that, has yet extinguished my spirit, which always rises with the rebound”
                  (<em>BLJ</em> V:186). Besides, Byron without his sables was arguably less compelling to the public
                  imagination, as Francis Jeffrey suggests of Byron’s far more conventional history
                  play, <em>Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice. An Historical Tragedy</em> (1821): “Lord Byron, without his bitters and his sweets, his softness and horrors,
                  is only a very bold and clever writer—withal somewhat clumsy and verbose” (Jeffrey
                  271). <em>Manfred</em> might be conceived of, nevertheless, as Byron’s process of attempting to shake off
                  the sables—an exorcism of vengeance and its Gothic forms—in order to rise with the
                  rebound, with “his bitters and his sweets,” in the commanding (if ambivalent) mixing
                  of generic registers and tones that he made his own.</p>
               <p><em>Manfred, A Dramatic Poem</em> is a poem in search of a certain tonality, for memory, for commemoration. It re-sets
                  the springs of wonder in search of a new set of tones and forms not only of revenge
                  but of self-critique and commemoration, of the good and the bad, a new mix of comic
                  and tragic forms that might—if not elude or “shake off”—at least disarm or re-mediate
                  the wondrous strange rituals of intimate publicity to which Byron’s life and work
                  were forevermore subject. Like Byron’s spirit, the old Gothic revenge forms also “rebound”:
                  never fully exorcised, there’s bloom on their cheeks. Uncharnelled, “redeemed from
                  the worm,” they “rebound” to enthrall. Hence our commemoration of <em>Manfred</em>’s “strange hectic” from which we draw the “strangest nourishment” (II.iv.100).</p>

               <p class="noCount">I wish to thank the convener of the <em>Manfred 200</em> symposium, Omar F. Miranda. I also thank Trinity College, Cambridge, for the Visiting
                  Scholarship that supported archival research on this essay at the Wren Library. And
                  I acknowledge the Australian Research Council for supporting the research and writing
                  of this essay.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The epigraph from <em>Hamlet</em> was added in the third issue of the first edition of <em>Manfred</em>, which is Jerome McGann’s copy-text for <em>CPW</em>. There are no less than three substantive texts of <em>Hamlet</em>; some editions, based on the First Folio, give “our philosophy” in place of “your
                  philosophy,” which suggests a gentler response from Hamlet, less of the retort that
                  is “<em>your</em>” philosophy. Byron owned a copy of the 1788 <em>Bell’s Edition of Shakespeare</em>, which is the edition I use throughout.</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The <em>Alpine Journal</em>, written in September-October 1816 as Byron toured the Alps with John Cam Hobhouse,
               has long been regarded as a key intertextual source for <em>Manfred</em>, at least since the first officially collected edition of Byron’s works, of 1832-3,
               when highlights of the <em>Journal</em> accompanied the text, and when Byron’s correspondence with Murray about the poem
               was presented as an aid to interpretation by being placed for readers before the text
               of the poem (see <em>Works</em>, XI, 3-4).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Moore translates this as “strongest nourishment” (<em>Works</em>, IV 322).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">As Gerald Parker details, Zanga had also been performed by Garrick’s contemporary,
               Henry Mossop, who Byron playfully cites as a fancied rival when he nostalgically recollects
               his own performance in “On a Distant View of Harrow” (1806). In 1815, Kemble and Kean
               competed for the role, and were celebrated by Leigh Hunt and William Hazlitt, respectively
               (see Parker 178-9).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Byron’s most emphatic protest against the staging of <em>Manfred</em> comes in the letter to Murray, from Venice, March 9, 1817: “The thing I have sent
               you you will see at a glimpse—could never be attempted or thought of for the stage—I
               much doubt it for publication even.—It is too much in my old style—but I composed
               it actually with a <em>horror</em> of the stage—&amp; with a view to render even the thought of it impracticable” (<em>BLJ</em> V: 185). Erdman offers the classic analysis of this statement, and of the ambivalence
               that informs it.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Contributing to the sense of <em>Manfred</em> as a play within a play, and of Byron as the author within his own play, a commiserating
               letter of February 1817 to Douglas Kinnaird (who had just resigned from the Drury
               Lane Subcommittee, after a falling out with the actress, Frances Maria Kelly) suggests
               further reasons why the genre of revenge tragedy was chosen to effect Byron’s revenge
               on the stage and on Drury Lane: “Sooner or later you will have your revenge—&amp; so shall
               I (in other matters) you on the stage &amp; I off—&amp; by Nemesis” (Feb. 3, 1817, <em>BLJ</em> V: 168). Here, Byron’s figure of revenge “off” “the stage” captures precisely his
               ambivalent relation to the stage that manifests itself against it.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Speaking of “wild Personifications,” and how they relate to “feelings and passions,”
               Steven Mullaney’s question about the ghost of Andrea and his companion Revenge in
               <em>The Spanish Tragedy</em>—“should we call him a character, an embodied spirit or vengeance from Hades, or a
               personified allegory?” (Mullaney 64)—is also an appropriate question, I suggest, for
               the legion of Spirits, such as Nemesis, that populate <em>Manfred</em>’s often crowded stage.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Coincidentally, Byron had already been reading Voltaire as he worked on <em>Manfred</em>, writing to Hobhouse on March 31, 1817 that he had just bought “a complete Voltaire
               in 92 volumes—whom I have been reading” (<em>BLJ</em> V: 199).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Despite my focus on the genre of revenge tragedy, I would emphasize that I regard
               <em>Manfred</em> as multigeneric, encompassing comic and melodramatic, as well as tragic, modes. For
               a suggestive formulation of the revenge comedy, which sounds out comedy’s darker notes
               in charivari, “public shaming rituals” and “the scapegoating scene generic to festive
               comedy,” see Jones (23, 26).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               published until 1832), Byron addresses Lady Byron as “the moral Clytemnestra of thy
               lord” (37). As McGann notes, this poem was written shortly after the collapse of de
               Staël’s attempt to reconcile Lord and Lady Byron (<em>CPW</em> IV, 460).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
