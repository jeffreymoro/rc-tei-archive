               <p>The idea of the system was one of De Quincey’s many obsessions; he returned to it
                  again and again over the course of his career as a writer. In addition to essays on
                  the transport system and accounts of systems of publication and communication, he
                  wrote extensively about political economy, probing its development after Adam Smith
                  and attempting to address its defects as a discipline and to correct the misapprehensions
                  that he argued limited its potential as a science. </p>
               <p>De Quincey was initially a skeptic. In <em>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</em>, he claims that when he first surveyed recent works of political economy, he found
                  them to be “generally the very dregs and rinsings of the human intellect; and that
                  any man of sound head, and practised in wielding logic with a scholastic adroitness,
                  might take up the whole academy of modern economists and throttle them between heaven
                  and earth with his finger and thumb, or bray their fungus heads together with a lady’s
                  fan” (65). David Ricardo’s <em>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em> (1817) made him a convert. It did for De Quincey what Wordsworth’s poetry would do
                  for Mill. “For two years,” he wrote, “I believe that I read no book but one” (64).
                  Reading Ricardo inspired “wonder and curiosity,” “emotions that had long been dead
                  in me,” and roused him from the personal and intellectual malaise brought on by opium
                  (65). In a passage that is as much an expression of his own ambitions as a reflection
                  on Ricardo’s accomplishment, he marvels that “an Englishman, and he not in academic
                  bowers, but oppressed by mercantile and senatorial cares,” had “deduced, <span class="foreign">à priori</span>, from the understanding itself, laws which first gave a ray of light into the unweildy
                  chaos of materials, and had constructed what had been but a collection of tentative
                  discussions into a science of regular proportions, now first standing on an eternal
                  basis” (65-6). Circumstances prevented De Quincey from finishing his first work on
                  Ricardo (to be titled <em>A Prolegomena to All Future Systems of Political Economy</em>), but after the <em>Confessions</em> had made his reputation and secured him a position as a regular contributor to the
                  <em>London Magazine</em>, he produced critiques of Malthus, a series of dialogues on Ricardo, an essay on
                  Ricardo and Adam Smith, and, finally, for <em>Blackwood’s</em>, the three essays that would be become <em>The Logic of Political Economy</em> (1844) (originally titled <em>Ricardo Made Easy; or, What is the Radical Difference between Ricardo and Adam Smith?
                     With Occasional Notices of Ricardo’s Oversights</em>).</p>
               <p>While De Quincey notices Ricardo’s oversights, he works tirelessly in <em>The Logic of Political Economy</em> to explicate the “scientific proportions” and “eternal basis” of Ricardo’s theories.
                  In the preface, he diagnoses the fundamental problems of contemporary political economic
                  theory, claiming that “as regards its <em>practical</em> applications,” economic science is “as treacherous as Shakespeare’s ‘stairs of sand’”
                  (119). The image he conjures up to illustrate economics’ unsound foundations—of “phantom
                  arrays of fleeting columns and fluctuating edifices,” created by winds on the Arabian
                  desert—recalls his description of Piranesi’s architectural drawings in the <em>Confessions</em> (119). For the opium eater, the impossible coherence of Piranesi’s designs represented
                  the “power of endless growth and self-reproduction” which animated his own dreams
                  (<em>Confessions</em> 71). The image of economic theory as shifting Arabian sands reflects the same power
                  but perceived from something like the opposite direction. Rather than Piranesi’s impossible
                  coherence—design undone by paradox—De Quincey finds in political economy a promise
                  of coherence that is perpetually, and simultaneously, extended and withdrawn. Despite
                  Ricardo’s genius, “nothing can be postulated—nothing can be demonstrated; for anarchy,
                  even as to the earliest principles, is predominant”; the sandcastles of political
                  economy are “for ever collapsing into dust” (<em>Logic</em> 119).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>The Logic of Political Economy</em> seeks to bring order to this chaos by shoring up “the distinctions which are elementary
                     to the science” (118). Its focus is Ricardo’s theory of value, which, De Quincey argues,
                     commentators had utterly misunderstood. This failure to appreciate Ricardo’s revision
                     of Smith, he claims, stunted the development of political economy as a systematic
                     mode of thought. But even as he works in the service of system, De Quincey encounters
                     the very problem he argues the political economists had utterly failed to address.
                     However beautifully conceived in theory, in practice, systems are governed by extrinsic
                     conditions. Like men in Marx’s conception of history, the market does not make prices
                     just as it pleases; it makes them “under circumstances directly encountered, given
                     and transmitted from the past” (Marx 15). Thus the tendency of political economists
                     to imagine that the law of supply and demand operates in a vacuum, independent of
                     preexisting circumstances, amounts to “metaphysical confusion”: <span class="quote">‘This is an error which has led to worse consequences than any of the others here noticed.
                        People fancy that the relation of Supply and Demand could by possibility, and that
                        in fact often <em>does</em>, determine separately <em>per se</em> the selling price of an article. Within a few months this monstrous idea has been
                        assumed for true by Colonel Torrens, in an express work on Economic Politics; by Lord
                        Brougham, in relation to the foreign corn trade; and by almost every journal in the
                        land that has fallen under my own eye. But it is a metaphysical impossibility that
                        Supply and Demand, the relation of which is briefly expressed by the term “market
                        value,” could ever affect price except by a <em>secondary</em> force. (<em>Logic</em> 121)’</span> De Quincey’s point is straightforward enough: while the relation of supply and demand
                     affects price, supply and demand necessarily act on a preexisting value. Unlike natural
                     price, which “is always monomial,” market price “must always be binomial.” It cannot
                     be determined merely by the relationship between supply and demand at a given moment
                     but must be calculated in relation to “an antecedent price, arising from some other
                     cause” (121). If market price cannot be determined in isolation, however, De Quincey’s
                     own logic undermines the stability of his analysis. The “other cause” toward which
                     he gestures must itself extend indefinitely into the past. It is also multiply determined—and,
                     one must imagine, similarly affected by supply and demand. Metaphysical impossibility,
                     it seems, gives way to an epistemological dead end. On De Quincey’s account, the logic
                     of political economy is constitutively recursive; it is this logic, rather than its
                     principles, that makes economics “the dismal science.”

               <p>As exhaustive (and exhausting) as it is, <em>The Logic of Political Economy</em> does not pursue the implications of its analysis to their logical conclusion. System
                  building requires a closed frame of reference. Two years later, however, in an essay
                  on what would appear to be an unrelated topic, De Quincey takes up the complications
                  that emerge when systems are situated in space and time and offers a striking illustration
                  of the limitations of the systematizing impulse. “System of the Heavens as Revealed
                  by Lord Rosse’s Telescopes,” which appeared in <em>Tait’s</em> in 1846, is ostensibly a notice of the Scottish astronomer John Pringle Nichol’s
                  <em>Thoughts on Some Important Points Relating to the System of the World</em>. Rather than a formal review, however, De Quincey takes his friend’s book as his
                  “text”—about which his “little paper … may be said to hover” (“System” 7, note 1).
                  Nichol’s book was a work of popular science; De Quincey aims to inspire the reader
                  with the sublimity of the universe revealed by recent advances in astronomy. His purpose
                  is not to criticize or even summarize Nichol’s account but, “through the light torrent
                  <em>spray</em> of fanciful images or allusions,” to give the reader “momentary glimpses of objects
                  vast and awful” (8, note 1).</p>
               <p>“System of the Heavens” opens with a question about the age of the earth. Kant had
                  posed the question in an essay De Quincey translated and published in <em>Tait’s</em> in 1833. In revisiting it, he transforms Kant’s inquiry into a puzzle. He points
                  out that the question does not concern the absolute age of the Earth, because knowing
                  the Earth’s age without a frame of reference would tell us nothing. Instead, Kant
                  asks, “What proportion does that amount form of the total career allotted to this
                  planet?” (8). At issue, in other words, is not “the <em>positive</em> amount of years through which our Earth has existed” but “the <em>period</em> of life, the <em>stage</em>, which she may be supposed to have reached” (8, 9). In sketching out the implications
                  of the question, the essay develops a fanciful conceit in which the Earth is “a <em>lady</em> planet” and “our dear little mother.” That asking her age is “a delicate point,”
                  and the question “improper,” doesn’t prevent De Quincey from speculating about it
                  at length and in absurd detail (8). “Is she a child, in fact,” he asks, “or is she
                  an adult? And, <em>if</em> an adult, and that you gave a ball to the Solar System, is she that kind of person
                  that you would introduce to a waltzing partner, some fiery young gentleman like Mars;
                  or would you rather suggest to her the sort of partnership which takes place at a
                  whist-table?” (9).</p>
               <p>Kant had warned against using “the sequence of human generations … as a measure for
                  God’s works at large” (“Question” 168). But De Quincey’s personification of the planets
                  and the analogy he draws between planetary time and generational relationships aren’t
                  intended to measure the Earth’s age in human years. They underscore the fact that
                  age, of the Earth or a human being, is not an absolute value but a relationship. De
                  Quincey suggests that Kant goes wrong when he loses sight of this fact, and the oversight
                  prompts him to wonder whether there is, “after all, any stationary meaning in the
                  question?” (“System” 10). If we could persuade “our dear excellent mother the Earth”
                  to tell us her age, “still <em>that</em> would leave us all as much in the dark as ever: since, if the answer were ‘Why, children,
                  at my next birth-day I shall count a matter of some million centuries,’ we should
                  still be at a loss to <em>value</em> her age: would it mean that she was a mere chicken, or that she was ‘getting up in
                  years’”? Conversely, if the Earth confessed only “generally to being a lady of a certain
                  age,” we would know “the <em>valuation</em> of the age” but not “the <em>absolute</em> years numerically: would a ‘certain age’ mean that ‘mamma’ was a million, or perhaps
                  not much above seventy thousand?” (12). However the question is posed, it assumes
                  a coordinating set of conditions that is absent; taken in isolation, neither version
                  tells us what we want to know. Like market value, any meaningful calculation of the
                  age of the Earth “must always be binomial.” As De Quincey puts it, “there is apparently
                  this two-edged embarrassment pressing upon the case” (11-12).</p>
               <p>This insight, it turns out, is the real focus of De Quincey’s essay, and it reveals
                  the central problem with the question of the Earth’s age. He variously entertains
                  the idea that the Earth is a child or an adult; a lady, “a healthy growing girl,”
                  or “a fine noble young woman”; or even “in the category of decaying, nay, of decayed
                  women” (9-10). But, however the Earth is figured, she is also a mother to man and
                  a sister to the other planets in the solar system, and these intersecting identifications
                  “explode” Kant’s problem. The Earth’s geological transformations suggest that she
                  is, perhaps, “both young and old”: <span class="quote">‘Young? If she is not young at present, perhaps she <em>will</em> be so in the future. Old? If she is not old at this moment, perhaps she <em>has</em> been old, and has a fair chance of becoming so again. In fact, she is a Phoenix that
                     is known to have secret processes for rebuilding herself out of her own ashes. Little
                     doubt there is but she has seen many a birth-day, many a funeral night, and many a
                     morning of resurrection. For listen:—Where now the mightiest of oceans rolls in pacific
                     beauty, once were anchored continents and boundless forests. (10)’</span> The ages of the Earth are “known to us geologically as facts” but remain “obscure
                  as durations.” The problem of the Earth’s age emerges out of the collision of human
                  and geological time; planetary revolutions, like political revolutions, are cycles
                  of “ruin and restoration” (11). But cyclical time offers no fixed point of reference,
                  and the two variables De Quincey identifies remain puzzlingly independent.</p>
               <p>In an effort to establish a stable frame of reference—to find a “stationary meaning”—De
                  Quincey turns to “the analogy of our whole planetary system” (which, he claims, Kant
                  has “overlooked”) (13). He reasons that, as siblings, any difference in age between
                  the planets should be negligible and asks how old “we take our brother and sister
                  planets to be? For <em>this</em> determination as to a point in <em>their</em> constitution will do something to illustrate our own” (12). For example, if Jupiter
                  is, as Kant seemed to believe, a young planet—as De Quincey puts it, “the younger
                  brother of our mamma”—how can the Earth be “an old decayed lady” (13)? Moreover, if
                  the Earth were old, surely we, her children, would be old as well—a claim De Quincey
                  refutes, citing “a thousand indications of strength and budding youth” in the nineteenth
                  century, including the promise of “Lord Rosse’s almost awful telescope” (14). While
                  it might seem that De Quincey confuses planetary time and human time (men are young,
                  so the Earth can’t be old), his real point has to do with their coordination. That
                  the Earth is at once our mother and Jupiter’s sister reminds us that it is a part
                  of two systems, one terrestrial and one celestial. Asking questions about the Earth’s
                  age invokes the system to which it belongs, and inquiring about the solar system in
                  turn entails consideration of the systems of which it forms merely a small part. The
                  resolving power of the new telescope not only reveals worlds beyond worlds; it discovers
                  systems beyond, and within, systems.</p>
               <p>Lord Rosse’s telescope brings the paradoxes of system into focus. The problem with
                  larger and larger telescopes, De Quincey observes, is that more power does not mean
                  greater resolution: “Concurrently with all increase in the space-penetrating power,
                  there arises an increasing confusion in the images reflected. As the power of this
                  instrument advances in one direction, correspondingly it recedes in another” (14-15).
                  Initially, it seems that Lord Rosse’s telescope has overcome this obstacle: <span class="quote">‘Most truly we may say that he has revealed more by far than he found. The theatre
                     to which he has introduced us is <em>immeasurably</em> beyond the old one which he found. To say that he found, in the visible universe,
                     a little wooden theatre of Thespis, a <span class="foreign">tréteau</span> or shed of vagrants, and that he presented us, at a price of incalculable anxiety,
                     with a Roman colosseum—<em>that</em> is to say little. Columbus, when he introduced the Old World to the New, did in fact
                     only introduce the majority to the minority; but Lord Rosse has introduced the minority
                     to the majority. (15)’</span> In making Lord Rosse a greater explorer than Columbus, this passage ostensibly celebrates
                  his accomplishment. But even as he praises Rosse’s discovery, De Quincey acknowledges
                  that it comes “at a price.” The sheer scale of the universe made visible by the new
                  telescope breeds an “incalculable anxiety”—a mirror image of the universe’s newly-discovered
                  immeasurability. The transposition of Old World and New, majority and minority, highlights
                  De Quincey’s concern with relative values. What is at stake is not size but scale,
                  and the revaluation of these relationships carries with it the menacing possibility
                  that this new universe might prove to be as hostile to man as the Age of Discovery
                  was to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. What Lord Rosse has found is positive
                  knowledge; what he has revealed, by comparison, is limitless. And this immeasurability
                  marks the limits of our knowledge. The idea of the universe, like the idea of publication,
                  is “a practicable object not reconcilable with the limitation of human power” (“Travelling”
                  232).</p>
               <p>The universe revealed by the new telescope puts us in touch with the sublime, De Quincey
                  suggests, less because it expands the scope of our knowledge than because it externalizes
                  the power that lies within the human mind. “In reality,” he writes, “the depths and
                  the heights which are in man, the depths by which he searches, the heights by which
                  he aspires, are but projected and made objective externally in the three dimensions
                  of space which are outside him.” The astronomer’s objective discoveries are merely
                  the shadows of subjective power; they are “the mirror to a mightier abyss that will
                  one day be expanded in himself” (“System” 15). De Quincey’s stunning description of
                  the nebula of Orion imagines this sublime abyss as “a head thrown back, and raising
                  its face (or eyes, if eyes it had) in the very anguish of hatred to some unknown heavens”
                  (19). The image of the nebula expresses “brutalities unspeakable” and “a convolute
                  of cruelty and revenge” (19, 20). In linking this allegorical visage to Milton’s allegory
                  of sin and death, De Quincey makes the stars continuous with literature and religion
                  in their ability to provoke pity and fear. In resolving them into a superhuman shape,
                  he retains human form as his point of reference—a practice that connects him to the
                  first watchers of the skies, who saw stars and created constellations. </p>

                  <p>David Masson comments on the “weird and fantastic effect” of this passage (“System”
                     18, note 1). Part of its strangeness, surely, is that Rosse’s telescope actually contributes
                     very little to the effect.

                              which appeared in Nichol’s book, is John Hershel’s rather than Rosse’s. See, for example,
                              Smith.</span></div>
                     </div> Before Rosse, De Quincey claims, the nebula was famous for its resistance to “the
                     most potent of telescopes” (17). After Rosse, it is now famous for its “submission
                     … to the all-conquering telescope” (18). Whether the nebula resists or submits is,
                     in a sense, irrelevant, because its significance has to do with its status as a mirror
                     to the observer’s mind. In a note to the revised version of the essay published in
                     1854, De Quincey answers those who criticized his depiction of the nebula by insisting
                     on the essentially subjective nature of description: “All such appearances, whether
                     seen in fire, or in the clouds, or in the arbitrary combinations of the stars, are
                     read differently by different people.” These differences sometimes result from different
                     conditions—the appearance of the nebula is affected by its motion and the motion of
                     the Earth; it changes when the power of the telescope is adjusted—but De Quincey insists
                     that “even where the grouping is exactly the same, being so rigorously limited as
                     to exclude all action of caprice, the result may yet be very different” (19, note
                     2). Like Wordsworth’s descriptions of the appearance of clouds or storms, the purpose
                     of De Quincey’s description is not accurate representation. Instead, the nebula is
                     the vehicle for the realization of an image of his subjective reflection.</p>
               </div>
               <p>If it seems that De Quincey gives away too much in asserting the fundamentally subjective
                  nature of perception, it would be a mistake to allow his weak relativism to obscure
                  his strong commitment to the significance of depths and heights. Spatial references
                  are of course crucial to the discourse of the sublime but not merely because they
                  reflect its character as Longinus or Burke described it. They also highlight the situation
                  and orientation of the perceiver. It’s crucial, for De Quincey, that Lord Rosse and
                  Wordsworth both look upward. In a long, seemingly bizarre footnote, he remarks that,
                  “if on a public road you meet a party of four women, it is at least fifty to one that
                  they are all laughing; whereas if you meet a party of [men], you may wager safely
                  that they are talking gravely, and that one of them is uttering the word <em>money</em>.” He concludes that, <span class="quote">‘because our sisters are too much occupied with the playful things of this earth,
                     and our brothers with its gravities … neither party sufficiently watches the skies.
                     And <em>that</em> accounts for a fact which often has struck myself—viz. that, in cities, on bright
                     moonless nights, when some brilliant skirmishings of the Aurora are exhibiting, or
                     even a luminous arch, which is a broad riband of snowy light that spans the skies,
                     positively, unless I myself say to people “Eyes upwards!” not one in a hundred, male
                     or female, but fails to see the show, though it may be seen <span class="foreign">gratis</span>, simply because their eyes are too uniformly reading the earth. (32)’</span> In one sense, the point of this passage is that worldly preoccupations—women’s with
                  trivialities, men’s with “<em>money</em>”—prevent us from looking outside ourselves and beyond our world. Lord Rosse and Wordsworth,
                  their gazes turned upward, stand opposed to this general “downward direction of the
                  eyes” (32).</p>
               <p>In another sense, however, De Quincey’s claim marks an interest in what Kant called
                  “orientation in thinking.” Anna Henchman has recently drawn attention to this connection,
                  tracing the influence of Kant’s 1786 essay and his <em>Theory of the Heavens</em> (1755) on “System of the Heavens.” For De Quincey, Henchman argues, “astronomical
                  observation has disrupted the categories of subjectivity and objectivity by revealing
                  that there is no fixed point in the entire universe,” and, in describing the “ebb
                  and flow” of De Quincey’s estimation of Kant, she traces a trajectory that reproduces
                  his shifting assessments of political economy: at first enthusiastic about <em>The Critique of Pure Reason</em>, De Quincey becomes disturbed by its “emphasis on the subjective nature of external
                  reality”; finally, prompted by Coleridge, he returns to Kant’s critical philosophy—in
                  particular the “idea that orientation and direction are necessary parts of thinking”
                  (Henchman 68, 69). Henchman’s reading of De Quincey’s essay shows how its “rapid shifts
                  in point of view, scale and even genre” reflect his understanding of the “universe
                  in flux” revealed by Lord Rosse’s telescope, an uncertainty he worked to assuage by
                  turning to Kant’s radical recasting of the relationship between subjective and objective
                  observation (Henchman 72). What is perhaps most striking about her account, however,
                  is the underlying sense that Kantian orientation in fact intensifies the instabilities
                  that De Quincey sought to alleviate.</p>
               <p>In “What is Orientation in Thinking?” Kant emphasizes the importance of correlating
                  external objects (like “the sun in the sky”) with the “feeling” of an internal difference
                  in the subject (between, for example, one’s left and right hands) (238). In essence,
                  he grounds our experience of the objective world in this subjective sense of direction.
                  Without this “<em>subjective</em> distinction,” Kant claims, “objective data” alone would be insufficient: <span class="quote">‘… if all the constellations, while in other respects retaining the same shape and
                     the same position in relation to each other, were one day miraculously transposed
                     so that their former easterly direction now became west, no human eye would notice
                     the slightest change on the next clear night, and even the astronomer, if he heeded
                     only what he saw and not at the same time what he felt, would inevitably become <em>disorientated</em>. But in fact, the ability to make distinctions by means of the feeling of right and
                     left comes quite naturally to his aid—an ability which, though implanted by nature,
                     has become a habit as a result of frequent practice; and if he simply directs his
                     eyes to the Pole Star, he will not only notice the change which has occurred, but
                     will still be able to <em>orientate</em> himself. (239)’</span> Kant “extend[s] this geographical process of the concept of orientation to signify
                  any kind of orientation within a given space” by offering a thought experiment: “in
                  the darkness, I can orientate myself in a familiar room so long as I can touch any
                  one object whose position I remember.” Were the positions of objects in that room
                  shifted, however, “for a joke,” “in such a way that their relative positions remained
                  the same but what was previously on the right was now on the left, I would be quite
                  unable to find my way about” (239).</p>
               <p>In “System of the Heavens,” De Quincey argues that we inhabit a universe in which
                  the transpositions Kant imagines are perpetual. The motions of the Earth, the other
                  planets, the stars, and the systems to which they belong leave us always in the dark,
                  depriving us of a stable frame of reference. For left and right, De Quincey substitutes
                  up and down, depth and height, space and time. In his reading of the nebula of Orion,
                  for example, he asks the reader to turn Nichol’s picture upside down, “for it happens
                  that in the professor’s book it is placed upside down as regards the natural position
                  of the human head” (19). This shift in orientation mocks Kant’s careful reasoning—a
                  fact De Quincey playfully acknowledges when he says that “were it not treasonable
                  to insinuate the possibility of an error against so great a swell as Immanuel Kant,
                  one would be inclined to fancy that Mr. Kant had really been dozing a little on this
                  occasion” (11). But his point throughout “System of the Heavens” is to demonstrate
                  the disorienting effects of the realization that the universe affords no fixed spot
                  in relation to which we might orient ourselves. In a universe in flux, human heads,
                  unlike Kant’s hands, can have no “natural position.”</p>
               <p>“Great is the mystery of Space,” De Quincey writes, “greater is the mystery of Time”
                  (15). Nebular astronomy after William Herschel demonstrates the continuity between
                  these propositions and thus illustrates the full scope of the telescope’s power to
                  perplex. At the end of the eighteenth century, Herschel’s improved telescopes, which
                  brought nebulae like Orion closer, seemed to promise that these “milky spots” would
                  eventually all be resolved into “starry worlds” (21). (This is, in fact, what Lord
                  Rosse claimed—mistakenly it turned out—to have discerned in the nebula of Orion.)
                  The relative distinctness or diffusion of these spots, it was assumed, was a function
                  of their distance from the observer. “But,” De Quincey observes, “<em>that</em> did not follow: for, in the treasury of nature, it turned out that there were other
                  resources for modifying the powers of distance, for muffling and unmuffling the voice
                  of stars.” A world “at the distance <em>x</em>,” pushed back to “a double distance,” should become less distinct. Instead, “by compression,
                  by deeper centralization,” it becomes brighter. Push it back again, and it grows faint;
                  but repeat the operation, moving the starry bodies to four times their original distance,
                  and “once again it shall shake off the oppression of distance” and grow brighter (22).
                  And this, De Quincey argues, is merely one of several “cases of perplexity” in sidereal
                  astronomy. The astronomer finds that size and distance collide (“is the size less
                  or the distance greater?”), the motions of the universe and of the earth within it
                  are “doubtfully confounded,” and the relative positions of two distant stars are impossible
                  to determine (is proximity real, “or simply an apparent proximity from lying in the
                  same visual line, though in far other depths of space?”) (24). In revealing the vastness
                  of space and exponentially expanding its sublime distances, the telescope confounds
                  the observer’s ability to find anything in it—or, more precisely, to speak with any
                  degree of certainty about what he has found.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lord Rosse has not just “created immeasurable worlds”; he has discovered innumerable
                     occasions for confusion (23). In sidereal astronomy, distance, magnitude, and motion
                     are not positive values, but relationships and thus sources of equivocation. The double
                     stars that, along with the nebular hypothesis, claimed the attention of astronomers
                     from Kant and Herschel to Rosse and Nichol, are “equivocal phenomena—phenomena that
                     are reconcilable indifferently with either of two assumptions” (26). De Quincey argues
                     that depth, height, and the vast distances of space are not cognizable by infants,
                     animals, or brutes: “Man only has a natural function for expanding, on an illimitable
                     sensorium, the illimitable growths of space…. To man is as much reserved the prerogative
                     of perceiving space in its higher extensions as of geometrically constructing the
                     relations of space. And the brute is no more capable of apprehending abysses through
                     the eye than he can build upwards or analyze downwards the aerial synthesis of Geometry”
                     (16). “System of the Heavens” is an attempt to make sense of the expanded, and expanding,
                     universe revealed by the telescope through such “aerial synthesis.” The attempt fails,
                     but its failure is precisely De Quincey’s point. Like Memnon’s head, which De Quincey
                     encountered soon after it arrived at the British Museum in 1821, space “baffles and
                     confounds all faculty of computation” (17).

                     enlighten: traveling at a speed three times that of the earth in orbit, it would take
                     forty-one thousand years to reach a star in the constellation Cygnus; at the same
                     rate, reaching “that distance to which Lord Rosse’s six-feet mirror has so recently
                     extended our <em>vision</em>” would take two hundred and fifty million years. The problem is not the difficulty
                     of the computation (calculating the ratio of these distances “is a simple rule-of-three
                     problem for a child”), but that the result is measured in terms of human time (in <em>years</em>) and yet defies human comprehension (26). Lord Rosse’s telescope has transformed
                     men into brutes. Faced with the overwhelming scale of the universe, man joins the
                     “deer, or hares, or foxes, and the pack of hounds in pursuit, chaser and chased, all

                  <p>De Quincey’s word-painting of the Orion nebula does not resolve this failure; it cannot.
                     Instead, it takes the failure of human comprehension and, out of it, creates an experience
                     of the sublime. This is the point of the essay and the point of looking up into the
                     sky. The mysteries De Quincey addresses are worth his attention precisely because
                     they defy his understanding and, in their defiance and cold contempt (reflected in
                     “the detestable phantom” of the Orion nebula), inspire him to hold “up a mirror of
                     description to appearances so grand, and in a dim sense often so symbolic” (19, note
                     2). Near the end of the essay, De Quincey imagines “a man in the last century, and
                     an eminent man too” who rejected the sublimity of astronomy: “on the contrary, he
                     regarded the solar system as decidedly vulgar; because the planets were so infernally
                     punctual … that they forced him … to think of post-office clocks, mail-coaches, and
                     book-keepers. Regularity may be beautiful, but it excludes the sublime” (29).

                     the planetary, 2, the cometary, 3, the sidereal; … 4, the nebular”), the sublimity
                     of the heavens is restored or revealed anew; systems of such amazing size and complexity
                     necessarily produce “variety,” “irregularity,” and “anomalies” sufficient to sustain
                     our sense of the sublime (30-31). “And,” he concludes, “for all purposes of frightening

                  within SYSTEM—was the Enlightenment, not Enlightenment as the condition of modernity
                  …, but the … temporally and geographically localized Enlightenment that did not make
                  it out of the eighteenth century” (206). From this standpoint, De Quincey’s systematizing
                  is a late example of how systems “tended to sink under their own weight” (206). We
                  might understand De Quincey’s systems—economic and astronomical, but also the mail-service
                  system as it is depicted in “The English Mail-Coach” or the mind and personal identity
                  as they are constituted by memory in the <em>Confessions</em> and <em>Suspiria de Profundis</em>—along these same lines and interpret his inability to make them make sense as failures.
                  For De Quincey, though, the failures that undo systems are themselves productive—of
                  sublimity and, in keeping with Kant’s larger point about the sublime, of thought.
                  Systems are fictions, but they are necessary—or at least unavoidable. And they necessarily
                  fail. If their creation reflects a conviction that the mind, world, and universe are
                  governed by reason, their failure is a testament to the persistent desire to make
                  sense of the mysteries and accidents we encounter, especially those that defy our
                  comprehension.</p>
