          <head>Introduction</head>
          <p>Where the question of “system” in the context of German Romanticism is concerned, and
            more specifically, in the aphorisms of Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel, it is all too
            tempting to dismiss the concept out of hand: not because it has no role to play in
            Romantic thinking (it does), but because the system-concept in this historical context
            is a quagmire of competing definitions and contradictions. Certainly, there is a marked
            difference between the Romantic champions of the fragmentary, with their ironic
            oscillations, and the attempted rigor of Kant’s, Fichte’s or Hegel’s philosophical
            systems. Even Schelling’s nature-philosophical system, with its sympathies to the
            Romantic understanding of science, does not or cannot approximate the playfulness of the
            Romantic approach to thinking about systems. But think about them they do: without
            professing the desire to build and dwell in one of their own, Schlegel and Novalis
            return time and again to the notion of what a system can and cannot be, what it does and
            does not do, and what an individual’s relationship to a system should and should not be.
            The rhetorical emphasis here on drawing distinctions is not accidental and points to a
            further challenge: after Niklas Luhmann, it is no longer possible to speak of “system”
            in the same breath as German Romanticism without considering the theoretical position
            that says that those same systems to which the Romantics return time and again bear
            features of autopoietic systems as defined by Luhmann. To be sure, Luhmann’s
            understanding of “system” is nothing like Kant’s or Hegel’s. To simplify a concept that
            is arguably much more complex for Luhmann, we could say that for him, systems are
            neither perfectly defined nor perfectly stable entities, but instead undergo a process
            of continuous development as they differentiate themselves from their environments.
            Taking the Romantic art system as an example, Luhmann describes it as
            “self-referential,” “operationally closed,” and in a state of change (507). These
            dynamics “cannot be grasped according to the schema—still predominant at the time of
            Romanticism—of part and whole” (507). The schema of “part and whole” to which Luhmann
            refers is, of course, a mainstay of Romantic thinking about systems and other key
            concepts defined by agile intellectual leaps across scale: in addition to the concept of
            system this would include the fragment, the organism, and the work of art. It appears
            that Schlegel and Novalis are caught in the crossfire between different understandings
            of what a system can be. A proper understanding of systems in the context of German
            Romanticism therefore needs to bring together both an examination of the historical
            concepts that surround their understanding of a system and our contemporary
            sensibilities about systems, or we run the risk of their blind-spots becoming our
              own.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I would like to thank Edgar Landgraf for his
              comments on this paper, particularly regarding Luhmann’s systems theory.</note></p>
          <p>To approach Romantic thinking about systems, Johann Christoph Adelung’s definition
            provides a solid point of departure. In the <title level="m">Grammatisch-kritisches
              Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart</title> (<title level="m">Grammatic-critical
              Dictionary of High German</title>), he defines a system as a “connection of things of
            the same kind and disposition and the order according to which they are joined amongst
            themselves” (“der Zusammenhang von Dingen einerley Art und Einrichtung und die Ordnung,
            nach welcher sie unter einander verbunden sind”) (“System” 510-511). Adelung’s
            definition leaves open both the contents of what a system may contain and any mention of
            the specific kind of order that governs them—this is left to the discretion of the
            systematician. For their part, Novalis and Schlegel divide their attention between each
            of these issues: on the one hand, they test out a range of possible candidates for
            systematic connecting (including words, fragments, and concepts from the wide array of
            disciplines which attracted their interest), and on the other hand, they think about how
            these parts relate and the behavior of systems as a whole. This entails a study of other
            systems as well as considering alternatives to systems altogether. Novalis, who refers
            to the systems of Copernicus, Helvetius, Locke, Brown, and Fichte (among others), writes
            that “one studies foreign systems in order to find one’s own” (<title level="m"
              >Schriften</title> 2:278) and that the “actual philosophical system” must be
            “systemlessness” integrated into a system (2:289). For all their apparent differences,
            these two aphorisms undertake the same strategy of differentiation, and they do so in a
            way compatible with Luhmann’s understanding of systems. They bring a foreign element
            into the familiar in order to observe the difference and allow it to become integrated
            into further thinking about the system. </p>
          <p>Also in line with Luhmann and current understanding of Romantic thought is Schlegel’s
            and Novalis’ tendency to decry any notion of systematic rigidity and permanence in favor
            of a highly mutable environment: the system, according to Novalis, has itself the
            ability to effect new connections (3:56). Along these lines, the metaphors associated
            with the behavior of systems are frequently drawn from the realm of the organic. “Only
            that deserves to be called system,” writes Schlegel, “which has unity and an organic
            build (<title level="m">Gliederbau</title>)” (<title level="m">Philosophical
              Lectures</title> 55).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Translations from the German
              are mine throughout. Unless otherwise specified, all quotes from Novalis are from the
                <title level="m">Schriften</title>, and all quotes from Schlegel are from the <title
                level="m">Kritische Friedrich-Schlegel-Ausgabe</title>.</note> He even goes so far
            as to complain about those fumbling intellectual “banausoi” who “desecrate an organic
            system through <emph>mechanical</emph> handling” (“Kritische” 18:2:15). The Romantic
            emphasis on organic language for systems and other complex, emergent environments
            underscores the notion that they are essentially incomplete and in perpetual states of
            becoming, yet this same language is so pervasive that it can be difficult to find the
            necessary vantage-point from which to consider possible alternatives. At the risk of
            bearing the brunt of Schlegel’s criticism, this essay is an attempt to do exactly what
            he warns against: to give the Romantic thinking about systems a kind of “mechanical
            handling” by exposing its indebtedness to a mechanical idea that pervades the organic
            model of systems and operates, as it were, in the blind spot of organic discourse. </p>
          <p>I will begin by situating the Romantic interest in a simple machine—the lever—in
            historical context before explaining the kind of conceptual “work” Schlegel and Novalis
            have it perform. The next part of the paper will focus on a particular aspect of the
            lever, the fulcrum, which is an object of interest in its own right. I will then use the
            fulcrum to return to the question of system. It is a common point of view that to think
            “organically” is to think “non-mechanically,” but the examples discussed in this essay
            will show that this is not always the case. Rather, the two can co-exist, and it is
            precisely the dynamics of this co-existence that will put the Romantic concept of system
            in a different perspective. </p>

          <head>Romantic interest in a simple machine</head>
          <p>There is pleasure to be found in the appreciation of simple things: those objects or
            ideas that are so commonplace as to escape our attention, but that, if we happen to
            observe them more carefully, reveal their intrinsic value in ways we would not have
            expected. The mechanical lever belongs in this category. It numbers first among the
            “simple machines” described in handbooks on mechanics since the time of Archimedes,
            where it is considered alongside other devices such as the scale, the wedge, and the
            pulley. Levers and lever effects are so intrinsic to our worldview that, once we begin
            to pay attention to them, they are everywhere: they serve as the basis of more
            complicated machinery and organisms (including the musculature of the human body), as
            figures for the augmentation of human agency, and they are implicated in any causal
            connection based on an advantageous relationship of input to output. Against the
            backdrop of a subject philosophy, the Romantic interest in the lever therefore makes
            sense, but as we will see, how Schlegel and Novalis integrate the lever into their
            thinking defy conventional notions of instrumentality as embodied by the spirit of
            Archimedes.</p>
          <p>Although the lever is the most fundamental of the six or seven simple machines of
            classical mechanics—all of which rely in some way on the laws of the lever—it has proven
            over time to be remarkably versatile as an instrument of philosophical as well as
            scientific thought. As the historian of science Domenico Meli shows in <title level="m"
              >Thinking With Objects</title> (2006), a number of intellectuals in the modern period,
            including Kepler, Descartes, and Leibniz, to name just a few, relied on the lever’s
            theory and used it to model problems relating to theories of motion, oscillation, and
            impact for scales both great and small. He writes that “several scholars…used the lever
            in their accounts of circular and orbital motion,” such as Borelli, who “imagined the
            planets to be pushed by the sun’s light acting like a lever,” and Jakob Bernoulli, who
            “used the lever to investigate the problem of the center of oscillation” (312). Meli
            attributes the phenomenon of thinking in terms of levers to what he calls the “crucial
            role played by the geometrical diagram,” a role he describes as “heuristic and at the
            same time didactic or mnemonic” (312). In that regard, our Romantic-era mechanists are
            in good company. They too deploy the theory of lever as a heuristic tool to model
            relationships between concepts, to describe processes of generation of both the
            individual and the universe, and, more generally, as a way of addressing potential
            contradictions of philosophical thinking.</p>
          <p>Thanks to a number of publications in the last two decades, “science” and “Romanticism”
            are no longer a contradiction in terms, even if the precise nature of that relationship
            remains open to debate. Recent scholarship has exposed in great detail the Romantic
            reception of scientific theory, especially in regard to the emerging life sciences.<note

              Müller-Sievers’ <title level="m">Self-Generation: Biology, Philosophy and Literature

              53.2 (2007), 387-412. </note> This heightened interest in one aspect of Romantic
            thinking has, however unintentionally, suppressed another aspect that also deserves
            consideration. The problem is that the well-documented Romantic interest in chemistry,
            galvanism, and early biological thinking as they relate to models of organic life would
            not necessarily seem to accommodate an equally avid interest in mechanical law or
            anything hinting at a “mechanical philosophy.” Yet this is precisely the kind of
            philosophy that any intellectual engagement with the mechanical lever would entail,
            simply because it “endeavours to explicate the Phaenomena of Nature from Mechanical
            Principles,” as one finds in John Harris’s <title level="m">Lexicon Technicum</title>
            (1704) (col. MEC). First associated with texts such as Robert Boyle’s <title level="m"
              >The Origin of Forms and Qualities according to the Corpuscular Philosophy
            </title>(1666) and Descartes’ posthumously published <title level="m">Treatise on
              Man</title> (1664), mechanical philosophy rejects the Aristotelian viewpoint that
            there are particular forms and qualities which dictate the tendencies of objects in the
            natural world, and the mechanical philosopher holds that “everything, be it terrestrial
            or celestial, natural motion or constrained, must be explained in terms of the size,
            shape and motion of the parts that make it up, just as the behavior of a machine is
            explained” (Garber 44).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Garber’s essay in the
              Cambridge History of Science devoted to Early Modern science emphasizes the importance
              of the Cartesian idea, as expressed in the <title level="m">Principia
                philosophiae</title>, that such an understanding of the machine-like functioning of
              the universe allows the understanding of one part to be extrapolated to the whole: “In
              this way, the image of the macrocosm and the microcosm, central to chymical
              philosophies and Renaissance naturalism, found its way into mechanism after a fashion.
              For the mechanical philosopher, as for the chymist and the Renaissance naturalist,
              what happens at one level reflects and is reflected by what happens at every other
              level” (Garber 44), a perspective which also plays a role in the Romantic
              appropriation of the lever.</note> As for Schlegel and Novalis, Marshall Brown speaks
            for many when he voices the conventional wisdom that the German Romantics have advanced
            beyond the mechanistic worldview (33). My position is that such an envisioned rejection
            of “mechanical philosophy” often misrepresents the facts by disregarding mechanical
            metaphors still integral to Romantic thinking and that one should speak less of a
            wholesale abandonment of a mechanistic world view than a reconfiguration of its useful
            aspects in proximity to organic models. This point of view is substantiated by those
            aphorisms of Schlegel and Novalis where one finds an avid interest in the lever as a
            mechanical device and as an instrument of thought whose use can be tested out in
            contexts reaching far beyond “material” application,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I
              am paraphrasing an idea voiced by Immanuel Kant in his 1763 essay, “Versuch den
              Begriff der negativen Größen in die Weltweisheit einzuführen,” where he writes, with
              reference to the lever’s law of equilibrium, that it is a concept one can extend “weit
              über die Grenzen der materialen Welt” (55). </note> yet there has been relatively
            little work done on basic mechanical principles in the Romantic context.<note

            that. </p>
          <p>We can begin the discussion of the Romantic lever with a simple definition of this
            simple machine, taken from the most established German scientific dictionary of the late
            eighteenth century to which Schlegel and Novalis both refer—Johann Gehler’s <title
              level="m">Physikalisches Wörterbuch</title> (<title level="m">Physical
              Dictionary</title>). In an entry compiled verbatim from the mathematical writings of
            Johann Erxleben and Abraham Kästner,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Abraham Gotthelf
              Kästner, <title level="m">Anfangsgründe der angewandten Mathematik</title> Göttingen:
              Verlag der Wittwe Vandenhoek, 1780 and Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben, <title
                level="m">Anfangsgründe der Naturlehre</title> Göttingen: Johann Christian
              Dieterich, 1787.</note> Gehler’s dictionary refers to the lever as “a fixed and
            inflexible connection of three bodies—or three points—two of which turn around the
            third, the fulcrum” (“Hebel”). This definition can be taken as representative for the
            theory of static mechanics as it stands at the end of the eighteenth century, but if we
            recall the passage from Adelung’s dictionary cited earlier, it also meets the minimum
            requirements for a system in that it creates a connection between things which, for all
            their differences, are like enough in “kind” or “disposition” to allow for them to be
            connected in the first place. This analogy between lever and system has the potential to
            be productive because the conditions according to which the Romantics deploy the former
            will have implications for the latter.</p>
          <p>While there is evidence enough that both Schlegel and Novalis were well-versed in
            mechanical theory, in the case of Novalis his most detailed notes on the working of the
            lever come not from classical mechanics but rather from the physics of Carl
            Eschenmayer’s nature-philosophy and in particular the <title level="m">Säze
              </title>[sic]<title level="m"> aus der Natur-Metaphysik auf chemische und medicinische
              Gegenstände angewandt</title> (<title level="m">Propositions from Nature-Metaphysics
              applied to Chemical and Medicinal Objects</title>). Eschenmayer’s stated purpose in
            the preface to the <title level="m">Säze</title> bears directly on the question of
            system and can, in turn, be taken as programmatic for Novalis’ approach. Eschenmayer
            envisioned his text as a guidepost for future thinking about how to apply
            nature-philosophical ideas to the fields of chemistry and medicine. Because the text of
            the <title level="m">Säze</title> does not itself accomplish the task but merely points
            the way, Eschenmayer acknowledges its status as fragment (<title level="m"
              >Bruchstük</title> [sic]), adding, “One can take propositions from a system and apply
            them completely unsystematically to objects of experience, without their most
            meritorious aspect falling by the wayside” (iv). When Novalis read Eschenmayer’s text,
            he excerpted interesting passages and added his own commentary: <quote>
              <lg>
                <l>[E:] The longer the arm of the lever, the greater the <emph>velocity</emph> of
                  the force moving the end.</l>
                <l>[N:] <emph>greater room to move</emph> (Spielraum) of the force absolute in
                  itself—greater <emph>armature </emph>of the force— </l>

                  the shorter arm, or press down on it—in order to compensate </l>
                <l>[N:] More <emph>intensity</emph> versus greater <emph>extensity</emph>
                </l>
                <l>(Eschenmayer, <title level="m">Säze</title> xiv-xv; qtd. in Novalis, <title
                    level="m">Schriften</title> 2:281)</l>
              </lg></quote> Novalis’ excerpts and commentary replicate Eschenmayer’s approach.
            Mechanical facts about the lever—for example that a weight hanging from a lever will
            move more quickly through a given angle of displacement in a given time, in proportion
            to the arm’s length—inspire in Novalis a more general reflection about force
            (Eschenmayer makes no mention of either “absolute force” or an “armature of force”). The
            same holds true for Novalis’ reformulation of the law of equilibrium through the
            concepts of “intensity” and “extensity.” Here, Novalis makes a peculiar move, in that
            his reformulation of the physical law does away with external objects (like weights
            hanging on the arms of the lever). This amounts to an internalization of perspective and
            an identification with the lever itself—an idea to which I will return below. </p>
          <p>A broader look at the appropriation of the lever in Novalis’ aphorisms reveals the same
            willingness to rethink the lever beyond the context of mechanical law or even
            nature-philosophy. Thus, alongside statements about the lever in accordance with
            Newtonian physics (for example, when Novalis writes that the lever must be explained
            according to the laws of celestial mechanics [3:77]), one finds it used to model other
            kinds of environments that neither Newton nor Eschenmayer had in mind, such as the
            syntactical relation of nouns and verbs (3:691). The degree to which Novalis’
            philosophical thinking is connected to his thinking about the lever becomes even more
            apparent when, with reference to his physicist friend Johann Wilhelm Ritter, Novalis
            constructs an analogy between “Ritter’s way of handling physics” and “my idea about the
            principle of personality in every substance,” something he equates with the force of the
            lever’s fulcrum (3:135). In other words, Novalis’ thinking about the lever seems to be
            more in line with a philosophical approach (or “way” of doing something) than an
            isolated interest. A laconic note, “<title level="m">About the Lever</title>,” found
            just a few pages later than the aphorism cited above, raises similar questions, namely,
            to what degree the lever was merely an object of conceptual interest for Novalis, and to
            what degree its very instrumentality may lie in how it facilitates a more general
            approach to thinking about certain problems of philosophical interest. These are
            questions which ultimately have to do with the individual, as the notion of a
            “personality in every substance” and the formulation of equilibrium in terms of
            “intensity and extensity” might suggest.</p>
          <p>Whereas Novalis thinks “about the lever” in such a way as to generalize from
            contemporary physical theory, Schlegel’s approach can best be described as the
            exploratory creation of levers themselves, which in turn aligns well with Meli’s
            discussion of the heuristic value of levers for the mechanical theory of the eighteenth
            century. It is the functional property of the lever, which is after all a machine for
            our use, that allows Schlegel to use it as an instrument of thought, as in the following
            two aphorisms that appear contiguously: <quote>
              <lg>
                <l>(1) Activity and receptivity completely relative. Substance absolute, only the
                  fulcrum in the [philosophical] lever (18:419).</l>

                    url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/systems/images/activity-receptivity-substance.png"

                <l>(2) Only through a continuous ever repeated disruption is life possible (18:419)
                </l>
              </lg></quote> Together, these two aphorisms offer a mechanical model of a lever in a
            state of constant motion, in the service of an organic principle. The fulcrum is a locus
            of alternation, a point which embodies the interplay of forces on either side. Much like
            the points of indifference between magnetic poles—which are also privileged points in
            Romantic thinking<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Around 1800, the concept of
              “indifference” took root in the sciences. It is commonly associated with Schelling’s
              discussion of magnetism in his nature-philosophy, having based his understanding of
              the term in part on the work of Dutch scientist Anton Brugmans, who describes a plane
              of indifference between the two poles of the magnet. In his <title level="m">Erster
                Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie</title> (1799), Schelling describes a
              state of indifference as one where natural phenomena exist with the forces acting upon
              them in balance, which can be considered as an analogous phenomenon to a lever in a
              state of equilibrium. See esp. Bernhard Rang, <title level="m">Identität und
                Indifferenz. Eine Untersuchung zu Schellings Identitätsphilosophie</title>
              Frankfurt: Klostermann, 2000, for a more detailed discussion of Schelling’s use of
              indifference. This antiquated concept of the magnet was replaced by magnetic fields
              after Ritter’s death (and later by quantum theory). </note>—the fulcrum serves as a
            model for negotiating a relationship between opposing concepts, as a figure of dynamic
            opposition. The suggestion that life or living is a process of repeated disruption is
            not unique to Schlegel. Schelling’s 1798 treatise, <title level="m">Von der
              Weltseele</title> (<title level="m">On the World Soul</title>), for example, also
            speaks of an equilibrium to life that must constantly be disturbed and re-established.
            In fact, in the same passage where Schelling makes this claim, he also uses the lever as
            a metaphor when he names oxygen and hydrogen the two “negative principles of life in the
            animal body,” comparing them to “weights on the lever of life” whose local
            disequilibrium allows for the large-scale maintenance of life itself (198).<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> One can contrast this point of view with the Hippocratic
              tradition that associates disease and disequilibrium.</note> Schlegel’s designation of
            the lever as “philosophical” emphasizes a theoretical relationship that complies with
            mechanical law. Though the units of his lever are relatively more abstract than
            Schelling’s hydrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of life itself, there is a shared
            emphasis on movement and process (as opposed to the figure of the lever in static
            equilibrium). </p>
          <p>The examples cited above are not unique in Schlegel’s work. One can find the blueprints
            of other levers whose terms are drawn from the key concepts that haunt his literary and
            philosophical notebooks around 1800: <quote><lg>
                <l>“Act and hypothesis form a lever, belief is the hypomochlion” (18:404)</l>
                <l>“Philology is perhaps constructed from the negative arm of philosophy or logic
                  and from the positive arm of poesy” (18:391)</l>
                <l>“Religion is the X of the encyclopedia—philology the hypomochlion. Art;
                  mythology, poesy the <emph>positive</emph> arm, philosophy, history the negative”
                  (18:391)</l>
                <l>“Mythology is only the hypomochlion of poesy” (16:293)</l>
              </lg></quote> It comes as no surprise that Schlegel also states that the lever is of
            “utmost importance” for the theory of construction (18:170). Such a claim would be
            unoriginal in a mechanics handbook, but what about in the Romantic context? Much in the
            same way as the formulas in Schlegel’s notebooks draw upon the language and symbolism of
            differential calculus, we see that in the examples quoted above the logic of the lever
            allows for abstract concepts to be treated as discrete quantities and positioned into
            relationships, without, however, losing their dynamic potential or status as
            constructions-in-progress. These levers accomplish a kind of philosophical work. They
            construct by bringing concepts together and positioning them in proximity to each other
            and also by establishing connections to allow for mobility, given that one fundamental
            aspect of the lever is its movement around the fulcrum—its ability to accommodate a
            shifting relationship of forces. Within the context of Romantic writing, one can also
            speak of local and global lever effects: once the relationships are constructed (for
            example, between mythology and poesy in the last of Schlegel’s aphorisms cited above),
            they will continue to bear upon our broader understanding (i.e., the relationship will
            continue to affect our understanding of them in the context of the Romantic encyclopedia
            project and beyond). Schlegel’s lever effects continue to operate beneath the surface of
            the encyclopedia project, even when the lever or its component parts are not directly
            mentioned. </p>
          <p>Once again, Adelung’s definition of system comes to mind, along with the thought that
            there is a homogenizing effect—at least of form, if not of content—when different
            concepts are treated as units with which to build. It is important to keep in mind,
            however, that the emphasis on the lever does not imply a reduction of Romantic thinking
            to something like a mechanical, clockwork cosmos. How Schlegel and Novalis position both
            the concept of the lever and their conceptual levers suggests a potential way of
            navigating between (and avoiding) oversimplified tropes of both the organic and the
            mechanical, even if their respective approaches are not precisely the same. In fact,
            they seem to be homing in on common ground from two different angles: Novalis, through a
            connection of the lever with the individual, and Schlegel, through a connection between
            the lever and the conceptual landscape of the intellect. As we will see, the meeting
            point of these two perspectives will be the fulcrum, which will also provide the most
            ambitious testing ground for the Romantic concept of system.</p>

          <p>Conspicuously absent from Schlegel’s notes is any mention of a hand or agency external
            to the functioning of these simple machines. Schlegel is no Archimedes: there is no
            fantasy of an ideal point from which to displace the world. Any “mechanical advantage”
            gained by the conceptual levers of his notes would seem to be re-absorbed into their

            can be observed, however, is a special emphasis placed on the concept of the fulcrum,
            which Schlegel and Novalis refer to using the Greek term, “hypomochlion.” Meaning
            “beneath the lever,” the hypomochlion is literally where the lever is placed to do its
            work—the planetary reality that grounds any fantasy of the Archimedean point.<note

                and Roman Antiquity</title>, A. G. Drachmann quotes the explanation provided in
              Pappus on the etymology of the hypomochlion: <quote>when people wanted to move a very
                heavy body, since the first thing they needed in moving it was to lift it from the
                ground, and there was no handle by which to handle it, because all parts of its
                bottom were on the ground, they had to find some way for this, and so they dug a
                small hole in the ground under the heavy body and took a long pole and put its end
                into the hole and pressed down the other end, and the burden came up (or ‘became
                small’). Then they placed under this pole a stone which is called ibumahliun
                [hypomochlion] and that means that which is placed under the lever, and they pressed
                down again and the burden became much lighter (or ‘was lifted higher up’). And as
                the power became known, it was understood that it was possible to move in this way
                great burdens. (52)</quote></note> From a mathematical perspective, the hypomochlion
            is a point of mediation on the lever itself and embodies the dynamic cancellation and
            maintenance of opposing forces; to think again with Luhmann, one could say that the
            hypomochlion encompasses a distinction and neutralizes it at the same time. In terms of
            thinking about systems, the hypomochlion acquires a priveleged status: it is the
            smallest conceivable model in which distinctions continue to be produced and,
            accordingly, is the smallest possible representation of the system itself. These aspects
            of the Romantic incorporation of the hypomochlion into their thinking about systems can
            be brought into even sharper relief against the backdrop of Eschenmayer’s and
            Schelling’s nature philosophy.</p>
          <p>Eschenmayer’s initial definition of the lever and the hypomochlion, to which Novalis
            refers in his notes, is simple enough as stated in the <title level="m">Säze</title>:
            “We can imagine the arms of a lever as two moments and regard the hypomochlion as the
            point in which both moments work against each other” (Wir können uns die Aerme eines
            Hebels mit ihren Kräften als zwei Bewegungsgrössen vorstellen, und das Hypomochlion als
            den Punkt ansehen, in welchem beide Grössen gegeneinander wirken) (xiv). This is
            essentially the same as the definition in Gehler’s <title level="m">Physikalisches
              Wörterbuch</title> cited at the beginning of the paper; like Gehler’s, Eschenmayer’s
            definition refers to a mathematical lever with no regard to material constraints. In the
            course of his nature-philosophical investigations over the next two decades, however,
            Eschenmayer will eventually consider ideas that would not be found in Gehler’s
            dictionary because they involve a speculative use of the lever (and the hypomochlion) as
            a model for activities of the mind: “1) The opposition between knowledge and being is
            expressed in the objective opposition between force and weight. 2) Mediation in the self
            is expressed in the hypomochlion of the lever. 3) The equation of knowledge and being is
            expressed through the relative equilibrium of weight and force” (<title level="m"
              >Psychologie</title> 448). These ideas, published in an 1817 volume devoted to
            empirical, pure, and applied psychology, may seem far removed from the current thinking
            about the lever around 1800, but we can see an analogous trajectory already developing
            in Schelling’s <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title> (1800). </p>
          <p>Schelling’s reference to the lever occurs in the context of a discussion that resists
            an easy summary but which can be characterized as an attempt to describe the ego
              (<foreign>das Ich</foreign>) as a product of opposed operations within the framework
            of self-consciousness. Schelling describes such a product as both real and inactive
              (<foreign>als ein reelles Unthätiges, oder als ein unthätiges Reelles</foreign>) (
              <title level="m">System</title> 101). It is both “mere matter” and a “product of the
            imagination” which is only important as a medium (<title level="m">Mittelglied</title>)
            (101). Schelling claims that “All matter is mere expression of an equilibrium of opposed
            operations which reduce each other reciprocally to a mere substrate of operation” (101).
            In other words, the stability of the material world relies upon a relative equilibrium
            of forces whose differences, once sublated, cease to be immediately apparent. At this
            point he introduces the comparison to the mechanical lever: “One should consider the
            lever, both weights operate only on the hypomochlion which is also the common substrate
            of their operation” (101). The hypomochlion therefore embodies both the conflict and the
            potential resolution of differences. Schelling goes one step further, however, to link
            what could be described as a purely material model, applicable to any physical context,
            more directly to a model of consciousness: “What is more, that substrate does not emerge
            accidentally through free production but rather completely automatically by virtue of a
            third operation that is as necessary as the identity of the self-consciousness” (101).
            Schelling contextualizes this idea with reference to the chapter heading, which states
            that opposed operations of self-consciousness, insofar as they inform a third operation,
            create something common between them. After his reference to the lever, Schelling
            directly equates this “common” element with a “<emph>construction of the ego
              itself</emph>, not as <emph>mere </emph>object but rather as subject and object at the
            same time” (102). </p>
          <p>What the above examples from Eschenmayer and Schelling show is that, in
            nature-philosophical thinking around 1800, the lever is removed from purely mechanical
            contexts and is deployed as a model for both the self in general and the emergence of
            self-consciousness. This model will eventually receive its most radical formulation in
            the psychological theory of Johann Herbart, who attempts with great mathematical rigor
            to use the lever and its law of equilibrium to model the recollection and suppression of
            thoughts in the brain (a topic for another day). Returning to the state of affairs
            around 1800, we can see that both Schlegel and Novalis have something more to contribute
            to the analogy between the lever and the individual. With an emphasis on a balance of
            forces, Novalis also considers the lever as a model for consciousness when he refers to
            “the temper of consciousness” as “maintained rest,” a “static force,” and “a
              <emph>constant quantity </emph>in continuous change (fulcrum on the lever)” (3:836).
            In keeping with the lever’s function as mediator between opposing forces, it is
            interesting to see how this figure of balance and reciprocity informs Novalis’ thinking
            in a more general sense: not only does Novalis “apply” the lever heuristically in new
            contexts, he also uses these same contexts for further reflection about the lever’s
            mechanical law. In another aphorism that begins with a reference to Plotinus’ idea of
            memory as the “lowest force of the soul—the basis of the others,” Novalis shows that, in
            addition to using the lever as an analogy for the operations of the mind, he can also
            use this model for further thinking about scientific theory: <quote>

                    (<title level="m">Schriften</title> 3:907).</l>
              </lg></quote> If we read these aphorisms in conjunction with the one where Novalis
            refers to his idea of “the principle of personality in every substance—or the force of
            the hypomochlion” (<title level="m">Schriften</title> 3:574), i.e., as a way of
            approaching physics, then at the very least there is mounting evidence for a model of
            the individual where the physics of the lever plays an important role (without, however,
            being reduced to a “mechanistic” philosophy in the older sense of the term). Other
            aphorisms, particularly those by Schlegel, go even further. In the same one where
            Schlegel attests that “the lever is extremely important for the theory of construction,”
            he writes that every universe has its own hypomochlion (18:170). And with reference to
            the hypomochlion as a figure of unified heterogeneity, he states that “the center of
            every universe [is] perhaps <title level="m">doubled</title> [and] actually
              <emph>heterogeneous</emph>. One from two, two at the same time from different orders”
            (18:171). What is true for the macrocosm holds true for the microcosm as well: the
            “active, free human is his own hypomochlion” (18:171). Here, more clearly than ever,
            Schlegel rewrites the Archimedean fantasy of the mighty lever by replacing it with a
            model that seems, at first glance, to be counterintuitive. For Schlegel, freedom
            is—among other things—the freedom from being indebted to any instrumental augmentation
            of power. The distinction between human agency and tool has been completely internalized
            to the point that human agency has been conceived in terms of a mechanical function. Far
            from being a philosophically reactionary maneuver, however, the identification of the
            individual with the hypomochlion does not present, in its sheer punctuality, any
            impediment to organic models of growth and generation. If anything, removing
            instrumental agency eases the way for autopoietic growth. </p>
          <p>One of the most significant aspects of the hypomochlion as it is incorporated into
            Romantic thinking—apart from the ease with which it can be moved across scale, from the
            universe to the individual—is its ability to embody “duplicity” in a literal sense
            without losing its integral “simplicity” as a point. In the hypomochlion, differences
            are sublated (<foreign>aufgehoben</foreign>) in that they are removed, maintained, and
            held up.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It is interesting, if one refers back to
              Hegel’s introduction of this term in <title level="m">Science of Logic</title> and the
                <title level="m">Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences</title>, to observe the way
              in which Hegel integrates the mechanical law of the lever into his discussion of
                <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign>.</note> If, as Novalis suggests, the true individual is
            also a true “dividual” (<title level="m">Dividuum</title>) (3:451), then the
            hypomochlion (and the lever) provide a model to illustrate how this idea need not be
            self-contradictory, because both identity and difference can be preserved. We have come
            a long way from Gehler’s definition of the lever as a “fixed and inflexible connection,”
            but Novalis is willing to go even further in his thinking about the lever when he
            suggests removing both the “fixed lines” <emph>and</emph> “point of support” such that
            the lever is now simply to be explained by the theory of force alone (3:470). As a
            physical idea it is not entirely clear what Novalis has in mind without a corresponding
            proof; as a philosophical model, however, Novalis’ proposal raises intriguing
            possibilities. If Novalis is referring to the point of support in the context of the
            physical lever, then perhaps he has decided to appropriate it indefinitely for the
            mathematical model where the fulcrum is, for all intents and purposes, part and parcel
            of the lever, bringing Novalis’ model of the lever that much closer to a model of a
            system that is self-sustaining. </p>

          <head>Conclusion: the mechanics of Romantic systems</head>
          <p>The equation of the hypomochlion with the individual—and with the system—has
            ramifications for our understanding of German Romanticism. In the wake of the
            mechanistic philosophy of the eighteenth century, and the perception that Romanticism
            distances itself both from this philosophy and from related figures of thought, the
            incorporation of perhaps <emph>the</emph> most important central concept from classical
            mechanics into a model of the subject should not be underestimated. At the same time, it
            seems clear that the presence of the hypomochlion is no real threat to the organic
            models that inform Schlegel’s and Novalis’ thinking. Instead, Romantic system-organs,
            when examined in terms of their smallest components, begin to resemble a mechanical
            assemblage where the fulcrum of the lever is the figure that defines the smallest
            possible—and paradoxically also the largest possible—unit.</p>
          <p>This suggests that a more nuanced view is required to understand precisely how a
            “mechanical” component can be embedded in Romantic nature-philosophical systems. Perhaps
            it is the elementary quality of the hypomochlion as a figure of individual duality that
            has allowed it to exist under the radar. Whereas an overt system of multiple levers
            would invariably recall older, contested models of the clockwork universe, a single
            lever—or even less than that, a single hypomochlion (and if Novalis has his way, perhaps
            even less than that: a mere tension of forces)—allows for mechanical theory to function
            uncontested in a less restrictive environment.</p>
          <p>Although figures of part and whole are central to Romantic thought, the hypomochlion
            possesses a unique mobility. It bridges conceptual work of the encyclopedia project and
            Romantic subject philosophy, equally at home as a model of consciousness, as a
            description of the individual, as a conceptual link between concepts drawn from
            different disciplines, and as a figure of cosmological reach. As the embodiment of
            agency without instrumentality, the hypomochlion is indebted to a model of the lever
            built upon pure relationality. Without a hand to direct it, it becomes organic and
            self-guiding, even as it remains figure of unified “dividuality.” In other words, the
            hypomochlion’s defining feature is the preservation of a distinction which allows it,
            with absolute succinctness, the potential of becoming a system unto itself.</p>
