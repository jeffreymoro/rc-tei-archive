      <div type="abstract">
        <p rend="noCount">The Eighteenth Century has been called the “age of the encyclopedia,” but
          the understanding of that word is very different in the encyclopedias of Chambers and
          Diderot on the one hand, and on the other hand the German Idealist tradition variously
          exemplified by Hegel’s <title level="m">Encyclopedia of the Philosophical
          Sciences</title>, Schelling’s <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, and Novalis’
            <title level="m">Romantic Encyclopedia</title>. In Kant’s terms, the first provides an
          aggregate of knowledge, whereas the second attempts a system that entails an
          architectonic. Focusing on Hegel’s desire to unify all the sciences through the
          meta-discipline of philosophy, this paper explores the increasing complication of his
          architectonic by the very figures he uses to safeguard it: namely the circle, the line,
          and the body. Tracing the supplementary relationship between the first and the second, I
          argue that the body with its multiple subsystems brings to a head the collapse of the
          “smooth” system Hegel intended into a “tangled’” system: a productive collapse, because
          instead of being a forced unification of knowledge, the encyclopedia becomes a
          thought-environment for transferences between disciplines and potentially the emergence of
          new disciplines. Or, in effect, it becomes a form of “Theory” avant la lettre.</p>

          <head>Encylopedias and Encyclopedics</head>
          <p> In encyclopedias that proliferated in the eighteenth century, the body, map and tree
            are frequent schemas for system. These figures project what Deleuze and Guattari call a
            striated space with clear coordinates (361-2) that can be compared to Kant’s equation of
            system with “architectonic,” which Kant naturalizes through the body that assigns parts
            their functions and subordinates them to a whole (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691).
            Yet what if the body is not an anatomical body, but is composed of multiple systems that
            work on different levels and in different registers: circulatory, digestive, nervous
            etc.? This paper reflects on the different conceptualizations of system generated by
            different analogues for organization, and the different models of intellectual formation
            produced by such systems. For my purposes encyclopedias that gather up all the pieces of
            information spawned by an expanding print culture can be distinguished from the
            “encyclopedics” developed by German Idealist and Romantic philosophers, such as Hegel,
            Schelling, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis. The material entities we call encyclopedias
            are multiply authored resources for information retrieval that were increasingly
            arranged in alphabetic form and intended for multiple readers. But the more metaphorical
            encyclopedias such as Hegel’s <title level="m">Encyclopedia of the Philosophical
              Sciences</title> (1817-32) or Novalis’ <title level="m">Notes for a Romantic
              Encyclopedia</title> (1798) are singly authored projects that go back to the root
            meaning of the term <foreign>enkyklos paedeia</foreign>, meaning a circle of learning
            that aims, not just at information, but at knowledge to be taken in by a single reader.
            But “metaphorical” is a misnomer, since it was only with Chambers and Diderot that the
            term encyclopedia even came to mean a work of reference rather than a general system of
            education (McArthur 103). Implicit in what I am calling encyclopedics, then, to
            distinguish it from this modern use of the word encyclopedia, is a program of learning
            or <foreign>Bildung</foreign> that occurs through a “cycle” of the sciences, or, as I
            shall argue, the problematizing of such a program.</p>
          <p> This difference occurs across what Derrida calls “philosophical continents”: French
            and British vs. German (“Sendoffs” 243). Though there is a spectral dialogue between
            them, Hegel marks this division when he distinguishes his “philosophical encyclopedia”
            from “ordinary encyclopedias,” which are an “assemblage of sciences” that are often only
            “bits of information” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 53). To elaborate, by the
            eighteenth century encyclopedias were mostly alphabetic, crossing lines with
            dictionaries. Yet from Chambers’ <title level="m">Cyclopedia</title> onwards (1728),
            they evinced anxieties about the empiricism of the alphabet. Thus Chambers expresses
            almost the same concerns as Hegel, when he speaks of the need to dispose “a Variety of
            Materials” so as “not to make a confused Heap of incongruous Parts, but one consistent
            Whole.” This, he says, he attains “by considering the several Matters” both “as so many
            Wholes, and as so many Parts of some greater Whole” linked by a “Reference.” But in a
            version of what would be later known as the hermeneutic circle, where the parts can only
            be known through the whole and vice versa, he also discusses the advantages of a
            dictionary within a system, namely that the former keeps one apprised of the “Pins and
            Joints,” the thousand things we might ignore, which is the only way “the Whole Circle or
            Body of Knowledge can be deliver’d” (i-ii).</p>
          <p> These material encyclopedias, in other words, tried to be both empirical and
            systematic. Indeed “system” is the battle-cry of the <title level="m">Encyclopedia
              Britannica</title> (<title level="m">EB</title>). To be sure, the <title level="m"
              >EB</title> seems to converge with Hegel’s emphasis on disciplines, on gathering up
            all the “philosophical sciences,” since its title page claims that it is conceived on “a
            Plan entirely New” in which the “Sciences and Arts are digested into Distinct Treatises
            or Systems,” with the aim of uniting all the “detached parts” into a “system.” But the
            very word system has undergone a sea-change. The major entries are not always on
            disciplines and are also often on what we might call “practices.” These entries are
            therefore systems in the sense Clifford Siskin uses the word when he describes 1798 as
            “the year of the system” (12). Though internally architectonic in Kant’s terms, they
            exhibit a micro-specialisation in which each discipline or practice has its own system,
            the placing of disciplines and practices on the same surface itself being an example of
            this micro-specialization.</p>
          <p> Material encyclopedias, in other words, are systematic in the sense of containing
            multiple modular systems rather than a total system of knowledge: a model that comes
            back to haunt Hegel and Schelling. Their logics of unification—such as an opening
            diagram of a tree with many branches, or in the case of Chambers, prefatory references
            to a land to be divided up into provinces, a body of knowledge, branches of knowledge,
            and the circle of knowledge (i, vii)– are strictly supplementary. For one thing, minor
            entries are cross-referenced only to the system to which they belong, and there is not
            that much cross-referencing among systems, or if there is, it is strictly indexical and
            not conceptual. And many minor entries also remain undigested into any larger system, so
            that in the end the signifier of totality is simply the material container of the book.
            Indeed, while there is a residual discourse of unity in Chambers, we could argue that by
            the time of the <title level="m">EB,</title> systematicity has come to mean method
            rather than totality. Parts of knowledge are “digested” into systems or treatises: a
            dead metaphor that we will see operating more luridly in Hegel. But these “digests” are
            themselves parts. They are just more comprehensively gathered up than in the growing
            number of periodicals that also provided summaries of books, including foreign books, so
            as to establish a transnational public sphere of communication.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> For instance the <title level="m">Intelligenzblatt Der Jenaischen
                Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</title> (1804-41) provides notices of recent
              publications under a number of disciplinary headings. In addition the 1818 issues of
              this monthly journal, for example, include notices of lecture courses at the
              University of Berlin, lists of books for sale and people who received doctorates. The
              journal is a heterogeneous attempt to cover the sphere of knowledge. In Britain the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</title> has a section on
              “Scientific Intelligence” arranged under various areas.The short-lived <title
                level="m">German Museum</title> (1800-1) reviews new publications in Germany, and
              then has a Supplement broken down into different subject areas.</note></p>
          <p> In fact, more than Chambers and his early modern precursors such as Vincent of
            Beauvais, who still pay lip-service to the circle or course of knowledge, the <title
              level="m">EB</title> stands on the cusp of a transition from encyclopedic knowledge to
            information, already confessing that there “is some inconvenience in ... perusing a
            whole system when we only want to consult a particular topic” (<emph>2<hi rend="sup"
                >nd</hi> ed.</emph> iv). Or as Tom MacArthur puts it, certain kinds of data –
            existing in catalogues, directories, dictionaries etc.—are better off outside the brain:
            just as we do with things, so too we can put “mental objects in the equivalent of bags"
            and carry them around. (7). While information is nothing new, what we do see in material
            encyclopedias is a shift in sensibility wherein by our own time, the modular,
            informational model will extend to the whole of knowledge, the very re-purposing of the
            word encyclopedia being a symptom of this shift.</p>

          <p> It is in this environment that Hegel undertakes his “philosophical” as opposed to
            “ordinary” encyclopedia,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I capitalize Hegel’s
              Encyclopedia only when referring to the work that consists of the <title level="m"

                >Philosophy of Mind</title>. The Encyclopedia project itself is much larger,
              including lectures on aesthetics and on religion edited and published by Hegel’s
              students. Hegel published very little: among his well-known texts, only the <title
                level="m">Phenomenology</title> (1807), <title level="m">The Science of Logic
              </title>(1812, 1813, 1816), the <title level="m">Philosophy of Right</title> (1821),
              and the Heidelberg <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> (1817) and Berlin <title
                level="m">Encyclopedia</title> (1827/30), which are outlines. Hegel’s many lecture
              courses are subsystems that develop parts of the macrosystem that exists in outline,
              and which he began to conceptualize well before 1817, in his earlier Jena system,
              which he also did not publish. Even the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
              as it comes down to us is an eclectic text, consisting of those parts of the outline
              that pertain to nature, with <title level="m">Zusätze</title> or expansions added by
              K.L. Michelet from notes by Hegel’s students. We should not dismiss these eclectic
              texts or <title level="m">Zusätze</title> as not truly Hegel’s simply because he did
              not publish them: this is to be bound by notions of final authorial intention that are
              fundamentally not Romantic. Hegel did not publish his lectures because his living
              system had to be endlessly annotated, expanded, qualified, and complicated: because he
              was not the closed thinker posited by Derrida (<title level="m">Glas</title>, <title
                level="a">The Age of Hegel</title>) and Hamacher. The format of the <title level="m"
                >Zusatz</title> is brilliantly addressed by Jean-Luc Nancy in <title level="m">The
                Speculative Remark</title>. We should note, and indeed insist, that the <title
                level="m">Zusatz</title> or supplement is also intrinsic to the kind of “system”
              represented by an encyclopedia. </note> and that Friedrich Schlegel says that the
            “encyclopedia of the French is totally a wrong tendency –whereas this project is native
            to Germany” (qd. Behler 284). Not that there were no ordinary encyclopedias in Germany,
            but the argument here is for an Idealist and/or Romantic rather than empiricist or
            technological encyclopedia like Diderot and d’Alembert’s <title level="m"
              >Encyclopédie</title>. Thus Hegel’s aim, and less systematically Schelling’s in his
            lectures on <title level="m">University Studies</title>, is both to preserve the
            coherence of a circle or cycle of disciplines and to expand the provenance of philosophy
            beyond Kant’s politically cautious limitation of it to a lower faculty (<title level="m"
              >Conflict</title> 43-58). It is to bring “Idealism ... into all the sciences,” as
            Schelling puts it (<title level="m">World-Soul</title> 94). With that in mind, while
            expanding the reach of philosophy to the life sciences, aesthetics etc., Hegel also
            strictly limits himself to “philosophical sciences,” participating in a tradition that
            goes back to Christian Wolff’s division of philosophical from historical or empirical
            knowledge, and forward to Husserl’s narrower distinction between “eidetic” and “factual”
            sciences ( Husserl, <title level="m">Ideas</title> 62-4). Hegel does include sciences
            such as aesthetics “that exist for themselves outside of philosophy in general,” but
            have a “rational basis” which also allows them to be treated philosophically (<title
              level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 53). But he excludes “pseudosciences” such as heraldry
            that are “thoroughly positive” (53): a dig at British encyclopedias that include this
            topic, in one case as a way of securing commercial patronage. </p>
          <p> Most of all Hegel is concerned to protect “philosophy” from the “English” confusion of
            it with “experimental physics” (or natural philosophy), so that “electrical machines ...
            pumps and the like are called philosophical instruments” (<title level="m"
              >Encyclopedia</title> 49)– a use of “philosophy” that we do indeed find in British
            scientific journals at the time. Reading all knowledge that matters through philosophy,
            Hegel’s system therefore strives to be a totality. This is to say that Hegel does not
            conceive his Encyclopedia as a multi-use resource but as an integrated system of
            knowledge, in which ‘system’ is tied up with the seriousness of knowledge and the
            education (“Bildung”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miller sometimes translates the
              word <foreign>Bildung</foreign> as “culture” and sometimes as “education” (<title
                level="m">Phenomenology</title> 8, 16; <title level="m">Phänomenologie </title>18,
              28). In addition to its associations with Blumenbach’s <title level="m"
                >Bildungstrieb</title>, the German word is also connected with
                <foreign>Bild</foreign> (picture or image), the word Hegel uses at the end of the
              text to describe Spirit as having traversed a “gallery of images” in its education. It
              is therefore unfortunate that at the end of the text, where Hegel couples <title
                level="m">Bild</title> with <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, Miller does not translate
              the word at all (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 428; <title level="m"
                >Phänomenologie 566).</title></note>) of self-consciousness as spirit, what Derrida
            calls an auto- and onto-encyclopedia of spirit (“Age of Hegel” 148). Hence the constant
            emphasis on system, in Hegel’s insistence that knowledge can only be “expounded as ...
            system” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 13-14), and in Schelling’s constant
            search for a system and his unworking of his various systems. Hence also Hegel’s
            narrativizing of system as something more than merely structural, when he divides his
              <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> into three parts that take the form of a journey
            or phenomenology of consciousness: “1) logic, the science of the idea in and for itself;
            2) the philosophy of nature, as the science of the idea in its otherness; 3) the
            philosophy of spirit, the science of the idea as it returns to itself from its
            otherness” (54). But needless to say this travel outwards to the margins of philosophy,
            in Hegel’s increasingly complex and multicomponent system, will result in multiple
            infractions from these margins that threaten philosophy’s systematic self-concept.</p>
          <p> Underpinning Hegel’s conception of system according to a <foreign>pars pro toto logic
              </foreign>(<title level="m">Encylopedia</title> 51) is Kant’s notion of architectonic,
            introduced as early as the lectures on <title level="m">Physical Geography</title>,
            where it is connected to the idea of the encyclopedia. Here Kant writes that we “need to
            become acquainted with the objects of our experience <hi rend="bold">as a whole</hi>,”
            so that our knowledge will form “not an <hi rend="bold">aggregation</hi> but a <hi
              rend="bold">system</hi>; for in a system the <hi rend="bold">whole</hi> is prior to
            the parts, while in an aggregation the <hi rend="bold">parts</hi> have priority” (446).
            In the first <title level="m">Critique</title> Kant further develops this concept of
            “architectonic,” repeating his distinction between system/science and aggregates. System
            is not just method, but the “unity of the manifold cognitions under one idea,” within a
            whole in which “the position of the parts with respect to each other is determined
              <foreign>a priori</foreign>.” Kant’s image for this whole from which parts cannot be
            “contingent[ly]” added or subtracted is the body, a figure to which we will return
            (691). But suffice it to say that Kant’s notion of the body is essentially aesthetic,
            where aesthetics, in Baumgarten’s terms, is “ars pulchre cogitandi,” the art of thinking
            beautifully (#533). This is to say that Kant’s notion of system differs from Hegel’s in
            being purely spatial, diagrammatic. As such it is a “schema” (<title level="m"
              >Reason</title> 691), and in the schematic mode, as Schelling says, the universal has
            not been unified with the particular; the schema is only a “rule” governing production
              (<title level="m">Philosophy of Art</title> 46-7). Kant’s spatial, synchronic
            conception of the body, and the fact that he operates within Baumgarten’s idea of
            “aesthetics as “the analogy of reason” and a supplement to logic, results in a smooth
            system, securely –even if only from a transcendental perspective– under the governance
            of philosophy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Unlike Husserl, who continues the
              German Idealist tradition of separating transcendental from empirical (or eidetic from
              factual) sciences, Kant is not driven by a passion to eradicate the “natural
              standpoint.” It simply does not fall within his domain, and when he deals with
              empirical matters such as universal history or perpetual peace, his concern is how to
              use the critical apparatus so as to think about these domains.</note></p>
          <p> The terms smooth and tangled are Bruno Latour’s version of Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s
            closed vs. open systems, which I extend here to the architecture of knowledge. Objects
            that we <emph>understand</emph> smoothly have defined boundaries: we grasp them
            separately, and changes in them are accidents that do not affect their substance.
            Tangled objects are affected by neighbouring objects and unwork, destabilize and rework
            knowledge (Latour 20-3). While Kant’s work was not restricted to philosophy – he also
            lectured on anthropology and geography – he always begins by mapping the space of
            knowledge and delimiting the place of a field within it. Within a larger architectonic
            that Kant (unlike his successors) did not presume to construct, “the position of the
            parts” or individual disciplines “with respect to each other” is “determined <foreign>a
              priori</foreign>” by philosophy (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691). More
            specifically, “every science [has] its determinate position in the encyclopedia of the
            sciences” and if “it is a philosophical science, then we must assign it its position in
            either its theoretical or its practical part” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 285).
            As Kant zooms in to a particular zone of the map, the smoothness of this distinction is
            maintained, and the margins of philosophy are given their <foreign>a priori</foreign>
            location. So for instance, in the lectures on <title level="m">Physical
              Geography</title>, Kant first evokes the larger map, and divides knowledge into the
            rational and empirical. And he then divides the latter into knowledge of the internal or
            the soul and knowledge of the external, the second being subdivided into knowledge of
            man or the world and knowledge of nature. The former is anthropology and is pragmatic
            rather than speculative, and the latter is physical geography (445-6).</p>
          <p> Following this rational/empirical division, Kant is also careful to delimit philosophy
            and not to hybridize it, even though the reality of his circumstances was that he had to
            teach outside philosophy, which had not yet institutionally become a
              <foreign>Fachwissenschaft</foreign> (or special subject). Thus even in the
            pre-Critical phase, his lectures on the Encyclopedia which he gave ten times between
            1767 and 1782, really deal only with the encyclopedia of philosophy, and unlike Hegel’s
              <title level="m">History of Philosophy</title>, which entangles philosophy with its
            history, they do so from a purely transcendental perspective.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> See Zammito (286-92) on the course entitled “Encyclopedia of
              Philosophy as a Whole with an abridged History of Philosophy Based on Feder’s Sketch.”
              Zammito speculates that there was more of this course than survives in printed form,
              and mentions that the Encyclopedia lectures were bound (by a buyer) with those on
              physical geography and physics (287). He thus argues for a closer connection of this
              course to the work of the <title level="m">Popularphilosoph</title> Johann Feder than
              seems warranted by the <title level="m">Enzyklopädievorlesung</title> published by
              Gerhard Lehmann, and this in turn is because he follows a division between the
              pre-Critical and Critical Kant, and sees the former, prior to the break with Herder,
              as still allied with “anthropology.” But as noted by Louden (434), Kant was required
              to use a textbook for his courses and generally paid little attention to his chosen
              text. Feder probably played this role in the Encyclopedia course, while Kant’s own
              contribution to the course is the <title level="m">Enzyklopädievorlesung</title>
              printed by Lehmann. In other words, while Kant may have been aware that one could
              think of the “encyclopedia” in a broader (mixed empirical and transcendental) sense,
              his own treatment of areas other than philosophy such as Anthropology and Physical
              Geography was consistent with the architectonic mapped out in the first <title
                level="m">Critique</title>, which rigorously separates the “rational” from the
              “empirical” parts of disciplines.</note> Kant begins by distinguishing historical
            sciences, which are forms of learnedness, from rational sciences which are sciences of
            insight, and he then subdivides the latter into philosophy as a discursive science and
            mathematics as a science of construction. As an encyclopedia in the sense of a digest or
            “kurzer Auszug” of philosophy (<title level="m">Vorlesung</title> 31-2), the lectures
            then sketch the principles of what would become Kant’s critical philosophy. In other
            words Kant’s sense of system, whether it is the total system of knowledge or the system
            of an individual part, is of a structure laid out in a “striated” or divisible space,
            and then partitioned according to an <foreign>a priori</foreign> logic. He therefore
            conceives the totality of knowledge as a smooth rather than tangled system, in which the
            parts may be thought through analogy but are always kept firmly separate and do not
            bleed into one another. For Kant there are no mixtures or “intersciences,” as Derrida
            calls them, and no new forms of thought that emerge in the interstices between existing
            fields. As he says quite definitely, “no science can belong to the transition” from one
            domain to the other “since that signifies only the articulation or organization of the
            system and not a place within it” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 285).</p>
          <p> In his early lectures on <title level="m">University Studies</title>, Schelling also
            uses the figure of the body to think the system of knowledge synchronically, but with a
            crucial difference. Drawing on a Spinozist vocabulary of emanations from or modes of a
            single substance, Schelling describes how all knowledge, “flow[s] from a single centre”:
            “Those sciences which reflect primordial knowledge most directly ... are ... the
            sensorium of the organic body of knowledge. We must start from the central organs and
            trace the life that flows from them through various channels to the outermost parts”
            (42). But as mystical as this articulation of the body is, and as close as it remains to
            what Deleuze calls the “organism” as distinct from the decentralized “body without
            organs” (44-8), Schelling does not conceive the body architectonically as a striated
            space, but rather in terms of flows. We will return to this metaphor of “fluidity” in
            both Schelling and Hegel. Suffice it to say that Schelling conceives the space of
            knowledge as “smooth” in Deleuze and Guattari’s very particular sense of that term,
            which is virtually the opposite of Latour’s. Both usages valorize open over closed
            systems. But while Latour defines smooth objects as bounded and divided off, Deleuze and
            Guattari oppose an open space that they call “smooth” to a more conventional “striated”
            space, which is divisible, segmented and thus bounded (<title level="m">Thousand
              Plateaus</title> 361-2). Schelling, we could say, wants to have both kinds of
            smoothness. He wants a system that is open and not inorganically divided up. And yet he
            also wants one that is smooth in the sense of being a totality, which is impossible, as
            is evident when he writes about the world of nature, whose tangled systems
            transferentially affect the way system itself is conceived.</p>
          <p> For purposes of this paper, I will not take up Schelling except as a dialogical gloss
            on Hegel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> But for further discussion of Schelling see
              my articles “First Outline of a System of Theory” and “The Abyss of the Past.”</note>
            For even during the period that saw the publication of his most idealistic work,
            including <title level="m">On University Studies</title> (1803) and The Philosophy of
            Art (1803/4), Schelling already recognized system as perspectival, constructing several
            systems: a <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title> (1800), but on the
            other hand numerous systems of nature. Indeed the experimentalism of these systems can
            be seen in the fact that Schelling uses, almost interchangeably, the words “system,”
            “first outline [<title level="m">Entwurf</title>]” “ideas for” and “introduction” to a
            philosophy of nature, which he may or may not be able to bring into identity with
            transcendental philosophy so as to create a system of the whole. This <title level="m"
              >Naturphilosophie</title>, in turn, is sometimes focalized through physics and
            chemistry, as in <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature </title>(1797/1803).
            But sometimes it is focused through the life sciences, with physics and chemistry being
            part of the life sciences rather than the hard sciences, as in <title level="m">First
              Outline for a System of the Philosophy of Nature</title> (1799), which itself is nit
            one but several “systems.” Even from the beginning, then, and despite the smooth system
            he articulates in <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, Schelling’s practice
            is always mobilized by what he calls “asystasy.” As he later says in “On the Nature of
            Philosophy as Science” (1821), “the idea of finding a system of human knowledge, or ...
            of contemplating human knowledge within a system, within a form of coexistence,
            presupposes, of course, that originally and of itself it does not exist in a system,
            hence that it is an ... [<emph>asystaton</emph>], ... something that is in inner
            conflict” (210).</p>
          <p> Leaving aside Schelling, then, I focus on Hegel, who wants to construct a
            comprehensive, complexly articulated architecture of knowledge rather than a “rhapsody”
            (Kant, <title level="m">Reason </title>691). According to Karl Rosenkranz, during the
            early Jena years when many of the elements of the encylopedia were introduced and when
            Schelling (or one side of him) was still committed to the Identity Philosophy, Schelling
            worked out the critical foundations of absolute philosophy in synchronic fashion, while
            Hegel set to work developing it as a “cycle of sciences” (qtd. by Vater 82). Yet the
            cycle is not necessarily the circle, and Hegel’s multiple, supplementary figures for his
            system compromise its smooth ambitions by entangling the architectonic within the
            temporal and the body within its organic complexities. This paper will explore three
            such figures: the line, the circle, and the body. Together they bring Hegel closer to,
            and yet mark his difference from, another idea of the encyclopedia which forms part of
            the contemporary context of Hegel’s project, but is at the opposite extreme from Kant’s
            architectonic: Novalis’ “encyclopedistics.” </p>
          <p> In Novalis’ <title level="m">Notes for a Romantic Encyclopedia</title> (1798), which
            despite its organization in fragments has its own systematic principles, the units of
            the system are also emergent disciplines and fields. But the relations of parts and
            whole are tangled and rhizomatic, not hierarchical and smooth. The whole cannot
            determine the part as in architectonic; but unlike in an aggregative system, the part
            does not remain finite and in its own sphere, as it possesses generative consequences
            for the whole of knowledge. “Application of the system to the parts,” Novalis writes,
            “and the parts to the <emph>system</emph> and the parts to the parts” (#460).</p>
          <p> For Novalis, then, the Encyclopedia is not an organization of knowledge but an
              <emph>asystaton</emph> that is a thought-environment for mixtures. Mixtures were
            anathema to Kant, who felt that each science should be placed in “a special system so
            that it constitutes a science of its own kind, in order to guard against the uncertainty
            arising from mixing things together” (<title level="m">Metaphysical Foundations</title>,
            9). Indeed Kant even proposes disentangling troublesome subsystems from the whole so as
            to purify them and then reinsert them into the whole (12-13). But as Walter Moser says,
            “mixture” was one of the key concepts in chemistry at the time, and chemistry occupied a
            privileged position among the early Romantics “as a discourse model that becomes the
            source” of “interdiscursive translation” (16, 6). This translation, in turn, realizes
            the creative, and not simply critical, potential of a tangled system. And what Novalis
            provides is a toolkit for such translation that involves “potentiation” and
            “application” as related procedures in the “encyclopedization of a science” (Novalis
            genuine raising to a higher power, every science can pass over into a higher
            philosophical science” (Novalis #487). It is application, however, that allows for the
            creation of a new science out of an already existing one (Moser 13), for instance
            psychopathology or psychoanalysis out of pathology, as we shall see. The goal of
            encyclopedic education is the “encyclopedization of a science” that occurs when the
            analogical implications of a science or even a “molecule of science” are potentiated so
            that the empirical, instead of being determined by the transcendental, retroacts upon it
            (Novalis #161, #489). The key here is analogy as a constitutive and not just the
            regulative procedure it is in Kant. “A science becomes applied,” according to Novalis,
            “if it serves as the analogous model and stimulus” for the development of another
            science, a process that is reciprocal, because it is also “the self-(post) development”
            of this other science (#487). To be sure, mixtures were not the goal from which Hegel
            started. But his system, unfolding philosophy through a series of histories and
            attempting to wrest the transcendental from the empirical, is nothing if not mixed.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head>Circles Within Circles</head>
          <p> Let us turn, then, to Hegel’s figures for system. The most prominent is the circle,
            which goes back to the root meaning of <foreign>enkyklos paideia</foreign>, and which he
            defines through its radii “as that which takes account of the difference within it and
            so reaches a complete determinateness” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 33). One might
            think of the circle as a smooth structure. Yet this is no ordinary circle. The
            philosophical encyclopedia consists of parts, each of which “is a circle of totality
            containing itself within itself, “ though the “philosophical idea is also within each
            particular determinacy or element. ” “The circle of Nature” is thus only one circle in
            Philosophy. The whole is then “a circle of circles” (<title level="m"
              >Encyclopedia</title> 51; <title level="m">Nature</title> 2): an immensely complicated
            structure like Milton’s cosmos: “Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb” (<title level="m"
              >Paradise Lost</title> VIII.84).</p>
          <p> The image of circles within circles differs from the smoother image of the building or
            group of buildings that Kant, despite conceiving the whole as a “body” (<title level="m"
              >Reason</title> 691), also uses for knowledge. For Kant “every science is of itself a
            system” and though we may move from one building to another each is a “freestanding
            building” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 252-3). Hegel’s figure, by contrast, has
            several hazards. First, while the circle is a figure of self-enclosure and containment,
            he sees <emph>as a breach</emph> the proceeding of one circle into another, which in
            more modern terms is the process of mediation or “the adapting ... of findings from one
            level to another” (Jameson 39-40). Hegel writes: “The individual circle thus ruptures
            itself because it is in itself a totality, it breaks through the limits of its own
            elements and establishes another sphere” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 51).
            Although the circle of circles is meant to contain multiplicity in unity, what Hegel
            describes here is an exceeding of containment. To be sure, this is in one sense the
            famous procedure of <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> or sublation. Hegel annotates this
            process further, when he says that sciences which are <emph>not</emph> positive
            “recognize their concepts as finite,” thus undergoing “a transition into a higher
            sphere” (54). A rupture, however, is also an infraction, a breaking of one circle into
            another, or rather of both into each other. Elsewhere I have described one such instance
            of mediation in the last section of the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature,</title>
            where Hegel projects his own three-part dialectic onto the physiological schema of
            sensibility, irritability and reproduction that was common at the time (Rajan
            “(In)Digestible Material”). Reading physiological processes in philosophical language,
            Hegel produces a psychosomatics of Spirit that is both a psychoanalysis in embryo and
            one of the new disciplines that Novalis was fond of imagining: “pathological philosophy”
              (#638).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As always, Novalis provides little
              elaboration, but pathological philosophy seems to be a philosophy open to failure: “An
              absolute drive for perfection and completeness is morbid, as soon as it shows itself
              to be destructive and adverse to what is <emph>imperfect</emph>, and
              incomplete.”</note></p>
          <p> As this example indicates, there is no guarantee that the breaking of the circle, the
            transition from one domain to another that Kant sees as incidental, is a transition into
            a <emph>higher</emph> sphere. The emergence of psychoanalysis from philosophy’s bringing
            of “Idealism” into the science of medicine is a transformative breaking of the circles
            of both empirical medicine and philosophy itself. It occurs precisely through
            potentiation: the elevation of physiology and medicine from empirical into philosophical
            sciences. And it also occurs through analogy: the analogical application of philosophy
            to physiology, which produces a new science through what Novalis calls
            “encyclopedization.” But this transition of one sphere into another establishes
            “another” and not a “higher” sphere. Indeed, rather than following an <foreign>a
              priori</foreign> logic, there is something of the accidental about it. And moreover it
            moves in more than one direction, inasmuch as physiology can also be analogically
            applied to philosophy to produce pathological philosophy, resulting in “the self-(post)
            development” of philosophy (Novalis #487). No doubt this is not exactly an accident
            Hegel wanted. Hence he must, so to speak, burn his work, so that “like the phoenix”
            Nature can “come forth from this externality rejuvenated as Spirit” and “reconcile
            itself with itself” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 444). But then Hegel also embraces
            such accidents, which are built into his seeing “substance as subject” and therefore,
            crucially, as “negativity.”As he writes in the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>:
            “The circle that remains self-enclosed and, like substance, holds its moments together,
            is an immediate relationship, one therefore which has nothing astonishing about it. But
            that an accident as such, detached from what circumscribes it, ... should attain an
            existence of its own and a separate freedom –this is the tremendous power of the
            negative” (10, 18-19).</p>
          <p> Related to the “proceeding” of one circle into another is a further problem, which is
            the entanglement of micro and macrosystems. Where material encyclopedias move from the
            bottom up, trying to fit individual systems into a system of the whole which never
            really overcomes the empiricism of aggregation, Idealism starts deductively with a whole
            into which the parts are supposedly fitted. Nevertheless, Hegel includes many of the
            minute details we might expect to find in material encyclopedias: discussions of
            meteors, limestone, lizards, and experiments in natural philosophy that show his
            familiarity with British journals of the time. The sheer complexity of Hegel’s system
            results in a disseminative multiplication of the parts within the whole.<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> Arkady Plotnitsky also takes up this complexity in terms
              of Deleuze’s concept of the baroque: a “defining feature of the Baroque is the
              multiplicity of varying and curved –convex and concave– mirrors .... Baroque houses
              are full of mirrors and seem to need mirrors more than windows” (Plotnitsky 120). But
              while also reading Hegel against the grain and emphasizing the complexity of the folds
              within what he calls his “superfold” (121), Plotnitsky sees the totality of Hegel’s
              work as a “divergent harmony” (132) in which the “upward movement of Spirit and
              humanity,” albeit in “diagonal” form (127), is not jeopardized.</note> Moreover,
            circles become “spheres,” a word that Hegel uses to describe both concepts like
            existence and negativity and fields of knowledge such as physics and mechanics. Spheres
            are not quite circles: whereas the circle is a two-dimensional schema, the sphere has a
            volume and “mass” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 79), which Hegel must struggle to
            keep under control. Thus as M.J. Petry explains, the “spheres” are supposed to be
            “levels” in a “hierarchy” which is like the Chain of Being (21-39). The “sphere of
            physics” is part of the “sphere of Nature” (Hegel, <title level="m">Nature</title> 26,
            23), and “each sphere ... complete[s] itself by passing into another higher one” (21), a
            logic Hegel evokes in the “transition” from Nature to Spirit at the end of the <title
              level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> (445). But this logic of subsumption can
            equally be one of complication, in which the levels risk becoming spheres in their own
            right. For as Schelling says, using the same term as Hegel, within each “determinate
            sphere of formation” “other spheres are again formed, and in these spheres others”
              (<title level="m">First Outline</title> 43-4). The result is intimated by Goethe, when
            he says that sciences “destroy themselves in two ways: by the breadth they reach and by
            the depth they plumb” (305).</p>
          <p> The logic is that of Leibniz’ <title level="m">Monadology</title>, adapted by
            Schelling in <title level="m">The First Outline</title> into a “dynamic atomism” (21)
            that doubles as a physics of knowledge. For Leibniz the monad is both a simple unity and
            is infinitely subdivisible into further monads. Kant resolved this paradox by arguing
            that monads are not to be conceived as physically filling a space but rather as spheres
            or “orbits of activity”: it is thus not the actual substance of the monad but its sphere
            of activity that is infinitely divided (<title level="m">Physical Monadology</title>
              53-7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a helpful discussion of this issue, see
              Michael Friedman, <title level="m">Introduction</title> to <title level="m">Kant’s
                Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</title>, vii-x.</note> Ideally for Hegel
            these multiple monads or spheres will be unified by the fiction of their
            “pre-established harmony”; thus for Leibniz individual monads, though self-contained,
            are all supposedly comprehended in the supreme Monad which is God (or absolute
            knowledge). But inversely, as Schelling recognizes, these monads, which externally
            appear as simple unities, are infinitely subdivisible into further and further monads,
            each with its own life (Leibniz 261, 266, 268).</p>
          <p> Thus even as Hegel’s macrosystems (of nature, art etc.) are compounded into ever
            larger unities, they are also infinitely particularized into microsystems with their own
            logic and so are complexly self-differing. In this way the sphere of “Organics” in the
              <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> is subdivided into the geological,
            vegetable and animal organisms, which can be placed in a hierarchy, but between which
            there are also rhizomatic connections. The animal organism is studied in terms of the
            sphere of physiology, which contains the sphere of pathology, which is inapplicable to
            the geological organism and unique to the animal (429). British Idealism is in many ways
            less tangled than its German parent, and thinkers such as Erasmus Darwin, John
            Abernethy, Joseph Henry Green, and (less successfully) Coleridge, contained pathology
            within physiology as a negative illustration of the laws of normal life, with the
            understanding that these laws could be better understood through deviations from them.
            But while this may also be Hegel’s aim, Hegel never returns from the pathological to the
            normal, as <title level="m">The Philosophy of Nature</title> ends with a section
            entitled “The Disease of the Individual” that derails the intended transition from
            Nature to Spirit. This last section becomes an accident detached from what circumscribes
            it, but one that affects the substance of Hegel’s thought precisely because that
            substance is actualized through a subject. The problem confronting Hegel is not unlike
            the dis-integration of the macro- by the micropedia in the work of his materialist
            rivals. But it has this difference, that the connections or disconnections that remain
            external in material encyclopedias are internalized as part of self-consciousness in
            encyclopedics, or perhaps, internalized as part of the text’s unconscious.</p>

          <head>The Endangered Line</head>
          <p> This brings us to the next problem, the entanglement of the of the circle and line.
            The encyclopedia is not just a spatial curriculum that one traverses from the outside,
            but a process of <title level="m">Bildung</title> or inner development. It is a “path”
            the “<emph>length</emph>” of which “has to be endured,” since knowledge is “a necessary
            and complete process of becoming” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 17, 20). Hegel
            criticized Schelling for being insufficiently dialectical (<title level="m">History of
              Philosophy</title> III. 334, 341-3), and by dialectic he did not simply mean a form of
            argumentation but a profoundly temporal experience: a process of remembering and working
            through, of engaging the ideal with the real, and a transposition of the philosophical
            into the historical. Unlike the Schelling of <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of
              Nature</title> (1797/1803), <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title>
            (1800), <title level="m">Bruno</title> (1802), and <title level="m">On University
              Studies</title>, (1803), Hegel could not conceive of the eternal and temporal or the
            ideal and real as synchronic, in the manner of Blake’s fourfold vision.<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of
                Nature</title> (1797/1803) Schelling writes: “In Nature, therefore, the whole
              absolute is knowable, although appearing Nature produces only successively, and in
              (for us) endless development, what in true Nature exists all at once and in an eternal
              fashion” (272).</note> Thus to a degree Hegel’s distinction between the sciences of
            nature and spirit corresponds to Schelling’s distinction between the real (or life)
            sciences and the ideal sciences such as philosophy, mathematics, and religion (<title
              level="m">University Studies</title> 103-4). But for Hegel, as for the post-Jena
            Schelling of the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay (1809), the emergence of freedom
            from necessity must be earned through the struggle of nature to become spirit, which
            occurs along a “path,” “road” or temporal line.</p>
          <p> This struggle is not only thematized through what Findlay calls the “dialectical
              <emph>journey</emph>” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 528); it also provides
            the structure for Hegel’s organization of knowledge. For if the eighteenth century sees
            a “temporalizing of the Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 242-3, 271-80), Hegel also temporalizes
            the cycle of disciplines along this evolutionary Chain of Being.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> We should bear in mind that for Hegel evolution, as the emergence of
              one natural form from another, is not an actual series of events but a series of
              “ideal” relationships (<title level="m">Nature</title> 20-1)</note> Thus the third
            section of the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> takes in geology,
            meteorology, botany, physiology and medicine, among others. These sciences are part of
            the broader system of “Organics,” which is preceded by mechanics and physics. The three
            together comprise the sphere of Nature, which is a sphere in a scale of disciplines that
            parallels the Chain of Being, since their subject-matter proceeds from the inorganic to
            the organic, and from lower to higher organizations along this chain. The <title
              level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, in turn, is a level that is surpassed by the
            sciences of Spirit. Altogether the cycle of learning in which consciousness learns how
            to become Spirit unfolds as an ascent from matter to Spirit, or necessity to freedom,
            through the progression from the real to the ideal sciences. Indeed “Nature” herself
            learns to be Spirit by proceeding through the phenomena, from molluscs to animals, that
            are the objects of the various sciences. Here Hegel is totally unlike the Schelling of
            the lectures <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, whose arrangement of
            chapters on disciplines is random rather than following a thematic progression anchored
            in the development of a subject.</p>
          <p> Not that there are no other systems which thematize a progressing ‘line’ of knowledge,
            for instance that projected by Coleridge, consisting of Logic, Natural [Philosophy] and
            Theology" (<title level="m">Notebooks</title> #5417). Indeed, working to put the
            ever-troublesome life sciences in their <foreign>a priori</foreign> place within this
            architectonic of knowledge, his friend and executor Joseph Henry Green more clearly
            executes Coleridge’s project of absorbing physiological into political “constitution,”
            or Nature into Spirit, by following <title level="m">Vital Dynamics</title> (1840) with
              <title level="m">Mental Dynamics or Groundwork of a Professional Education</title>
            (1847) and then <title level="m">Spiritual Philosophy</title> (1865), as a means to the
              <title level="m">Bildung</title> of Coleridge’s “clerisy.” Green, though more immersed
            in Schelling, had read some Hegel and studied with Solger in Berlin in 1817, the year
            Solger helped to bring Hegel to the University of Berlin. Nevertheless it is only Hegel
            who traverses this “road” as a “pathway of <emph>doubt</emph>” (<title level="m"
              >Phenomenology</title> 49), in which the sciences are not analytic systems but
            phenomenological expressions of what, in an almost fantastical prosopopeia, he calls
            “Nature’s” struggle to become Spirit. Thus, even if against their grain, the sciences
            form what Novalis calls a “pathological philosophy” in which each science is profoundly
            lacking, and must “shatter” the “inadequate form” of its “circle,” only to expose its
            own inadequacy (<title level="m">Nature</title> 443).</p>
          <p> So as Nature, in Hegel’s personification or self-projection, struggles for
            self-consciousness, consciousness too is exposed to its human nature in the shapes or
              <foreign>Gestaltungen</foreign> (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 9) that it
            gives itself in its sciences. Hence the line that Hegel wants to organize smoothly
            within the synthetic paradigm of the dialectic is beset by accidents that disclose the
            “tremendous power of the negative.” Indeed this “road,” which he calls an “inwardizing
              [<foreign>Er-Innerung</foreign>] and Calvary” of Spirit (<title level="m"
              >Phenomenology</title> 51, 493), is littered with such accidents, which Hegel, after
            “tarrying” with the “negative” (19), tries unconvincingly to elide through various
            figural somersaults. For instance as the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
            disastrously concludes with <title level="a">The Disease of the Individual,</title>
            Hegel claims that the “goal of Nature,” mired as it is in “an ever-increasing wealth of
            detail,” is to “destroy itself ... to consume itself like the phoenix in order to come
            forth from this externality rejuvenated as spirit” (444). Similarly at the end of the
              <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, almost all of which is about how this discipline
            of thinking beautifully falls afoul of the actual history of art, Hegel famously
            proclaims the end of art. The circle is likewise one of these figures that tries to
            perform what the Idea and the Concept cannot do. The circle is “the line returning into
            itself” and the “paralysis” of the dimensions of time such that present, past and future
            are “closed together in a unity,” their distinctions “sublated” (<title level="m"
              >Nature</title> 43-4). It is “the path of a <emph>purely uniform</emph> motion” (70).
            In the closure of the circle the point “has been already at the place it is reaching”
            (43-4); the “end” is already in the “beginning” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title>
            10).</p>
          <p> Yet this closure of the circle is a form of damage control exerted on the line, path,
            or journey. For the line figures a form of experience in which the immanent unfolding of
            the “Idea” in time and history risks removing the transcendental guarantees that exist
            in the early Schelling’s synchronicity of the eternal and temporal, or “true” and
            “appearing Nature” (<title level="m">Ideas</title> 272). Hence Hegel finds the circle
            limited as well as complete, referring to each circular totalization as an “inadequate
            form” and suggesting that there is something simplistic in the circle that “holds its
            moments together” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 443; <title level="m"
              >Phenomenology</title> 18-19). This is to say that if Hegel needs to repair the line
            with the circle, he conversely needs the line to supply the dialectic, or as Schelling
            will later call it “realism,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the <title level="m"
                >Freedom</title> essay Schelling writes: “Idealism, if it does not have as its basis
              a living realism, becomes just as empty and abstract a system as that of Leibniz,
              Spinoza, or any other dogmatist.... Idealism is the soul of philosophy; realism is the
              body; only both together can constitute a living whole” (26). In <title level="m">Ages
                of the World</title> he writes, “Whoever does not acknowledge the priority of
              Realism wants evolution without the involution that preceded it. ... The greatest
              glory of development is not expected from what easily unfolds. It is expected from
              what has been excluded and which only decides to unfold with opposition (107).</note>
            that is lacking in what Hegel critiques as Absolute Idealism. In the Preface to the
              <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>, which famously caused the rift with Schelling,
            though it also formatively changed Schelling’s work, Hegel calls Absolute Idealism “the
            night in which all cows are black” (9). He describes it as a “monochromatic formalism”
            that ignores “the living Substance” as a “self-originating, self-differentiating wealth
            of shapes” and “begins straight away with absolute knowledge” (9-10, 16). The “long way”
            that Spirit must “travel,” the line as opposed to the circle, figures the process of
            remembering and working through that is the labour of the negative (10, 15).<note

        <div type="section">
          <head>The Nervous Body</head>
          <p> Let us turn now to our final figure, the body which, like the circle, projects a
            system that holds its moments together. Thus in the <title level="m"
              >Phenomenology</title> Hegel writes that Spirit “articulates its body into a variety
            of functions, and allots one particular part for only one function” (197). In the <title
              level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> he echoes Kant’s contrast between knowledge
            that is “heaped together” and knowledge as an “articulated” whole which, like the
            “animal body,” grows “internally” and not “externally” by “contingent addition” (Kant,
              <title level="m">Reason</title> 591). In the same vein of an external and aggregated
            vs. internal and integrated growth, Hegel too argues that plants grow only in size, but
            when the animal increases in size it “remains one shape” (<title level="m"
              >Nature</title> 304).</p>
          <p> Like Kant, then, Hegel wants to conceive the body as a whole that keeps parts in their
            place. Thus implicitly he aligns material encyclopedias with the aggregative structure
            of the vegetable body, while his own philosophical encyclopedia is like the animal body
            that grows internally and retains “one shape.” But does not such a unification become
            coercive when it is extended to the body politic or the body of knowledge? And indeed
            can Hegel uphold his analogy? For Kant’s body, as we have seen, is aesthetic or at best
            anatomical, where anatomy maps the volume of organs on a flat surface. But Hegel is
            sensitive to the difference between structure and process. Describing the “ordinary view
            of anatomy” as “the knowledge of the parts of the body regarded as inanimate,” Hegel
            writes in his “Preface: On Scientific Cognition” that in anatomy we “do not as yet
            possess the subject-matter itself,” since we do not know “the particulars” (<title
              level="m">Phenomenology</title> 1). He later adds that in such a system, “the organism
            is apprehended from the abstract aspect of a dead existence; its moments so taken
            pertain to anatomy and the corpse, not to cognition and the living organism.” “The
            moments have really ceased <emph>to be</emph> for they cease to be processes.” It is
            only within these processes, within their transitions (to pick up the word Kant
            dismisses), that “anatomical parts,” or by analogy disciplines, “have a meaning,” since
            only then can “what is forcibly detached and fixed as an individual system” be returned
            to being a “fluid moment” (166).</p>
          <p> Moreover, unlike Kant, Hegel also writes at length on the real body in the last major
            division of his <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> on “Organics.” And it is
            the physiological and not the anatomical body that he treats, breaking the circle in
            which the earlier Schelling had closed off the dangers of physiology by synchronizing it
            with anatomy (<title level="m">University Studies</title> 141). As we have seen, for
            Hegel the animal body (which includes the human) is distinguished from the plant in
            terms of the unity of the animal as an “organism” vs. the structure of the plant as an
            “aggregate” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 394). Plants grow only in size, whereas
            when the animal increases in size it “remains one shape” (304). Correspondingly plants
            “fall apart” into “a number of individuals, the whole plant being rather the basis
              (<title level="m">Boden</title>) for these individuals than a subjective unity of
            members” (303). The plant “is thus impotent to hold its members in its power” and indeed
            does not have “true members [<title level="m">Gliedern</title>]” (276); or as Hegel says
            elsewhere “every branch is a new plant and not at all ... just a single member” (<title
              level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.137). By contrast, in the animal organism members are
            subordinate to the whole, even as the whole “is articulated into parts that are
              <emph>separate and distinct</emph>,” so that “each member is reciprocally end and
            means” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 303, 377). Yet as a “totality of articulated
            members” (377) that respects differences the animal body is beset by problems, the first
            of which is its multiple, overlapping systems: “three” systems, like the <title
              level="m">Encyclopedia</title> itself, or as Hegel admits, “a good many more” (<title
              level="m">Nature</title> 359; <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 166). While the
            body “contain[s]” these systems, their very unification “produce[s] a general, concrete
            interpenetration” of systems by “one another,” so that a particular system is not
            confined to its place “but permeates all the other systems of the organism” (<title
              level="m">Nature</title> 372; <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 162). The
            relation of parts to the whole here is dangerously close to Novalis’ application of the
            parts to the whole. This is to say that unity itself may be something of a
              <foreign>pharmakon</foreign>, if we allow one system, for instance physiology, to
            affect another, such as the body politic, which is also discussed in terms of the
            biopolitical language of “members.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the <title
                level="m"> Philosophy of Right</title>, “members” are consistently opposed to
              “self-sufficient individuals” or "parts" (64, 199-200, 264, 328; cf. also 315 which
              specifically evokes the animal organism). Members are separate but in the end
              subordinate to a whole.</note></p>
          <p> Indeed Schelling emphasizes precisely such “accidents”that occur through integration
            in a body, when he uses the body as a figure for complex systems. Schelling writes that
            the body contains multiple systems (“digestive etc.”), and favourably contrasts this
            tangled body to Kant’s use of geometry as a model for philosophy: “It is as though one
            preferred a stereometrically regular crystal to the human body for the reason that the
            former has no possibility of falling ill, while the latter hosts germs of every possible
            illness” ( “On the Nature of Philosophy” 212-13). Working out of the same speculative
            image cluster in which “a system or organ” establishing itself in “isolation” is
            condemned as disease (Hegel, <title level="m">Nature</title> 428), Schelling had already
            attributed a positive value to disease in the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay
            (1809): “An individual body part [<title level="m">Glied</title>], like the eye, is only
            possible within the whole of an organism; nonetheless, it has its own life for itself,
            indeed, its own kind of freedom, which it obviously proves through the disease of which
            it is capable” (18). But if it is Schelling who ambivalently valorizes this separateness
            as freedom, it is Hegel who allows, through his concept of “fluidity,” for the obstinacy
            of the part to have consequences for the whole.</p>
          <p> While there is no space here for an extensive reading of the section on the “Animal
            Organism,” suffice it to say that just as Schelling’s dynamic atomism doubles as a
            physics of knowledge, so too Hegel’s discussions of the body double as a physiology, or
            indeed pathography, of the “full body of articulated cognition” (<title level="m"
              >Phenomenology</title> 9).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The “body” of cognition
              is the metaphor of Hegel’s translator A.V.Miller, but is in the spirit of Hegel, who
              does begin his Preface by using anatomy to think about the nature of knowledge. Green
              Musselman uses the term “pathography” to describe “autobiographical memoirs written by
              modern-day physicians who suffer an illness” (6).</note> This is all the more so given
            the use of the word “systems” throughout the section on the body, and given that the
            same words and concepts are often used both in the epistemic and physiological
            registers. Thus the aggregate and the organism describe plants vs. animals but also the
            form that Hegel wants a science to take: it “must present itself as an organism” rather
            than being “a simple aggregate” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 6). Indeed, it is
            because of his investment in organic, inward knowledge with deep rather than surface,
            metamorphic connections that Hegel thinks poorly of plants. In a similar mirroring of
            the literal and metaphorical, Hegel concludes the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>
            by saying that through its long journey the Self has “to penetrate and digest
              (<foreign>verdauen</foreign>) the entire wealth of its substance” (492). In the
            section on the organism in the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> he then has
            an extensive account of digestion that is overdetermined by psycho-philosophical
            concerns that make it impossible not to apply his physiology to his philosophy. In short
            the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, this “weak link in the dialectical
            chain” (Gasché 3), is a <foreign>mise-en-abime</foreign> of the Encyclopedia itself. It
            is, as Hegel says, “the Idea in the form of <emph>otherness</emph>” (<title level="m"
              >Nature</title> 13), and as such generates a number of reflexive figures for the
            functioning of the larger system.</p>
          <p> This is not to say with Werner Hamacher, who is similarly sensitive to Hegel’s work as
            “writing,” that Hegel’s philosophy, “closed as it is in order to round out the circle of
            the encyclopedic system,” draws “every critique which contests it, every new reading
            which addresses it, back into its own circle” (1). On the contrary Hegel, tarrying as he
            does with the negative, is pushed again and again to break the circle that he wants to
            close, and to expose his auto-encyclopedia of Spirit to its auto-immunity. Auto-immunity
            is Derrida’s word for the tendency of an organism to destroy “its own immunitary
            protections,” which he sees as a kind of vitality (<title level="m">Rogues</title> 124,
            55). And for Hegel too this auto-immunity is precisely what characterizes the organism,
            even though he hopes to endure and overcome it: “A stone cannot become diseased,” but
            the “living creature is always exposed to danger, always bears within itself an other,
            but can endure this contradiction, which the inorganic cannot” (<title level="m"
              >Nature</title> 429, 274). Or as he also says, noting the specific character of an
            organism as an inside facing an outside, a “wound ... only becomes dangerous through
            exposure to air. Organic life alone is characterized by its perpetual self-restoration
            in the process of its destruction” (109).</p>
          <p> As a mirror within the Encyclopedia, the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
            generates a number of figures that react on the larger system. Let me briefly touch on
            three in the section on the animal body: digestion, disease and fluidity. First,
            digestion or “assimilation” (381): the “adaptation of the non-organic to the purposes of
            the living creature” (381), which Hegel also calls “mediation” (402). We often extend
            the verbs “digest” and “assimilate” to knowledge. Indeed, repeating his opposition of
            the organism to the non-organic, Hegel produces a peculiarly vexed metaphor for
            knowledge as a struggle with resistant material: “all externality is non-organic; as,
            e.g., for the individual, the sciences are his non-organic nature,” which he has “to
            make his own” (276). Throughout the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, which
            Hegel describes as an “alien existence” that is “refractory towards the unity of the
            Notion” (3, 444), we see the pathos and <foreign>agon</foreign> of Hegel’s attempt to
              <emph>organ</emph>ize these sciences within a larger system so as to convert
            “externality” into a “self-like unity” (393). These attempts at
            <emph>organ</emph>ization, at accessing “structure, as alive” (377), are always bound up
            with some kind of pain. Take, for instance, the weirdly catachrestic mediation of
            anatomical into psycho-philosophical language in Hegel’s glossing of a description of
            bones that he borrows from Autenreith’s <title level="m">Handbuch der empirischen
              menschlichen Physiologie</title> (1801): <quote> ‘Bones, simply on account of the
              larger number of their vessels in general possess more vitality’ (in comparison with
              cartilages); ‘and this is evidenced by their susceptibility to inflammation and
              pathological changes ....’ Bone, i.e. the sensibility belonging to shape as such is,
              like the wood of the plant, the simple and therefore dead force which is not yet a
              process, but abstract reflection-into-self. At the same time, however, it is the dead
              force reflected into self. (361)</quote> Or take the neuropathically intense,
            psychoanalytically prescient description of how the “sensibility which has withdrawn
            into itself,” produces a “system not yet separated out,” the sympathetic nervous system.
            “This system forms ganglia [<title level="m">Nervenknoten</title>] which can be regarded
            as little brains in the abdomen.” Here according to Autenreith digestion “is withdrawn
            from our control” into an absent body, a lapse that Hegel glosses as follows: “In the
            sommanbulistic state ...self-consciousness is turned inwards [and] this internal
            vitality passes into the ganglia, and into the brain of this dark independent
            self-consciousness” (364). If the passage on bones is an example of mediation, the
            analysis of the sympathetic nervous system is something else: one of those accidents to
            which Hegel refers, which unsettles his intentions and is part of the “self-(post)
            development” of philosophy, inasmuch as another “sphere” is beginning to be formed
            within physiology, namely psychoanalysis.</p>
          <p> In contrast to the more thoughtful, recursive term “inwardizing” or
              <foreign>Er-Innerung</foreign>, digestion names an aggressive process of sublating
            these “externalities” or “accidents” that assault Spirit in Hegel’s reading of the
            scientific manuals of his time. Indeed the aggression of philosophy’s attempt to
            organize the “non-organic” material of physiology is evident in Hegel’s account of
            digestion as a process in which the “appetitive organism” is turned “outwards” and
            “provided with weapons” (393). The organism “overcome[s] and digest[s]” “the object or
            the negative” into its “subjectivity,” so as to master its own unwanted
              “<emph>involvement</emph> with the outer world” (395): an aggression that is bound to
            fail, given Hegel’s description of the subject itself as pure negativity, or as he also
            says “<emph>lack</emph>” (385). But what happens when the animal cannot fully digest
            what is external? Elsewhere I have described the complex psycho-metaphorics of
            digestion, in which it is not clear whether “the non-organic ‘potency’” (403) is outside
            or also inside. The animal must digest what is external, but is “repell[ed]” by itself
            because of its “entanglement with the outer thing,” and so must also cast out this
            outside that is inside. The “conclusion of the process of assimilation” is thus
            “excretion,” by which the animal, instead of making the external internal, “makes itself
            external to itself” (404): “Excrement has, therefore, no other significance than this,
            that the organism recognizing its error, gets rid of its entanglement with outside
            things” (405), and thus “rid[s] itself of [its] lack of self-confidence” (403).</p>
          <p> But as this oddly ethical and psychological language indicates, this outside was never
            fully outside. On the one hand, excretion has to follow digestion in normal assimilation
            and so is a sign that digestive appropriation has succeeded: excrement, we are told,
            “consists mainly of digested matter, or what the organism itself has added to the
            digested material” (405). But on the other hand, excretion also seems a form of
            indigestion, since “even in the healthiest animals” the excrement is not “homogeneous”
            but contains “undecomposed food” (405), which is to say that excrement is a rem(a)inder
            of failed assimilation.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See my article “(In)Digestible
              Material” (226-9). Hegel is not the only Romantic writer obsessed with his digestion,
              Coleridge and de Quincey also being examples.</note> No wonder, then, that in
            digestion “the organism in angrily opposing itself to the outer world is divided within
            itself” (402). Or that digestion proves to be a turning on oneself, as the “organism
            converts its own members into a non-organic nature, ... lives on itself and produces its
            own self,” becoming a “self-like unity” only through a repression in which digestion is,
            in effect, a form of abjection (377, 393). If philosophy is what the organism has added
            to external matter, then the sheer weirdness of the way Hegel catachrestically converts
            matter into the language of Spirit makes philosophy a kind of undigested excrement. The
            result is that the text, whose attempt to heal the wound of nature recalls the genre of
            spiritual autobiography, is more accurately described as a pathography of the
            philosophical spirit.</p>
          <p> The vexed nature of digestion opens up another sphere in the discussion of the animal
            organism, namely disease, which occurs when one of the body’s “systems or organs ...
            establishes itself in isolation [<foreign>sich fur sich festsetzt</foreign>] and
            persists in its particular activity against the activity of the whole” (428). Disease,
            in other words, is the part’s resistance to being digested by the whole, or the whole’s
            failure to digest its parts. Indeed Hegel goes so far as to describe disease as “an
            indigestibility in general” (433), and the language of toxicity crosses between
            digestion and illness. Digestion, “the <emph>power</emph>” of life “over its non-organic
            object,” is an “infection” (395), a curious word, since it is not clear whether the food
            or the body is being infected. On the other hand, the medicine for disease is an
              “<emph>indigestible</emph> substance” that forces the organism to rally and digest
            what is external to it (434, 436).</p>
          <p> These ambivalences towards digestion bring Hegel closer than we might expect to
            Schelling, who, as we have seen, confers a value on disease as the freedom of the part
            from the whole (although he too is not without ambivalence). For on the surface Hegel
            does seem more committed than his erstwhile friend to the containment of members in a
            whole, and less inclined to say, as Schelling does, that “disease is a completely
            relative concept” and that what is disease in one organism may be part of another
            organism’s functioning (<title level="m">First Outline</title> 160). But it is
            significant that in his allegorization of the stages through which disease passes Hegel
            translates the physiological term “irritability” into a word with great value in his
            philosophical system: negativity. Combining terms from the physiology of Haller,
            Blumenbach, and Kielmeyer– terms that had preoccupied him from the Jena years and the
              <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> onwards–eHegel postulates three “moments” in
            the normal organism that are also moments in a disease: sensibility, irritability and
            reproduction. In effect, he then maps his three-part dialectic onto these moments.<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> This schema is discussed in both the <title level="m"
                >Phenomenology</title> (160-70) and the <title level="m">Philosophy of
                Nature</title>, but the former does not include a discussion of disease. The
              dialectic and the explicit relation of irritability to negativity come in only in the
              discussion of disease in the latter. </note> In sensibility the organism as
              “<emph>being-within-self</emph>” verges on the passive, on “insensibility” (<title
              level="m">Phenomenology</title> 161; <title level="m">Nature</title> 361). Likewise in
            disease, in the phase of sensibility the disease is “<emph>virtually (an sich)</emph>
            present, but without any actual morbidity” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 433). At the
            threshold of sensibility, the organism arrives at a “moment of difference” in the
            “nervous system,” which is “directed outwards and involved in external relationships”
            (361-5). This leads to the next phase, namely irritability, associated with the muscular
            rather than nervous system, where the organism is involved with “difference” and an
            “active maintenance of self” (365, 359). Finally Hegel draws on Blumenbach’s <title
              level="m">Bildungstrieb</title>, which was influential for Kant’s notion of teleology,
            to theorize his third moment of “reproduction.” In the normal state reproduction simply
            means the organism’s reproduction of its parts or of further organisms, or in an
            interesting variant, the constructive instinct of birds, for instance, building nests
              (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 161; <title level="m">Nature </title>407). But
            tellingly, in the pathography of <title level="m">The Philosophy of Nature</title>’s
            last section, the only reproduction that the organism can manage is excrement, as if to
            dis-figure teleology and epigenesis as the organism’s progressive self-organization over
            time. </p>
          <p> Of particular interest here is the second moment of irritability and the form it takes
            in the section on disease. For irritability as difference can be simply aggressive:
            plants are sensitive, animals irritable. It is in only connection with disease that it
            becomes associated with the more self-scrutinizing language of negativity. Here
            irritability takes on a psychic dimension as the part’s separation of itself from the
            whole: “There is established in the self and in opposition to it as universal, a
            determinateness which makes its own self into a fixed self,” and now the organism,
            concentrated in a part of itself, is “restricted to itself” and “possesses within its
            own self the negative of itself” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 433, 438). The self is
            “turned against its structure” and the “negative thing is the structure itself” (429).
            While this obstinacy of the part is not desirable for Hegel’s architectonic notion of
            the body, it cannot be wholly undesirable, given that the negative (albeit as negativity
            rather than determinate negation) is the motor of Hegel’s system.</p>
          <p> In short, the separation of the part from the whole is seen as disease, but it is this
            “indigestibility” which seems the condition of possibility for a negativity to which
            Hegel is deeply committed. Schelling’s discussion elsewhere of “indecomposable”
            substances provides an interesting parallel to Hegel’s indigestible material. Working
            out of Kant’s argument that anything which is divisible cannot be “free from
            composition” or utterly “simple” (<title level="m">Physical Monadology</title> 55),
            Schelling distinguishes between “decomposable” substances like soil, and those that are
            “absolute[ly] indecomposable” or “absolute[ly] incomposable.” Perhaps confusingly, he
            insists that the latter are also “absolute[ly] composable”: “Indecomposability and
            absolute composability ... always coexist” (<title level="m">First Outline</title>
            29-31). Schelling’s point is to keep indecomposability as a way for something to resist
            appropriation, to preserve its integrity, while allowing that such dead-ends, which do
            not fit into a system, are also always be composable, capable of being dissolved and
            dissipated in order to be recreated. Hence just as “nature makes the absolutely
            indecomposable substances composable through decomposition, so the absolutely
            indecomposable substances, conversely, are inserted once again into the universal
            circulation of matter through composition” (31). Schelling’s terms, developed as they
            are in the subject-less realm of physics, lack the affect of Hegel’s indigestibility,
            whose environment is the psycho-physiology of the organism. But the point bears on
            Hegel: the indigestible that resists assimilation, causing a dis-ease within the system
            or even an absolute stoppage, can also be decomposed and put back into intellectual
            circulation.</p>
          <p> One such undigested or uncomposed remnant is the curious passage on the sympathetic
            nervous system as withdrawn into a “somnambulistic state” that conceals a “dark
            independent self-consciousness” (<title level="m">Nature </title>364). Like the bits of
            information in the <title level="m">EB</title>, Hegel’s translation of the ganglia into
            the terms of mesmerism as well as philosophy is neither digested nor cast out from his
            larger system. But from a later perspective we can compose it in another order, where it
            becomes part of “the self-(post) development” of Romantic philosophy as a laboratory for
            psychoanalysis, at that time a “system not yet separated out” from physiology (364).</p>
          <p> In Novalis’ terms, this encyclopedization of a molecule of knowledge becomes possible
            by “applying” the physiological concept of “fluidity” to knowledge, thus potentializing
            it in the epistemic register. Fluidity is an important concept for both Hegel and
            Schelling. In Schelling’s <title level="m">First Outline</title> the universal fluid is
            the unconditioned (<foreign>Unbedingt</foreign>) that precedes Nature’s composition of
            products or “figures” (26, 27n), which are “bound” forms that must be decomposed or
            unbound in order to be composed again, or taken up “into the universal process of
            organization” (31). For Schelling, as Coleridge recognized in adapting him, this Primary
            Imagination at the level of Nature is the ground and analogue for the workings of the
            Secondary Imagination mediated by mind (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 304). More
            agonistically, Hegel adapts this fluidity to disease, thinking the part-whole
            relationship through his ambivalence about chronic vs. acute illness. For in disease, as
            we have seen, one system isolates itself and establishes itself against the whole, “the
            fluidity and all-pervading process of which is thus obstructed,” whereas in health all
            the body’s “organs are fluid in the universal” (<title level="m">Nature</title>
            428).</p>
          <p> But the problem, which has ramifications for cognitive as well as physiological
            behaviour, is that this “derange[ment]” of the organism by one of its parts can involve
            either chronic or acute illness. In chronic illness, the disease “remains in one organ,”
            while other functions are “quite unimpaired, ” but in acute illness the entire organism
            is “morbidly affected”(432). And Hegel is uncertain which is less disastrous. On the one
            hand, as long as the disease “is peculiar to” and “confined” within “one particular
            system” such as the philosophy of nature, “it is easier to cure because only one organ
            is irritated or depressed.” “The system has only to be extricated from its entanglement
            with its non-organic nature and kept within bounds” (433), as Hegel tries to do in
            moving on from nature to spirit. On the other hand, chronic disease is also particularly
            associated with obstruction, as in “hardening of the liver” (432). We can understand
            this through Merleau-Ponty’s analysis of pathological behaviour as something “rigid” and
            not “integrated into a coherent and flexible field of meaning” (Wild xv; Merleau-Ponty
            86, 178). Hence when “one system” makes itself “the independent centre of activity...
            the organism too can no longer, as an independent whole, come to itself,” which is to
            say that the disease has not really been isolated in a part. So Hegel also says that
            medicine prefers acute illness, since if the whole organism is affected, “the activity
            of the whole organism too, can be released” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 432). Acute
            illness restores fluidity, facilitating a cure through what is, in effect, a kathartic
            “general, concrete interpenetration” of the systems earlier described (372), but with
            the proviso that until this katharsis happens, the rigidity, not unlike uncomposability,
            also protects what the existing field of meaning is not ready to integrate.</p>
          <p> It is clear that Hegel himself cannot confine intellectual dis-ease, the restlessness
            of the negative, in one system. The distinction between acute and chronic illness is
            followed by an uncomposed <title level="m">Zusatz</title> “A third form of disease is
            that which originates in the universal subject, especially man. These are <emph>diseases
              of the soul ... </emph>which can even result in death” (432). The point simply sits
            there, in a silent confinement, briefly offered as information rather than knowledge, an
            uncomposed remnant of Hegel’s encyclopedic reading in the scientific literature of his
            time. Yet diseases of the soul return in another system, the Anthropology, which is part
            of the philosophy of Spirit. But conversely, it also seems that neither Hegel nor
            Schelling are quite ready to release the depression of one system into the whole. For
            even the latter’s discussion of disease in the <title level="m">First Outline</title>,
            whose germinal importance Krell has analysed (103-15), lies uncomposed in an appendix,
            and the larger work in which it is released, namely the unpublished 1815 <title
              level="m">Ages of the World</title>, is not a whole.</p>
          <p> Stepping back, we see in the tremendous complexity of Hegel’s Encyclopedia what
            Bertalanffy calls an open rather than closed system. For Bertalanffy open systems emerge
            on the threshold between physics and biology. Whereas physics and mathematics model
            closed systems, what he calls “organismic” biology makes possible a system characterized
            by “continuous change, regulation, and apparent teleology,” but constantly thwarted and
            complicated by feedback loops (6, 89-92). But Bertalanffy provides an imperfect parallel
            on two grounds. In the feedback loop information is fed back and recombined till “the
            goal or target is reached,” so that his open systems are still characterized by
            homeostasis or the maintenance of balance (43-6). Second, in Hegel’s and Schelling’s
            turn away from Spinoza, substance is subject. But for Bertalanffy though substance is
            process, it is not subject; the open system in Bertalanffy or Deleuze has a
            subject-less, absolute immanence that is without what Schelling calls “personality”
              (<title level="m">Freedom</title> 33, 75). It is therefore characterized by a certain
            utopianism and abstraction, whereas Hegel’s work suffers through time. Hegel’s
            sympathetic nervous system also provides a model for the circulation of information in
            complex systems; indeed as the symptom of what it describes, the <title level="m"
              >Philosophy of Nature</title> is a system that is at once digestive, nervous and
            productive. This is to say that encyclopedics, the struggle of a single subject to
              <emph>organ</emph>ize knowledge, is the labour of the negative, a difficult education
            subject to accident and at times ruin. Sometimes, as in the <title level="m">
              Phenomenology</title> and the Introduction to the <title level="m"
              >Encyclopedia</title>, this struggle with the negative that is <title level="m"
              >Bildung</title> is cast as a spiritual autobiography. But sometimes, as in the <title
              level="m">Philosophy of Nature,</title> it is the pathography of Spirit’s attempt “to
            orient [itself] in the world of sickness” and to heal itself (Musselman 6), which is
            possible only if we think of healing as an interminable analysis.</p>
