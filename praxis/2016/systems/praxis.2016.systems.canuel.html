            <p>This essay introduces the essays in the current volume by beginning with the work
               of William Hazlitt. Hazlitt’s relation to the work of noted system-builders of the
               age (from Kant to Bentham) was far from straightforward: he criticized their “derangement”
               but admired and even envied their vision. Hazlitt’s views echo a range of other writers
               (Blake, Wollstonecraft, and Godwin, to name a few) who were adept at constructing
               systems as well as attacking them. Such responses demonstrate the startling range
               of positions that could be taken with respect to systematic thinking of the age, and
               the essays in the volume demonstrate that Romanticism presents us not with a unified
               set of beliefs or ideologies about systems but rather with a vibrant display of contrasting
               arguments, anxieties, and ambitions. </p>

               <p>In his essay 
                  “On People with One Idea”
                  from <em>Table-Talk</em>, William Hazlitt begins his diatribe against a host of writers and political figures
                  of the day by criticizing Major Cartwright’s program for Parliamentary Reform (here
                  Cartwright is designated only as “C—”). The problem with people like Cartwright, Hazlitt
                  says, is that they see their own causes as the cures for all evils and the answers
                  to all questions. Beginning with Cartwright, he quickly moves on to criticize a range
                  of others who espouse the causes of nutrition, abolition, Unitarianism—all with the
                  same deluded fervor. Hazlitt even includes himself among those who have spent too
                  much time “incessantly harping on one idea”: he once joined the ranks of “projectors”
                  who all share the same “disorder” or “derangement of the fancy” (144). As Hazlitt
                  goes on with his argument, it becomes clear that he is taking issue not merely with
                  people who have one idea but with those who have one particular kind of idea: that
                  of the systematizing impulse so prevalent in his day. The advocates of “system” singled
                  out for some of his more stinging ridicule include crazed adherents of the “Kantean
                  system” of metaphysics (145), as well as industrialist and social reformer Robert
                  Owen, whose “system” of villages and factories are inflated—in the minds of Owen and
                  other reformers—with “undue importance” (152-53).</p>
               <p>What is Hazlitt talking about when he refers to systems and their advocates? At first
                  glance, it seems as though systematizers are simply people with bad manners. He refers
                  to how these misguided philosophers, social improvers, and “projectors” are “vivacious
                  mannerists” who are “bad companions” in conversation (157, 153); they make everyone
                  “tired” of speaking with them, even make them tired of themselves (154). But he offers
                  a still more incisive account of system-builders. Although they claim that their systems
                  provide all-encompassing answers to all questions, and that they cure all evils, their
                  systems fail at this endeavor. Instead, systems seem only like personal ticks and
                  obsessions. Hazlitt doesn’t suggest that the thoughts of systematic thinkers are too
                  large or abstract: such a complaint is not really the focus of his essay, and this
                  is why Hazlitt’s account provides an intriguing contrast with the idea of “system”
                  to be found in Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>. There, Burke consistently opposes the English traditions of common law, inheritance,
                  and Protestantism to the “new political system” in France (226); the new system he
                  observes is associated with philosophical abstraction and mathematical calculation
                  removed from empirical observation. On Hazlitt’s terms, however, systematizers are
                  not systematic enough. The claims of systematizers to cure “every . . . evil” (140)
                  and to offer “a subject which is of universal and paramount interest” (139) are utterly
                  mistaken or at least wildly overblown. Their ideas and schemes are insufficiently
                  capacious to connect multiple objects, phenomena, or agents; the result is that Cartwright,
                  Owen, and their ilk are “always revolving round [their] own little circle[s]” (154).
                  Each little circle, by attracting fanatically devoted adherents, creates a “collusion”
                  among a small group of persons attached to a small number of objects, rather than
                  an “exchange” of ideas; only the latter—an “exchange”—allows one to “hear what people
                  have to say on a number of subjects” and ultimately find a common ground with them
                  (154).</p>
               <p>“Exchange” for Hazlitt is a big circle—more “Catholic”—rather than a little one (153);
                  it seems to imitate and outdo the work of systematizers rather than merely oppose
                  them. We might be tempted to think that the “exchange” system Hazlitt is arguing for—exchange
                  over collusion—is liberalism. But that wouldn’t be quite right. People with one idea,
                  it turns out, are alternately associated with landed property and with liberal commercialism.
                  Cartwright’s reform is like an “estate for life”; it is a personal “stronghold” (141)—as
                  if the form of his thought overturned the content of his quest for universal suffrage.
                  But even as the ideas of system-builders seem to provide propertied security, they
                  are just as often “by their very nature intermittent” and change with the “season”
                  (142), as if ideas were not like landed property but like marketable, all-too-exchangeable,
                  goods. Both alternatives seem in Hazlitt’s view to demonstrate an excessive dedication
                  merely to personal “distinction” (142). These bad systematizers are “egotists” who
                  are “only in love with themselves” (158). In contrast, Hazlitt recommends a way of
                  thinking that arises from personal commitment but also from a consideration of a larger
                  “circle” or context than the reformers and social improvers currently see. The more
                  “Catholic” mind that Hazlitt prefers (153) admits the importance of single genres,
                  discourses, or disciplines, while it also refuses prolonged identification with any
                  one of them, acknowledging and grasping “other things” beyond local or personal obsessions
                  (153). The “exchange of ideas” and the “conversation” (138) ensuing from it are not
                  about personal possession; having an idea means only engaging with it temporarily
                  and at the same seeing its limitations in order to move on elsewhere within the larger
                  set of interconnected ideas. The exchange thus situates the subject (including Hazlitt
                  the essayist) in a web of generic and discursive relationships that permits articulation
                  from a particular standpoint, but it also encourages movement and understanding among
                  different standpoints. All of those standpoints, moreover, collectively participate
                  in the larger “circle” of exchange. And thus we might say that Hazlitt fights system—tentatively
                  and uncomfortably—with system. </p>
               <p>Hazlitt approaches the problem of systems in a way that is politically charged; he
                  sees “projectors” everywhere in the politics of English reform, and he sees system-builders
                  like Jeremy Bentham and William Godwin defining, or at least helping to define, the
                  spirit of the age (<em>Spirit of the Age</em> 4-32). These thinkers, moreover, are deeply indebted to explorations of systems throughout
                  the eighteenth century. Hazlitt’s impulse to dismiss systematic thinkers as egotists
                  in both <em>Table Talk</em> and <em>The Spirit of the Age</em> is most certainly motivated by his nervousness about the association between social
                  projectors and revolutionary politics, but, again, the tactic contrasts with Burke’s
                  tendency to counter the generalizing, abstracting politics of system with the politics
                  of habit and tradition. Hazlitt’s very un-Burkean move is to make current systems
                  look too small rather than too large. And this deliberate mischaracterization, brilliant
                  as it is, only thinly disguises the fact that Hazlitt conjures up an opposition to
                  systematic thinkers precisely in order to mask a deeper sympathy with them, or even
                  an envy of them.</p>
               <p>The justification for Hazlitt’s nervous and tentative enthusiasm for systems becomes
                  particularly apparent when we consider that the impulse behind Enlightenment thought
                  in La Mettrie, Holbach, and Volney was (not unlike Hazlitt) to criticize social structures
                  that were too influenced by the obsessions and whims of tyrannical individuals. Holbach’s
                  <em>Système de la Nature</em>, for example, understood itself to be a “system” insofar as it emphasized the interdependence
                  of all parts of the human and natural world according to “unerring laws,” and further
                  understood that interdependence to provide a rational principle for human action (2.62).
                  The trouble Holbach inadvertently encountered was that a system of nature always required
                  imposing an obviously human set of values on nature, which were then read back onto
                  society. This is what Bentham—the arch system-builder, whom Hazlitt both criticized
                  and admired—didn’t like about the natural law tradition: it claimed to move beyond
                  the vagaries of traditional moral and legal structures, but it seemed merely to be
                  the result of an unacknowledged human fabrication. The solution he found was not to
                  move beyond human fabrication but to insist upon it. Law is man-made rather than natural,
                  and its perfection derives precisely from its achievement of coherence as a deliberately
                  and carefully constructed entity (anticipating, perhaps, Niklas Luhmann’s account
                  of systems as self-referential [34]).</p>
               <p>Bentham’s critique of the common law tradition ran in a similar direction, since the
                  worship of common law, particularly in William Blackstone’s account (an account praised
                  by Edmund Burke [117]), seemed to him very much like the worship of natural law: only
                  living humans can really say what a law, whether inherited from nature or tradition,
                  is. Thus Bentham’s attack on Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries</em> in the <em>Fragment on Government</em> appears to be nothing other than a critique of Blackstone’s lack of system. He criticizes
                  and corrects the irregular dependence on manners, personality, and custom in Blackstone’s
                  view—and he instead proposes a “system uniform, comprehensive, and simultaneous” based
                  on a “principle” of utility (64). Blackstone’s system, in Bentham’s view, is not a
                  system at all.</p>
               <p>Bentham emphasizes something that was present in Enlightenment thinking all along
                  but not always consistently realized. He equates system with a formal invention that,
                  because of its more complete accounting for all members in an organization or body—in
                  Bentham’s case, a social one—could advance beyond customs and prejudices that understand
                  society primarily in terms of a small group. A system could thus operate as an advance
                  on accumulated customs and traditions and look like a way of ushering in a new historical
                  epoch, even while to no small degree what was new about the system was that it would
                  subsume and include, rather than simply replace, the existing norms and practices
                  inherited from prior epochs. </p>
               <p>In many ways, Bentham’s definition of his “systematic” approach to political organization
                  brings us close to our own modern dictionary definitions of “system,” which (judging
                  from the examples in the <em>OED</em>) had accumulated a double meaning by the end of the eighteenth century. A system
                  was a mode of thought or physical organization that was 1) internally coherent to
                  form a “complex unity” and 2) guided by a philosophical “law,” “purpose,” or “function.”
                  Bentham in many respects may become system’s apologist just as much as Burke is its
                  adversary, but if these views seem to oppose each other, we might look at Romanticism
                  less in terms of strict adherents and opponents to system (although of course we can
                  see that such positions did exist), and more in terms of a far more complex, troubled,
                  and ambivalent series of engagements with system’s promises and hazards. This is why
                  Hazlitt provides a striking instance for us to study closely. On the one hand, that
                  is, he represents systems as highly personalized and sharply differentiated: they
                  are associated with specific discourses of reform, education, philosophical thought,
                  and so on. Clifford Siskin explains this disposition toward systems as an embedding
                  of systems within disciplines and genres of discourse (206). This embedding, distant
                  from the more ambitious systematic thinking characteristic of the early eighteenth
                  century, connects to a third definition for system that seems to have appeared in
                  English usage around 1800—a definition of system not merely as coherent and unified
                  by one idea but also limited or (as defined by the <em>OED</em>) even “oppressive.” On the other hand, we have now seen how Hazlitt—even while he
                  points to the limits of “projectors” and their systems—demonstrates an intriguing
                  admiration of still larger systems, and even thinks of a system of “exchange” as a
                  solution to the problem of system itself. The fact that “exchange” trumps political
                  systems defined by liberal individualism or landed property attests to its potential
                  critical power over them.</p>
               <p>We could turn to many other works of the Romantic age that display comparable levels
                  of distance from and attraction to systems. Wollstonecraft’s <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> employs “system” consistently to describe a “false” view of education and of woman’s
                  place in the world. She specifies that her own view of system is not simply more truthful
                  but also more systematic, or it is more truthful because it is systematic, since she
                  identifies false modes of thinking as systems but then calls their pretensions to
                  systematicity into doubt. The current “system of British politics” is only “courteously”
                  called a system because what appears to be coherent is actually incoherent, and what
                  appears to involve interdependence actually involves subordination (224). Wollstonecraft
                  isn’t entirely comfortable with the term “system” as a way of describing her own methods—she
                  calls National Education a “plan” instead (254)—but it does in fact fall in line with
                  systematic thinking in terms of its ambition to describe and recommend modes of human
                  relationship that would depart from existing modes of thought and behavior, by substituting
                  a new, coherent set of interdependencies—more “Catholic” in Hazlitt’s words—for patriarchal
                  systems of subordination. Wollstonecraft criticizes false systems, but her own recommendations
                  are utterly devoted to education as a coherent and inclusive system enhancing public
                  virtue (259).</p>
               <p>This layering in accounts of systems—referring to an enclosed and limited set of practices
                  and also to a theoretical ambition—animates other writing that I will here simply
                  note briefly. In <em>Caleb Williams</em>, Godwin contrasts two ways of thinking of “systems”: as individual schemes or interests
                  versus a more “just political system,” however briefly imagined, based upon utilitarian
                  principles (227). In William Blake’s <em>Jerusalem</em>, Los famously asserts that “I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans
                  / I will not Reason &amp; Compare: my business is to Create” (651). False system in <em>Jerusalem</em> is the product of division, while the system replacing it allows identities to “comingle”
                  in “mutual interchange” (824). Percy Shelley criticizes false systems too and replaces
                  them with new ones: more precisely, he attacks the system of monarchy, to be replaced
                  by a “social system” for mutual “advantage,” animated by a principle of equality (253).
                  In all of these examples, we can detect a certain level of uneasiness about systems,
                  countered by an attempt to define a new system whose unifying principle would not
                  impose the same restrictions and exclusions that these various authors identify in
                  false or limited systems.</p>
               <p>My point has been only a fairly general one about the way that Romantic writing could
                  point to “system” as a limit in thinking and also as a way of overcoming that limit.
                  The essays in this volume probe more deeply into the way that Romantic writers explored
                  the limits and possibilities of thinking in terms of systems. The purpose of the collection
                  is not to provide a single perspective adopted by Romantic authors, any more than
                  it is to provide a single theoretical perspective with which to view those authors.
                  Still, the essays do in fact collectively convey a sense that Romantic writers viewed
                  systems with a complex mixture of skepticism, anxiety, and enthusiasm. Perhaps these
                  essays indicate that it is more fruitful to read Romantic writing as a daring investigation
                  of what systems are, and what they do or don’t do, rather than a staging or demonstration
                  of one single, stable idea of system. </p>
               <p>Taken together, the essays also demonstrate a theoretical urge (again, not one that
                  involves theoretical uniformity) to re-examine some of the ways in which the criticism
                  of Romanticism has approached systems in the past few decades. In their different
                  approaches, both deconstruction and new historicism occasionally viewed Romanticism
                  as a resistance to systematic thinking: for Paul de Man, tropes undid “textual systems”
                  (71); for David Simpson, Romantic literature as a whole defined itself against “system”
                  and “theory” (140-41). Inspired by Pierre Bourdieu, the cultural study of the literary
                  system—to be found in critics such as Peter Murphy, Margaret Russett, and Clifford
                  Siskin—has done much to overcome the opposition between literary expression and systems
                  by placing literature within a set of systematic interdisciplinary or intergeneric
                  relationships. That important work can be seen as a necessary background for the inquiries
                  in this volume, which seek to explore the greater self-awareness about discursive
                  constructions as—or in relation to—literary, political, or philosophical systems.</p>
               <p>The first two essays, by Tilottama Rajan and Andrew Franta, explore notions of systems
                  and their limits; the second two, by Jocelyn Holland and Anne Frey, investigate the
                  inner workings of systems and explore the connections between systems and organic
                  forms. Rajan’s account of systems in Hegel begins with an account of the way that
                  encyclopedic systems in the empiricist tradition give way to an equation between “system”
                  and “method,” once it is discovered to be impossible to conceive of adequate ways
                  of unifying projects of knowledge. This impasse is in a sense overcome in German idealist
                  attempts to systematize knowledge, but Rajan shows how this is not achieved without
                  a struggle. In Kant, system is achieved only through rigorous exclusions; in Hegel,
                  the attempt to bring all of nature under the aegis of Spirit results in a painful
                  acknowledgment of nature’s indigestibility and disease. The system envisioned in Hegel
                  is therefore “subject to accident and at times ruin” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.systems.2016.rajan.html">“Models” par. 44</a>).</p>
               <p>If there is something indigestible that confronts the systems Rajan is analyzing in
                  her essay, Franta investigates Thomas De Quincey’s adventures in systematic thinking
                  in order to show how De Quincey confronts this problem even more directly. In his
                  writing on political economy, De Quincey critiques Ricardo for not acknowledging the
                  extrinsic forces that influence market prices. While insisting on prior and more complex
                  causes for market prices—and in a sense insisting on them as part of his view of the
                  economic system—he cannot develop a way of making his own system coherent enough to
                  account for the endlessly receding and intractable causes behind market prices at
                  given moments in time. This problem gets to be examined further in De Quincey’s writing
                  on astronomy, where the attempt to grasp the order of the universe is only magnified
                  in its impossibility the more one advances (with telescopes) one’s ability to observe
                  it. But as much as this extends the logic of the writing on political economy, it
                  also modifies it. The encounter with the immensity and incomprehensibility is not
                  simply a failure; it ushers in the experience of the sublime, of further thought,
                  and of further systematic attempts at comprehension: De Quincey shows that “systems
                  are fictions,” Franta writes, “but they are necessary—or at least unavoidable. And
                  they necessarily fail” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.systems.2016.franta.html">"De Quincey's Systems" par. 20</a>).</p>
               <p>Although Holland’s essay shifts attention away from the issue of a system’s success
                  or failure, it addresses mechanical aspects of systems that are often excluded from
                  considerations of philosophical definitions that concentrate on system as organic
                  form. Holland’s essay claims that many notions of system in fact often appear to waver
                  between the organic and the mechanical. More specifically, she shows how even systems
                  that appear to be organized along organic principles nevertheless depend upon a fundamental
                  mechanism: the lever, with its fulcrum or hypermochlion operating as either a balance
                  or connecting point between forces. The structure of the lever is analogized to the
                  workings of the individual mind in Novalis; his aphorisms make individual consciousness
                  appear to be a lever-like balance of forces. The implications of this move are developed
                  even further in Schlegel, where not only individual minds but also the “universe”
                  as a whole is described as a lever with a fulcrum. Holland is not saying here that
                  the mechanical aspects of systems inhibit their organic functions, but rather that
                  mechanism is allowed a space to work—joining parts of the mind and world—within nature
                  philosophy. </p>
               <p>In her essay, Frey also describes the internal workings of systems, or more precisely
                  the workings <em>between</em> systems, and this entails (in Percy Shelley’s writing) attention to the construction
                  of poetic forms. Concentrating on Shelley’s <em>Laon and Cythna</em> (revised as <em>The Revolt of Islam</em>), Frey shows how Shelley in a great many contexts connects political change—the shift
                  from one system to another—with the physical attributes of air. <em>Laon and Cynthna</em> in particular repeatedly connects revolutionary speech with air and the drawing of
                  breath. Furthermore, the poem’s staging of revolutionary language is self-consciously
                  connected to the arrangement of pauses in the poem—pauses from stanza breaks to caesuras
                  for readers to draw a breath. Giving the reader a space for her own thought and agency,
                  pauses convey Shelley’s ideal for the way he wants to think of poetic form as a “scaffolding”
                  for the agency required for change. Not merely identical to any particular political
                  system, poetry’s form, on Shelley’s terms, moves agents in order to produce a change
                  in systems.</p>
               <p>The essays in this issue collectively may indicate, as my initial instance of Hazlitt
                  suggests, that Romantic writers are keenly interested in the possibilities of systematic
                  thought, but they are keenly aware of its possible limitations. Those limitations
                  may emerge as indigestible parts of a system (Rajan) or as reminders of the mechanical
                  bases for systems (Holland); they may incur reliance on aesthetic experiences or forms
                  that pressure existing systems and construct new ones (Franta, Frey). The essays in
                  this volume also point to some intriguing questions for us to consider in our future
                  research. What are the precise advantages and disadvantages of thinking in terms of
                  systems? What produces trouble for their operation? To what extent is system itself
                  able to address this trouble? What is the relation between systematizing the natural
                  world and systematizing the political world, and how do Romantic writers understand
                  the separation or fluidity between these systems? If our interest in systems is partly
                  inspired by a materialist emphasis on specific discourses, communication networks,
                  or institutions, what continuing role does aesthetic form have in a discussion of
                  systems? What operations are required in order to criticize or revise systems?</p>
