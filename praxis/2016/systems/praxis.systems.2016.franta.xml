          <p>The idea of the system was one of De Quincey’s many obsessions; he returned to it again
            and again over the course of his career as a writer. In addition to essays on the
            transport system and accounts of systems of publication and communication, he wrote
            extensively about political economy, probing its development after Adam Smith and
            attempting to address its defects as a discipline and to correct the misapprehensions
            that he argued limited its potential as a science. </p>
          <p>De Quincey was initially a skeptic. In <title level="m">Confessions of an English
              Opium-Eater</title>, he claims that when he first surveyed recent works of political
            economy, he found them to be “generally the very dregs and rinsings of the human
            intellect; and that any man of sound head, and practised in wielding logic with a
            scholastic adroitness, might take up the whole academy of modern economists and throttle
            them between heaven and earth with his finger and thumb, or bray their fungus heads
            together with a lady’s fan” (65). David Ricardo’s <title level="m">On the Principles of
              Political Economy and Taxation</title> (1817) made him a convert. It did for De
            Quincey what Wordsworth’s poetry would do for Mill. “For two years,” he wrote, “I
            believe that I read no book but one” (64). Reading Ricardo inspired “wonder and
            curiosity,” “emotions that had long been dead in me,” and roused him from the personal
            and intellectual malaise brought on by opium (65). In a passage that is as much an
            expression of his own ambitions as a reflection on Ricardo’s accomplishment, he marvels
            that “an Englishman, and he not in academic bowers, but oppressed by mercantile and
            senatorial cares,” had “deduced, <foreign>à priori</foreign>, from the understanding
            itself, laws which first gave a ray of light into the unweildy chaos of materials, and
            had constructed what had been but a collection of tentative discussions into a science
            of regular proportions, now first standing on an eternal basis” (65-6). Circumstances
            prevented De Quincey from finishing his first work on Ricardo (to be titled <title
              level="m">A Prolegomena to All Future Systems of Political Economy</title>), but after
            the <title level="m">Confessions</title> had made his reputation and secured him a
            position as a regular contributor to the <title level="j">London Magazine</title>, he
            produced critiques of Malthus, a series of dialogues on Ricardo, an essay on Ricardo and
            Adam Smith, and, finally, for <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, the three essays
            that would be become <title level="m">The Logic of Political Economy</title> (1844)
            (originally titled <title level="m">Ricardo Made Easy; or, What is the Radical
              Difference between Ricardo and Adam Smith? With Occasional Notices of Ricardo’s
              Oversights</title>).</p>
          <p>While De Quincey notices Ricardo’s oversights, he works tirelessly in <title level="m"
              >The Logic of Political Economy</title> to explicate the “scientific proportions” and
            “eternal basis” of Ricardo’s theories. In the preface, he diagnoses the fundamental
            problems of contemporary political economic theory, claiming that “as regards its
              <emph>practical</emph> applications,” economic science is “as treacherous as
            Shakespeare’s ‘stairs of sand’” (119). The image he conjures up to illustrate economics’
            unsound foundations—of “phantom arrays of fleeting columns and fluctuating edifices,”
            created by winds on the Arabian desert—recalls his description of Piranesi’s
            architectural drawings in the <title level="m">Confessions</title> (119). For the opium
            eater, the impossible coherence of Piranesi’s designs represented the “power of endless
            growth and self-reproduction” which animated his own dreams (<title level="m"
              >Confessions</title> 71). The image of economic theory as shifting Arabian sands
            reflects the same power but perceived from something like the opposite direction. Rather
            than Piranesi’s impossible coherence—design undone by paradox—De Quincey finds in
            political economy a promise of coherence that is perpetually, and simultaneously,
            extended and withdrawn. Despite Ricardo’s genius, “nothing can be postulated—nothing can
            be demonstrated; for anarchy, even as to the earliest principles, is predominant”; the
            sandcastles of political economy are “for ever collapsing into dust” (<title level="m"
              >Logic</title> 119).</p>
          <p><title level="m">The Logic of Political Economy</title> seeks to bring order to this
            chaos by shoring up “the distinctions which are elementary to the science” (118). Its
            focus is Ricardo’s theory of value, which, De Quincey argues, commentators had utterly
            misunderstood. This failure to appreciate Ricardo’s revision of Smith, he claims,
            stunted the development of political economy as a systematic mode of thought. But even
            as he works in the service of system, De Quincey encounters the very problem he argues
            the political economists had utterly failed to address. However beautifully conceived in
            theory, in practice, systems are governed by extrinsic conditions. Like men in Marx’s
            conception of history, the market does not make prices just as it pleases; it makes them
            “under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past” (Marx
            15). Thus the tendency of political economists to imagine that the law of supply and
            demand operates in a vacuum, independent of preexisting circumstances, amounts to
            “metaphysical confusion”: <quote>This is an error which has led to worse consequences
              than any of the others here noticed. People fancy that the relation of Supply and
              Demand could by possibility, and that in fact often <emph>does</emph>, determine
              separately <emph>per se</emph> the selling price of an article. Within a few months
              this monstrous idea has been assumed for true by Colonel Torrens, in an express work
              on Economic Politics; by Lord Brougham, in relation to the foreign corn trade; and by
              almost every journal in the land that has fallen under my own eye. But it is a
              metaphysical impossibility that Supply and Demand, the relation of which is briefly
              expressed by the term “market value,” could ever affect price except by a
                <emph>secondary</emph> force. (<title level="m">Logic</title> 121)</quote> De
            Quincey’s point is straightforward enough: while the relation of supply and demand
            affects price, supply and demand necessarily act on a preexisting value. Unlike natural
            price, which “is always monomial,” market price “must always be binomial.” It cannot be
            determined merely by the relationship between supply and demand at a given moment but
            must be calculated in relation to “an antecedent price, arising from some other cause”
            (121). If market price cannot be determined in isolation, however, De Quincey’s own
            logic undermines the stability of his analysis. The “other cause” toward which he
            gestures must itself extend indefinitely into the past. It is also multiply
            determined—and, one must imagine, similarly affected by supply and demand. Metaphysical
            impossibility, it seems, gives way to an epistemological dead end. On De Quincey’s
            account, the logic of political economy is constitutively recursive; it is this logic,
            rather than its principles, that makes economics “the dismal science.”<note place="foot"
              resp="editors">The phrase is Carlyle’s, from his “Occasional Discourse on the Negro
              Question,” published in <title level="j">Fraser’s</title> in December 1849.</note></p>
          <p>As exhaustive (and exhausting) as it is, <title level="m">The Logic of Political
              Economy</title> does not pursue the implications of its analysis to their logical
            conclusion. System building requires a closed frame of reference. Two years later,
            however, in an essay on what would appear to be an unrelated topic, De Quincey takes up
            the complications that emerge when systems are situated in space and time and offers a
            striking illustration of the limitations of the systematizing impulse. “System of the
            Heavens as Revealed by Lord Rosse’s Telescopes,” which appeared in <title level="j"
              >Tait’s</title> in 1846, is ostensibly a notice of the Scottish astronomer John
            Pringle Nichol’s <title level="m">Thoughts on Some Important Points Relating to the
              System of the World</title>. Rather than a formal review, however, De Quincey takes
            his friend’s book as his “text”—about which his “little paper … may be said to hover”
            (“System” 7, note 1). Nichol’s book was a work of popular science; De Quincey aims to
            inspire the reader with the sublimity of the universe revealed by recent advances in
            astronomy. His purpose is not to criticize or even summarize Nichol’s account but,
            “through the light torrent <emph>spray</emph> of fanciful images or allusions,” to give
            the reader “momentary glimpses of objects vast and awful” (8, note 1). </p>
          <p>“System of the Heavens” opens with a question about the age of the earth. Kant had
            posed the question in an essay De Quincey translated and published in <title level="j"
              >Tait’s</title> in 1833. In revisiting it, he transforms Kant’s inquiry into a puzzle.
            He points out that the question does not concern the absolute age of the Earth, because
            knowing the Earth’s age without a frame of reference would tell us nothing. Instead,
            Kant asks, “What proportion does that amount form of the total career allotted to this
            planet?” (8). At issue, in other words, is not “the <emph>positive</emph> amount of
            years through which our Earth has existed” but “the <emph>period</emph> of life, the
              <emph>stage</emph>, which she may be supposed to have reached” (8, 9). In sketching
            out the implications of the question, the essay develops a fanciful conceit in which the
            Earth is “a <emph>lady</emph> planet” and “our dear little mother.” That asking her age
            is “a delicate point,” and the question “improper,” doesn’t prevent De Quincey from
            speculating about it at length and in absurd detail (8). “Is she a child, in fact,” he
            asks, “or is she an adult? And, <emph>if</emph> an adult, and that you gave a ball to
            the Solar System, is she that kind of person that you would introduce to a waltzing
            partner, some fiery young gentleman like Mars; or would you rather suggest to her the
            sort of partnership which takes place at a whist-table?” (9). </p>
          <p>Kant had warned against using “the sequence of human generations … as a measure for
            God’s works at large” (“Question” 168). But De Quincey’s personification of the planets
            and the analogy he draws between planetary time and generational relationships aren’t
            intended to measure the Earth’s age in human years. They underscore the fact that age,
            of the Earth or a human being, is not an absolute value but a relationship. De Quincey
            suggests that Kant goes wrong when he loses sight of this fact, and the oversight
            prompts him to wonder whether there is, “after all, any stationary meaning in the
            question?” (“System” 10). If we could persuade “our dear excellent mother the Earth” to
            tell us her age, “still <emph>that</emph> would leave us all as much in the dark as
            ever: since, if the answer were ‘Why, children, at my next birth-day I shall count a
            matter of some million centuries,’ we should still be at a loss to <emph>value</emph>
            her age: would it mean that she was a mere chicken, or that she was ‘getting up in
            years’”? Conversely, if the Earth confessed only “generally to being a lady of a certain
            age,” we would know “the <emph>valuation</emph> of the age” but not “the
              <emph>absolute</emph> years numerically: would a ‘certain age’ mean that ‘mamma’ was a
            million, or perhaps not much above seventy thousand?” (12). However the question is
            posed, it assumes a coordinating set of conditions that is absent; taken in isolation,
            neither version tells us what we want to know. Like market value, any meaningful
            calculation of the age of the Earth “must always be binomial.” As De Quincey puts it,
            “there is apparently this two-edged embarrassment pressing upon the case” (11-12). </p>
          <p>This insight, it turns out, is the real focus of De Quincey’s essay, and it reveals the
            central problem with the question of the Earth’s age. He variously entertains the idea
            that the Earth is a child or an adult; a lady, “a healthy growing girl,” or “a fine
            noble young woman”; or even “in the category of decaying, nay, of decayed women” (9-10).
            But, however the Earth is figured, she is also a mother to man and a sister to the other
            planets in the solar system, and these intersecting identifications “explode” Kant’s
            problem. The Earth’s geological transformations suggest that she is, perhaps, “both
            young and old”: <quote>Young? If she is not young at present, perhaps she
                <emph>will</emph> be so in the future. Old? If she is not old at this moment,
              perhaps she <emph>has</emph> been old, and has a fair chance of becoming so again. In
              fact, she is a Phoenix that is known to have secret processes for rebuilding herself
              out of her own ashes. Little doubt there is but she has seen many a birth-day, many a
              funeral night, and many a morning of resurrection. For listen:—Where now the mightiest
              of oceans rolls in pacific beauty, once were anchored continents and boundless
              forests. (10)</quote> The ages of the Earth are “known to us geologically as facts”
            but remain “obscure as durations.” The problem of the Earth’s age emerges out of the
            collision of human and geological time; planetary revolutions, like political
            revolutions, are cycles of “ruin and restoration” (11). But cyclical time offers no
            fixed point of reference, and the two variables De Quincey identifies remain puzzlingly
            independent.</p>
          <p>In an effort to establish a stable frame of reference—to find a “stationary meaning”—De
            Quincey turns to “the analogy of our whole planetary system” (which, he claims, Kant has
            “overlooked”) (13). He reasons that, as siblings, any difference in age between the
            planets should be negligible and asks how old “we take our brother and sister planets to
            be? For <emph>this</emph> determination as to a point in <emph>their</emph> constitution
            will do something to illustrate our own” (12). For example, if Jupiter is, as Kant
            seemed to believe, a young planet—as De Quincey puts it, “the younger brother of our
            mamma”—how can the Earth be “an old decayed lady” (13)? Moreover, if the Earth were old,
            surely we, her children, would be old as well—a claim De Quincey refutes, citing “a
            thousand indications of strength and budding youth” in the nineteenth century, including
            the promise of “Lord Rosse’s almost awful telescope” (14). While it might seem that De
            Quincey confuses planetary time and human time (men are young, so the Earth can’t be
            old), his real point has to do with their coordination. That the Earth is at once our
            mother and Jupiter’s sister reminds us that it is a part of two systems, one terrestrial
            and one celestial. Asking questions about the Earth’s age invokes the system to which it
            belongs, and inquiring about the solar system in turn entails consideration of the
            systems of which it forms merely a small part. The resolving power of the new telescope
            not only reveals worlds beyond worlds; it discovers systems beyond, and within, systems. </p>
          <p>Lord Rosse’s telescope brings the paradoxes of system into focus. The problem with
            larger and larger telescopes, De Quincey observes, is that more power does not mean
            greater resolution: “Concurrently with all increase in the space-penetrating power,
            there arises an increasing confusion in the images reflected. As the power of this
            instrument advances in one direction, correspondingly it recedes in another” (14-15).
            Initially, it seems that Lord Rosse’s telescope has overcome this obstacle: <quote>Most
              truly we may say that he has revealed more by far than he found. The theatre to which
              he has introduced us is <emph>immeasurably</emph> beyond the old one which he found.
              To say that he found, in the visible universe, a little wooden theatre of Thespis, a
                <foreign>tréteau</foreign> or shed of vagrants, and that he presented us, at a price
              of incalculable anxiety, with a Roman colosseum—<emph>that</emph> is to say little.
              Columbus, when he introduced the Old World to the New, did in fact only introduce the
              majority to the minority; but Lord Rosse has introduced the minority to the majority.
              (15)</quote> In making Lord Rosse a greater explorer than Columbus, this passage
            ostensibly celebrates his accomplishment. But even as he praises Rosse’s discovery, De
            Quincey acknowledges that it comes “at a price.” The sheer scale of the universe made
            visible by the new telescope breeds an “incalculable anxiety”—a mirror image of the
            universe’s newly-discovered immeasurability. The transposition of Old World and New,
            majority and minority, highlights De Quincey’s concern with relative values. What is at
            stake is not size but scale, and the revaluation of these relationships carries with it
            the menacing possibility that this new universe might prove to be as hostile to man as
            the Age of Discovery was to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. What Lord Rosse has
            found is positive knowledge; what he has revealed, by comparison, is limitless. And this
            immeasurability marks the limits of our knowledge. The idea of the universe, like the
            idea of publication, is “a practicable object not reconcilable with the limitation of
            human power” (“Travelling” 232).</p>
          <p> The universe revealed by the new telescope puts us in touch with the sublime, De
            Quincey suggests, less because it expands the scope of our knowledge than because it
            externalizes the power that lies within the human mind. “In reality,” he writes, “the
            depths and the heights which are in man, the depths by which he searches, the heights by
            which he aspires, are but projected and made objective externally in the three
            dimensions of space which are outside him.” The astronomer’s objective discoveries are
            merely the shadows of subjective power; they are “the mirror to a mightier abyss that
            will one day be expanded in himself” (“System” 15). De Quincey’s stunning description of
            the nebula of Orion imagines this sublime abyss as “a head thrown back, and raising its
            face (or eyes, if eyes it had) in the very anguish of hatred to some unknown heavens”
            (19). The image of the nebula expresses “brutalities unspeakable” and “a convolute of
            cruelty and revenge” (19, 20). In linking this allegorical visage to Milton’s allegory
            of sin and death, De Quincey makes the stars continuous with literature and religion in
            their ability to provoke pity and fear. In resolving them into a superhuman shape, he
            retains human form as his point of reference—a practice that connects him to the first
            watchers of the skies, who saw stars and created constellations. </p>
          <p> David Masson comments on the “weird and fantastic effect” of this passage (“System”
            18, note 1). Part of its strangeness, surely, is that Rosse’s telescope actually
            contributes very little to the effect.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In fact, as
              numerous scholars have noted, the image of the nebula De Quincey describes, which
              appeared in Nichol’s book, is John Hershel’s rather than Rosse’s. See, for example,
              Smith.</note> Before Rosse, De Quincey claims, the nebula was famous for its
            resistance to “the most potent of telescopes” (17). After Rosse, it is now famous for
            its “submission … to the all-conquering telescope” (18). Whether the nebula resists or
            submits is, in a sense, irrelevant, because its significance has to do with its status
            as a mirror to the observer’s mind. In a note to the revised version of the essay
            published in 1854, De Quincey answers those who criticized his depiction of the nebula
            by insisting on the essentially subjective nature of description: “All such appearances,
            whether seen in fire, or in the clouds, or in the arbitrary combinations of the stars,
            are read differently by different people.” These differences sometimes result from
            different conditions—the appearance of the nebula is affected by its motion and the
            motion of the Earth; it changes when the power of the telescope is adjusted—but De
            Quincey insists that “even where the grouping is exactly the same, being so rigorously
            limited as to exclude all action of caprice, the result may yet be very different” (19,
            note 2). Like Wordsworth’s descriptions of the appearance of clouds or storms, the
            purpose of De Quincey’s description is not accurate representation. Instead, the nebula
            is the vehicle for the realization of an image of his subjective reflection.</p>
          <p> If it seems that De Quincey gives away too much in asserting the fundamentally
            subjective nature of perception, it would be a mistake to allow his weak relativism to
            obscure his strong commitment to the significance of depths and heights. Spatial
            references are of course crucial to the discourse of the sublime but not merely because
            they reflect its character as Longinus or Burke described it. They also highlight the
            situation and orientation of the perceiver. It’s crucial, for De Quincey, that Lord
            Rosse and Wordsworth both look upward. In a long, seemingly bizarre footnote, he remarks
            that, “if on a public road you meet a party of four women, it is at least fifty to one
            that they are all laughing; whereas if you meet a party of [men], you may wager safely
            that they are talking gravely, and that one of them is uttering the word
              <emph>money</emph>.” He concludes that, <quote>because our sisters are too much
              occupied with the playful things of this earth, and our brothers with its gravities …
              neither party sufficiently watches the skies. And <emph>that</emph> accounts for a
              fact which often has struck myself—viz. that, in cities, on bright moonless nights,
              when some brilliant skirmishings of the Aurora are exhibiting, or even a luminous
              arch, which is a broad riband of snowy light that spans the skies, positively, unless
              I myself say to people “Eyes upwards!” not one in a hundred, male or female, but fails
              to see the show, though it may be seen <foreign>gratis</foreign>, simply because their
              eyes are too uniformly reading the earth. (32)</quote> In one sense, the point of this
            passage is that worldly preoccupations—women’s with trivialities, men’s with
              “<emph>money</emph>”—prevent us from looking outside ourselves and beyond our world.
            Lord Rosse and Wordsworth, their gazes turned upward, stand opposed to this general
            “downward direction of the eyes” (32). </p>
          <p>In another sense, however, De Quincey’s claim marks an interest in what Kant called
            “orientation in thinking.” Anna Henchman has recently drawn attention to this
            connection, tracing the influence of Kant’s 1786 essay and his <title level="m">Theory
              of the Heavens</title> (1755) on “System of the Heavens.” For De Quincey, Henchman
            argues, “astronomical observation has disrupted the categories of subjectivity and
            objectivity by revealing that there is no fixed point in the entire universe,” and, in
            describing the “ebb and flow” of De Quincey’s estimation of Kant, she traces a
            trajectory that reproduces his shifting assessments of political economy: at first
            enthusiastic about <title level="m">The Critique of Pure Reason</title>, De Quincey
            becomes disturbed by its “emphasis on the subjective nature of external reality”;
            finally, prompted by Coleridge, he returns to Kant’s critical philosophy—in particular
            the “idea that orientation and direction are necessary parts of thinking” (Henchman 68,
            69). Henchman’s reading of De Quincey’s essay shows how its “rapid shifts in point of
            view, scale and even genre” reflect his understanding of the “universe in flux” revealed
            by Lord Rosse’s telescope, an uncertainty he worked to assuage by turning to Kant’s
            radical recasting of the relationship between subjective and objective observation
            (Henchman 72). What is perhaps most striking about her account, however, is the
            underlying sense that Kantian orientation in fact intensifies the instabilities that De
            Quincey sought to alleviate. </p>
          <p>In “What is Orientation in Thinking?” Kant emphasizes the importance of correlating
            external objects (like “the sun in the sky”) with the “feeling” of an internal
            difference in the subject (between, for example, one’s left and right hands) (238). In
            essence, he grounds our experience of the objective world in this subjective sense of
            direction. Without this “<emph>subjective</emph> distinction,” Kant claims, “objective
            data” alone would be insufficient: <quote>… if all the constellations, while in other
              respects retaining the same shape and the same position in relation to each other,
              were one day miraculously transposed so that their former easterly direction now
              became west, no human eye would notice the slightest change on the next clear night,
              and even the astronomer, if he heeded only what he saw and not at the same time what
              he felt, would inevitably become <emph>disorientated</emph>. But in fact, the ability
              to make distinctions by means of the feeling of right and left comes quite naturally
              to his aid—an ability which, though implanted by nature, has become a habit as a
              result of frequent practice; and if he simply directs his eyes to the Pole Star, he
              will not only notice the change which has occurred, but will still be able to
                <emph>orientate</emph> himself. (239)</quote> Kant “extend[s] this geographical
            process of the concept of orientation to signify any kind of orientation within a given
            space” by offering a thought experiment: “in the darkness, I can orientate myself in a
            familiar room so long as I can touch any one object whose position I remember.” Were the
            positions of objects in that room shifted, however, “for a joke,” “in such a way that
            their relative positions remained the same but what was previously on the right was now
            on the left, I would be quite unable to find my way about” (239).</p>
          <p>In “System of the Heavens,” De Quincey argues that we inhabit a universe in which the
            transpositions Kant imagines are perpetual. The motions of the Earth, the other planets,
            the stars, and the systems to which they belong leave us always in the dark, depriving
            us of a stable frame of reference. For left and right, De Quincey substitutes up and
            down, depth and height, space and time. In his reading of the nebula of Orion, for
            example, he asks the reader to turn Nichol’s picture upside down, “for it happens that
            in the professor’s book it is placed upside down as regards the natural position of the
            human head” (19). This shift in orientation mocks Kant’s careful reasoning—a fact De
            Quincey playfully acknowledges when he says that “were it not treasonable to insinuate
            the possibility of an error against so great a swell as Immanuel Kant, one would be
            inclined to fancy that Mr. Kant had really been dozing a little on this occasion” (11).
            But his point throughout “System of the Heavens” is to demonstrate the disorienting
            effects of the realization that the universe affords no fixed spot in relation to which
            we might orient ourselves. In a universe in flux, human heads, unlike Kant’s hands, can
            have no “natural position.”</p>
          <p> “Great is the mystery of Space,” De Quincey writes, “greater is the mystery of Time”
            (15). Nebular astronomy after William Herschel demonstrates the continuity between these
            propositions and thus illustrates the full scope of the telescope’s power to perplex. At
            the end of the eighteenth century, Herschel’s improved telescopes, which brought nebulae
            like Orion closer, seemed to promise that these “milky spots” would eventually all be
            resolved into “starry worlds” (21). (This is, in fact, what Lord Rosse
            claimed—mistakenly it turned out—to have discerned in the nebula of Orion.) The relative
            distinctness or diffusion of these spots, it was assumed, was a function of their
            distance from the observer. “But,” De Quincey observes, “<emph>that</emph> did not
            follow: for, in the treasury of nature, it turned out that there were other resources
            for modifying the powers of distance, for muffling and unmuffling the voice of stars.” A
            world “at the distance <emph>x</emph>,” pushed back to “a double distance,” should
            become less distinct. Instead, “by compression, by deeper centralization,” it becomes
            brighter. Push it back again, and it grows faint; but repeat the operation, moving the
            starry bodies to four times their original distance, and “once again it shall shake off
            the oppression of distance” and grow brighter (22). And this, De Quincey argues, is
            merely one of several “cases of perplexity” in sidereal astronomy. The astronomer finds
            that size and distance collide (“is the size less or the distance greater?”), the
            motions of the universe and of the earth within it are “doubtfully confounded,” and the
            relative positions of two distant stars are impossible to determine (is proximity real,
            “or simply an apparent proximity from lying in the same visual line, though in far other
            depths of space?”) (24). In revealing the vastness of space and exponentially expanding
            its sublime distances, the telescope confounds the observer’s ability to find anything
            in it—or, more precisely, to speak with any degree of certainty about what he has
            found.</p>
          <p> Lord Rosse has not just “created immeasurable worlds”; he has discovered innumerable
            occasions for confusion (23). In sidereal astronomy, distance, magnitude, and motion are
            not positive values, but relationships and thus sources of equivocation. The double
            stars that, along with the nebular hypothesis, claimed the attention of astronomers from
            Kant and Herschel to Rosse and Nichol, are “equivocal phenomena—phenomena that are
            reconcilable indifferently with either of two assumptions” (26). De Quincey argues that
            depth, height, and the vast distances of space are not cognizable by infants, animals,
            or brutes: “Man only has a natural function for expanding, on an illimitable sensorium,
            the illimitable growths of space…. To man is as much reserved the prerogative of
            perceiving space in its higher extensions as of geometrically constructing the relations
            of space. And the brute is no more capable of apprehending abysses through the eye than
            he can build upwards or analyze downwards the aerial synthesis of Geometry” (16).
            “System of the Heavens” is an attempt to make sense of the expanded, and expanding,
            universe revealed by the telescope through such “aerial synthesis.” The attempt fails,
            but its failure is precisely De Quincey’s point. Like Memnon’s head, which De Quincey
            encountered soon after it arrived at the British Museum in 1821, space “baffles and
            confounds all faculty of computation” (17).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a
              reading of the relationship between Memnon’s head and “System of the Heavens,” see
              Barrell 104-25.</note> Attempts to calculate interstellar distances yield results
            which mystify rather than enlighten: traveling at a speed three times that of the earth
            in orbit, it would take forty-one thousand years to reach a star in the constellation
            Cygnus; at the same rate, reaching “that distance to which Lord Rosse’s six-feet mirror
            has so recently extended our <emph>vision</emph>” would take two hundred and fifty
            million years. The problem is not the difficulty of the computation (calculating the
            ratio of these distances “is a simple rule-of-three problem for a child”), but that the
            result is measured in terms of human time (in <emph>years</emph>) and yet defies human
            comprehension (26). Lord Rosse’s telescope has transformed men into brutes. Faced with
            the overwhelming scale of the universe, man joins the “deer, or hares, or foxes, and the
            pack of hounds in pursuit, chaser and chased, all going headlong over a precipice
            together” (16). </p>
          <p> De Quincey’s word-painting of the Orion nebula does not resolve this failure; it
            cannot. Instead, it takes the failure of human comprehension and, out of it, creates an
            experience of the sublime. This is the point of the essay and the point of looking up
            into the sky. The mysteries De Quincey addresses are worth his attention precisely
            because they defy his understanding and, in their defiance and cold contempt (reflected
            in “the detestable phantom” of the Orion nebula), inspire him to hold “up a mirror of
            description to appearances so grand, and in a dim sense often so symbolic” (19, note 2).
            Near the end of the essay, De Quincey imagines “a man in the last century, and an
            eminent man too” who rejected the sublimity of astronomy: “on the contrary, he regarded
            the solar system as decidedly vulgar; because the planets were so infernally punctual …
            that they forced him … to think of post-office clocks, mail-coaches, and book-keepers.
            Regularity may be beautiful, but it excludes the sublime” (29).<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> Henchman points out that this eighteenth-century man is likely De
              Quincey’s invention, noting, among other reasons, that “the post-office clocks he
              supposedly referred to were a nineteenth-century innovation” (245, note 15).</note>
            This complaint, he argues, was the result of living “in the days of mere planetary
            astronomy.” It is answered, and more than answered, by the discoveries that have
            transformed “our own little system” into “a subordinate province.” “We ought no longer
            to talk of astronomy, but of <emph>the astronomies</emph>” (30). With the multiplication
            of astronomical systems (De Quincey enumerates “1, the planetary, 2, the cometary, 3,
            the sidereal; … 4, the nebular”), the sublimity of the heavens is restored or revealed
            anew; systems of such amazing size and complexity necessarily produce “variety,”
            “irregularity,” and “anomalies” sufficient to sustain our sense of the sublime (30-31).
            “And,” he concludes, “for all purposes of frightening us, anomalies in systems so vast
            are as good as a ghost” (31).</p>
          <p>Clifford Siskin has argued that the “specific mode of producing knowledge in
            writing—systems within SYSTEM—was the Enlightenment, not Enlightenment as the condition
            of modernity …, but the … temporally and geographically localized Enlightenment that did
            not make it out of the eighteenth century” (206). From this standpoint, De Quincey’s
            systematizing is a late example of how systems “tended to sink under their own weight”
            (206). We might understand De Quincey’s systems—economic and astronomical, but also the
            mail-service system as it is depicted in “The English Mail-Coach” or the mind and
            personal identity as they are constituted by memory in the <title level="m"
              >Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title>—along these
            same lines and interpret his inability to make them make sense as failures. For De
            Quincey, though, the failures that undo systems are themselves productive—of sublimity
            and, in keeping with Kant’s larger point about the sublime, of thought. Systems are
            fictions, but they are necessary—or at least unavoidable. And they necessarily fail. If
            their creation reflects a conviction that the mind, world, and universe are governed by
            reason, their failure is a testament to the persistent desire to make sense of the
            mysteries and accidents we encounter, especially those that defy our comprehension. </p>
