            <p>This essay offers a new perspective to German Romanticism's thinking about systems
               by exposing its indebtedness to a mechanical idea that pervades the organic model
               of systems and operates in the blind spot of organic discourse. Against the common
               point of view that to think “organically” is to think “non-mechanically,” this essay
               argues that these two perspectives can in fact co-exist, and it is precisely the particular
               dynamics of this co-existence that will put the Romantic concept of system in a new
               light.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Where the question of “system” in the context of German Romanticism is concerned,
                     and more specifically, in the aphorisms of Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel, it is all
                     too tempting to dismiss the concept out of hand: not because it has no role to play
                     in Romantic thinking (it does), but because the system-concept in this historical
                     context is a quagmire of competing definitions and contradictions. Certainly, there
                     is a marked difference between the Romantic champions of the fragmentary, with their
                     ironic oscillations, and the attempted rigor of Kant’s, Fichte’s or Hegel’s philosophical
                     systems. Even Schelling’s nature-philosophical system, with its sympathies to the
                     Romantic understanding of science, does not or cannot approximate the playfulness
                     of the Romantic approach to thinking about systems. But think about them they do:
                     without professing the desire to build and dwell in one of their own, Schlegel and
                     Novalis return time and again to the notion of what a system can and cannot be, what
                     it does and does not do, and what an individual’s relationship to a system should
                     and should not be. The rhetorical emphasis here on drawing distinctions is not accidental
                     and points to a further challenge: after Niklas Luhmann, it is no longer possible
                     to speak of “system” in the same breath as German Romanticism without considering
                     the theoretical position that says that those same systems to which the Romantics
                     return time and again bear features of autopoietic systems as defined by Luhmann.
                     To be sure, Luhmann’s understanding of “system” is nothing like Kant’s or Hegel’s.
                     To simplify a concept that is arguably much more complex for Luhmann, we could say
                     that for him, systems are neither perfectly defined nor perfectly stable entities,
                     but instead undergo a process of continuous development as they differentiate themselves
                     from their environments. Taking the Romantic art system as an example, Luhmann describes
                     it as “self-referential,” “operationally closed,” and in a state of change (507).
                     These dynamics “cannot be grasped according to the schema—still predominant at the
                     time of Romanticism—of part and whole” (507). The schema of “part and whole” to which
                     Luhmann refers is, of course, a mainstay of Romantic thinking about systems and other
                     key concepts defined by agile intellectual leaps across scale: in addition to the
                     concept of system this would include the fragment, the organism, and the work of art.
                     It appears that Schlegel and Novalis are caught in the crossfire between different
                     understandings of what a system can be. A proper understanding of systems in the context
                     of German Romanticism therefore needs to bring together both an examination of the
                     historical concepts that surround their understanding of a system and our contemporary
                     sensibilities about systems, or we run the risk of their blind-spots becoming our
                     own.

                              regarding Luhmann’s systems theory.</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>To approach Romantic thinking about systems, Johann Christoph Adelung’s definition
                  provides a solid point of departure. In the <em>Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart</em> (<em>Grammatic-critical Dictionary of High German</em>), he defines a system as a “connection of things of the same kind and disposition
                  and the order according to which they are joined amongst themselves” (“der Zusammenhang
                  von Dingen einerley Art und Einrichtung und die Ordnung, nach welcher sie unter einander
                  verbunden sind”) (“System” 510-511). Adelung’s definition leaves open both the contents
                  of what a system may contain and any mention of the specific kind of order that governs
                  them—this is left to the discretion of the systematician. For their part, Novalis
                  and Schlegel divide their attention between each of these issues: on the one hand,
                  they test out a range of possible candidates for systematic connecting (including
                  words, fragments, and concepts from the wide array of disciplines which attracted
                  their interest), and on the other hand, they think about how these parts relate and
                  the behavior of systems as a whole. This entails a study of other systems as well
                  as considering alternatives to systems altogether. Novalis, who refers to the systems
                  of Copernicus, Helvetius, Locke, Brown, and Fichte (among others), writes that “one
                  studies foreign systems in order to find one’s own” (<em>Schriften</em> 2:278) and that the “actual philosophical system” must be “systemlessness” integrated
                  into a system (2:289). For all their apparent differences, these two aphorisms undertake
                  the same strategy of differentiation, and they do so in a way compatible with Luhmann’s
                  understanding of systems. They bring a foreign element into the familiar in order
                  to observe the difference and allow it to become integrated into further thinking
                  about the system.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Also in line with Luhmann and current understanding of Romantic thought is Schlegel’s
                     and Novalis’ tendency to decry any notion of systematic rigidity and permanence in
                     favor of a highly mutable environment: the system, according to Novalis, has itself
                     the ability to effect new connections (3:56). Along these lines, the metaphors associated
                     with the behavior of systems are frequently drawn from the realm of the organic. “Only
                     that deserves to be called system,” writes Schlegel, “which has unity and an organic
                     build (<em>Gliederbau</em>)” (<em>Philosophical Lectures</em> 55).

                     </div> He even goes so far as to complain about those fumbling intellectual “banausoi” who
                     “desecrate an organic system through <em>mechanical</em> handling” (“Kritische” 18:2:15). The Romantic emphasis on organic language for systems
                     and other complex, emergent environments underscores the notion that they are essentially
                     incomplete and in perpetual states of becoming, yet this same language is so pervasive
                     that it can be difficult to find the necessary vantage-point from which to consider
                     possible alternatives. At the risk of bearing the brunt of Schlegel’s criticism, this
                     essay is an attempt to do exactly what he warns against: to give the Romantic thinking
                     about systems a kind of “mechanical handling” by exposing its indebtedness to a mechanical
                     idea that pervades the organic model of systems and operates, as it were, in the blind
                     spot of organic discourse.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I will begin by situating the Romantic interest in a simple machine—the lever—in historical
                  context before explaining the kind of conceptual “work” Schlegel and Novalis have
                  it perform. The next part of the paper will focus on a particular aspect of the lever,
                  the fulcrum, which is an object of interest in its own right. I will then use the
                  fulcrum to return to the question of system. It is a common point of view that to
                  think “organically” is to think “non-mechanically,” but the examples discussed in
                  this essay will show that this is not always the case. Rather, the two can co-exist,
                  and it is precisely the dynamics of this co-existence that will put the Romantic concept
                  of system in a different perspective. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Romantic interest in a simple machine</span></h2>
               <p>There is pleasure to be found in the appreciation of simple things: those objects
                  or ideas that are so commonplace as to escape our attention, but that, if we happen
                  to observe them more carefully, reveal their intrinsic value in ways we would not
                  have expected. The mechanical lever belongs in this category. It numbers first among
                  the “simple machines” described in handbooks on mechanics since the time of Archimedes,
                  where it is considered alongside other devices such as the scale, the wedge, and the
                  pulley. Levers and lever effects are so intrinsic to our worldview that, once we begin
                  to pay attention to them, they are everywhere: they serve as the basis of more complicated
                  machinery and organisms (including the musculature of the human body), as figures
                  for the augmentation of human agency, and they are implicated in any causal connection
                  based on an advantageous relationship of input to output. Against the backdrop of
                  a subject philosophy, the Romantic interest in the lever therefore makes sense, but
                  as we will see, how Schlegel and Novalis integrate the lever into their thinking defy
                  conventional notions of instrumentality as embodied by the spirit of Archimedes.</p>
               <p>Although the lever is the most fundamental of the six or seven simple machines of
                  classical mechanics—all of which rely in some way on the laws of the lever—it has
                  proven over time to be remarkably versatile as an instrument of philosophical as well
                  as scientific thought. As the historian of science Domenico Meli shows in <em>Thinking With Objects</em> (2006), a number of intellectuals in the modern period, including Kepler, Descartes,
                  and Leibniz, to name just a few, relied on the lever’s theory and used it to model
                  problems relating to theories of motion, oscillation, and impact for scales both great
                  and small. He writes that “several scholars…used the lever in their accounts of circular
                  and orbital motion,” such as Borelli, who “imagined the planets to be pushed by the
                  sun’s light acting like a lever,” and Jakob Bernoulli, who “used the lever to investigate
                  the problem of the center of oscillation” (312). Meli attributes the phenomenon of
                  thinking in terms of levers to what he calls the “crucial role played by the geometrical
                  diagram,” a role he describes as “heuristic and at the same time didactic or mnemonic”
                  (312). In that regard, our Romantic-era mechanists are in good company. They too deploy
                  the theory of lever as a heuristic tool to model relationships between concepts, to
                  describe processes of generation of both the individual and the universe, and, more
                  generally, as a way of addressing potential contradictions of philosophical thinking.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thanks to a number of publications in the last two decades, “science” and “Romanticism”
                     are no longer a contradiction in terms, even if the precise nature of that relationship
                     remains open to debate. Recent scholarship has exposed in great detail the Romantic
                     reception of scientific theory, especially in regard to the emerging life sciences.

                     </div> This heightened interest in one aspect of Romantic thinking has, however unintentionally,
                     suppressed another aspect that also deserves consideration. The problem is that the
                     well-documented Romantic interest in chemistry, galvanism, and early biological thinking
                     as they relate to models of organic life would not necessarily seem to accommodate
                     an equally avid interest in mechanical law or anything hinting at a “mechanical philosophy.”
                     Yet this is precisely the kind of philosophy that any intellectual engagement with
                     the mechanical lever would entail, simply because it “endeavours to explicate the
                     Phaenomena of Nature from Mechanical Principles,” as one finds in John Harris’s <em>Lexicon Technicum</em> (1704) (col. MEC). First associated with texts such as Robert Boyle’s <em>The Origin of Forms and Qualities according to the Corpuscular Philosophy </em>(1666) and Descartes’ posthumously published <em>Treatise on Man</em> (1664), mechanical philosophy rejects the Aristotelian viewpoint that there are particular
                     forms and qualities which dictate the tendencies of objects in the natural world,
                     and the mechanical philosopher holds that “everything, be it terrestrial or celestial,
                     natural motion or constrained, must be explained in terms of the size, shape and motion
                     of the parts that make it up, just as the behavior of a machine is explained” (Garber
                     44).

                     thinking and that one should speak less of a wholesale abandonment of a mechanistic
                     world view than a reconfiguration of its useful aspects in proximity to organic models.
                     This point of view is substantiated by those aphorisms of Schlegel and Novalis where
                     one finds an avid interest in the lever as a mechanical device and as an instrument
                     of thought whose use can be tested out in contexts reaching far beyond “material”

                  <p>We can begin the discussion of the Romantic lever with a simple definition of this
                     simple machine, taken from the most established German scientific dictionary of the
                     late eighteenth century to which Schlegel and Novalis both refer—Johann Gehler’s <em>Physikalisches Wörterbuch</em> (<em>Physical Dictionary</em>). In an entry compiled verbatim from the mathematical writings of Johann Erxleben
                     and Abraham Kästner,

                     </div> Gehler’s dictionary refers to the lever as “a fixed and inflexible connection of three
                     bodies—or three points—two of which turn around the third, the fulcrum” (“Hebel”).
                     This definition can be taken as representative for the theory of static mechanics
                     as it stands at the end of the eighteenth century, but if we recall the passage from
                     Adelung’s dictionary cited earlier, it also meets the minimum requirements for a system
                     in that it creates a connection between things which, for all their differences, are
                     like enough in “kind” or “disposition” to allow for them to be connected in the first
                     place. This analogy between lever and system has the potential to be productive because
                     the conditions according to which the Romantics deploy the former will have implications
                     for the latter.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While there is evidence enough that both Schlegel and Novalis were well-versed in
                  mechanical theory, in the case of Novalis his most detailed notes on the working of
                  the lever come not from classical mechanics but rather from the physics of Carl Eschenmayer’s
                  nature-philosophy and in particular the <em>Säze </em>[sic]<em>aus der Natur-Metaphysik auf chemische und medicinische Gegenstände angewandt</em> (<em>Propositions from Nature-Metaphysics applied to Chemical and Medicinal Objects</em>). Eschenmayer’s stated purpose in the preface to the <em>Säze</em> bears directly on the question of system and can, in turn, be taken as programmatic
                  for Novalis’ approach. Eschenmayer envisioned his text as a guidepost for future thinking
                  about how to apply nature-philosophical ideas to the fields of chemistry and medicine.
                  Because the text of the <em>Säze</em> does not itself accomplish the task but merely points the way, Eschenmayer acknowledges
                  its status as fragment (<em>Bruchstük</em> [sic]), adding, “One can take propositions from a system and apply them completely
                  unsystematically to objects of experience, without their most meritorious aspect falling
                  by the wayside” (iv). When Novalis read Eschenmayer’s text, he excerpted interesting
                  passages and added his own commentary: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">[E:] The longer the arm of the lever, the greater the <em>velocity</em> of the force moving the end.</div>
                     <div class="l">[N:] <em>greater room to move</em> (Spielraum) of the force absolute in itself—greater <em>armature </em>of the force—</div>
                     <div class="l">[E:] Consequently for the attainment of equilibrium a stronger mass must hang on the

               </blockquote>
               <p> Novalis’ excerpts and commentary replicate Eschenmayer’s approach. Mechanical facts
                  about the lever—for example that a weight hanging from a lever will move more quickly
                  through a given angle of displacement in a given time, in proportion to the arm’s
                  length—inspire in Novalis a more general reflection about force (Eschenmayer makes
                  no mention of either “absolute force” or an “armature of force”). The same holds true
                  for Novalis’ reformulation of the law of equilibrium through the concepts of “intensity”
                  and “extensity.” Here, Novalis makes a peculiar move, in that his reformulation of
                  the physical law does away with external objects (like weights hanging on the arms
                  of the lever). This amounts to an internalization of perspective and an identification
                  with the lever itself—an idea to which I will return below.</p>
               <p>A broader look at the appropriation of the lever in Novalis’ aphorisms reveals the
                  same willingness to rethink the lever beyond the context of mechanical law or even
                  nature-philosophy. Thus, alongside statements about the lever in accordance with Newtonian
                  physics (for example, when Novalis writes that the lever must be explained according
                  to the laws of celestial mechanics [3:77]), one finds it used to model other kinds
                  of environments that neither Newton nor Eschenmayer had in mind, such as the syntactical
                  relation of nouns and verbs (3:691). The degree to which Novalis’ philosophical thinking
                  is connected to his thinking about the lever becomes even more apparent when, with
                  reference to his physicist friend Johann Wilhelm Ritter, Novalis constructs an analogy
                  between “Ritter’s way of handling physics” and “my idea about the principle of personality
                  in every substance,” something he equates with the force of the lever’s fulcrum (3:135).
                  In other words, Novalis’ thinking about the lever seems to be more in line with a
                  philosophical approach (or “way” of doing something) than an isolated interest. A
                  laconic note, “<em>About the Lever</em>,” found just a few pages later than the aphorism cited above, raises similar questions,
                  namely, to what degree the lever was merely an object of conceptual interest for Novalis,
                  and to what degree its very instrumentality may lie in how it facilitates a more general
                  approach to thinking about certain problems of philosophical interest. These are questions
                  which ultimately have to do with the individual, as the notion of a “personality in
                  every substance” and the formulation of equilibrium in terms of “intensity and extensity”
                  might suggest.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Whereas Novalis thinks “about the lever” in such a way as to generalize from contemporary
                     physical theory, Schlegel’s approach can best be described as the exploratory creation
                     of levers themselves, which in turn aligns well with Meli’s discussion of the heuristic
                     value of levers for the mechanical theory of the eighteenth century. It is the functional
                     property of the lever, which is after all a machine for our use, that allows Schlegel
                     to use it as an instrument of thought, as in the following two aphorisms that appear
                     contiguously: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">(1) Activity and receptivity completely relative. Substance absolute, only the fulcrum

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Together, these two aphorisms offer a mechanical model of a lever in a state of constant
                     motion, in the service of an organic principle. The fulcrum is a locus of alternation,
                     a point which embodies the interplay of forces on either side. Much like the points
                     of indifference between magnetic poles—which are also privileged points in Romantic

                              associated with Schelling’s discussion of magnetism in his nature-philosophy, having
                              based his understanding of the term in part on the work of Dutch scientist Anton Brugmans,
                              who describes a plane of indifference between the two poles of the magnet. In his
                              Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie (1799), Schelling describes a state
                              of indifference as one where natural phenomena exist with the forces acting upon them
                              in balance, which can be considered as an analogous phenomenon to a lever in a state

                     </div>—the fulcrum serves as a model for negotiating a relationship between opposing concepts,
                     as a figure of dynamic opposition. The suggestion that life or living is a process
                     of repeated disruption is not unique to Schlegel. Schelling’s 1798 treatise, <em>Von der Weltseele</em> (<em>On the World Soul</em>), for example, also speaks of an equilibrium to life that must constantly be disturbed
                     and re-established. In fact, in the same passage where Schelling makes this claim,
                     he also uses the lever as a metaphor when he names oxygen and hydrogen the two “negative
                     principles of life in the animal body,” comparing them to “weights on the lever of
                     life” whose local disequilibrium allows for the large-scale maintenance of life itself
                     (198).

               <p> It comes as no surprise that Schlegel also states that the lever is of “utmost importance”
                  for the theory of construction (18:170). Such a claim would be unoriginal in a mechanics
                  handbook, but what about in the Romantic context? Much in the same way as the formulas
                  in Schlegel’s notebooks draw upon the language and symbolism of differential calculus,
                  we see that in the examples quoted above the logic of the lever allows for abstract
                  concepts to be treated as discrete quantities and positioned into relationships, without,
                  however, losing their dynamic potential or status as constructions-in-progress. These
                  levers accomplish a kind of philosophical work. They construct by bringing concepts
                  together and positioning them in proximity to each other and also by establishing
                  connections to allow for mobility, given that one fundamental aspect of the lever
                  is its movement around the fulcrum—its ability to accommodate a shifting relationship
                  of forces. Within the context of Romantic writing, one can also speak of local and
                  global lever effects: once the relationships are constructed (for example, between
                  mythology and poesy in the last of Schlegel’s aphorisms cited above), they will continue
                  to bear upon our broader understanding (i.e., the relationship will continue to affect
                  our understanding of them in the context of the Romantic encyclopedia project and
                  beyond). Schlegel’s lever effects continue to operate beneath the surface of the encyclopedia
                  project, even when the lever or its component parts are not directly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Once again, Adelung’s definition of system comes to mind, along with the thought that
                  there is a homogenizing effect—at least of form, if not of content—when different
                  concepts are treated as units with which to build. It is important to keep in mind,
                  however, that the emphasis on the lever does not imply a reduction of Romantic thinking
                  to something like a mechanical, clockwork cosmos. How Schlegel and Novalis position
                  both the concept of the lever and their conceptual levers suggests a potential way
                  of navigating between (and avoiding) oversimplified tropes of both the organic and
                  the mechanical, even if their respective approaches are not precisely the same. In
                  fact, they seem to be homing in on common ground from two different angles: Novalis,
                  through a connection of the lever with the individual, and Schlegel, through a connection
                  between the lever and the conceptual landscape of the intellect. As we will see, the
                  meeting point of these two perspectives will be the fulcrum, which will also provide
                  the most ambitious testing ground for the Romantic concept of system.</p>

                              the explanation provided in Pappus on the etymology of the hypomochlion: ‘when people
                              wanted to move a very heavy body, since the first thing they needed in moving it was
                              to lift it from the ground, and there was no handle by which to handle it, because
                              all parts of its bottom were on the ground, they had to find some way for this, and
                              so they dug a small hole in the ground under the heavy body and took a long pole and
                              put its end into the hole and pressed down the other end, and the burden came up (or

                     </div> From a mathematical perspective, the hypomochlion is a point of mediation on the lever
                     itself and embodies the dynamic cancellation and maintenance of opposing forces; to
                     think again with Luhmann, one could say that the hypomochlion encompasses a distinction
                     and neutralizes it at the same time. In terms of thinking about systems, the hypomochlion
                     acquires a priveleged status: it is the smallest conceivable model in which distinctions
                     continue to be produced and, accordingly, is the smallest possible representation
                     of the system itself. These aspects of the Romantic incorporation of the hypomochlion
                     into their thinking about systems can be brought into even sharper relief against
                     the backdrop of Eschenmayer’s and Schelling’s nature philosophy.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Eschenmayer’s initial definition of the lever and the hypomochlion, to which Novalis
                  refers in his notes, is simple enough as stated in the <em>Säze</em>: “We can imagine the arms of a lever as two moments and regard the hypomochlion as
                  the point in which both moments work against each other” (Wir können uns die Aerme
                  eines Hebels mit ihren Kräften als zwei Bewegungsgrössen vorstellen, und das Hypomochlion
                  als den Punkt ansehen, in welchem beide Grössen gegeneinander wirken) (xiv). This
                  is essentially the same as the definition in Gehler’s <em>Physikalisches Wörterbuch</em> cited at the beginning of the paper; like Gehler’s, Eschenmayer’s definition refers
                  to a mathematical lever with no regard to material constraints. In the course of his
                  nature-philosophical investigations over the next two decades, however, Eschenmayer
                  will eventually consider ideas that would not be found in Gehler’s dictionary because
                  they involve a speculative use of the lever (and the hypomochlion) as a model for
                  activities of the mind: “1) The opposition between knowledge and being is expressed
                  in the objective opposition between force and weight. 2) Mediation in the self is
                  expressed in the hypomochlion of the lever. 3) The equation of knowledge and being
                  is expressed through the relative equilibrium of weight and force” (<em>Psychologie</em> 448). These ideas, published in an 1817 volume devoted to empirical, pure, and applied
                  psychology, may seem far removed from the current thinking about the lever around
                  1800, but we can see an analogous trajectory already developing in Schelling’s <em>System of Transcendental Idealism</em> (1800).</p>
               <p>Schelling’s reference to the lever occurs in the context of a discussion that resists
                  an easy summary but which can be characterized as an attempt to describe the ego (<span class="foreign">das Ich</span>) as a product of opposed operations within the framework of self-consciousness. Schelling
                  describes such a product as both real and inactive (<span class="foreign">als ein reelles Unthätiges, oder als ein unthätiges Reelles</span>) ( <em>System</em> 101). It is both “mere matter” and a “product of the imagination” which is only important
                  as a medium (<em>Mittelglied</em>) (101). Schelling claims that “All matter is mere expression of an equilibrium of
                  opposed operations which reduce each other reciprocally to a mere substrate of operation”
                  (101). In other words, the stability of the material world relies upon a relative
                  equilibrium of forces whose differences, once sublated, cease to be immediately apparent.
                  At this point he introduces the comparison to the mechanical lever: “One should consider
                  the lever, both weights operate only on the hypomochlion which is also the common
                  substrate of their operation” (101). The hypomochlion therefore embodies both the
                  conflict and the potential resolution of differences. Schelling goes one step further,
                  however, to link what could be described as a purely material model, applicable to
                  any physical context, more directly to a model of consciousness: “What is more, that
                  substrate does not emerge accidentally through free production but rather completely
                  automatically by virtue of a third operation that is as necessary as the identity
                  of the self-consciousness” (101). Schelling contextualizes this idea with reference
                  to the chapter heading, which states that opposed operations of self-consciousness,
                  insofar as they inform a third operation, create something common between them. After
                  his reference to the lever, Schelling directly equates this “common” element with
                  a “<em>construction of the ego itself</em>, not as <em>mere </em>object but rather as subject and object at the same time” (102).</p>
               <p>What the above examples from Eschenmayer and Schelling show is that, in nature-philosophical
                  thinking around 1800, the lever is removed from purely mechanical contexts and is
                  deployed as a model for both the self in general and the emergence of self-consciousness.
                  This model will eventually receive its most radical formulation in the psychological
                  theory of Johann Herbart, who attempts with great mathematical rigor to use the lever
                  and its law of equilibrium to model the recollection and suppression of thoughts in
                  the brain (a topic for another day). Returning to the state of affairs around 1800,
                  we can see that both Schlegel and Novalis have something more to contribute to the
                  analogy between the lever and the individual. With an emphasis on a balance of forces,
                  Novalis also considers the lever as a model for consciousness when he refers to “the
                  temper of consciousness” as “maintained rest,” a “static force,” and “a <em>constant quantity </em>in continuous change (fulcrum on the lever)” (3:836). In keeping with the lever’s
                  function as mediator between opposing forces, it is interesting to see how this figure
                  of balance and reciprocity informs Novalis’ thinking in a more general sense: not
                  only does Novalis “apply” the lever heuristically in new contexts, he also uses these
                  same contexts for further reflection about the lever’s mechanical law. In another
                  aphorism that begins with a reference to Plotinus’ idea of memory as the “lowest force
                  of the soul—the basis of the others,” Novalis shows that, in addition to using the
                  lever as an analogy for the operations of the mind, he can also use this model for
                  further thinking about scientific theory: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">(Opposition of <em>Basis</em>, a concept that relates to weight, and <em>lever</em> (from lifting) which relates to counter-weight) (New deduction of the lever from

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> If we read these aphorisms in conjunction with the one where Novalis refers to his
                  idea of “the principle of personality in every substance—or the force of the hypomochlion”
                  (<em>Schriften</em> 3:574), i.e., as a way of approaching physics, then at the very least there is mounting
                  evidence for a model of the individual where the physics of the lever plays an important
                  role (without, however, being reduced to a “mechanistic” philosophy in the older sense
                  of the term). Other aphorisms, particularly those by Schlegel, go even further. In
                  the same one where Schlegel attests that “the lever is extremely important for the
                  theory of construction,” he writes that every universe has its own hypomochlion (18:170).
                  And with reference to the hypomochlion as a figure of unified heterogeneity, he states
                  that “the center of every universe [is] perhaps <em>doubled</em> [and] actually <em>heterogeneous</em>. One from two, two at the same time from different orders” (18:171). What is true
                  for the macrocosm holds true for the microcosm as well: the “active, free human is
                  his own hypomochlion” (18:171). Here, more clearly than ever, Schlegel rewrites the
                  Archimedean fantasy of the mighty lever by replacing it with a model that seems, at
                  first glance, to be counterintuitive. For Schlegel, freedom is—among other things—the
                  freedom from being indebted to any instrumental augmentation of power. The distinction
                  between human agency and tool has been completely internalized to the point that human
                  agency has been conceived in terms of a mechanical function. Far from being a philosophically
                  reactionary maneuver, however, the identification of the individual with the hypomochlion
                  does not present, in its sheer punctuality, any impediment to organic models of growth
                  and generation. If anything, removing instrumental agency eases the way for autopoietic
                  growth.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of the most significant aspects of the hypomochlion as it is incorporated into
                     Romantic thinking—apart from the ease with which it can be moved across scale, from
                     the universe to the individual—is its ability to embody “duplicity” in a literal sense
                     without losing its integral “simplicity” as a point. In the hypomochlion, differences
                     are sublated (<span class="foreign">aufgehoben</span>) in that they are removed, maintained, and held up.

                              Hegel integrates the mechanical law of the lever into his discussion of Aufhebung.</span></div>
                     </div> If, as Novalis suggests, the true individual is also a true “dividual” (<em>Dividuum</em>) (3:451), then the hypomochlion (and the lever) provide a model to illustrate how
                     this idea need not be self-contradictory, because both identity and difference can
                     be preserved. We have come a long way from Gehler’s definition of the lever as a “fixed
                     and inflexible connection,” but Novalis is willing to go even further in his thinking
                     about the lever when he suggests removing both the “fixed lines” <em>and</em> “point of support” such that the lever is now simply to be explained by the theory
                     of force alone (3:470). As a physical idea it is not entirely clear what Novalis has
                     in mind without a corresponding proof; as a philosophical model, however, Novalis’
                     proposal raises intriguing possibilities. If Novalis is referring to the point of
                     support in the context of the physical lever, then perhaps he has decided to appropriate
                     it indefinitely for the mathematical model where the fulcrum is, for all intents and
                     purposes, part and parcel of the lever, bringing Novalis’ model of the lever that
                     much closer to a model of a system that is self-sustaining.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion: the mechanics of Romantic systems</span></h2>
               <p>The equation of the hypomochlion with the individual—and with the system—has ramifications
                  for our understanding of German Romanticism. In the wake of the mechanistic philosophy
                  of the eighteenth century, and the perception that Romanticism distances itself both
                  from this philosophy and from related figures of thought, the incorporation of perhaps
                  <em>the</em> most important central concept from classical mechanics into a model of the subject
                  should not be underestimated. At the same time, it seems clear that the presence of
                  the hypomochlion is no real threat to the organic models that inform Schlegel’s and
                  Novalis’ thinking. Instead, Romantic system-organs, when examined in terms of their
                  smallest components, begin to resemble a mechanical assemblage where the fulcrum of
                  the lever is the figure that defines the smallest possible—and paradoxically also
                  the largest possible—unit.</p>
               <p>This suggests that a more nuanced view is required to understand precisely how a “mechanical”
                  component can be embedded in Romantic nature-philosophical systems. Perhaps it is
                  the elementary quality of the hypomochlion as a figure of individual duality that
                  has allowed it to exist under the radar. Whereas an overt system of multiple levers
                  would invariably recall older, contested models of the clockwork universe, a single
                  lever—or even less than that, a single hypomochlion (and if Novalis has his way, perhaps
                  even less than that: a mere tension of forces)—allows for mechanical theory to function
                  uncontested in a less restrictive environment.</p>
               <p>Although figures of part and whole are central to Romantic thought, the hypomochlion
                  possesses a unique mobility. It bridges conceptual work of the encyclopedia project
                  and Romantic subject philosophy, equally at home as a model of consciousness, as a
                  description of the individual, as a conceptual link between concepts drawn from different
                  disciplines, and as a figure of cosmological reach. As the embodiment of agency without
                  instrumentality, the hypomochlion is indebted to a model of the lever built upon pure
                  relationality. Without a hand to direct it, it becomes organic and self-guiding, even
                  as it remains figure of unified “dividuality.” In other words, the hypomochlion’s
                  defining feature is the preservation of a distinction which allows it, with absolute
                  succinctness, the potential of becoming a system unto itself.</p>

               “Natural Science and the Romanticisms”

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Garber’s essay in the Cambridge History of Science devoted to Early Modern science
               emphasizes the importance of the Cartesian idea, as expressed in the <em>Principia philosophiae</em>, that such an understanding of the machine-like functioning of the universe allows
               the understanding of one part to be extrapolated to the whole: “In this way, the image
               of the macrocosm and the microcosm, central to chymical philosophies and Renaissance
               naturalism, found its way into mechanism after a fashion. For the mechanical philosopher,
               as for the chymist and the Renaissance naturalist, what happens at one level reflects
               and is reflected by what happens at every other level” (Garber 44), a perspective
               which also plays a role in the Romantic appropriation of the lever.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Begriff der negativen Größen in die Weltweisheit einzuführen,” where he writes, with
               reference to the lever’s law of equilibrium, that it is a concept one can extend “weit
               über die Grenzen der materialen Welt” (55). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Around 1800, the concept of “indifference” took root in the sciences. It is commonly
               associated with Schelling’s discussion of magnetism in his nature-philosophy, having
               based his understanding of the term in part on the work of Dutch scientist Anton Brugmans,
               who describes a plane of indifference between the two poles of the magnet. In his
               <em>Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie</em> (1799), Schelling describes a state of indifference as one where natural phenomena
               exist with the forces acting upon them in balance, which can be considered as an analogous
               phenomenon to a lever in a state of equilibrium. See esp. Bernhard Rang, <em>Identität und Indifferenz. Eine Untersuchung zu Schellings Identitätsphilosophie</em> Frankfurt: Klostermann, 2000, for a more detailed discussion of Schelling’s use of
               indifference. This antiquated concept of the magnet was replaced by magnetic fields
               after Ritter’s death (and later by quantum theory).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>The Mechanical Technology of Greek and Roman Antiquity</em>, A. G. Drachmann quotes the explanation provided in Pappus on the etymology of the
               hypomochlion: <span class="quote">‘when people wanted to move a very heavy body, since the first thing they needed in
                  moving it was to lift it from the ground, and there was no handle by which to handle
                  it, because all parts of its bottom were on the ground, they had to find some way
                  for this, and so they dug a small hole in the ground under the heavy body and took
                  a long pole and put its end into the hole and pressed down the other end, and the
                  burden came up (or ‘became small’). Then they placed under this pole a stone which
                  is called ibumahliun [hypomochlion] and that means that which is placed under the
                  lever, and they pressed down again and the burden became much lighter (or ‘was lifted
                  higher up’). And as the power became known, it was understood that it was possible
                  to move in this way great burdens. (52)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
