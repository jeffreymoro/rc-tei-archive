        <p rend="noCount">This essay examines two interrelated strategies Shelley uses to conceive
          of the systemic context for individual agency. In both cases, Shelley portrays agency as

          weather as a global system that is subject to local variability. Comparing the movement of
          weather to the movement of ideas, Shelley postulates that systemic change occurs when air

          <p>Like many of his fellow Romantics, Shelley aimed to change the system. To call his
            target “the system” might sound a bit anachronistic, but Clifford Siskin sets the origin
            of this usage—of system as the totality of things as they are—in the Romantic period
            (“Novels” 202). For Shelley, the “system” includes the kind of combined economic and
            political institutions that limit human possibility, whether in medieval Venice in
              <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, in the Ottoman Empire in <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, or at home in Britain in “The Mask of Anarchy.” But the insidious
            danger of a system is that it extends from these social and political institutions to
            form the worldviews and expectations of a population. Successful revolution therefore
            requires a change in the public mind alongside changes in political structure. Shelley
            hoped to exert agency within such a totality, and in <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title> he asks how an individual can exert any change in a system and an
            associated way of thinking that are all encompassing. In <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, I argue, Shelley imagines that the best chance for change comes from
            creating “pauses” in the system. Pauses allow for some limited freedom for agency and
            change without falling prey to the self-defeating illusion that individuals control the
            direction and pace of social change. At moments when the system pauses, Shelley awaits a
            future audience to read and carry forward his ideas. And once he has conceived change in
            this way, his own poetry becomes a tool that—in its formal techniques and
            interventions—is capable of inciting a slow, gradual process of change. </p>
          <p>In this paper, I examine two interrelated strategies Shelley uses to conceive of the
            systemic context for individual agency. In both cases, Shelley portrays agency as moving
            or acting upon air. First, drawing on new scientific accounts, Shelley examines the
            weather as a global system that is subject to local variability. Comparing the movement
            of weather to the movement of ideas, Shelley postulates that systemic change occurs when
            air from a “free” region—represented in the poem by the ocean—moves into and temporarily
            disrupts air that has been tainted by despotic social and political structures. </p>
          <p>In this analogy, weather provides a model for the action of poetry because air is the
            medium through which the poet acts on readers by literally changing their breath. And
            the second way Shelley explores the possibility of systemic change is through adopting
            and altering poetic form to move readers’ breath. Poetic form proves such an important
            resource for Shelley not only because it shapes readers’ breathing to its metrical
            patterns but because it carries forms from the past—forms that have outlasted their
            original historical moment—into the future. As Andrew Franta argues, for Shelley “poetry
            is a process defined as much by its transmission from one generation to the next as the
            immediate circumstances that govern its production and reception,” and “this long-term
            view of the process of writing . . . claims for poetic form itself the privilege of a
            future perspective on the present” (113). For Shelley, particular poetic forms provide
            one resource for stepping outside of one’s own era, into both the past that originated
            forms and the future that will continue to adapt them. Literature is not a system of its
            own nor part of “the system” because it adopts forms and genres that outlast the
            historical systems that produced them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miranda Burgess
              and Robert Kaufman both suggest that Romantic-era literature critiques the dominant
              political-economic system. Kaufman revises Luhmann’s model of system to suggest that
              literature served a functionally differentiated system of its own (18); Burgess argues
              that Romantic writers resisted defining literature as systematic (10-14). Shelley, I’m
              arguing, defines system through the more totalizing definition of system that Siskin
              traces to the Romantic era and sees literary form as providing a position from which
              to stand outside of the system. On Shelley’s vision of the temporality of change, see
              Mitchell 163-203.</note> And when they are utilized in a new literary and historical
            context, literary forms provide a way of creating the gaps and pauses that Shelley
            thinks provide the opportunity for systemic change. The temporal distance of poetic
            form, then, means that form allows the poet a position from which to step outside the
            “system,” defined as the totality of society itself. Working within the constraints of
            the Spenserian stanza and taking advantage of the possibilities for pauses and caesuras
            it provides, Shelley makes air itself signify in what he imagines is a politically
            effective way, namely as opening literal sound gaps in an oppressive political order. As
            Shelley sees it, the Spenserian stanza’s pauses provide a structure for change even if
            the (conservative) politics of Spenser’s own <title level="m">Faerie Queene</title> did
            not recognize this potential. And in exploring Shelley’s interwoven ways of imagining
            air—one working within the global weather system, the other using a temporally distanced
            form to leverage pauses in the system—I track how Shelley envisions his own poetic forms
            as a source of potential future change. </p>

        <div type="section">
          <head>Revolutionary Pauses</head>
          <p>In an 1817 letter, Shelley suggests that he writes <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title> to portray “the <foreign>beau ideal</foreign> as it were of the French
            Revolution” through the story of a Greek revolt against the Ottoman Turks. As multiple
            commentators have noted, the “revolution” in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> is
            not “ideal” in the sense of successful.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See especially
              Cian Duffy, who notes that Shelley’s concept of “beau ideal” resembles his idea of
              “intellectual beauty” (171). </note> The revolt fails when surrounding nations’ armies
            come to the despot’s aid, slaughtering the remaining rebels and ushering in famine and
            plagues that decimate the population; the hero and heroine are murdered at the stake.
            The poem presents an ideal revolution, then, in the sense that it demonstrates how
            revolutions arise and why they fail, and defends even failed revolutions as necessary
            steps in human progress. In the case of the French Revolution and the Greek revolt in
              <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, the system of despotism is too strong for
            any individual revolt to succeed for long. </p>
          <p>But Shelley suggests that revolutions inevitably fail not only because despots lend
            each other armies but because individuals who grow up surrounded by tyranny do not know
            how to embrace freedom. When revolutionaries acquire power, then, they only know how to
            use it despotically. In the preface to <title level="m">Laon and Cythna, </title>
            Shelley argues that the people’s very difficulty in acquiring genuine freedom
            demonstrates why tyranny is so pernicious: “if the revolution had been in every respect
            prosperous, then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our
            abhorrence” (101). The French Revolution failed not because its goals were incorrect but
            because it attempted large-scale social change too quickly. In <title level="m">A
              Philosophical View of Reform</title> and elsewhere, Shelley therefore argues for
            gradual change, which he says will allow people to learn the responsibilities of
            freedom. </p>
          <p>Shelley casts his “ideal French Revolution” as a Spenserian romance, and also moves the
            rebellion from France to Greece. The romance genre offers Shelley a way of conceiving
            individuals acting for broader social classes and nations. Shelley reinterprets the
            genre to ask how any individual can effect change within a system whose coherence and
            all pervasiveness is an essential part of its power. But the Spenserian romance and the
            Spenserian stanza also themselves offer a case study for Shelley in gradual change, and
            in working within (but extending) both literary tradition and the “forms” of the day.
            Shelley’s subtitle for <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, “A Vision of the
            Nineteenth Century in the Stanza of Spenser,” emphasizes both the potential disjunction
            between Spenser’s day and the “nineteenth century” and the potential of genres to find
            new meaning in a new time. After Byron used the stanza form in his bestselling <title
              level="m">Childe Harold</title>, the Spenserian stanza indeed became to some degree a
            “form” of Shelley’s day. Nevertheless, as Greg Kucich has argued, Shelley’s decision to
            adopt Spenser’s stanza form is somewhat surprising, given his opposition to Spenser’s
            religious and monarchical politics. And Shelley takes more than just a stanza form from
            Spenser. The plot of Shelley’s poem correlates with Book One of the <title level="m"
              >Faerie Queen</title>, albeit revising several monarchical elements of Spenser’s plot
            into a more republican light (Kucich 272).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On
              Shelley’s revisions to Spenserian romance, see also Duff and Hubbell. </note> In
            choosing a Spenserian stanza form even as he distances himself from Spenser’s politics,
            Shelley suggests that change accrues through making small adjustments in the existing
            poetic tradition. Spenser’s stanzas will in Shelley’s hands invoke the kind of change
            that their most famous practitioner neither sought nor foresaw. And the anachronistic
            endurance of Spenser’s forms from the past remind us of the potential power of Shelley’s
            forms to stir change in ways he could not foresee. Form, precisely because no poet is
            the author of forms, allows a poem to stand in the past, present, and even future
            simultaneously. </p>
          <p>When Shelley explains why he decided to write <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>
            in Spenserian stanzas, however, he sets aside his interests in systemic political change
            and attributes his decision solely to aesthetics. First, he suggests, he found the
            Spenserian stanza form more forgiving than other forms: in Milton’s blank verse there is
            “no shelter for mediocrity.” And second, he suggests, “I was enticed also by the
            brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical
            thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure”
            (104). Shelley aestheticizes political concerns throughout <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>. But I will argue that Shelley uses the pause for a political as well
            as aesthetic purpose and that the pause encapsulates the poem’s strategy for intervening
            in the political and social systems it indicts. </p>
          <p>The pause illustrates one way in which a formal intervention creates the opportunity
            for systemic change without tyrannically determining the direction of that change. As
            many readers have noted, Shelley calls poets the “legislators of the world” and argues
            that they will stir the dead leaves, implant the seeds, and light the sparks of future
            change (to cite metaphors used in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> and more
            famously in the “Defence of Poetry” and “Ode to the West Wind”) but yet insists that
            poets cannot know the form this change will take; poets cannot see how the future will
            use or transform their ideas. Shelley portrays this kind of indirect agency in <title
              level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> when Cythna and the Hermit, each inspired by Laon’s
            words and actions, spread his ideas and incite revolt. Cythna in particular applies
            Laon’s ideas to a new and particular goal, arguing that women and slaves should rebel
            against domestic tyranny. Because Shelley emphasizes that future readers will shape his
            ideas, in the preface to <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> he claims that he does
            not write didactic poetry, but rather hopes “to awaken the feelings, so that the reader
            should see the beauty of true virtue, and be incited to those inquiries which have led
            to my moral and political creed, and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the
            world” (100).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Critics have debated whether Shelley’s
              vision turns didactic despite his stated goals. Ulmer calls the poem didactic (56).
              White suggests that Shelley was aware that a poem showing scenes of pedagogy risks
              didacticism and in Canto 1 “appears devoted to aestheticizing these pedagogical
              scenes, replacing language with what the poet-narrator calls ‘melody’ (289) and
              didacticism with imaginative communion,” as he seeks “truth without reference” (133,
              134). </note> And as Deborah Elise White has argued, because Shelley wants to locate
            meaning in the future but cannot see the future, he resists language’s referentiality
            (103). Speaking through pauses, poetic form provides a way in which poetry can
            communicate non-semantically, non-representationally, and without specifying a
            determinate vision. Moreover, in Shelley’s use, the pause thematizes the moments in
            which speech or action awaits interpretation, in which listeners will either adopt or
            revise or reject the poet’s ideas. In <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, I’ll
            argue, Shelley uses the pause to model how one agent may transmit a revolutionary idea
            in a system pervasively inimical to such a view, and how form provides the resources for
            such systemic change. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
          <head>Moving the air</head>
          <p> Throughout <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, Shelley compares the thoughts and
            movements of characters to weather phenomena. In Canto II, which describes how Laon
            first develops an awareness of the possibilities of freedom even while living amongst
            Ottoman tyranny, Shelley is particularly aware of air currents. Laon is able to grasp an
            idea of human possibility even within tyranny for two reasons. First, the Greek ruins
            “speak” to him, providing visual evidence that there was in the past, and might someday
            be again, a different political and social order, that “such man has been, and such may
            yet become!” (766). And second, he literally grows up in different air: on the coast, at
            the edge of land and sea, he watches “o’er the still sea and jagged islets. . . the
            light of moonrise” and “the clouds near the horizon driven” (750-1, 752). Because long
            oppression has turned his fellows “evil,” he is the only one who “wandered forth / to
            see or feel” nature (699, 708-9). But it is the sea air and the ancient towers that
            provide Laon both a way of reaching out of the current tyrannical atmosphere and a
            content to transmit. </p>
          <p>I’m interested in Shelley’s discussion of oceans, air currents, and weather more
            generally because Shelley uses descriptions of weather to consider what it means to live
            as part of a system and how it might be possible to see outside of the social and
            political system that shapes an individual. As Mary Favret has compellingly argued, the
            Romantic period saw a change in the scientific understanding of weather; the classical
            idea of weather as deriving from the peculiar geographical or topographical features of
            a specific place became less important than a model in which weather was a global
            system, in which air and moisture moved from place to place so that one place’s weather
            would become another’s.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a complete discussion of
              the changing scientific understanding of weather, see also Janković 126-30.</note> For
            Favret, weather then calls attention to mediation. In <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, Shelley sees the weather as part of a global system and describes the
            motion of people and ideas through cloud metaphors. He compares the gathering rebels to
            “clouds inwoven in the silent sky / By winds from distant regions meting there”
            (3568-9). And when the foreign-born armies begin their killing rampage, Shelley
            describes them too as clouds: “The infantry, file after file, did pour / Their clouds on
            the utmost hills” (3888-9). In both cases, the cloud metaphors emphasize that the people
            move as a part of a transnational political system. And while clouds can transmit either
            tainted or “free” air, Shelley envisions Laon, like the clouds, moving clean ocean air
            to inland regions and “human thought” from its source to the listening masses. Laon
            comes closest to describing himself as a cloud when he leaves the Hermit and travels to
            the rebellion-in-progress. Although he does not here adopt meteorological language, his
            motion is cloud-like: “O’er many a mountain-chain which rears / Its hundred crests
            aloft, my spirit bears / My frame, o’er many a dale and many a moor (1696-8). He
            continues moving like a cloud in the next stanza: “My powers revived within me, and I
            went / As one whom winds waft o’er the bending grass, / Through many a vale of that
            broad continent” (1702-4). In describing both individuals and armies as clouds, Shelley
            suggests that they can transmit new air to a locality, but he also underlines the
            difficulty of escaping the kind of global system in which despots support each others’
            regimes. </p>
          <p>The ocean has a particular status in Shelley’s interlocking models of meteorological
            and sociopolitical systems because it is part of the global weather system but somewhat
            independent of the socio-political system. Although certainly subject to claims of
            sovereignty and national dominance (Britannia, after all, aimed to “rule the waves”),
            the ocean is less governable than land. But Shelley solves this problem in
            correspondence between these two levels of systems by depicting the ocean as a source of
            both clouds and of the free thought or philosophical truth that cannot be perverted by
            politics. Shelley was highly observant of the clouds. Marilyn Gaull suggests that
            Shelley’s 1820 poem “The Cloud” likely relies on Luke Howard’s widely read 1803 <title
              level="m">Essay on Clouds, </title>which describes the transformation of clouds and
            defines the nomenclatures of cloud types still in use today (591). In “The Cloud,”
            Shelley describes the cloud’s motions as it forms from evaporated water, moves across
            spaces, and raises storms or dissipates: it “bring[s] fresh showers for the thirsting
            flowers, / From the seas and the streams” (1-2). He also emphasizes the importance of
            the ocean within this life cycle, as the vast repository for and ultimate destination of
            the water that forms clouds. Shelley depicts the ocean as the “geni” or “Spirit” that
            inspires the clouds’ motion: lightning is the “pilot” of the cloud, but the pilot is <quote><lg>
                <l>Lured by the love of the genii that move </l>

                <l>          The Spirit he loves remains (23-28). </l>
              </lg></quote> The “Spirit” of the ocean is a source for clouds in the same way that
            the “intellectual beauty” or the “source of human thought” to which Shelley refers in
            “Mont Blanc” feeds thought. But if the 1820 poem defines the ocean as the ultimate
            origin for clouds, Shelley also describes water evaporating from previous downpours. A
            local climate can transform the character of the water. But the global system that
            carries water from the ocean determines that ultimately water will return to its source,
            and the oceans themselves—subject to no single tyrant—remain the pure source.<note
              place="foot" resp="editors"> On the relationship of political system to environment in
              Shelley, see also Alan Bewell, who argues that for Shelley, “diseased environments are
              not the cause of social and political disorder but are their result” (217).</note>
            Even when the lightning “dreams,” and regardless of where the cloud goes, it retains a
            knowledge of its ocean origin.</p>
          <p> If the ocean is the “spirit,” or the “source of human thought,” it is also the source
            of Laon’s positive vision for humanity. Whether because it is the “origin” of moist air,
            or because oceans are less governable than land, ocean air communicates freedom. Even if
            tyranny fogs all land, the sea retains its own air. Shelley depicts Laon and Cythna
            taking in sea air and carrying it or breathing it back out. As we’ve seen, in Canto 2
            the sea air helps teach Laon to envision a more free humanity. In Canto 6 when Laon and
            Cythna retreat from the rebels’ losing battle to a Greek ruin on a rocky outcropping
            overlooking the ocean, they hear the “motion of water” when the steed carrying them
            “pause[s].” Shelley suggests that even if they soon lose awareness of their environment
            and “only heard, or saw, or felt the other,” their love for one another proves that they
            have absorbed “thoughts” from the “utmost Ocean / Of universal life” (2544, 2594-5). </p>
          <p> As Cythna later sits by herself overlooking the ocean, Shelley describes her
            internalizing the sea air to create her own “atmosphere”: <quote>
              <lg>
                <l>Her lips were parted, and the measured breath</l>
                <l>Was now heard there;—her dark and intricate eyes</l>
                <l>Orb within orb, deeper than sleep or death,</l>
                <l>Absorbed the glories of the burning skies,</l>
                <l>Which, mingling with her heart's deep ecstasies, </l>
                <l>Burst from her looks and gestures;—and a light</l>
                <l>Of liquid tenderness, like love, did rise</l>
                <l>From her whole frame,—an atmosphere which quite</l>
                <l>Arrayed her in its beams, tremulous and soft and bright. (4261-9)</l>
              </lg></quote> When Cythna “absorb[s] the glories of the burning skies,” she radiates
            in turn a “tremulous” atmosphere that sheds light on her. In the first two lines,
            Shelley describes her “measured breath” as if she is absorbing and then radiating poetry
            in order to create her new atmosphere. And Shelley puns on poetry’s ability to form
            reader’s breath when he inserts a double dash after the pause, “the measured breath /
            Was now heard there;--,” the “there” pointing to the space where the reader (like
            Cythna) breathes. Cythna and poetry alter the atmosphere by breathing out the ocean air,
            which is pure and free air, taken straight from the imaginative source. </p>
          <p> When describing the air on land, Shelley’s cloud metaphors often depict clouded
            thought, the pernicious ideas rooted in a system of tyranny, that prevent individuals
            from understanding or seizing the possibilities for human freedom: Shelley, for example,
            refers to “the cloud of that unutterable curse / Which clings upon mankind (932-3).
            Calling these misperceptions clouds suggests that they might dissipate: Cythna describes
            public opinion as “more frail / Than yon dim cloud now fading on the moon / Even while
            we gaze, though it awhile avail / To hide the orb of truth” (3271-5). But these clouds
            are dependent on the overall atmosphere, and so they “wither not” in a tyrannical
            climate (3455). Tyranny, Shelley suggests, literally creates a poisonous “atmosphere”:
            people cannot escape, either physically or mentally, the air that surrounds them. When
            Laon at the beginning of the poem attempts to educate his countrymen about their
            government’s tyranny, he at first succeeds: his thoughts like “vapours,” “invested with
            the light / of language” are “bright in the outspread morning’s radiancy,” and “all
            bosoms made reply” (805-8). However, Laon’s words are only “vapours” floating through
            the despotic atmosphere, and so as soon as the listeners breathe, they take in the old
            polluted air again. Laon recalls, “I could feel the listener’s senses swim / And hear
            his breath its own swift gaspings smother/ Even as my words evoked them” (813-15). When
            the air the listener breathes is tainted by despotism, breathing, the very act that
            keeps him alive, returns him to the structures that keep him in poverty and tyranny.
            Laon himself grew up in different air, in unpopulated regions, in nature and the liminal
            space of the seashore, and so received a different moral education. </p>
          <p>But even Laon himself must be careful how he shares his ideas, or his visions will
            oppress another. In Canto II, as Laon speaks to his listeners, “all things became /
            Slaves to my holy and heroic verse” (933-4). And when Laon shares his vision with
            Cythna, the “sway” of his thoughts was “gathering like a cloud / The very wind on which
            it rolls away” (938-9). At this moment, he imagines himself controlling the transmission
            of his own thoughts by passing them to his sister. Laon must learn to speak powerfully,
            and create air in which individuals can breathe freedom, without imposing his own vision
            of that freedom. For Shelley, ultimately the poet’s power comes precisely from not
            controlling the terms of his own transmission. And if Shelley aspires to have his own
            poetry do the work of clouds, moving moist ocean air to dry locations, he finds in the
            Spenserian stanza a resource and tool. </p>

          <head>Pausing with Spenser</head>
          <p>The Spenserian stanza’s rhyme scheme—ababbcbcc, with the first eight lines in iambic
            pentameter and the ninth line (the second line of the concluding couplet) an
            Alexandrine—is appropriate for a poem thematizing gradual change: the “b” rhyme at the
            end of the first quatrain is extended into a couplet, providing an initial resting point
            for the poem, which after moving forward to “c” then returns to “b” before ending with a
            “c” couplet. And even the finality of this “c” couplet is rendered less definite by the
            two lines’ uneven rhymes (iambic pentameter in line eight followed by an Alexandrine in
            line nine). As we’ve seen, however, in accounting for his choice of form, Shelley
            credits not any political use but rather the aesthetic qualities of the stanza’s pauses.
            The Spenserian stanza enables several kinds of pauses. The stanza dictates one caesura,
            in the middle of the Alexandrine in line nine. Since most of Shelley’s stanzas are
            end-stopped, he inserts pauses between stanzas. In the rhyme, the repetition of the “b”
            rhyme in the fourth and fifth lines can also create a brief pause, through a sense of
            elongation. Shelley also uses relatively frequent enjambment to create pauses in the
            iambic lines and occasionally moves the caesura in the Alexandrine. While Shelley may
            certainly appreciate the aesthetic variety of pauses, he also employs these pauses to
            comment on the conditions of and possibility for systemic change. </p>
          <p>For Shelley, a pause is not only a temporary stop, but a moment at which the poet
            awaits—and the outcome of his speech depends on—mediation. A “pause” stops action, but
            what happens next is determined by his listeners. When Shelley in the poem’s dedication
            to Mary suggests that “Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!” he means that
            truth—through his poetry, of course—temporarily speaks to humans. He depends on
            “mankind” to listen. When the hermit tells Laon about the revolution underway, he
            repeatedly describes the action as “paused”: the rebels have been victorious, but the
            Othman’s armies continue to resist. The hermit worries that without Laon’s intervention,
            the rebels, raised in a tyrannical political system, will themselves turn tyrants and
            seek revenge on the Othman’s soldiers. Laon must convince them to lay down their arms
            and escape from the system of violence. When Laon addresses the rebels, he describes the
            effect of his speech as pausing their passion: “Ah, ye are pale,—ye weep,—your passions
            pause,— / Tis well! ye feel the truth of love’s benignant laws” (1799-1800). Shelley
            follows Godwin in critiquing passion’s sway over reason and Holbach in suggesting that
            governments structure individuals’ passion.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Holbach
              argues that while passions are “necessary to the conservation of man”—and form through
              his “organization,” “habits,” and “education”—“government gives them play, conducts
              them towards to those objects, which it believes itself interested in making desirable
              to its subjects” (I, 105). </note> Freedom requires pausing this passion in order to
            substitute a law grounded in love for tyranny. Laon himself pauses (marked with double
            dashes) repeatedly in his speech. He stops their action but must rely on their own
            emotions to feel “love” rather than rage.</p>
          <p>It’s ironic that Shelley describes the rebels “weeping” even as their passions pause.
            In reading this scene, Timothy Morton notes not only Shelley’s critique of passion but
            his appeal to a non-verbal sympathy. The rebels are moved in part because Laon, scraped
            by a spear, is bleeding: “Full communication between creatures does not need the
            symbolization of sympathy in words: sympathy can be felt on the pulses, it is written in
            the heart.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Morton 113; on passion see esp. 125-6 and
              137-8.</note> Shelley also distinguishes here between passion, which would impose one
            person’s vision on another, and emotion that responds to and registers a shared
            humanity. “Weeping” and “love” recognize the demands of others in a way that “passion”
            does not. Similarly, when Laon stops the rebels from executing the Tyrant, the pause he
            induces allows the rebels to witness and be moved by a different kind of emotion, the
            child’s love for her father: <quote>
              <lg>
                <l> The murmur of the people, slowly dying</l>
                <l> Paused as I spake; then those who near me were, </l>
                <l>Cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying</l>
                <l> Shrouding his head, which now that infant fair</l>
                <l> Clasped on her lap in silence;--through the air,</l>
                <l>Sobs were then heard” (2026-8). </l>
              </lg></quote> Here, Laon’s speech readies the crowd for compassion, but it is the
            child’s love that stirs in the rebels “soft looks and speeches meet” (2034). In both of
            these instances the “pause” allows the crowd to connect emotionally with a scene taking
            place before it. Emotion then works in the manner Robert Mitchell describes, in which
            emotion is “understood as sights of intensity which enabled the emergence of something
            new” (20). The “pause” is effective first in stopping the systemic violence, but also in
            opening the space for individuals to recognize emotions of love and compassion that
            would offer a space from which to critique the system in which they have been formed.
            And in working through a “pause,” Laon has learned how to halt others’ passions without
            turning them into slaves of his own vision. </p>
          <p>Shelley envisions the pause as a bodily response. Thomas H. Ford has recently argued
            that the Romantics viewed air as the medium of poetry, with meter shaping its movements;
            when read out loud, poetry acts on the reader’s vocal column, reshaping air and
            determining when the reader will breathe.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Ford argues
              that “the idea that what rhythm arranges and patterns is atmosphere, is formed bodies
              of air, provides the basis for the poetics of <title level="m">Lyrical
              Ballads</title>, and indeed for the poetic age which that volume heralds” (460). Such
              an idea is possible in part because the term “atmosphere” begins in the late
              eighteenth century to refers to emotional and conceptual rather than merely physical
              environments (458). </note> Shelley puns on his control over the reader’s breath in
            one Alexandrine from <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>: he notes that “Victorious
            Evil” seeks to make women slaves “till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of
            scorn” (981). Here the line describes the way a political system teaches characters how
            to breathe as well as determining the character of the “atmosphere” they take in;
            placing the caesura after the word “breathe” calls our attention to the way that poetry,
            and not only despotism, teaches patterns of breath. Shelley envisions his poetry’s
            stresses and pauses literally shaping readers’ breath. And although Shelley most
            frequently thematizes his action on readers’ bodies in describing breath, he also draws
            poetry’s common association between metrical iambs and the human heartbeat. As Kirstie
            Blair notes, the heartbeat modeled meter both in its regular rhythm and the way that
            rhythm can vary because of emotional charge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Catherine
              Robson suggests that the connection of iamb and heartbeat was felt more prominently in
              a culture that emphasized memorization and performance of poetry, when reciters knew
              that they must calm their heartbeat to “glide into the mesmeric state of the reciter
              of the successfully memorized, fully internalized poem, when body and words beat as
              one in measured familiarity” (112). While <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> was
              too long to be memorized, reading the poem aloud could create similar effect. </note>
            A pause, for Shelley, would also momentarily stop the heartbeat to change its rhythm. </p>
          <p>The Spenserian stanza moves readers’ voices and breath between two different metrical
            patterns (pentameter and Alexandrine). More importantly, however, Shelley plays with the
            kind of change the pause invokes, and with the ability of meter to transform both
            readers’ bodies and literary form, by moving the typical pauses within the stanza, and
            most notably the caesura. While the vast majority of Shelley’s stanzas place the caesura
            in its standard spot, in the middle of the final Alexandrine line, he moves the pause to
            thematize the movement of social systems. When in Canto 5 Laon promises that the rebels
            will forgive the tyrant’s soldiers for murdering their compatriots, Shelley uses pauses
            to mark the change in spirit that forgiveness enables. Stanza X ends with a standard
            Alexandrine: “Ye stabbed as they did sleep—but they forgive ye now” (1809). Stanza XI
            moves the pause, and allows a reading of the line as trochaic before the pause, but
            iambic after: “Even as to thee have these done ill, and are forgiven!” (1818). When
            discussing the way soldiers act for despots, then, the line takes a rhythm that could
            seem irregular or, if we compare metrical beats to heartbeats, unnaturally distorted; it
            returns to iambs when the rebels show human sympathy and forgiveness. In both examples,
            the pause separates the soldier’s vindictive action from the forgiveness that
            demonstrates that the rebels have abandoned their tyrannical mindset and are ready to
            claim freedom. If Laon’s “pause” creates a systemic break, then, Shelley uses the
            metrical pause to evoke these breaks.</p>
          <p>In the execution scene in Canto 11, Shelley repeatedly moves the caesura to show a
            systematic change in people’s thinking, as the crowd’s sympathies waver between
            allegiance to state and religion and allegiance to Laon and Cythna. In this scene, Laon,
            Cythna, and the priest repeatedly “pause” each others’ actions. When Laon (here
            disguised as “the Stranger”) stops a man from killing him, Shelley emphasizes the
            systemic potential of his action by adding a pause to the line: the assailant “Sate
            silently—his voice then did the Stranger rear” (4004). Later, Cythna’s arrival pauses
            the execution in progress: “All thought [she] was God’s Angel come to sweep / The
            lingering guilty to their fiery grave,” and the masses turn to pray to Laon, whom they
            were about to burn at the stake (4520, 4522-3). As Cythna temporarily moves the social
            order, Shelley moves the caesura one half foot forward: the masses “With crushing panic,
            fled in terror’s altered mood’ (4530). The next stanza calls his effect a “pause,” and
            inserts an extra pause in the line between her arrival and the action it produces: “They
            pause, they blush, they gaze,--a gathering shout / Bursts like one sound” (4531-2). The
            priest then “check[s]” this “sudden rout” (4533-4). This stanza moves the final caesura
            forward as the priest moves the crowd back into the religious system: “‘But he misdeems
            / That he is wise whose wounds do only bleed / Inly for self.’—Thus thought that
            Christian Priest indeed” (4537-39). The subsequent stanza again moves the caesura as the
            priest makes his case for executing Cythna, even if this means reneging on their promise
            to Laon: “Is it mine/ To stand alone, when kings and soldiers fear, / A Woman? God has
            sent his other victim here” (4546-8). The revolt as a whole, we now see, was only (but
            still significantly) a pause in the history of tyranny. One final movement of the
            Alexandrine’s caesura occurs at the moment when the Tyrant’s (and Cythna’s) child dies,
            along with her mother: “The tyrant’s child fell without life or motion / Before his
            throne, subdued by some unseen emotion” (4592-3). After watching her mother die, the
            child exits the tyrant’s control through death.</p>
          <p>Shelley analyzes how listeners (and readers) learn from pauses when describing the
            effects of Cythna’s victory speech. Following their defeat of the Othman’s army, Cythna
            stands atop the victory altar to address the rebels. Shelley prints the text of her
            speech, but in the subsequent stanza describes her extra-linguistic communication: <quote>
              <lg>
                <l> Ere she had ceased, the mists of night entwining</l>
                <l>Their dim woof, floated o'er the infinite throng;</l>
                <l>She, like a spirit through the darkness shining,</l>
                <l>In tones whose sweetness silence did prolong,</l>
                <l>As if to lingering winds they did belong,</l>
                <l>Poured forth her inmost soul: a passionate speech</l>
                <l>With wild and thrilling pauses woven among,</l>
                <l>Which whoso heard, was mute, for it could teach</l>
                <l>To rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach. (2272-80)</l>
              </lg></quote> Cythna speaks through “pauses” in part because the atmosphere of tyranny
            has not completely dissipated. The return of “mists” and darkness at the opening of the
            stanza prefigures the return of despotic power. The enjambed line describing the mists
            “entwining / their dim woof” emphasizes tyranny’s enduring power by carrying the mists
            across lines. Cythna “shine[s]” through the mist of tyranny and improper thinking.
            Shelley again suggests tyranny’s pervasive control when he describes “the dreamlike
            music. . . . falling in pauses, . . . . Like beams through floating clouds on waves
            below,” as if people only hear music when the “clouds” of political despotism pause
            (2084-7). Cythna’s speech and the revolution itself, then, are merely a pause in the
            despotic order. But Cythna also speaks through “pauses” because Shelley
            characteristically describes silence as more powerful than language. Cythna’s speech, of
            course, is printed in the stanzas preceding this one, so neither Cythna nor Shelley are
            actually communicating without words. But the stanza suggests that nonverbal
            communication is even more powerful than the printed words because people are able to
            take a “silent” message as their own. In the penultimate line the pauses inserted before
            and especially after “mute”—“whoso heard, was mute, for it could teach”—briefly render
            the readers mute like the listeners. If listeners can only speak the language they
            learned under tyrannical rule, then they must be mute to hear Cythna’s message. The next
            stanza describes Cythna’s speech and the listeners’ necessary silence using metaphors
            Shelley will develop more famously in “Ode to the West Wind.” He compares Cythna’s voice
            to a “mountain stream,” her listeners to the “withered leaves of Autumn” that her voice
            sweeps into a bay; while her voice “sleeps / In the shadow of the shores” the leaves
            “wake / Under the wave;” her “speechless calm” incites this “living change” in the
            “multitude so moveless” (2281-9). </p>
          <p>In rendering her listeners “mute,” Cythna ironically speaks for freedom and stirs the
            conditions of freedom only in the act of silencing others. Such a teaching method,
            however, is compatible with Shelley’s insistence that the speaker neither imposes his or
            her ideas on listeners, nor determines the form they will take into the future. The
            message depends on the listeners’ “hearts.” The caesura in the final line occurs at the
            moment of transmission from Cythna to her listeners, between “rapture like her own” and
            “all listening hearts.” In a kind of chiasmus, the mute listeners “reach” for the
            “rapture” which Cythna’s pauses demonstrate, claiming her message as their own. Cythna
            must “pause” her listeners to enable their “hearts” to “reach.” Cythna’s effect on
            listeners’ hearts emphasizes once again that a pause allows individuals to respond with
            their own emotional reaction to the scene before them. But in making the “heart” the
            entity that learns from pauses, Shelley also depicts the body as the site of poetry’s
            teaching, as if Cythna’s pauses teach listeners’ hearts a new rhythm. </p>
          <p> Through her “wild and thrilling pauses,” Cythna speaks in the kind of extra-linguistic
            form that Shelley envisions continuing, free of specific referents, into the unknowable
            future. And in these lines, his puns reflect his argument that the stanza form provides
            the form that will endure; the form itself creates a pause. In the mid-stanza couplet
            beginning in line four, Shelley describes Cythna’s success as a speaker by the way her
            “tones” “linger” even beyond the words she speaks: “in tones whose sweetness silence did
            prolong, as if to lingering winds they did belong.” While tone is not a formal quality,
            Shelley’s comparison of her tone to “lingering” winds here calls our attention to the
            enduring effects of the Spenserian stanza in shaping Shelley’s lines. Not only does the
            “silence” “prolong” her tones (a nice hope, perhaps, for poetry’s transmission into the
            future), the stanza form demands that Shelley “prolong” the initial quatrain by turning
            the second “b” rhyme into a couplet, and to do so he adds a simile referring to the
            ur-Romantic trope for poetic inspiration, winds. Moreover, in these lines both the form
            and content comment on poetry’s ability to step outside of its time. Cythna’s voice is
            like “lingering winds” that delay the inevitable return of tyranny’s “mists,” and the
            line uses its self-consciously poetic wind simile in the midst of narration to create
            the couplet, denoting poetic form’s ability to link past, present, and future
            utterances. The metaphor of “lingering winds” in this first couplet also references the
            “b” rhymes’ back and forth movement between the “a” and “c”; the discussion of
            “prolonging” and “lingering,” then, ultimately argues for the lingering effects of
            stanza forms themselves. Because poets rely on future listeners to reinterpret their
            message, the poet’s forms (like Cythna’s tones) will “linger” even after her words. </p>
          <p> Cythna demonstrates the effects of form in a second sense when she circulates among
            the celebrating masses. Shelley next attributes the change she incites to her form,
            embodied in her person and her name. As Cythna circulates, Laon reports, the listeners
            “fed on her form,” and “ate, of Liberty, / And Hope, and Justice, and Laone’s name”
            along with their vegetarian, tyranny-free, banquet (2319, 2296-7). In Shelley’s model,
            form is like a vegetarian dinner, hurting no one, but also allowing individuals to take
            the ideas that Cythna represents and transform them, as a body transforms food into
            energy. Her name is a type of form because it aspires to form’s repeatability: she
            adopts the name from Laon and changes it, both by adding the feminized “e” and by
            inhabiting it to carry out her own actions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
              additional significances of the name Laone, see especially Nersessian 130.</note> Her
            name further becomes a form at the end of the rebellion, when multiple young men and
            women surrender to the executioners and die claiming to be “Laon” and “Laone.” For
            Shelley, turning an individual into a form does not mean making them the liberal
            isolated individual of political and economic theory, but rather allowing others to
            adopt and transform their identity. </p>
          <p>Shelley uses architectural ruins as another model for and instance of the way in which
            forms create structures that will support future change. In Canto 2, when Laon describes
            his first inklings of freedom, the ancient Greek ruins teach him to stand above and
            outside of the poisoned air surrounding him. When Laon envisions his future, he
            announces that he will be a tower: “and who shall stand / Amid the rocking earthquake
            steadfast still, / But Laon? On high Freedom’s desert land / A tower whose marble walls
            the leagued storms withstand!” (789-92). The Greek towers evoke both temporal and
            spatial distance from the present air and political systems. The towers were built in a
            different political system, and their height suggests that they reach above the polluted
            air of current tyranny.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Shelley recognizes that this
              claim might be illusion, however. When imprisoned for killing a soldier, Laon
              initially imagines that he is above the clouds, as if outside the tyrant’s political
              system: from his ancient “column” on the hill, “The islands and the mountains in the
              day / Like clouds reposed afar” (1239-40). But when he sees a boat, and remembers that
              it carries Cythna into slavery, he realizes that his sense of distance was in fact
              “frenzy” and “madness;” he does not “[know his] own misery” and remains in the grip of
              the tyrant’s political order (1238). </note> And the ruins are emblematic of form for
            Shelley not only because they indicate a distance from present political systems, but
            also because they are being transformed in the present, as they both fall apart and
            provide a scaffolding for natural vegetation. </p>
          <p> Shelley’s descriptions of the ruins emphasize the way in which nature has grown on,
            in, and through the built structures. Shelley suggests that the ruins enable the growth
            of nature and humanity in a way that the cities and the tyrannical political structures
            they host do not.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Lyndon Gladden reads
              Shelley’s vine-covered ruins as “liminal spaces in which elements of nature and
              civilization mix and meld together,” aiding and thematizing characters’ recuperation
              (246). Gladden argues that elsewhere in the poem Shelley “turns . . . to the natural
              world as a register for the unnatural condition of tyranny” (247).</note> But more
            crucially for my point, these descriptions observe what Robert Mitchell calls entwining,
            the way in which nature parasitically builds on past human structures.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> Mitchell, writing on Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Ruined
                Cottage</title>, describes entwining as demonstrating “nature’s colonizing
              negativity,” its tendency to “erase all remnants of human activity” (148). For
              Shelley, in contrast, it is important that the forms of the past are not completely
              erased, but remain as a scaffolding for the present. I nonetheless cite Mitchell’s
              term to call attention to the way in which Shelley’s vines, like Wordsworth’s in
              Mitchell’s description “rechanneled the powers of the dead, turning them in a
              different direction” (148). </note> For Shelley, this entwining demonstrates the
            present learning from and altering the past. When the Hermit takes Laon to a coastal
            tower to recover, Shelley calls the tower “A changeling of man’s art, nursed amid
            Nature’s brood”; the chamber is “tapestried” with “rare mosses,” and the openings in the
            lattices allow Laon to see the moon (1429-30, 1432). When Laon and Cythna retreat from
            the battle to the cliff over the sea, they take shelter in a ruin that has been
            similarly transformed by nature. On the roof of the hall, “fair clinging weeds with ivy
            pale did grow, / Clasping its gray vents with a verdurous woof” (2575-6). It is “from
            that lone ruin” that they can hear “the murmur of the motion / of waters” (2535-6). </p>
          <p>The ruin, in these stanzas, is the spatial equivalent of the pause, with holes that
            allow Laon and Cythna to view the stars and meteors, and that allow leaves to blow
            inside and vines to grow through its walls. The holes suggest that it is the very
            changes and evolutions of the past form that enable its visionary capacity. As the ruins
            themselves decay into and are transformed by nature, they lose some of their original
            context, and instead provide a glimpse of a natural world exterior to both the present
            and the past. “(By analog, we can think of the way Shelley’s use of the Spenserian
            stanza wrests it from its Elizabethan context). And the holes, then, transform the air
            from the atmosphere of tyranny surrounding Laon and Cythna to a transparent visual and
            aural medium, enabling them to see the sky and hear the ocean. </p>
          <p>Shelley’s reference to the meteor notably illustrates the way in which ruins allow a
            view of an “air” untainted by both past and present systems. In Shelley’s day, a
            scientific consensus had only recently emerged that meteors originated from outside of
            the earth (Janković 151). When Laon and Cythna, then, look “through a rent / Of the
            ruin” to see “from the morass, / A wandering Meteor by some wild wind sent,” Shelley
            once again implicitly argues that decayed old forms and the pauses or air they structure
            allow Laon and Cythna (and poets and readers) to see outside of the political system and
            the “atmosphere” it produces (2615-17). Tying “rent” and “sent” together in rhyme
            intensifies the connection between the hole in the ruin and the meteor it allows Laon
            and Cythna to view. Like the oceans, this meteor derives from outside the
            socio-political system in a manner that resembles the ideal sources of Shelley’s
            philosophy. And the knowledge it provides Laon and Cythna is illustrated through the
            sexual union (against custom) of brother and sister: “The Meteor showed the leaves on
            which we sate, / And Cythna’s glowing arms, and the thick ties / Of her soft hair” as
            well as her “deepening eyes,” “marble brow, and eager lips” (2623-6, 2630). I read
            Shelley’s ruins, then, as a register of the way in which form, as a decayed and
            transformed past structure, provides the “rents” that allow us to see outside of our
            atmosphere. </p>
          <p>Shelley calls attention to the specifically poetic resonance of this formal structure
            in the next stanza when he describes the ruin as a resting place for dead leaves: <quote><lg>
                <l> The autumnal winds, as if spell-bound, had made</l>
                <l> A natural couch of leaves in that recess,</l>
                <l> Which seasons none disturbed, but in the shade</l>
                <l> Of flowering parasites did Spring love to dress</l>
                <l> With their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness</l>
                <l> Of those dead leaves, shedding their stars, whene’er</l>
                <l> The wandering wind her nurslings might caress;</l>
                <l> Whose intertwining fingers ever there </l>
                <l>Made music wild and soft that filled the listening air. (2578-86)</l>
              </lg></quote> The ruin provides a space for the leaves to gather and to support
            “flowering parasites” in the Spring. Shelley’s description of the flowers and “music
            wild” suggests the wind, ruin, and leaves together make new poetry from the detritus of
            the past. Calling the fallen flower blossoms “stars” emphasizes their origin in an
            exterior time (distant like the heavens), and credits this distance for their beauty.
            But Shelley also emphasizes that poems support future change, as the wind considers the
            leaves the “nurslings” of future times. The ruins of Shelley’s poetic structures can
            also accrue new generations of dead leaves, and new blooms that array themselves
            parasitically on the support of old forms. Nancy Moore Goslee suggests that the ruins,
            like Romantic fragment poems, “tempt us to imagine a completion; yet such completions
            have a conjectural openness that might differ radically from controlling intentions,
            whether individual or cultural” (71). Shelley in particular imagines future readers
            completing his forms when his poems too become ruins. </p>
          <p>During Laon’s execution Shelley implicitly compares him to towers, asking to what
            degree his death transforms his action into a form. Laon observes the surrounding towers
            from atop his execution pyre: <quote><lg>
                <l> I, Laon, led by mutes, ascend my bier</l>
                <l> Of fire and look around; each distant isle</l>
                <l> Is dark in the bright dawn; towers far and near,</l>
                <l>Pierce like reposing fames the tremulous atmosphere. (4491-4)</l>
              </lg></quote> Laon’s bier is like the towers that seem to “flame” in the atmosphere.
            As Laon literally burns into a ruin himself, he also becomes a tower, both in his
            elevated height and in his evocation of a message that does not fit his times. And the
            flames of both Laon’s execution and of the sun shining on the islands renders the
            atmosphere “tremulous;” the smoke that kills Laon, then, alters the atmosphere, and
            Shelley sees in the atmosphere the kind of vibration that turns air into a medium,
            rendering it capable of transmitting Laon’s vision even through the systematic tyranny
            surrounding him. Literally, of course, this is the effect of the smoke. But Laon and
            Cythna, in voluntarily standing (and dying) in opposition to the despot’s political
            system, bring on this smoke. And even in death, the ruined Laon may inspire others as he
            had been inspired by Greek ruins. </p>
          <p>One of Shelley’s linguistic structures for moving the caesura illustrates the way in
            which form provides a scaffolding for individual agency. Shelley in several places moves
            the caesura by placing either a name or a noun referring to the characters, set off by
            commas, in the first feet of an Alexandrine line. For example, after Laon narrates how
            his best friend turned against him, he addresses Cythna: “Since kin were cold, and
            friends had now become / Heartless and false, I turned from all, to be, / Cythna, the
            only source of tears and smiles to thee” (853-5). In Canto 11 Shelley sets off the name
            “Laon” in describing the procession leading Laon to his execution: “I’the midst appears
            / Laon,--exempt alone from mortal hopes and fears.” In both examples, setting off the
            name also marks the character’s exclusion from their larger communities, both because of
            their separate vision and (in Laon’s case) impending death. Shelley also occasionally
            uses this positioning to mark identities which also carve people out of the mainstream,
            such as “a woman” and “an atheist.” The final appearance of this pattern occurs when the
            child speaks to Laon after their death, and announces that she belongs to him as well as
            to Cythna. This time the line carves a space for a small group, a “we”: “again / We
            meet, exempted now from mortal fear or pain” (4664-5). In each case, placing the name at
            the beginning of the line either definitely moves the caesura (leaving the remainder of
            the line to be read like iambic pentameter) or adds a second caesura.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> Shelley occasionally uses a similar structure within iambic pentameter
              lines to mark Laon’s agency. As Laon leaves the Hermit, Shelley sets “I left,” “my
              way,” “my frame” each at the beginning of a line, followed by punctuation that marks a
              pause, to show Laon exerting his agency within the revolution already begun by Cythna
              and the Hermit (1694, 1696, 1698). </note> Marking an individual’s name off suggests
            that individuals find agency for themselves by using their name to move the pauses, in
            the process creating a space for themselves within the structure of the poetic line.
            Such movement also shows a fairly limited and even ambiguous degree of agency, since
            it’s possible to read the name either moving the caesura or adding a second caesura.
            Regardless of how we scan the line, though, these examples show Shelley making small
            adjustments within form to find a space for the self. And Shelley’s use of names to move
            form also provides another way to account for Shelley’s oft-remarked distancing of
            himself from his Romantic-era audiences: the poet is privileged not only by the clarity
            of his vision but by the very forms of his utterances, as his movement within form
            provides a resource for agency that everyday actors lack.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> As Susan Wolfson notes, Shelley was aware that the poems he directed
              toward the lower classes were unpublishable. Wolfson sees the form of “The Mask of
              Anarchy” commenting on this distance between author and reader (196-8); Andrew Franta
              reads the form commenting as well on the temporal distance between present and future
              readers (121-2). Richard Cronin notes that Shelley holds two incompatible attitudes
              toward the lower class’s participation in reform. On the one hand, influenced by
              Cobbett, he argues that the lower classes must demand a portion of political power; on
              the other hand, he is hesitant to trust the lower classes to revolt themselves, and
              instead suggests that the Whig intellectual elite should argue on their behalf
              (164-6). </note>

          <head>Poems against systems</head>
          <p>Shelley portrays the socio-political system as a totality from which only a few (like
            Laon) can escape. But he simultaneously suggests that even systems that seem totalizing
            to those inside—like the political tyranny of the Ottoman Empire—do have an exterior.
            If, as Clifford Siskin suggests, Romanticism was the era in which system was no longer a
            genre that aimed to define a comprehensive totality, but rather a knowledge claim
            embedded in multiple genres, then we can see Shelley finding in the very contest between
            overlapping global and local systems a possibility of exerting change.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors"> See “The Problem of Periodization” and “Mediated Enlightenment.”
            </note> Shelley uses the weather as a metaphor for the way in which global and local
            systems intertwine. Shelley portrays poetry as part of the global weather system.
            Poetry’s air inevitably reflects the sociopolitical systems of the author’s day, but
            also challenges these systems. First, poets employ forms from a past day that juxtapose
            past systems to the present and that hopefully endure to represent the present to the
            future. Second, poets draw from the “source of human thought” to envision and enact
            change to the both the political and metrical systems. And poetry imports ideas from the
            ineffable source of human thought in order to change society just as the weather (in
            Shelley’s vision) originates in deep ocean currents; but once both move to land they can
            also become mired in local political systems. </p>
          <p>In his “Defence of Poetry,” Shelley calls meter a system, but somewhat qualifies this
            definition: meter is “a certain system of traditional forms for harmony and language”
            (484). Poetry more generally, he suggests, is not a system, but rather, because of its
            origin in imaginative thought, the “root and blossom of all systems of thought” (503).
            Poetry starts new systems because it can reach outside current social and political
            orders. But even if poetry at times serves systems, the best poems can never be
            completely encompassed by any particular system. In this, Shelley finds Milton
            exemplary: <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> “contains within itself a
            philosophical refutation of that system of which, by a strange and natural antithesis,
            it has been a chief popular support” (498). In <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>,
            Shelley certainly aims for a “philosophical refutation” of the systems of his day. And
            he suggests that if meter is a system, this is because it acts on its readers both
            mentally and physiologically, temporarily extricating them from other systems of which
            they are a part as it dictates their breath, alters their heartbeat, changes the rhythm
            of their speech. Meter dislodges present systems because metrical forms derive from
            prior eras, and will hopefully carry into an unforeseeable future, but also because they
            create pauses in the order. Equally importantly, since even the most regular systems of
            meter allow for variation, Shelley employs this variation to pause the reach of social
            and political structures, and to train readers’ physiological responses. And these
            physiological changes carry an ideological charge if they allow readers to even
            temporarily escape both the teaching and the air that have been tainted by despotism. </p>
          <p>The pause models one way in which form provides a resource for change: originating in
            another era, it stands apart from the current socio-political system. If Shelley chooses
            the stanza form in part for its pauses, then, it’s not only because he finds them
            “musical.” Shelley invokes change by inhabiting the Spenserian stanza’s form and moving
            it, imagining that he will temporarily transform readers’ air and breath, and through
            them, create rents in the systems of the present. But if Shelley hopes that his
            meter—and in particular its pauses—will act as brief systems to dislodge the political
            systems of his day, he does not want his poems or their forms to harden into systems.
            Instead, he envisions his greatest success as the moment when future readers create
            rents in his own forms. This, for Shelley, is the form of systemic change. </p>
