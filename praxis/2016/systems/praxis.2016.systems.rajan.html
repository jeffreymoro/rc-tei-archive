            <p>The Eighteenth Century has been called the “age of the encyclopedia,” but the understanding
               of that word is very different in the encyclopedias of Chambers and Diderot on the
               one hand, and on the other hand the German Idealist tradition variously exemplified
               by Hegel’s <em>Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences</em>, Schelling’s <em>On University Studies</em>, and Novalis’ <em>Romantic Encyclopedia</em>. In Kant’s terms, the first provides an aggregate of knowledge, whereas the second
               attempts a system that entails an architectonic. Focusing on Hegel’s desire to unify
               all the sciences through the meta-discipline of philosophy, this paper explores the
               increasing complication of his architectonic by the very figures he uses to safeguard
               it: namely the circle, the line, and the body. Tracing the supplementary relationship
               between the first and the second, I argue that the body with its multiple subsystems
               brings to a head the collapse of the “smooth” system Hegel intended into a “tangled’”
               system: a productive collapse, because instead of being a forced unification of knowledge,
               the encyclopedia becomes a thought-environment for transferences between disciplines
               and potentially the emergence of new disciplines. Or, in effect, it becomes a form
               of “Theory” avant la lettre.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Encylopedias and Encyclopedics</span></h2>
               <p>In encyclopedias that proliferated in the eighteenth century, the body, map and tree
                  are frequent schemas for system. These figures project what Deleuze and Guattari call
                  a striated space with clear coordinates (361-2) that can be compared to Kant’s equation
                  of system with “architectonic,” which Kant naturalizes through the body that assigns
                  parts their functions and subordinates them to a whole (<em>Reason</em> 691). Yet what if the body is not an anatomical body, but is composed of multiple
                  systems that work on different levels and in different registers: circulatory, digestive,
                  nervous etc.? This paper reflects on the different conceptualizations of system generated
                  by different analogues for organization, and the different models of intellectual
                  formation produced by such systems. For my purposes encyclopedias that gather up all
                  the pieces of information spawned by an expanding print culture can be distinguished
                  from the “encyclopedics” developed by German Idealist and Romantic philosophers, such
                  as Hegel, Schelling, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis. The material entities we call
                  encyclopedias are multiply authored resources for information retrieval that were
                  increasingly arranged in alphabetic form and intended for multiple readers. But the
                  more metaphorical encyclopedias such as Hegel’s <em>Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences</em> (1817-32) or Novalis’ <em>Notes for a Romantic Encyclopedia</em> (1798) are singly authored projects that go back to the root meaning of the term
                  <span class="foreign">enkyklos paedeia</span>, meaning a circle of learning that aims, not just at information, but at knowledge
                  to be taken in by a single reader. But “metaphorical” is a misnomer, since it was
                  only with Chambers and Diderot that the term encyclopedia even came to mean a work
                  of reference rather than a general system of education (McArthur 103). Implicit in
                  what I am calling encyclopedics, then, to distinguish it from this modern use of the
                  word encyclopedia, is a program of learning or <span class="foreign">Bildung</span> that occurs through a “cycle” of the sciences, or, as I shall argue, the problematizing
                  of such a program.</p>
               <p>This difference occurs across what Derrida calls “philosophical continents”: French
                  and British vs. German (“Sendoffs” 243). Though there is a spectral dialogue between
                  them, Hegel marks this division when he distinguishes his “philosophical encyclopedia”
                  from “ordinary encyclopedias,” which are an “assemblage of sciences” that are often
                  only “bits of information” (<em>Encyclopedia</em> 53). To elaborate, by the eighteenth century encyclopedias were mostly alphabetic,
                  crossing lines with dictionaries. Yet from Chambers’ <em>Cyclopedia</em> onwards (1728), they evinced anxieties about the empiricism of the alphabet. Thus
                  Chambers expresses almost the same concerns as Hegel, when he speaks of the need to
                  dispose “a Variety of Materials” so as “not to make a confused Heap of incongruous
                  Parts, but one consistent Whole.” This, he says, he attains “by considering the several
                  Matters” both “as so many Wholes, and as so many Parts of some greater Whole” linked
                  by a “Reference.” But in a version of what would be later known as the hermeneutic
                  circle, where the parts can only be known through the whole and vice versa, he also
                  discusses the advantages of a dictionary within a system, namely that the former keeps
                  one apprised of the “Pins and Joints,” the thousand things we might ignore, which
                  is the only way “the Whole Circle or Body of Knowledge can be deliver’d” (i-ii).</p>
               <p>These material encyclopedias, in other words, tried to be both empirical and systematic.
                  Indeed “system” is the battle-cry of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (<em>EB</em>). To be sure, the <em>EB</em> seems to converge with Hegel’s emphasis on disciplines, on gathering up all the “philosophical
                  sciences,” since its title page claims that it is conceived on “a Plan entirely New”
                  in which the “Sciences and Arts are digested into Distinct Treatises or Systems,”
                  with the aim of uniting all the “detached parts” into a “system.” But the very word
                  system has undergone a sea-change. The major entries are not always on disciplines
                  and are also often on what we might call “practices.” These entries are therefore
                  systems in the sense Clifford Siskin uses the word when he describes 1798 as “the
                  year of the system” (12). Though internally architectonic in Kant’s terms, they exhibit
                  a micro-specialisation in which each discipline or practice has its own system, the
                  placing of disciplines and practices on the same surface itself being an example of
                  this micro-specialization.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Material encyclopedias, in other words, are systematic in the sense of containing
                     multiple modular systems rather than a total system of knowledge: a model that comes
                     back to haunt Hegel and Schelling. Their logics of unification—such as an opening
                     diagram of a tree with many branches, or in the case of Chambers, prefatory references
                     to a land to be divided up into provinces, a body of knowledge, branches of knowledge,
                     and the circle of knowledge (i, vii)– are strictly supplementary. For one thing, minor
                     entries are cross-referenced only to the system to which they belong, and there is
                     not that much cross-referencing among systems, or if there is, it is strictly indexical
                     and not conceptual. And many minor entries also remain undigested into any larger
                     system, so that in the end the signifier of totality is simply the material container
                     of the book. Indeed, while there is a residual discourse of unity in Chambers, we
                     could argue that by the time of the <em>EB,</em> systematicity has come to mean method rather than totality. Parts of knowledge are
                     “digested” into systems or treatises: a dead metaphor that we will see operating more
                     luridly in Hegel. But these “digests” are themselves parts. They are just more comprehensively
                     gathered up than in the growing number of periodicals that also provided summaries
                     of books, including foreign books, so as to establish a transnational public sphere
                     of communication.

               <p>In fact, more than Chambers and his early modern precursors such as Vincent of Beauvais,
                  who still pay lip-service to the circle or course of knowledge, the <em>EB</em> stands on the cusp of a transition from encyclopedic knowledge to information, already
                  confessing that there “is some inconvenience in ... perusing a whole system when we
                  only want to consult a particular topic” (<em>2<sup>nd</sup> ed.</em> iv). Or as Tom MacArthur puts it, certain kinds of data – existing in catalogues,
                  directories, dictionaries etc.—are better off outside the brain: just as we do with
                  things, so too we can put “mental objects in the equivalent of bags" and carry them
                  around. (7). While information is nothing new, what we do see in material encyclopedias
                  is a shift in sensibility wherein by our own time, the modular, informational model
                  will extend to the whole of knowledge, the very re-purposing of the word encyclopedia
                  being a symptom of this shift.</p>

                              published by Hegel’s students. Hegel published very little: among his well-known texts,
                              only the Phenomenology (1807), The Science of Logic (1812, 1813, 1816), the Philosophy
                              of Right (1821), and the Heidelberg Encyclopedia (1817) and Berlin Encyclopedia (1827/30),
                              which are outlines. Hegel’s many lecture courses are subsystems that develop parts

                     wrong tendency –whereas this project is native to Germany” (qd. Behler 284). Not that
                     there were no ordinary encyclopedias in Germany, but the argument here is for an Idealist
                     and/or Romantic rather than empiricist or technological encyclopedia like Diderot
                     and d’Alembert’s <em>Encyclopédie</em>. Thus Hegel’s aim, and less systematically Schelling’s in his lectures on <em>University Studies</em>, is both to preserve the coherence of a circle or cycle of disciplines and to expand
                     the provenance of philosophy beyond Kant’s politically cautious limitation of it to
                     a lower faculty (<em>Conflict</em> 43-58). It is to bring “Idealism ... into all the sciences,” as Schelling puts it
                     (<em>World-Soul</em> 94). With that in mind, while expanding the reach of philosophy to the life sciences,
                     aesthetics etc., Hegel also strictly limits himself to “philosophical sciences,” participating
                     in a tradition that goes back to Christian Wolff’s division of philosophical from
                     historical or empirical knowledge, and forward to Husserl’s narrower distinction between
                     “eidetic” and “factual” sciences ( Husserl, <em>Ideas</em> 62-4). Hegel does include sciences such as aesthetics “that exist for themselves outside
                     of philosophy in general,” but have a “rational basis” which also allows them to be
                     treated philosophically (<em>Encyclopedia</em> 53). But he excludes “pseudosciences” such as heraldry that are “thoroughly positive”
                     (53): a dig at British encyclopedias that include this topic, in one case as a way
                     of securing commercial patronage.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Most of all Hegel is concerned to protect “philosophy” from the “English” confusion
                     of it with “experimental physics” (or natural philosophy), so that “electrical machines
                     ... pumps and the like are called philosophical instruments” (<em>Encyclopedia</em> 49)– a use of “philosophy” that we do indeed find in British scientific journals at
                     the time. Reading all knowledge that matters through philosophy, Hegel’s system therefore
                     strives to be a totality. This is to say that Hegel does not conceive his Encyclopedia
                     as a multi-use resource but as an integrated system of knowledge, in which ‘system’
                     is tied up with the seriousness of knowledge and the education (“Bildung”

                              Blumenbach’s Bildungstrieb, the German word is also connected with Bild (picture or
                              image), the word Hegel uses at the end of the text to describe Spirit as having traversed
                              a “gallery of images” in its education. It is therefore unfortunate that at the end
                              of the text, where Hegel couples Bild with Bildung, Miller does not translate the

                     of spirit (“Age of Hegel” 148). Hence the constant emphasis on system, in Hegel’s
                     insistence that knowledge can only be “expounded as ... system” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 13-14), and in Schelling’s constant search for a system and his unworking of his various
                     systems. Hence also Hegel’s narrativizing of system as something more than merely
                     structural, when he divides his <em>Encyclopedia</em> into three parts that take the form of a journey or phenomenology of consciousness:
                     “1) logic, the science of the idea in and for itself; 2) the philosophy of nature,
                     as the science of the idea in its otherness; 3) the philosophy of spirit, the science
                     of the idea as it returns to itself from its otherness” (54). But needless to say
                     this travel outwards to the margins of philosophy, in Hegel’s increasingly complex
                     and multicomponent system, will result in multiple infractions from these margins
                     that threaten philosophy’s systematic self-concept.</p>

                  <p>Underpinning Hegel’s conception of system according to a <span class="foreign">pars pro toto logic </span>(<em>Encylopedia</em> 51) is Kant’s notion of architectonic, introduced as early as the lectures on <em>Physical Geography</em>, where it is connected to the idea of the encyclopedia. Here Kant writes that we
                     “need to become acquainted with the objects of our experience <span style="font-weight:bold">as a whole</span>,” so that our knowledge will form “not an <span style="font-weight:bold">aggregation</span> but a <span style="font-weight:bold">system</span>; for in a system the <span style="font-weight:bold">whole</span> is prior to the parts, while in an aggregation the <span style="font-weight:bold">parts</span> have priority” (446). In the first <em>Critique</em> Kant further develops this concept of “architectonic,” repeating his distinction between
                     system/science and aggregates. System is not just method, but the “unity of the manifold
                     cognitions under one idea,” within a whole in which “the position of the parts with
                     respect to each other is determined <span class="foreign">a priori</span>.” Kant’s image for this whole from which parts cannot be “contingent[ly]” added or
                     subtracted is the body, a figure to which we will return (691). But suffice it to
                     say that Kant’s notion of the body is essentially aesthetic, where aesthetics, in
                     Baumgarten’s terms, is “ars pulchre cogitandi,” the art of thinking beautifully (#533).
                     This is to say that Kant’s notion of system differs from Hegel’s in being purely spatial,
                     diagrammatic. As such it is a “schema” (<em>Reason</em> 691), and in the schematic mode, as Schelling says, the universal has not been unified
                     with the particular; the schema is only a “rule” governing production (<em>Philosophy of Art</em> 46-7). Kant’s spatial, synchronic conception of the body, and the fact that he operates
                     within Baumgarten’s idea of “aesthetics as “the analogy of reason” and a supplement
                     to logic, results in a smooth system, securely –even if only from a transcendental
                     perspective– under the governance of philosophy.

               <p>The terms smooth and tangled are Bruno Latour’s version of Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s
                  closed vs. open systems, which I extend here to the architecture of knowledge. Objects
                  that we <em>understand</em> smoothly have defined boundaries: we grasp them separately, and changes in them are
                  accidents that do not affect their substance. Tangled objects are affected by neighbouring
                  objects and unwork, destabilize and rework knowledge (Latour 20-3). While Kant’s work
                  was not restricted to philosophy – he also lectured on anthropology and geography
                  – he always begins by mapping the space of knowledge and delimiting the place of a
                  field within it. Within a larger architectonic that Kant (unlike his successors) did
                  not presume to construct, “the position of the parts” or individual disciplines “with
                  respect to each other” is “determined <span class="foreign">a priori</span>” by philosophy (<em>Reason</em> 691). More specifically, “every science [has] its determinate position in the encyclopedia
                  of the sciences” and if “it is a philosophical science, then we must assign it its
                  position in either its theoretical or its practical part” (<em>Judgment</em> 285). As Kant zooms in to a particular zone of the map, the smoothness of this distinction
                  is maintained, and the margins of philosophy are given their <span class="foreign">a priori</span> location. So for instance, in the lectures on <em>Physical Geography</em>, Kant first evokes the larger map, and divides knowledge into the rational and empirical.
                  And he then divides the latter into knowledge of the internal or the soul and knowledge
                  of the external, the second being subdivided into knowledge of man or the world and
                  knowledge of nature. The former is anthropology and is pragmatic rather than speculative,
                  and the latter is physical geography (445-6).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Following this rational/empirical division, Kant is also careful to delimit philosophy
                     and not to hybridize it, even though the reality of his circumstances was that he
                     had to teach outside philosophy, which had not yet institutionally become a <span class="foreign">Fachwissenschaft</span> (or special subject). Thus even in the pre-Critical phase, his lectures on the Encyclopedia
                     which he gave ten times between 1767 and 1782, really deal only with the encyclopedia
                     of philosophy, and unlike Hegel’s <em>History of Philosophy</em>, which entangles philosophy with its history, they do so from a purely transcendental
                     perspective.

                     </div> Kant begins by distinguishing historical sciences, which are forms of learnedness,
                     from rational sciences which are sciences of insight, and he then subdivides the latter
                     into philosophy as a discursive science and mathematics as a science of construction.
                     As an encyclopedia in the sense of a digest or “kurzer Auszug” of philosophy (<em>Vorlesung</em> 31-2), the lectures then sketch the principles of what would become Kant’s critical
                     philosophy. In other words Kant’s sense of system, whether it is the total system
                     of knowledge or the system of an individual part, is of a structure laid out in a
                     “striated” or divisible space, and then partitioned according to an <span class="foreign">a priori</span> logic. He therefore conceives the totality of knowledge as a smooth rather than tangled
                     system, in which the parts may be thought through analogy but are always kept firmly
                     separate and do not bleed into one another. For Kant there are no mixtures or “intersciences,”
                     as Derrida calls them, and no new forms of thought that emerge in the interstices
                     between existing fields. As he says quite definitely, “no science can belong to the
                     transition” from one domain to the other “since that signifies only the articulation
                     or organization of the system and not a place within it” (<em>Judgment</em> 285).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In his early lectures on <em>University Studies</em>, Schelling also uses the figure of the body to think the system of knowledge synchronically,
                  but with a crucial difference. Drawing on a Spinozist vocabulary of emanations from
                  or modes of a single substance, Schelling describes how all knowledge, “flow[s] from
                  a single centre”: “Those sciences which reflect primordial knowledge most directly
                  ... are ... the sensorium of the organic body of knowledge. We must start from the
                  central organs and trace the life that flows from them through various channels to
                  the outermost parts” (42). But as mystical as this articulation of the body is, and
                  as close as it remains to what Deleuze calls the “organism” as distinct from the decentralized
                  “body without organs” (44-8), Schelling does not conceive the body architectonically
                  as a striated space, but rather in terms of flows. We will return to this metaphor
                  of “fluidity” in both Schelling and Hegel. Suffice it to say that Schelling conceives
                  the space of knowledge as “smooth” in Deleuze and Guattari’s very particular sense
                  of that term, which is virtually the opposite of Latour’s. Both usages valorize open
                  over closed systems. But while Latour defines smooth objects as bounded and divided
                  off, Deleuze and Guattari oppose an open space that they call “smooth” to a more conventional
                  “striated” space, which is divisible, segmented and thus bounded (<em>Thousand Plateaus</em> 361-2). Schelling, we could say, wants to have both kinds of smoothness. He wants
                  a system that is open and not inorganically divided up. And yet he also wants one
                  that is smooth in the sense of being a totality, which is impossible, as is evident
                  when he writes about the world of nature, whose tangled systems transferentially affect
                  the way system itself is conceived.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For purposes of this paper, I will not take up Schelling except as a dialogical gloss

                     </div> For even during the period that saw the publication of his most idealistic work, including <em>On University Studies</em> (1803) and The Philosophy of Art (1803/4), Schelling already recognized system as
                     perspectival, constructing several systems: a <em>System of Transcendental Idealism</em> (1800), but on the other hand numerous systems of nature. Indeed the experimentalism
                     of these systems can be seen in the fact that Schelling uses, almost interchangeably,
                     the words “system,” “first outline [<em>Entwurf</em>]” “ideas for” and “introduction” to a philosophy of nature, which he may or may not
                     be able to bring into identity with transcendental philosophy so as to create a system
                     of the whole. This <em>Naturphilosophie</em>, in turn, is sometimes focalized through physics and chemistry, as in <em>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature </em>(1797/1803). But sometimes it is focused through the life sciences, with physics and
                     chemistry being part of the life sciences rather than the hard sciences, as in <em>First Outline for a System of the Philosophy of Nature</em> (1799), which itself is nit one but several “systems.” Even from the beginning, then,
                     and despite the smooth system he articulates in <em>On University Studies</em>, Schelling’s practice is always mobilized by what he calls “asystasy.” As he later
                     says in “On the Nature of Philosophy as Science” (1821), “the idea of finding a system
                     of human knowledge, or ... of contemplating human knowledge within a system, within
                     a form of coexistence, presupposes, of course, that originally and of itself it does
                     not exist in a system, hence that it is an ... [<em>asystaton</em>], ... something that is in inner conflict” (210).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Leaving aside Schelling, then, I focus on Hegel, who wants to construct a comprehensive,
                  complexly articulated architecture of knowledge rather than a “rhapsody” (Kant, <em>Reason </em>691). According to Karl Rosenkranz, during the early Jena years when many of the elements
                  of the encylopedia were introduced and when Schelling (or one side of him) was still
                  committed to the Identity Philosophy, Schelling worked out the critical foundations
                  of absolute philosophy in synchronic fashion, while Hegel set to work developing it
                  as a “cycle of sciences” (qtd. by Vater 82). Yet the cycle is not necessarily the
                  circle, and Hegel’s multiple, supplementary figures for his system compromise its
                  smooth ambitions by entangling the architectonic within the temporal and the body
                  within its organic complexities. This paper will explore three such figures: the line,
                  the circle, and the body. Together they bring Hegel closer to, and yet mark his difference
                  from, another idea of the encyclopedia which forms part of the contemporary context
                  of Hegel’s project, but is at the opposite extreme from Kant’s architectonic: Novalis’
                  “encyclopedistics.”</p>
               <p>In Novalis’ <em>Notes for a Romantic Encyclopedia</em> (1798), which despite its organization in fragments has its own systematic principles,
                  the units of the system are also emergent disciplines and fields. But the relations
                  of parts and whole are tangled and rhizomatic, not hierarchical and smooth. The whole
                  cannot determine the part as in architectonic; but unlike in an aggregative system,
                  the part does not remain finite and in its own sphere, as it possesses generative
                  consequences for the whole of knowledge. “Application of the system to the parts,”
                  Novalis writes, “and the parts to the <em>system</em> and the parts to the parts” (#460).</p>
               <p>For Novalis, then, the Encyclopedia is not an organization of knowledge but an <em>asystaton</em> that is a thought-environment for mixtures. Mixtures were anathema to Kant, who felt
                  that each science should be placed in “a special system so that it constitutes a science
                  of its own kind, in order to guard against the uncertainty arising from mixing things
                  together” (<em>Metaphysical Foundations</em>, 9). Indeed Kant even proposes disentangling troublesome subsystems from the whole
                  so as to purify them and then reinsert them into the whole (12-13). But as Walter
                  Moser says, “mixture” was one of the key concepts in chemistry at the time, and chemistry
                  occupied a privileged position among the early Romantics “as a discourse model that
                  becomes the source” of “interdiscursive translation” (16, 6). This translation, in
                  turn, realizes the creative, and not simply critical, potential of a tangled system.
                  And what Novalis provides is a toolkit for such translation that involves “potentiation”
                  and “application” as related procedures in the “encyclopedization of a science” (Novalis
                  genuine raising to a higher power, every science can pass over into a higher philosophical
                  science” (Novalis #487). It is application, however, that allows for the creation
                  of a new science out of an already existing one (Moser 13), for instance psychopathology
                  or psychoanalysis out of pathology, as we shall see. The goal of encyclopedic education
                  is the “encyclopedization of a science” that occurs when the analogical implications
                  of a science or even a “molecule of science” are potentiated so that the empirical,
                  instead of being determined by the transcendental, retroacts upon it (Novalis #161,
                  #489). The key here is analogy as a constitutive and not just the regulative procedure
                  it is in Kant. “A science becomes applied,” according to Novalis, “if it serves as
                  the analogous model and stimulus” for the development of another science, a process
                  that is reciprocal, because it is also “the self-(post) development” of this other
                  science (#487). To be sure, mixtures were not the goal from which Hegel started. But
                  his system, unfolding philosophy through a series of histories and attempting to wrest
                  the transcendental from the empirical, is nothing if not mixed.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Circles Within Circles</span></h2>
               <p>Let us turn, then, to Hegel’s figures for system. The most prominent is the circle,
                  which goes back to the root meaning of <span class="foreign">enkyklos paideia</span>, and which he defines through its radii “as that which takes account of the difference
                  within it and so reaches a complete determinateness” (<em>Nature</em> 33). One might think of the circle as a smooth structure. Yet this is no ordinary
                  circle. The philosophical encyclopedia consists of parts, each of which “is a circle
                  of totality containing itself within itself, “ though the “philosophical idea is also
                  within each particular determinacy or element. ” “The circle of Nature” is thus only
                  one circle in Philosophy. The whole is then “a circle of circles” (<em>Encyclopedia</em> 51; <em>Nature</em> 2): an immensely complicated structure like Milton’s cosmos: “Cycle and Epicycle,
                  Orb in Orb” (<em>Paradise Lost</em> VIII.84).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The image of circles within circles differs from the smoother image of the building
                     or group of buildings that Kant, despite conceiving the whole as a “body” (<em>Reason</em> 691), also uses for knowledge. For Kant “every science is of itself a system” and
                     though we may move from one building to another each is a “freestanding building”
                     (<em>Judgment</em> 252-3). Hegel’s figure, by contrast, has several hazards. First, while the circle
                     is a figure of self-enclosure and containment, he sees <em>as a breach</em> the proceeding of one circle into another, which in more modern terms is the process
                     of mediation or “the adapting ... of findings from one level to another” (Jameson
                     39-40). Hegel writes: “The individual circle thus ruptures itself because it is in
                     itself a totality, it breaks through the limits of its own elements and establishes
                     another sphere” (<em>Encyclopedia</em> 51). Although the circle of circles is meant to contain multiplicity in unity, what
                     Hegel describes here is an exceeding of containment. To be sure, this is in one sense
                     the famous procedure of <span class="foreign">Aufhebung</span> or sublation. Hegel annotates this process further, when he says that sciences which
                     are <em>not</em> positive “recognize their concepts as finite,” thus undergoing “a transition into
                     a higher sphere” (54). A rupture, however, is also an infraction, a breaking of one
                     circle into another, or rather of both into each other. Elsewhere I have described
                     one such instance of mediation in the last section of the <em>Philosophy of Nature,</em> where Hegel projects his own three-part dialectic onto the physiological schema of
                     sensibility, irritability and reproduction that was common at the time (Rajan “(In)Digestible
                     Material”). Reading physiological processes in philosophical language, Hegel produces
                     a psychosomatics of Spirit that is both a psychoanalysis in embryo and one of the
                     new disciplines that Novalis was fond of imagining: “pathological philosophy” (#638).

                              and incomplete.”</span></div>

               <p>As this example indicates, there is no guarantee that the breaking of the circle,
                  the transition from one domain to another that Kant sees as incidental, is a transition
                  into a <em>higher</em> sphere. The emergence of psychoanalysis from philosophy’s bringing of “Idealism”
                  into the science of medicine is a transformative breaking of the circles of both empirical
                  medicine and philosophy itself. It occurs precisely through potentiation: the elevation
                  of physiology and medicine from empirical into philosophical sciences. And it also
                  occurs through analogy: the analogical application of philosophy to physiology, which
                  produces a new science through what Novalis calls “encyclopedization.” But this transition
                  of one sphere into another establishes “another” and not a “higher” sphere. Indeed,
                  rather than following an <span class="foreign">a priori</span> logic, there is something of the accidental about it. And moreover it moves in more
                  than one direction, inasmuch as physiology can also be analogically applied to philosophy
                  to produce pathological philosophy, resulting in “the self-(post) development” of
                  philosophy (Novalis #487). No doubt this is not exactly an accident Hegel wanted.
                  Hence he must, so to speak, burn his work, so that “like the phoenix” Nature can “come
                  forth from this externality rejuvenated as Spirit” and “reconcile itself with itself”
                  (<em>Nature</em> 444). But then Hegel also embraces such accidents, which are built into his seeing
                  “substance as subject” and therefore, crucially, as “negativity.”As he writes in the
                  <em>Phenomenology</em>: “The circle that remains self-enclosed and, like substance, holds its moments together,
                  is an immediate relationship, one therefore which has nothing astonishing about it.
                  But that an accident as such, detached from what circumscribes it, ... should attain
                  an existence of its own and a separate freedom –this is the tremendous power of the
                  negative” (10, 18-19).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Related to the “proceeding” of one circle into another is a further problem, which
                     is the entanglement of micro and macrosystems. Where material encyclopedias move from
                     the bottom up, trying to fit individual systems into a system of the whole which never
                     really overcomes the empiricism of aggregation, Idealism starts deductively with a
                     whole into which the parts are supposedly fitted. Nevertheless, Hegel includes many
                     of the minute details we might expect to find in material encyclopedias: discussions
                     of meteors, limestone, lizards, and experiments in natural philosophy that show his
                     familiarity with British journals of the time. The sheer complexity of Hegel’s system
                     results in a disseminative multiplication of the parts within the whole.

                              baroque: a “defining feature of the Baroque is the multiplicity of varying and curved
                              –convex and concave– mirrors .... Baroque houses are full of mirrors and seem to need
                              mirrors more than windows” (Plotnitsky 120). But while also reading Hegel against

                              (121), Plotnitsky sees the totality of Hegel’s work as a “divergent harmony” (132)

                     </div> Moreover, circles become “spheres,” a word that Hegel uses to describe both concepts
                     like existence and negativity and fields of knowledge such as physics and mechanics.
                     Spheres are not quite circles: whereas the circle is a two-dimensional schema, the
                     sphere has a volume and “mass” (<em>Nature</em> 79), which Hegel must struggle to keep under control. Thus as M.J. Petry explains,
                     the “spheres” are supposed to be “levels” in a “hierarchy” which is like the Chain
                     of Being (21-39). The “sphere of physics” is part of the “sphere of Nature” (Hegel, <em>Nature</em> 26, 23), and “each sphere ... complete[s] itself by passing into another higher one”
                     (21), a logic Hegel evokes in the “transition” from Nature to Spirit at the end of
                     the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> (445). But this logic of subsumption can equally be one of complication, in which
                     the levels risk becoming spheres in their own right. For as Schelling says, using
                     the same term as Hegel, within each “determinate sphere of formation” “other spheres
                     are again formed, and in these spheres others” (<em>First Outline</em> 43-4). The result is intimated by Goethe, when he says that sciences “destroy themselves
                     in two ways: by the breadth they reach and by the depth they plumb” (305).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The logic is that of Leibniz’ <em>Monadology</em>, adapted by Schelling in <em>The First Outline</em> into a “dynamic atomism” (21) that doubles as a physics of knowledge. For Leibniz
                     the monad is both a simple unity and is infinitely subdivisible into further monads.
                     Kant resolved this paradox by arguing that monads are not to be conceived as physically
                     filling a space but rather as spheres or “orbits of activity”: it is thus not the
                     actual substance of the monad but its sphere of activity that is infinitely divided
                     (<em>Physical Monadology</em> 53-7).

                     </div> Ideally for Hegel these multiple monads or spheres will be unified by the fiction
                     of their “pre-established harmony”; thus for Leibniz individual monads, though self-contained,
                     are all supposedly comprehended in the supreme Monad which is God (or absolute knowledge).
                     But inversely, as Schelling recognizes, these monads, which externally appear as simple
                     unities, are infinitely subdivisible into further and further monads, each with its
                     own life (Leibniz 261, 266, 268).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Thus even as Hegel’s macrosystems (of nature, art etc.) are compounded into ever larger
                  unities, they are also infinitely particularized into microsystems with their own
                  logic and so are complexly self-differing. In this way the sphere of “Organics” in
                  the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> is subdivided into the geological, vegetable and animal organisms, which can be placed
                  in a hierarchy, but between which there are also rhizomatic connections. The animal
                  organism is studied in terms of the sphere of physiology, which contains the sphere
                  of pathology, which is inapplicable to the geological organism and unique to the animal
                  (429). British Idealism is in many ways less tangled than its German parent, and thinkers
                  such as Erasmus Darwin, John Abernethy, Joseph Henry Green, and (less successfully)
                  Coleridge, contained pathology within physiology as a negative illustration of the
                  laws of normal life, with the understanding that these laws could be better understood
                  through deviations from them. But while this may also be Hegel’s aim, Hegel never
                  returns from the pathological to the normal, as <em>The Philosophy of Nature</em> ends with a section entitled “The Disease of the Individual” that derails the intended
                  transition from Nature to Spirit. This last section becomes an accident detached from
                  what circumscribes it, but one that affects the substance of Hegel’s thought precisely
                  because that substance is actualized through a subject. The problem confronting Hegel
                  is not unlike the dis-integration of the macro- by the micropedia in the work of his
                  materialist rivals. But it has this difference, that the connections or disconnections
                  that remain external in material encyclopedias are internalized as part of self-consciousness
                  in encyclopedics, or perhaps, internalized as part of the text’s unconscious.</p>

                  <p>This brings us to the next problem, the entanglement of the of the circle and line.
                     The encyclopedia is not just a spatial curriculum that one traverses from the outside,
                     but a process of <em>Bildung</em> or inner development. It is a “path” the “<em>length</em>” of which “has to be endured,” since knowledge is “a necessary and complete process
                     of becoming” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 17, 20). Hegel criticized Schelling for being insufficiently dialectical (<em>History of Philosophy</em> III. 334, 341-3), and by dialectic he did not simply mean a form of argumentation
                     but a profoundly temporal experience: a process of remembering and working through,
                     of engaging the ideal with the real, and a transposition of the philosophical into
                     the historical. Unlike the Schelling of <em>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature</em> (1797/1803), <em>System of Transcendental Idealism</em> (1800), <em>Bruno</em> (1802), and <em>On University Studies</em>, (1803), Hegel could not conceive of the eternal and temporal or the ideal and real
                     as synchronic, in the manner of Blake’s fourfold vision.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                              the whole absolute is knowable, although appearing Nature produces only successively,
                              and in (for us) endless development, what in true Nature exists all at once and in
                              an eternal fashion” (272).</span></div>
                     </div> Thus to a degree Hegel’s distinction between the sciences of nature and spirit corresponds
                     to Schelling’s distinction between the real (or life) sciences and the ideal sciences
                     such as philosophy, mathematics, and religion (<em>University Studies</em> 103-4). But for Hegel, as for the post-Jena Schelling of the <em>Freedom</em> essay (1809), the emergence of freedom from necessity must be earned through the struggle
                     of nature to become spirit, which occurs along a “path,” “road” or temporal line.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This struggle is not only thematized through what Findlay calls the “dialectical <em>journey</em>” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 528); it also provides the structure for Hegel’s organization of knowledge. For if
                     the eighteenth century sees a “temporalizing of the Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 242-3,
                     271-80), Hegel also temporalizes the cycle of disciplines along this evolutionary
                     Chain of Being.

                              (Nature 20-1)</span></div>
                     </div> Thus the third section of the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> takes in geology, meteorology, botany, physiology and medicine, among others. These
                     sciences are part of the broader system of “Organics,” which is preceded by mechanics
                     and physics. The three together comprise the sphere of Nature, which is a sphere in
                     a scale of disciplines that parallels the Chain of Being, since their subject-matter
                     proceeds from the inorganic to the organic, and from lower to higher organizations
                     along this chain. The <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>, in turn, is a level that is surpassed by the sciences of Spirit. Altogether the
                     cycle of learning in which consciousness learns how to become Spirit unfolds as an
                     ascent from matter to Spirit, or necessity to freedom, through the progression from
                     the real to the ideal sciences. Indeed “Nature” herself learns to be Spirit by proceeding
                     through the phenomena, from molluscs to animals, that are the objects of the various
                     sciences. Here Hegel is totally unlike the Schelling of the lectures <em>On University Studies</em>, whose arrangement of chapters on disciplines is random rather than following a thematic
                     progression anchored in the development of a subject.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Not that there are no other systems which thematize a progressing ‘line’ of knowledge,
                  for instance that projected by Coleridge, consisting of Logic, Natural [Philosophy]
                  and Theology" (<em>Notebooks</em> #5417). Indeed, working to put the ever-troublesome life sciences in their <span class="foreign">a priori</span> place within this architectonic of knowledge, his friend and executor Joseph Henry
                  Green more clearly executes Coleridge’s project of absorbing physiological into political
                  “constitution,” or Nature into Spirit, by following <em>Vital Dynamics</em> (1840) with <em>Mental Dynamics or Groundwork of a Professional Education</em> (1847) and then <em>Spiritual Philosophy</em> (1865), as a means to the <em>Bildung</em> of Coleridge’s “clerisy.” Green, though more immersed in Schelling, had read some
                  Hegel and studied with Solger in Berlin in 1817, the year Solger helped to bring Hegel
                  to the University of Berlin. Nevertheless it is only Hegel who traverses this “road”
                  as a “pathway of <em>doubt</em>” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 49), in which the sciences are not analytic systems but phenomenological expressions
                  of what, in an almost fantastical prosopopeia, he calls “Nature’s” struggle to become
                  Spirit. Thus, even if against their grain, the sciences form what Novalis calls a
                  “pathological philosophy” in which each science is profoundly lacking, and must “shatter”
                  the “inadequate form” of its “circle,” only to expose its own inadequacy (<em>Nature</em> 443).</p>
               <p>So as Nature, in Hegel’s personification or self-projection, struggles for self-consciousness,
                  consciousness too is exposed to its human nature in the shapes or <span class="foreign">Gestaltungen</span> (<em>Phenomenology</em> 9) that it gives itself in its sciences. Hence the line that Hegel wants to organize
                  smoothly within the synthetic paradigm of the dialectic is beset by accidents that
                  disclose the “tremendous power of the negative.” Indeed this “road,” which he calls
                  an “inwardizing [<span class="foreign">Er-Innerung</span>] and Calvary” of Spirit (<em>Phenomenology</em> 51, 493), is littered with such accidents, which Hegel, after “tarrying” with the
                  “negative” (19), tries unconvincingly to elide through various figural somersaults.
                  For instance as the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> disastrously concludes with 
                  “The Disease of the Individual,”
                  Hegel claims that the “goal of Nature,” mired as it is in “an ever-increasing wealth
                  of detail,” is to “destroy itself ... to consume itself like the phoenix in order
                  to come forth from this externality rejuvenated as spirit” (444). Similarly at the
                  end of the <em>Aesthetics</em>, almost all of which is about how this discipline of thinking beautifully falls afoul
                  of the actual history of art, Hegel famously proclaims the end of art. The circle
                  is likewise one of these figures that tries to perform what the Idea and the Concept
                  cannot do. The circle is “the line returning into itself” and the “paralysis” of the
                  dimensions of time such that present, past and future are “closed together in a unity,”
                  their distinctions “sublated” (<em>Nature</em> 43-4). It is “the path of a <em>purely uniform</em> motion” (70). In the closure of the circle the point “has been already at the place
                  it is reaching” (43-4); the “end” is already in the “beginning” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 10).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet this closure of the circle is a form of damage control exerted on the line, path,
                     or journey. For the line figures a form of experience in which the immanent unfolding
                     of the “Idea” in time and history risks removing the transcendental guarantees that
                     exist in the early Schelling’s synchronicity of the eternal and temporal, or “true”
                     and “appearing Nature” (<em>Ideas</em> 272). Hence Hegel finds the circle limited as well as complete, referring to each
                     circular totalization as an “inadequate form” and suggesting that there is something
                     simplistic in the circle that “holds its moments together” (<em>Nature</em> 443; <em>Phenomenology</em> 18-19). This is to say that if Hegel needs to repair the line with the circle, he
                     conversely needs the line to supply the dialectic, or as Schelling will later call
                     it “realism,”

                     Schelling’s work, Hegel calls Absolute Idealism “the night in which all cows are black”
                     (9). He describes it as a “monochromatic formalism” that ignores “the living Substance”
                     as a “self-originating, self-differentiating wealth of shapes” and “begins straight
                     away with absolute knowledge” (9-10, 16). The “long way” that Spirit must “travel,”
                     the line as opposed to the circle, figures the process of remembering and working
                     through that is the labour of the negative (10, 15).

               <h2><span class="head">The Nervous Body</span></h2>
               <p>Let us turn now to our final figure, the body which, like the circle, projects a system
                  that holds its moments together. Thus in the <em>Phenomenology</em> Hegel writes that Spirit “articulates its body into a variety of functions, and allots
                  one particular part for only one function” (197). In the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> he echoes Kant’s contrast between knowledge that is “heaped together” and knowledge
                  as an “articulated” whole which, like the “animal body,” grows “internally” and not
                  “externally” by “contingent addition” (Kant, <em>Reason</em> 591). In the same vein of an external and aggregated vs. internal and integrated
                  growth, Hegel too argues that plants grow only in size, but when the animal increases
                  in size it “remains one shape” (<em>Nature</em> 304).</p>
               <p>Like Kant, then, Hegel wants to conceive the body as a whole that keeps parts in their
                  place. Thus implicitly he aligns material encyclopedias with the aggregative structure
                  of the vegetable body, while his own philosophical encyclopedia is like the animal
                  body that grows internally and retains “one shape.” But does not such a unification
                  become coercive when it is extended to the body politic or the body of knowledge?
                  And indeed can Hegel uphold his analogy? For Kant’s body, as we have seen, is aesthetic
                  or at best anatomical, where anatomy maps the volume of organs on a flat surface.
                  But Hegel is sensitive to the difference between structure and process. Describing
                  the “ordinary view of anatomy” as “the knowledge of the parts of the body regarded
                  as inanimate,” Hegel writes in his “Preface: On Scientific Cognition” that in anatomy
                  we “do not as yet possess the subject-matter itself,” since we do not know “the particulars”
                  (<em>Phenomenology</em> 1). He later adds that in such a system, “the organism is apprehended from the abstract
                  aspect of a dead existence; its moments so taken pertain to anatomy and the corpse,
                  not to cognition and the living organism.” “The moments have really ceased <em>to be</em> for they cease to be processes.” It is only within these processes, within their
                  transitions (to pick up the word Kant dismisses), that “anatomical parts,” or by analogy
                  disciplines, “have a meaning,” since only then can “what is forcibly detached and
                  fixed as an individual system” be returned to being a “fluid moment” (166).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Moreover, unlike Kant, Hegel also writes at length on the real body in the last major
                     division of his <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> on “Organics.” And it is the physiological and not the anatomical body that he treats,
                     breaking the circle in which the earlier Schelling had closed off the dangers of physiology
                     by synchronizing it with anatomy (<em>University Studies</em> 141). As we have seen, for Hegel the animal body (which includes the human) is distinguished
                     from the plant in terms of the unity of the animal as an “organism” vs. the structure
                     of the plant as an “aggregate” (<em>Nature</em> 394). Plants grow only in size, whereas when the animal increases in size it “remains
                     one shape” (304). Correspondingly plants “fall apart” into “a number of individuals,
                     the whole plant being rather the basis (<em>Boden</em>) for these individuals than a subjective unity of members” (303). The plant “is thus
                     impotent to hold its members in its power” and indeed does not have “true members
                     [<em>Gliedern</em>]” (276); or as Hegel says elsewhere “every branch is a new plant and not at all ...
                     just a single member” (<em>Aesthetics</em> I.137). By contrast, in the animal organism members are subordinate to the whole,
                     even as the whole “is articulated into parts that are <em>separate and distinct</em>,” so that “each member is reciprocally end and means” (<em>Nature</em> 303, 377). Yet as a “totality of articulated members” (377) that respects differences
                     the animal body is beset by problems, the first of which is its multiple, overlapping
                     systems: “three” systems, like the <em>Encyclopedia</em> itself, or as Hegel admits, “a good many more” (<em>Nature</em> 359; <em>Phenomenology</em> 166). While the body “contain[s]” these systems, their very unification “produce[s]
                     a general, concrete interpenetration” of systems by “one another,” so that a particular
                     system is not confined to its place “but permeates all the other systems of the organism”
                     (<em>Nature</em> 372; <em>Phenomenology</em> 162). The relation of parts to the whole here is dangerously close to Novalis’ application
                     of the parts to the whole. This is to say that unity itself may be something of a <span class="foreign">pharmakon</span>, if we allow one system, for instance physiology, to affect another, such as the
                     body politic, which is also discussed in terms of the biopolitical language of “members.”

               </div>
               <p>Indeed Schelling emphasizes precisely such “accidents”that occur through integration
                  in a body, when he uses the body as a figure for complex systems. Schelling writes
                  that the body contains multiple systems (“digestive etc.”), and favourably contrasts
                  this tangled body to Kant’s use of geometry as a model for philosophy: “It is as though
                  one preferred a stereometrically regular crystal to the human body for the reason
                  that the former has no possibility of falling ill, while the latter hosts germs of
                  every possible illness” ( “On the Nature of Philosophy” 212-13). Working out of the
                  same speculative image cluster in which “a system or organ” establishing itself in
                  “isolation” is condemned as disease (Hegel, <em>Nature</em> 428), Schelling had already attributed a positive value to disease in the <em>Freedom</em> essay (1809): “An individual body part [<em>Glied</em>], like the eye, is only possible within the whole of an organism; nonetheless, it
                  has its own life for itself, indeed, its own kind of freedom, which it obviously proves
                  through the disease of which it is capable” (18). But if it is Schelling who ambivalently
                  valorizes this separateness as freedom, it is Hegel who allows, through his concept
                  of “fluidity,” for the obstinacy of the part to have consequences for the whole.</p>

                  <p>While there is no space here for an extensive reading of the section on the “Animal
                     Organism,” suffice it to say that just as Schelling’s dynamic atomism doubles as a
                     physics of knowledge, so too Hegel’s discussions of the body double as a physiology,
                     or indeed pathography, of the “full body of articulated cognition” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 9).

                              the spirit of Hegel, who does begin his Preface by using anatomy to think about the
                              nature of knowledge. Green Musselman uses the term “pathography” to describe “autobiographical
                              memoirs written by modern-day physicians who suffer an illness” (6).</span></div>
                     </div> This is all the more so given the use of the word “systems” throughout the section
                     on the body, and given that the same words and concepts are often used both in the
                     epistemic and physiological registers. Thus the aggregate and the organism describe
                     plants vs. animals but also the form that Hegel wants a science to take: it “must
                     present itself as an organism” rather than being “a simple aggregate” (<em>Nature</em> 6). Indeed, it is because of his investment in organic, inward knowledge with deep
                     rather than surface, metamorphic connections that Hegel thinks poorly of plants. In
                     a similar mirroring of the literal and metaphorical, Hegel concludes the <em>Phenomenology</em> by saying that through its long journey the Self has “to penetrate and digest (<span class="foreign">verdauen</span>) the entire wealth of its substance” (492). In the section on the organism in the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> he then has an extensive account of digestion that is overdetermined by psycho-philosophical
                     concerns that make it impossible not to apply his physiology to his philosophy. In
                     short the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>, this “weak link in the dialectical chain” (Gasché 3), is a <span class="foreign">mise-en-abime</span> of the Encyclopedia itself. It is, as Hegel says, “the Idea in the form of <em>otherness</em>” (<em>Nature</em> 13), and as such generates a number of reflexive figures for the functioning of the
                     larger system.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This is not to say with Werner Hamacher, who is similarly sensitive to Hegel’s work
                  as “writing,” that Hegel’s philosophy, “closed as it is in order to round out the
                  circle of the encyclopedic system,” draws “every critique which contests it, every
                  new reading which addresses it, back into its own circle” (1). On the contrary Hegel,
                  tarrying as he does with the negative, is pushed again and again to break the circle
                  that he wants to close, and to expose his auto-encyclopedia of Spirit to its auto-immunity.
                  Auto-immunity is Derrida’s word for the tendency of an organism to destroy “its own
                  immunitary protections,” which he sees as a kind of vitality (<em>Rogues</em> 124, 55). And for Hegel too this auto-immunity is precisely what characterizes the
                  organism, even though he hopes to endure and overcome it: “A stone cannot become diseased,”
                  but the “living creature is always exposed to danger, always bears within itself an
                  other, but can endure this contradiction, which the inorganic cannot” (<em>Nature</em> 429, 274). Or as he also says, noting the specific character of an organism as an
                  inside facing an outside, a “wound ... only becomes dangerous through exposure to
                  air. Organic life alone is characterized by its perpetual self-restoration in the
                  process of its destruction” (109).</p>
               <p>As a mirror within the Encyclopedia, the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> generates a number of figures that react on the larger system. Let me briefly touch
                  on three in the section on the animal body: digestion, disease and fluidity. First,
                  digestion or “assimilation” (381): the “adaptation of the non-organic to the purposes
                  of the living creature” (381), which Hegel also calls “mediation” (402). We often
                  extend the verbs “digest” and “assimilate” to knowledge. Indeed, repeating his opposition
                  of the organism to the non-organic, Hegel produces a peculiarly vexed metaphor for
                  knowledge as a struggle with resistant material: “all externality is non-organic;
                  as, e.g., for the individual, the sciences are his non-organic nature,” which he has
                  “to make his own” (276). Throughout the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>, which Hegel describes as an “alien existence” that is “refractory towards the unity
                  of the Notion” (3, 444), we see the pathos and <span class="foreign">agon</span> of Hegel’s attempt to <em>organ</em>ize these sciences within a larger system so as to convert “externality” into a “self-like
                  unity” (393). These attempts at <em>organ</em>ization, at accessing “structure, as alive” (377), are always bound up with some kind
                  of pain. Take, for instance, the weirdly catachrestic mediation of anatomical into
                  psycho-philosophical language in Hegel’s glossing of a description of bones that he
                  borrows from Autenreith’s <em>Handbuch der empirischen menschlichen Physiologie</em> (1801): <span class="quote">‘‘Bones, simply on account of the larger number of their vessels in general possess
                     more vitality’ (in comparison with cartilages); ‘and this is evidenced by their susceptibility
                     to inflammation and pathological changes ....’ Bone, i.e. the sensibility belonging
                     to shape as such is, like the wood of the plant, the simple and therefore dead force
                     which is not yet a process, but abstract reflection-into-self. At the same time, however,
                     it is the dead force reflected into self. (361)’</span> Or take the neuropathically intense, psychoanalytically prescient description of
                  how the “sensibility which has withdrawn into itself,” produces a “system not yet
                  separated out,” the sympathetic nervous system. “This system forms ganglia [<em>Nervenknoten</em>] which can be regarded as little brains in the abdomen.” Here according to Autenreith
                  digestion “is withdrawn from our control” into an absent body, a lapse that Hegel
                  glosses as follows: “In the sommanbulistic state ...self-consciousness is turned inwards
                  [and] this internal vitality passes into the ganglia, and into the brain of this dark
                  independent self-consciousness” (364). If the passage on bones is an example of mediation,
                  the analysis of the sympathetic nervous system is something else: one of those accidents
                  to which Hegel refers, which unsettles his intentions and is part of the “self-(post)
                  development” of philosophy, inasmuch as another “sphere” is beginning to be formed
                  within physiology, namely psychoanalysis.</p>
               <p>In contrast to the more thoughtful, recursive term “inwardizing” or <span class="foreign">Er-Innerung</span>, digestion names an aggressive process of sublating these “externalities” or “accidents”
                  that assault Spirit in Hegel’s reading of the scientific manuals of his time. Indeed
                  the aggression of philosophy’s attempt to organize the “non-organic” material of physiology
                  is evident in Hegel’s account of digestion as a process in which the “appetitive organism”
                  is turned “outwards” and “provided with weapons” (393). The organism “overcome[s]
                  and digest[s]” “the object or the negative” into its “subjectivity,” so as to master
                  its own unwanted “<em>involvement</em> with the outer world” (395): an aggression that is bound to fail, given Hegel’s description
                  of the subject itself as pure negativity, or as he also says “<em>lack</em>” (385). But what happens when the animal cannot fully digest what is external? Elsewhere
                  I have described the complex psycho-metaphorics of digestion, in which it is not clear
                  whether “the non-organic ‘potency’” (403) is outside or also inside. The animal must
                  digest what is external, but is “repell[ed]” by itself because of its “entanglement
                  with the outer thing,” and so must also cast out this outside that is inside. The
                  “conclusion of the process of assimilation” is thus “excretion,” by which the animal,
                  instead of making the external internal, “makes itself external to itself” (404):
                  “Excrement has, therefore, no other significance than this, that the organism recognizing
                  its error, gets rid of its entanglement with outside things” (405), and thus “rid[s]
                  itself of [its] lack of self-confidence” (403).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But as this oddly ethical and psychological language indicates, this outside was never
                     fully outside. On the one hand, excretion has to follow digestion in normal assimilation
                     and so is a sign that digestive appropriation has succeeded: excrement, we are told,
                     “consists mainly of digested matter, or what the organism itself has added to the
                     digested material” (405). But on the other hand, excretion also seems a form of indigestion,
                     since “even in the healthiest animals” the excrement is not “homogeneous” but contains
                     “undecomposed food” (405), which is to say that excrement is a rem(a)inder of failed
                     assimilation.

                     </div> No wonder, then, that in digestion “the organism in angrily opposing itself to the
                     outer world is divided within itself” (402). Or that digestion proves to be a turning
                     on oneself, as the “organism converts its own members into a non-organic nature, ...
                     lives on itself and produces its own self,” becoming a “self-like unity” only through
                     a repression in which digestion is, in effect, a form of abjection (377, 393). If
                     philosophy is what the organism has added to external matter, then the sheer weirdness
                     of the way Hegel catachrestically converts matter into the language of Spirit makes
                     philosophy a kind of undigested excrement. The result is that the text, whose attempt
                     to heal the wound of nature recalls the genre of spiritual autobiography, is more
                     accurately described as a pathography of the philosophical spirit.</p>

               <p>The vexed nature of digestion opens up another sphere in the discussion of the animal
                  organism, namely disease, which occurs when one of the body’s “systems or organs ...
                  establishes itself in isolation [<span class="foreign">sich fur sich festsetzt</span>] and persists in its particular activity against the activity of the whole” (428).
                  Disease, in other words, is the part’s resistance to being digested by the whole,
                  or the whole’s failure to digest its parts. Indeed Hegel goes so far as to describe
                  disease as “an indigestibility in general” (433), and the language of toxicity crosses
                  between digestion and illness. Digestion, “the <em>power</em>” of life “over its non-organic object,” is an “infection” (395), a curious word,
                  since it is not clear whether the food or the body is being infected. On the other
                  hand, the medicine for disease is an “<em>indigestible</em> substance” that forces the organism to rally and digest what is external to it (434,
                  436).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These ambivalences towards digestion bring Hegel closer than we might expect to Schelling,
                     who, as we have seen, confers a value on disease as the freedom of the part from the
                     whole (although he too is not without ambivalence). For on the surface Hegel does
                     seem more committed than his erstwhile friend to the containment of members in a whole,
                     and less inclined to say, as Schelling does, that “disease is a completely relative
                     concept” and that what is disease in one organism may be part of another organism’s
                     functioning (<em>First Outline</em> 160). But it is significant that in his allegorization of the stages through which
                     disease passes Hegel translates the physiological term “irritability” into a word
                     with great value in his philosophical system: negativity. Combining terms from the
                     physiology of Haller, Blumenbach, and Kielmeyer– terms that had preoccupied him from
                     the Jena years and the <em>Phenomenology</em> onwards–eHegel postulates three “moments” in the normal organism that are also moments
                     in a disease: sensibility, irritability and reproduction. In effect, he then maps
                     his three-part dialectic onto these moments.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This schema is discussed in both the Phenomenology (160-70) and the Philosophy of
                              Nature, but the former does not include a discussion of disease. The dialectic and
                              the explicit relation of irritability to negativity come in only in the discussion
                              of disease in the latter.</span></div>
                     </div> In sensibility the organism as “<em>being-within-self</em>” verges on the passive, on “insensibility” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 161; <em>Nature</em> 361). Likewise in disease, in the phase of sensibility the disease is “<em>virtually (an sich)</em> present, but without any actual morbidity” (<em>Nature</em> 433). At the threshold of sensibility, the organism arrives at a “moment of difference”
                     in the “nervous system,” which is “directed outwards and involved in external relationships”
                     (361-5). This leads to the next phase, namely irritability, associated with the muscular
                     rather than nervous system, where the organism is involved with “difference” and an
                     “active maintenance of self” (365, 359). Finally Hegel draws on Blumenbach’s <em>Bildungstrieb</em>, which was influential for Kant’s notion of teleology, to theorize his third moment
                     of “reproduction.” In the normal state reproduction simply means the organism’s reproduction
                     of its parts or of further organisms, or in an interesting variant, the constructive
                     instinct of birds, for instance, building nests (<em>Phenomenology</em> 161; <em>Nature </em>407). But tellingly, in the pathography of <em>The Philosophy of Nature</em>’s last section, the only reproduction that the organism can manage is excrement,
                     as if to dis-figure teleology and epigenesis as the organism’s progressive self-organization
                     over time.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of particular interest here is the second moment of irritability and the form it takes
                  in the section on disease. For irritability as difference can be simply aggressive:
                  plants are sensitive, animals irritable. It is in only connection with disease that
                  it becomes associated with the more self-scrutinizing language of negativity. Here
                  irritability takes on a psychic dimension as the part’s separation of itself from
                  the whole: “There is established in the self and in opposition to it as universal,
                  a determinateness which makes its own self into a fixed self,” and now the organism,
                  concentrated in a part of itself, is “restricted to itself” and “possesses within
                  its own self the negative of itself” (<em>Nature</em> 433, 438). The self is “turned against its structure” and the “negative thing is
                  the structure itself” (429). While this obstinacy of the part is not desirable for
                  Hegel’s architectonic notion of the body, it cannot be wholly undesirable, given that
                  the negative (albeit as negativity rather than determinate negation) is the motor
                  of Hegel’s system.</p>
               <p>In short, the separation of the part from the whole is seen as disease, but it is
                  this “indigestibility” which seems the condition of possibility for a negativity to
                  which Hegel is deeply committed. Schelling’s discussion elsewhere of “indecomposable”
                  substances provides an interesting parallel to Hegel’s indigestible material. Working
                  out of Kant’s argument that anything which is divisible cannot be “free from composition”
                  or utterly “simple” (<em>Physical Monadology</em> 55), Schelling distinguishes between “decomposable” substances like soil, and those
                  that are “absolute[ly] indecomposable” or “absolute[ly] incomposable.” Perhaps confusingly,
                  he insists that the latter are also “absolute[ly] composable”: “Indecomposability
                  and absolute composability ... always coexist” (<em>First Outline</em> 29-31). Schelling’s point is to keep indecomposability as a way for something to
                  resist appropriation, to preserve its integrity, while allowing that such dead-ends,
                  which do not fit into a system, are also always be composable, capable of being dissolved
                  and dissipated in order to be recreated. Hence just as “nature makes the absolutely
                  indecomposable substances composable through decomposition, so the absolutely indecomposable
                  substances, conversely, are inserted once again into the universal circulation of
                  matter through composition” (31). Schelling’s terms, developed as they are in the
                  subject-less realm of physics, lack the affect of Hegel’s indigestibility, whose environment
                  is the psycho-physiology of the organism. But the point bears on Hegel: the indigestible
                  that resists assimilation, causing a dis-ease within the system or even an absolute
                  stoppage, can also be decomposed and put back into intellectual circulation.</p>
               <p>One such undigested or uncomposed remnant is the curious passage on the sympathetic
                  nervous system as withdrawn into a “somnambulistic state” that conceals a “dark independent
                  self-consciousness” (<em>Nature </em>364). Like the bits of information in the <em>EB</em>, Hegel’s translation of the ganglia into the terms of mesmerism as well as philosophy
                  is neither digested nor cast out from his larger system. But from a later perspective
                  we can compose it in another order, where it becomes part of “the self-(post) development”
                  of Romantic philosophy as a laboratory for psychoanalysis, at that time a “system
                  not yet separated out” from physiology (364).</p>
               <p>In Novalis’ terms, this encyclopedization of a molecule of knowledge becomes possible
                  by “applying” the physiological concept of “fluidity” to knowledge, thus potentializing
                  it in the epistemic register. Fluidity is an important concept for both Hegel and
                  Schelling. In Schelling’s <em>First Outline</em> the universal fluid is the unconditioned (<span class="foreign">Unbedingt</span>) that precedes Nature’s composition of products or “figures” (26, 27n), which are
                  “bound” forms that must be decomposed or unbound in order to be composed again, or
                  taken up “into the universal process of organization” (31). For Schelling, as Coleridge
                  recognized in adapting him, this Primary Imagination at the level of Nature is the
                  ground and analogue for the workings of the Secondary Imagination mediated by mind
                  (<em>Biographia</em> 304). More agonistically, Hegel adapts this fluidity to disease, thinking the part-whole
                  relationship through his ambivalence about chronic vs. acute illness. For in disease,
                  as we have seen, one system isolates itself and establishes itself against the whole,
                  “the fluidity and all-pervading process of which is thus obstructed,” whereas in health
                  all the body’s “organs are fluid in the universal” (<em>Nature</em> 428).</p>
               <p>But the problem, which has ramifications for cognitive as well as physiological behaviour,
                  is that this “derange[ment]” of the organism by one of its parts can involve either
                  chronic or acute illness. In chronic illness, the disease “remains in one organ,”
                  while other functions are “quite unimpaired, ” but in acute illness the entire organism
                  is “morbidly affected”(432). And Hegel is uncertain which is less disastrous. On the
                  one hand, as long as the disease “is peculiar to” and “confined” within “one particular
                  system” such as the philosophy of nature, “it is easier to cure because only one organ
                  is irritated or depressed.” “The system has only to be extricated from its entanglement
                  with its non-organic nature and kept within bounds” (433), as Hegel tries to do in
                  moving on from nature to spirit. On the other hand, chronic disease is also particularly
                  associated with obstruction, as in “hardening of the liver” (432). We can understand
                  this through Merleau-Ponty’s analysis of pathological behaviour as something “rigid”
                  and not “integrated into a coherent and flexible field of meaning” (Wild xv; Merleau-Ponty
                  86, 178). Hence when “one system” makes itself “the independent centre of activity...
                  the organism too can no longer, as an independent whole, come to itself,” which is
                  to say that the disease has not really been isolated in a part. So Hegel also says
                  that medicine prefers acute illness, since if the whole organism is affected, “the
                  activity of the whole organism too, can be released” (<em>Nature</em> 432). Acute illness restores fluidity, facilitating a cure through what is, in effect,
                  a kathartic “general, concrete interpenetration” of the systems earlier described
                  (372), but with the proviso that until this katharsis happens, the rigidity, not unlike
                  uncomposability, also protects what the existing field of meaning is not ready to
                  integrate.</p>
               <p>It is clear that Hegel himself cannot confine intellectual dis-ease, the restlessness
                  of the negative, in one system. The distinction between acute and chronic illness
                  is followed by an uncomposed <em>Zusatz</em> “A third form of disease is that which originates in the universal subject, especially
                  man. These are <em>diseases of the soul ... </em>which can even result in death” (432). The point simply sits there, in a silent confinement,
                  briefly offered as information rather than knowledge, an uncomposed remnant of Hegel’s
                  encyclopedic reading in the scientific literature of his time. Yet diseases of the
                  soul return in another system, the Anthropology, which is part of the philosophy of
                  Spirit. But conversely, it also seems that neither Hegel nor Schelling are quite ready
                  to release the depression of one system into the whole. For even the latter’s discussion
                  of disease in the <em>First Outline</em>, whose germinal importance Krell has analysed (103-15), lies uncomposed in an appendix,
                  and the larger work in which it is released, namely the unpublished 1815 <em>Ages of the World</em>, is not a whole.</p>
               <p>Stepping back, we see in the tremendous complexity of Hegel’s Encyclopedia what Bertalanffy
                  calls an open rather than closed system. For Bertalanffy open systems emerge on the
                  threshold between physics and biology. Whereas physics and mathematics model closed
                  systems, what he calls “organismic” biology makes possible a system characterized
                  by “continuous change, regulation, and apparent teleology,” but constantly thwarted
                  and complicated by feedback loops (6, 89-92). But Bertalanffy provides an imperfect
                  parallel on two grounds. In the feedback loop information is fed back and recombined
                  till “the goal or target is reached,” so that his open systems are still characterized
                  by homeostasis or the maintenance of balance (43-6). Second, in Hegel’s and Schelling’s
                  turn away from Spinoza, substance is subject. But for Bertalanffy though substance
                  is process, it is not subject; the open system in Bertalanffy or Deleuze has a subject-less,
                  absolute immanence that is without what Schelling calls “personality” (<em>Freedom</em> 33, 75). It is therefore characterized by a certain utopianism and abstraction, whereas
                  Hegel’s work suffers through time. Hegel’s sympathetic nervous system also provides
                  a model for the circulation of information in complex systems; indeed as the symptom
                  of what it describes, the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> is a system that is at once digestive, nervous and productive. This is to say that
                  encyclopedics, the struggle of a single subject to <em>organ</em>ize knowledge, is the labour of the negative, a difficult education subject to accident
                  and at times ruin. Sometimes, as in the <em>Phenomenology</em> and the Introduction to the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, this struggle with the negative that is <em>Bildung</em> is cast as a spiritual autobiography. But sometimes, as in the <em>Philosophy of Nature,</em> it is the pathography of Spirit’s attempt “to orient [itself] in the world of sickness”
                  and to heal itself (Musselman 6), which is possible only if we think of healing as
                  an interminable analysis.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For instance the <em>Intelligenzblatt Der Jenaischen Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</em> (1804-41) provides notices of recent publications under a number of disciplinary
               headings. In addition the 1818 issues of this monthly journal, for example, include
               notices of lecture courses at the University of Berlin, lists of books for sale and
               people who received doctorates. The journal is a heterogeneous attempt to cover the
               sphere of knowledge. In Britain the <em>Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</em> has a section on “Scientific Intelligence” arranged under various areas.The short-lived
               <em>German Museum</em> (1800-1) reviews new publications in Germany, and then has a Supplement broken down
               into different subject areas.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">I capitalize Hegel’s Encyclopedia only when referring to the work that consists of
               the <em>Logic</em>, <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>, and <em>Philosophy of Mind</em>. The Encyclopedia project itself is much larger, including lectures on aesthetics
               and on religion edited and published by Hegel’s students. Hegel published very little:
               among his well-known texts, only the <em>Phenomenology</em> (1807), <em>The Science of Logic </em>(1812, 1813, 1816), the <em>Philosophy of Right</em> (1821), and the Heidelberg <em>Encyclopedia</em> (1817) and Berlin <em>Encyclopedia</em> (1827/30), which are outlines. Hegel’s many lecture courses are subsystems that develop
               parts of the macrosystem that exists in outline, and which he began to conceptualize
               well before 1817, in his earlier Jena system, which he also did not publish. Even
               the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> as it comes down to us is an eclectic text, consisting of those parts of the outline
               that pertain to nature, with <em>Zusätze</em> or expansions added by K.L. Michelet from notes by Hegel’s students. We should not
               dismiss these eclectic texts or <em>Zusätze</em> as not truly Hegel’s simply because he did not publish them: this is to be bound
               by notions of final authorial intention that are fundamentally not Romantic. Hegel
               did not publish his lectures because his living system had to be endlessly annotated,
               expanded, qualified, and complicated: because he was not the closed thinker posited
               by Derrida (<em>Glas</em>, 
               “The Age of Hegel”
               ) and Hamacher. The format of the <em>Zusatz</em> is brilliantly addressed by Jean-Luc Nancy in <em>The Speculative Remark</em>. We should note, and indeed insist, that the <em>Zusatz</em> or supplement is also intrinsic to the kind of “system” represented by an encyclopedia.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Miller sometimes translates the word <span class="foreign">Bildung</span> as “culture” and sometimes as “education” (<em>Phenomenology</em> 8, 16; <em>Phänomenologie </em>18, 28). In addition to its associations with Blumenbach’s <em>Bildungstrieb</em>, the German word is also connected with <span class="foreign">Bild</span> (picture or image), the word Hegel uses at the end of the text to describe Spirit
               as having traversed a “gallery of images” in its education. It is therefore unfortunate
               that at the end of the text, where Hegel couples <em>Bild</em> with <span class="foreign">Bildung</span>, Miller does not translate the word at all (<em>Phenomenology</em> 428; <em>Phänomenologie 566).</em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Unlike Husserl, who continues the German Idealist tradition of separating transcendental
               from empirical (or eidetic from factual) sciences, Kant is not driven by a passion
               to eradicate the “natural standpoint.” It simply does not fall within his domain,
               and when he deals with empirical matters such as universal history or perpetual peace,
               his concern is how to use the critical apparatus so as to think about these domains.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">See Zammito (286-92) on the course entitled “Encyclopedia of Philosophy as a Whole
               with an abridged History of Philosophy Based on Feder’s Sketch.” Zammito speculates
               that there was more of this course than survives in printed form, and mentions that
               the Encyclopedia lectures were bound (by a buyer) with those on physical geography
               and physics (287). He thus argues for a closer connection of this course to the work
               of the <em>Popularphilosoph</em> Johann Feder than seems warranted by the <em>Enzyklopädievorlesung</em> published by Gerhard Lehmann, and this in turn is because he follows a division between
               the pre-Critical and Critical Kant, and sees the former, prior to the break with Herder,
               as still allied with “anthropology.” But as noted by Louden (434), Kant was required
               to use a textbook for his courses and generally paid little attention to his chosen
               text. Feder probably played this role in the Encyclopedia course, while Kant’s own
               contribution to the course is the <em>Enzyklopädievorlesung</em> printed by Lehmann. In other words, while Kant may have been aware that one could
               think of the “encyclopedia” in a broader (mixed empirical and transcendental) sense,
               his own treatment of areas other than philosophy such as Anthropology and Physical
               Geography was consistent with the architectonic mapped out in the first <em>Critique</em>, which rigorously separates the “rational” from the “empirical” parts of disciplines.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">As always, Novalis provides little elaboration, but pathological philosophy seems
               to be a philosophy open to failure: “An absolute drive for perfection and completeness
               is morbid, as soon as it shows itself to be destructive and adverse to what is <em>imperfect</em>, and incomplete.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Arkady Plotnitsky also takes up this complexity in terms of Deleuze’s concept of the
               baroque: a “defining feature of the Baroque is the multiplicity of varying and curved
               –convex and concave– mirrors .... Baroque houses are full of mirrors and seem to need
               mirrors more than windows” (Plotnitsky 120). But while also reading Hegel against
               the grain and emphasizing the complexity of the folds within what he calls his “superfold”
               (121), Plotnitsky sees the totality of Hegel’s work as a “divergent harmony” (132)
               in which the “upward movement of Spirit and humanity,” albeit in “diagonal” form (127),
               is not jeopardized.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               dogmatist.... Idealism is the soul of philosophy; realism is the body; only both together
               can constitute a living whole” (26). In <em>Ages of the World</em> he writes, “Whoever does not acknowledge the priority of Realism wants evolution
               without the involution that preceded it. ... The greatest glory of development is
               not expected from what easily unfolds. It is expected from what has been excluded
               and which only decides to unfold with opposition (107).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
