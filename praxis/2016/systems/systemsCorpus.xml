               <p>This essay introduces the essays in the current volume by beginning with
          the work of William Hazlitt. Hazlitt’s relation to the work of noted system-builders of
          the age (from Kant to Bentham) was far from straightforward: he criticized their
          “derangement” but admired and even envied their vision. Hazlitt’s views echo a range of
          other writers (Blake, Wollstonecraft, and Godwin, to name a few) who were adept at
          constructing systems as well as attacking them. Such responses demonstrate the startling
          range of positions that could be taken with respect to systematic thinking of the age, and
          the essays in the volume demonstrate that Romanticism presents us not with a unified set
          of beliefs or ideologies about systems but rather with a vibrant display of contrasting
          arguments, anxieties, and ambitions. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p> In his essay <title level="a">On People with One Idea</title> from <title level="m">Table-Talk</title>, William Hazlitt begins his diatribe against a host of writers and
            political figures of the day by criticizing Major Cartwright’s program for Parliamentary
            Reform (here Cartwright is designated only as “C—”). The problem with people like
            Cartwright, Hazlitt says, is that they see their own causes as the cures for all evils
            and the answers to all questions. Beginning with Cartwright, he quickly moves on to
            criticize a range of others who espouse the causes of nutrition, abolition,
            Unitarianism—all with the same deluded fervor. Hazlitt even includes himself among those
            who have spent too much time “incessantly harping on one idea”: he once joined the ranks
            of “projectors” who all share the same “disorder” or “derangement of the fancy” (144).
            As Hazlitt goes on with his argument, it becomes clear that he is taking issue not
            merely with people who have one idea but with those who have one particular kind of
            idea: that of the systematizing impulse so prevalent in his day. The advocates of
            “system” singled out for some of his more stinging ridicule include crazed adherents of
            the “Kantean system” of metaphysics (145), as well as industrialist and social reformer
            Robert Owen, whose “system” of villages and factories are inflated—in the minds of Owen
            and other reformers—with “undue importance” (152-53). </p>
                  <p>What is Hazlitt talking about when he refers to systems and their advocates? At first
            glance, it seems as though systematizers are simply people with bad manners. He refers
            to how these misguided philosophers, social improvers, and “projectors” are “vivacious
            mannerists” who are “bad companions” in conversation (157, 153); they make everyone
            “tired” of speaking with them, even make them tired of themselves (154). But he offers a
            still more incisive account of system-builders. Although they claim that their systems
            provide all-encompassing answers to all questions, and that they cure all evils, their
            systems fail at this endeavor. Instead, systems seem only like personal ticks and
            obsessions. Hazlitt doesn’t suggest that the thoughts of systematic thinkers are too
            large or abstract: such a complaint is not really the focus of his essay, and this is
            why Hazlitt’s account provides an intriguing contrast with the idea of “system” to be
            found in Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>.
            There, Burke consistently opposes the English traditions of common law, inheritance, and
            Protestantism to the “new political system” in France (226); the new system he observes
            is associated with philosophical abstraction and mathematical calculation removed from
            empirical observation. On Hazlitt’s terms, however, systematizers are not systematic
            enough. The claims of systematizers to cure “every . . . evil” (140) and to offer “a
            subject which is of universal and paramount interest” (139) are utterly mistaken or at
            least wildly overblown. Their ideas and schemes are insufficiently capacious to connect
            multiple objects, phenomena, or agents; the result is that Cartwright, Owen, and their
            ilk are “always revolving round [their] own little circle[s]” (154). Each little circle,
            by attracting fanatically devoted adherents, creates a “collusion” among a small group
            of persons attached to a small number of objects, rather than an “exchange” of ideas;
            only the latter—an “exchange”—allows one to “hear what people have to say on a number of
            subjects” and ultimately find a common ground with them (154). </p>
                  <p>“Exchange” for Hazlitt is a big circle—more “Catholic”—rather than a little one (153);
            it seems to imitate and outdo the work of systematizers rather than merely oppose them.
            We might be tempted to think that the “exchange” system Hazlitt is arguing for—exchange
            over collusion—is liberalism. But that wouldn’t be quite right. People with one idea, it
            turns out, are alternately associated with landed property and with liberal
            commercialism. Cartwright’s reform is like an “estate for life”; it is a personal
            “stronghold” (141)—as if the form of his thought overturned the content of his quest for
            universal suffrage. But even as the ideas of system-builders seem to provide propertied
            security, they are just as often “by their very nature intermittent” and change with the
            “season” (142), as if ideas were not like landed property but like marketable,
            all-too-exchangeable, goods. Both alternatives seem in Hazlitt’s view to demonstrate an
            excessive dedication merely to personal “distinction” (142). These bad systematizers are
            “egotists” who are “only in love with themselves” (158). In contrast, Hazlitt recommends
            a way of thinking that arises from personal commitment but also from a consideration of
            a larger “circle” or context than the reformers and social improvers currently see. The
            more “Catholic” mind that Hazlitt prefers (153) admits the importance of single genres,
            discourses, or disciplines, while it also refuses prolonged identification with any one
            of them, acknowledging and grasping “other things” beyond local or personal obsessions
            (153). The “exchange of ideas” and the “conversation” (138) ensuing from it are not
            about personal possession; having an idea means only engaging with it temporarily and at
            the same seeing its limitations in order to move on elsewhere within the larger set of
            interconnected ideas. The exchange thus situates the subject (including Hazlitt the
            essayist) in a web of generic and discursive relationships that permits articulation
            from a particular standpoint, but it also encourages movement and understanding among
            different standpoints. All of those standpoints, moreover, collectively participate in
            the larger “circle” of exchange. And thus we might say that Hazlitt fights
            system—tentatively and uncomfortably—with system. </p>
                  <p> Hazlitt approaches the problem of systems in a way that is politically charged; he
            sees “projectors” everywhere in the politics of English reform, and he sees
            system-builders like Jeremy Bentham and William Godwin defining, or at least helping to
            define, the spirit of the age (<title level="m">Spirit of the Age</title> 4-32). These
            thinkers, moreover, are deeply indebted to explorations of systems throughout the
            eighteenth century. Hazlitt’s impulse to dismiss systematic thinkers as egotists in both
              <title level="m">Table Talk</title> and <title level="m">The Spirit of the Age</title>
            is most certainly motivated by his nervousness about the association between social
            projectors and revolutionary politics, but, again, the tactic contrasts with Burke’s
            tendency to counter the generalizing, abstracting politics of system with the politics
            of habit and tradition. Hazlitt’s very un-Burkean move is to make current systems look
            too small rather than too large. And this deliberate mischaracterization, brilliant as
            it is, only thinly disguises the fact that Hazlitt conjures up an opposition to
            systematic thinkers precisely in order to mask a deeper sympathy with them, or even an
            envy of them. </p>
                  <p>The justification for Hazlitt’s nervous and tentative enthusiasm for systems becomes
            particularly apparent when we consider that the impulse behind Enlightenment thought in
            La Mettrie, Holbach, and Volney was (not unlike Hazlitt) to criticize social structures
            that were too influenced by the obsessions and whims of tyrannical individuals.
            Holbach’s <title level="m">Système de la Nature</title>, for example, understood itself
            to be a “system” insofar as it emphasized the interdependence of all parts of the human
            and natural world according to “unerring laws,” and further understood that
            interdependence to provide a rational principle for human action (2.62). The trouble
            Holbach inadvertently encountered was that a system of nature always required imposing
            an obviously human set of values on nature, which were then read back onto society. This
            is what Bentham—the arch system-builder, whom Hazlitt both criticized and admired—didn’t
            like about the natural law tradition: it claimed to move beyond the vagaries of
            traditional moral and legal structures, but it seemed merely to be the result of an
            unacknowledged human fabrication. The solution he found was not to move beyond human
            fabrication but to insist upon it. Law is man-made rather than natural, and its
            perfection derives precisely from its achievement of coherence as a deliberately and
            carefully constructed entity (anticipating, perhaps, Niklas Luhmann’s account of systems
            as self-referential [34]). </p>
                  <p>Bentham’s critique of the common law tradition ran in a similar direction, since the
            worship of common law, particularly in William Blackstone’s account (an account praised
            by Edmund Burke [117]), seemed to him very much like the worship of natural law: only
            living humans can really say what a law, whether inherited from nature or tradition, is.
            Thus Bentham’s attack on Blackstone’s <title level="m">Commentaries</title> in the
              <title level="m">Fragment on Government</title> appears to be nothing other than a
            critique of Blackstone’s lack of system. He criticizes and corrects the irregular
            dependence on manners, personality, and custom in Blackstone’s view—and he instead
            proposes a “system uniform, comprehensive, and simultaneous” based on a “principle” of
            utility (64). Blackstone’s system, in Bentham’s view, is not a system at all. </p>
                  <p>Bentham emphasizes something that was present in Enlightenment thinking all along but
            not always consistently realized. He equates system with a formal invention that,
            because of its more complete accounting for all members in an organization or body—in
            Bentham’s case, a social one—could advance beyond customs and prejudices that understand
            society primarily in terms of a small group. A system could thus operate as an advance
            on accumulated customs and traditions and look like a way of ushering in a new
            historical epoch, even while to no small degree what was new about the system was that
            it would subsume and include, rather than simply replace, the existing norms and
            practices inherited from prior epochs. </p>
                  <p>In many ways, Bentham’s definition of his “systematic” approach to political
            organization brings us close to our own modern dictionary definitions of “system,” which
            (judging from the examples in the <title level="m">OED</title>) had accumulated a double
            meaning by the end of the eighteenth century. A system was a mode of thought or physical
            organization that was 1) internally coherent to form a “complex unity” and 2) guided by
            a philosophical “law,” “purpose,” or “function.” Bentham in many respects may become
            system’s apologist just as much as Burke is its adversary, but if these views seem to
            oppose each other, we might look at Romanticism less in terms of strict adherents and
            opponents to system (although of course we can see that such positions did exist), and
            more in terms of a far more complex, troubled, and ambivalent series of engagements with
            system’s promises and hazards. This is why Hazlitt provides a striking instance for us
            to study closely. On the one hand, that is, he represents systems as highly personalized
            and sharply differentiated: they are associated with specific discourses of reform,
            education, philosophical thought, and so on. Clifford Siskin explains this disposition
            toward systems as an embedding of systems within disciplines and genres of discourse
            (206). This embedding, distant from the more ambitious systematic thinking
            characteristic of the early eighteenth century, connects to a third definition for
            system that seems to have appeared in English usage around 1800—a definition of system
            not merely as coherent and unified by one idea but also limited or (as defined by the
              <title level="m">OED</title>) even “oppressive.” On the other hand, we have now seen
            how Hazlitt—even while he points to the limits of “projectors” and their
            systems—demonstrates an intriguing admiration of still larger systems, and even thinks
            of a system of “exchange” as a solution to the problem of system itself. The fact that
            “exchange” trumps political systems defined by liberal individualism or landed property
            attests to its potential critical power over them. </p>
                  <p>We could turn to many other works of the Romantic age that display comparable levels of
            distance from and attraction to systems. Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">A Vindication
              of the Rights of Woman</title> employs “system” consistently to describe a “false”
            view of education and of woman’s place in the world. She specifies that her own view of
            system is not simply more truthful but also more systematic, or it is more truthful
            because it is systematic, since she identifies false modes of thinking as systems but
            then calls their pretensions to systematicity into doubt. The current “system of British
            politics” is only “courteously” called a system because what appears to be coherent is
            actually incoherent, and what appears to involve interdependence actually involves
            subordination (224). Wollstonecraft isn’t entirely comfortable with the term “system” as
            a way of describing her own methods—she calls National Education a “plan” instead
            (254)—but it does in fact fall in line with systematic thinking in terms of its ambition
            to describe and recommend modes of human relationship that would depart from existing
            modes of thought and behavior, by substituting a new, coherent set of
            interdependencies—more “Catholic” in Hazlitt’s words—for patriarchal systems of
            subordination. Wollstonecraft criticizes false systems, but her own recommendations are
            utterly devoted to education as a coherent and inclusive system enhancing public virtue
            (259). </p>
                  <p>This layering in accounts of systems—referring to an enclosed and limited set of
            practices and also to a theoretical ambition—animates other writing that I will here
            simply note briefly. In <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, Godwin contrasts two
            ways of thinking of “systems”: as individual schemes or interests versus a more “just
            political system,” however briefly imagined, based upon utilitarian principles (227). In
            William Blake’s <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, Los famously asserts that “I must
            Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans / I will not Reason &amp; Compare: my
            business is to Create” (651). False system in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> is the
            product of division, while the system replacing it allows identities to “comingle” in
            “mutual interchange” (824). Percy Shelley criticizes false systems too and replaces them
            with new ones: more precisely, he attacks the system of monarchy, to be replaced by a
            “social system” for mutual “advantage,” animated by a principle of equality (253). In
            all of these examples, we can detect a certain level of uneasiness about systems,
            countered by an attempt to define a new system whose unifying principle would not impose
            the same restrictions and exclusions that these various authors identify in false or
            limited systems. </p>
                  <p>My point has been only a fairly general one about the way that Romantic writing could
            point to “system” as a limit in thinking and also as a way of overcoming that limit. The
            essays in this volume probe more deeply into the way that Romantic writers explored the
            limits and possibilities of thinking in terms of systems. The purpose of the collection
            is not to provide a single perspective adopted by Romantic authors, any more than it is
            to provide a single theoretical perspective with which to view those authors. Still, the
            essays do in fact collectively convey a sense that Romantic writers viewed systems with
            a complex mixture of skepticism, anxiety, and enthusiasm. Perhaps these essays indicate
            that it is more fruitful to read Romantic writing as a daring investigation of what
            systems are, and what they do or don’t do, rather than a staging or demonstration of one
            single, stable idea of system. </p>
                  <p> Taken together, the essays also demonstrate a theoretical urge (again, not one that
            involves theoretical uniformity) to re-examine some of the ways in which the criticism
            of Romanticism has approached systems in the past few decades. In their different
            approaches, both deconstruction and new historicism occasionally viewed Romanticism as a
            resistance to systematic thinking: for Paul de Man, tropes undid “textual systems” (71);
            for David Simpson, Romantic literature as a whole defined itself against “system” and
            “theory” (140-41). Inspired by Pierre Bourdieu, the cultural study of the literary
            system—to be found in critics such as Peter Murphy, Margaret Russett, and Clifford
            Siskin—has done much to overcome the opposition between literary expression and systems
            by placing literature within a set of systematic interdisciplinary or intergeneric
            relationships. That important work can be seen as a necessary background for the
            inquiries in this volume, which seek to explore the greater self-awareness about
            discursive constructions as—or in relation to—literary, political, or philosophical
            systems.</p>
                  <p>The first two essays, by Tilottama Rajan and Andrew Franta, explore notions of systems
            and their limits; the second two, by Jocelyn Holland and Anne Frey, investigate the
            inner workings of systems and explore the connections between systems and organic forms.
            Rajan’s account of systems in Hegel begins with an account of the way that encyclopedic
            systems in the empiricist tradition give way to an equation between “system” and
            “method,” once it is discovered to be impossible to conceive of adequate ways of
            unifying projects of knowledge. This impasse is in a sense overcome in German idealist
            attempts to systematize knowledge, but Rajan shows how this is not achieved without a
            struggle. In Kant, system is achieved only through rigorous exclusions; in Hegel, the
            attempt to bring all of nature under the aegis of Spirit results in a painful
            acknowledgment of nature’s indigestibility and disease. The system envisioned in Hegel
            is therefore “subject to accident and at times ruin” (<ref target="praxis.systems.2016.rajan.html">“Models” par. 44</ref>). </p>
                  <p> If there is something indigestible that confronts the systems Rajan is analyzing in
            her essay, Franta investigates Thomas De Quincey’s adventures in systematic thinking in
            order to show how De Quincey confronts this problem even more directly. In his writing
            on political economy, De Quincey critiques Ricardo for not acknowledging the extrinsic
            forces that influence market prices. While insisting on prior and more complex causes
            for market prices—and in a sense insisting on them as part of his view of the economic
            system—he cannot develop a way of making his own system coherent enough to account for
            the endlessly receding and intractable causes behind market prices at given moments in
            time. This problem gets to be examined further in De Quincey’s writing on astronomy,
            where the attempt to grasp the order of the universe is only magnified in its
            impossibility the more one advances (with telescopes) one’s ability to observe it. But
            as much as this extends the logic of the writing on political economy, it also modifies
            it. The encounter with the immensity and incomprehensibility is not simply a failure; it
            ushers in the experience of the sublime, of further thought, and of further systematic
            attempts at comprehension: De Quincey shows that “systems are fictions,” Franta writes,
            “but they are necessary—or at least unavoidable. And they necessarily fail” (<ref target="praxis.systems.2016.franta.html">"De Quincey's Systems" par. 20</ref>).</p>
                  <p> Although Holland’s essay shifts attention away from the issue of a system’s success or
            failure, it addresses mechanical aspects of systems that are often excluded from
            considerations of philosophical definitions that concentrate on system as organic form.
            Holland’s essay claims that many notions of system in fact often appear to waver between
            the organic and the mechanical. More specifically, she shows how even systems that
            appear to be organized along organic principles nevertheless depend upon a fundamental
            mechanism: the lever, with its fulcrum or hypermochlion operating as either a balance or
            connecting point between forces. The structure of the lever is analogized to the
            workings of the individual mind in Novalis; his aphorisms make individual consciousness
            appear to be a lever-like balance of forces. The implications of this move are developed
            even further in Schlegel, where not only individual minds but also the “universe” as a
            whole is described as a lever with a fulcrum. Holland is not saying here that the
            mechanical aspects of systems inhibit their organic functions, but rather that mechanism
            is allowed a space to work—joining parts of the mind and world—within nature philosophy. </p>
                  <p>In her essay, Frey also describes the internal workings of systems, or more precisely
            the workings <emph>between</emph> systems, and this entails (in Percy Shelley’s writing)
            attention to the construction of poetic forms. Concentrating on Shelley’s <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> (revised as <title level="m">The Revolt of
              Islam</title>), Frey shows how Shelley in a great many contexts connects political
            change—the shift from one system to another—with the physical attributes of air. <title level="m">Laon and Cynthna</title> in particular repeatedly connects revolutionary
            speech with air and the drawing of breath. Furthermore, the poem’s staging of
            revolutionary language is self-consciously connected to the arrangement of pauses in the
            poem—pauses from stanza breaks to caesuras for readers to draw a breath. Giving the
            reader a space for her own thought and agency, pauses convey Shelley’s ideal for the way
            he wants to think of poetic form as a “scaffolding” for the agency required for change.
            Not merely identical to any particular political system, poetry’s form, on Shelley’s
            terms, moves agents in order to produce a change in systems. </p>
                  <p> The essays in this issue collectively may indicate, as my initial instance of Hazlitt
            suggests, that Romantic writers are keenly interested in the possibilities of systematic
            thought, but they are keenly aware of its possible limitations. Those limitations may
            emerge as indigestible parts of a system (Rajan) or as reminders of the mechanical bases
            for systems (Holland); they may incur reliance on aesthetic experiences or forms that
            pressure existing systems and construct new ones (Franta, Frey). The essays in this
            volume also point to some intriguing questions for us to consider in our future
            research. What are the precise advantages and disadvantages of thinking in terms of
            systems? What produces trouble for their operation? To what extent is system itself able
            to address this trouble? What is the relation between systematizing the natural world
            and systematizing the political world, and how do Romantic writers understand the
            separation or fluidity between these systems? If our interest in systems is partly
            inspired by a materialist emphasis on specific discourses, communication networks, or
            institutions, what continuing role does aesthetic form have in a discussion of systems?
            What operations are required in order to criticize or revise systems?</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>The idea of the system was one of De Quincey’s many obsessions; he returned to it again
            and again over the course of his career as a writer. In addition to essays on the
            transport system and accounts of systems of publication and communication, he wrote
            extensively about political economy, probing its development after Adam Smith and
            attempting to address its defects as a discipline and to correct the misapprehensions
            that he argued limited its potential as a science. </p>
                  <p>De Quincey was initially a skeptic. In <title level="m">Confessions of an English
              Opium-Eater</title>, he claims that when he first surveyed recent works of political
            economy, he found them to be “generally the very dregs and rinsings of the human
            intellect; and that any man of sound head, and practised in wielding logic with a
            scholastic adroitness, might take up the whole academy of modern economists and throttle
            them between heaven and earth with his finger and thumb, or bray their fungus heads
            together with a lady’s fan” (65). David Ricardo’s <title level="m">On the Principles of
              Political Economy and Taxation</title> (1817) made him a convert. It did for De
            Quincey what Wordsworth’s poetry would do for Mill. “For two years,” he wrote, “I
            believe that I read no book but one” (64). Reading Ricardo inspired “wonder and
            curiosity,” “emotions that had long been dead in me,” and roused him from the personal
            and intellectual malaise brought on by opium (65). In a passage that is as much an
            expression of his own ambitions as a reflection on Ricardo’s accomplishment, he marvels
            that “an Englishman, and he not in academic bowers, but oppressed by mercantile and
            senatorial cares,” had “deduced, <foreign>à priori</foreign>, from the understanding
            itself, laws which first gave a ray of light into the unweildy chaos of materials, and
            had constructed what had been but a collection of tentative discussions into a science
            of regular proportions, now first standing on an eternal basis” (65-6). Circumstances
            prevented De Quincey from finishing his first work on Ricardo (to be titled <title level="m">A Prolegomena to All Future Systems of Political Economy</title>), but after
            the <title level="m">Confessions</title> had made his reputation and secured him a
            position as a regular contributor to the <title level="j">London Magazine</title>, he
            produced critiques of Malthus, a series of dialogues on Ricardo, an essay on Ricardo and
            Adam Smith, and, finally, for <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, the three essays
            that would be become <title level="m">The Logic of Political Economy</title> (1844)
            (originally titled <title level="m">Ricardo Made Easy; or, What is the Radical
              Difference between Ricardo and Adam Smith? With Occasional Notices of Ricardo’s
              Oversights</title>).</p>
                  <p>While De Quincey notices Ricardo’s oversights, he works tirelessly in <title level="m">The Logic of Political Economy</title> to explicate the “scientific proportions” and
            “eternal basis” of Ricardo’s theories. In the preface, he diagnoses the fundamental
            problems of contemporary political economic theory, claiming that “as regards its
              <emph>practical</emph> applications,” economic science is “as treacherous as
            Shakespeare’s ‘stairs of sand’” (119). The image he conjures up to illustrate economics’
            unsound foundations—of “phantom arrays of fleeting columns and fluctuating edifices,”
            created by winds on the Arabian desert—recalls his description of Piranesi’s
            architectural drawings in the <title level="m">Confessions</title> (119). For the opium
            eater, the impossible coherence of Piranesi’s designs represented the “power of endless
            growth and self-reproduction” which animated his own dreams (<title level="m">Confessions</title> 71). The image of economic theory as shifting Arabian sands
            reflects the same power but perceived from something like the opposite direction. Rather
            than Piranesi’s impossible coherence—design undone by paradox—De Quincey finds in
            political economy a promise of coherence that is perpetually, and simultaneously,
            extended and withdrawn. Despite Ricardo’s genius, “nothing can be postulated—nothing can
            be demonstrated; for anarchy, even as to the earliest principles, is predominant”; the
            sandcastles of political economy are “for ever collapsing into dust” (<title level="m">Logic</title> 119).</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Logic of Political Economy</title> seeks to bring order to this
            chaos by shoring up “the distinctions which are elementary to the science” (118). Its
            focus is Ricardo’s theory of value, which, De Quincey argues, commentators had utterly
            misunderstood. This failure to appreciate Ricardo’s revision of Smith, he claims,
            stunted the development of political economy as a systematic mode of thought. But even
            as he works in the service of system, De Quincey encounters the very problem he argues
            the political economists had utterly failed to address. However beautifully conceived in
            theory, in practice, systems are governed by extrinsic conditions. Like men in Marx’s
            conception of history, the market does not make prices just as it pleases; it makes them
            “under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past” (Marx
            15). Thus the tendency of political economists to imagine that the law of supply and
            demand operates in a vacuum, independent of preexisting circumstances, amounts to
            “metaphysical confusion”: <quote>This is an error which has led to worse consequences
              than any of the others here noticed. People fancy that the relation of Supply and
              Demand could by possibility, and that in fact often <emph>does</emph>, determine
              separately <emph>per se</emph> the selling price of an article. Within a few months
              this monstrous idea has been assumed for true by Colonel Torrens, in an express work
              on Economic Politics; by Lord Brougham, in relation to the foreign corn trade; and by
              almost every journal in the land that has fallen under my own eye. But it is a
              metaphysical impossibility that Supply and Demand, the relation of which is briefly
              expressed by the term “market value,” could ever affect price except by a
                <emph>secondary</emph> force. (<title level="m">Logic</title> 121)</quote> De
            Quincey’s point is straightforward enough: while the relation of supply and demand
            affects price, supply and demand necessarily act on a preexisting value. Unlike natural
            price, which “is always monomial,” market price “must always be binomial.” It cannot be
            determined merely by the relationship between supply and demand at a given moment but
            must be calculated in relation to “an antecedent price, arising from some other cause”
            (121). If market price cannot be determined in isolation, however, De Quincey’s own
            logic undermines the stability of his analysis. The “other cause” toward which he
            gestures must itself extend indefinitely into the past. It is also multiply
            determined—and, one must imagine, similarly affected by supply and demand. Metaphysical
            impossibility, it seems, gives way to an epistemological dead end. On De Quincey’s
            account, the logic of political economy is constitutively recursive; it is this logic,
            rather than its principles, that makes economics “the dismal science.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrase is Carlyle’s, from his “Occasional Discourse on the Negro
              Question,” published in <title level="j">Fraser’s</title> in December 1849.</note>

            conclusion. System building requires a closed frame of reference. Two years later,
            however, in an essay on what would appear to be an unrelated topic, De Quincey takes up
            the complications that emerge when systems are situated in space and time and offers a
            striking illustration of the limitations of the systematizing impulse. “System of the
            Heavens as Revealed by Lord Rosse’s Telescopes,” which appeared in <title level="j">Tait’s</title> in 1846, is ostensibly a notice of the Scottish astronomer John
            Pringle Nichol’s <title level="m">Thoughts on Some Important Points Relating to the
              System of the World</title>. Rather than a formal review, however, De Quincey takes
            his friend’s book as his “text”—about which his “little paper … may be said to hover”
            (“System” 7, note 1). Nichol’s book was a work of popular science; De Quincey aims to
            inspire the reader with the sublimity of the universe revealed by recent advances in
            astronomy. His purpose is not to criticize or even summarize Nichol’s account but,
            “through the light torrent <emph>spray</emph> of fanciful images or allusions,” to give
            the reader “momentary glimpses of objects vast and awful” (8, note 1). </p>
                  <p>“System of the Heavens” opens with a question about the age of the earth. Kant had
            posed the question in an essay De Quincey translated and published in <title level="j">Tait’s</title> in 1833. In revisiting it, he transforms Kant’s inquiry into a puzzle.
            He points out that the question does not concern the absolute age of the Earth, because
            knowing the Earth’s age without a frame of reference would tell us nothing. Instead,
            Kant asks, “What proportion does that amount form of the total career allotted to this
            planet?” (8). At issue, in other words, is not “the <emph>positive</emph> amount of
            years through which our Earth has existed” but “the <emph>period</emph> of life, the
              <emph>stage</emph>, which she may be supposed to have reached” (8, 9). In sketching
            out the implications of the question, the essay develops a fanciful conceit in which the
            Earth is “a <emph>lady</emph> planet” and “our dear little mother.” That asking her age
            is “a delicate point,” and the question “improper,” doesn’t prevent De Quincey from
            speculating about it at length and in absurd detail (8). “Is she a child, in fact,” he
            asks, “or is she an adult? And, <emph>if</emph> an adult, and that you gave a ball to
            the Solar System, is she that kind of person that you would introduce to a waltzing
            partner, some fiery young gentleman like Mars; or would you rather suggest to her the
            sort of partnership which takes place at a whist-table?” (9). </p>
                  <p>Kant had warned against using “the sequence of human generations … as a measure for
            God’s works at large” (“Question” 168). But De Quincey’s personification of the planets
            and the analogy he draws between planetary time and generational relationships aren’t
            intended to measure the Earth’s age in human years. They underscore the fact that age,
            of the Earth or a human being, is not an absolute value but a relationship. De Quincey
            suggests that Kant goes wrong when he loses sight of this fact, and the oversight
            prompts him to wonder whether there is, “after all, any stationary meaning in the
            question?” (“System” 10). If we could persuade “our dear excellent mother the Earth” to
            tell us her age, “still <emph>that</emph> would leave us all as much in the dark as
            ever: since, if the answer were ‘Why, children, at my next birth-day I shall count a
            matter of some million centuries,’ we should still be at a loss to <emph>value</emph>
            her age: would it mean that she was a mere chicken, or that she was ‘getting up in
            years’”? Conversely, if the Earth confessed only “generally to being a lady of a certain
            age,” we would know “the <emph>valuation</emph> of the age” but not “the
              <emph>absolute</emph> years numerically: would a ‘certain age’ mean that ‘mamma’ was a
            million, or perhaps not much above seventy thousand?” (12). However the question is
            posed, it assumes a coordinating set of conditions that is absent; taken in isolation,
            neither version tells us what we want to know. Like market value, any meaningful
            calculation of the age of the Earth “must always be binomial.” As De Quincey puts it,
            “there is apparently this two-edged embarrassment pressing upon the case” (11-12). </p>
                  <p>This insight, it turns out, is the real focus of De Quincey’s essay, and it reveals the
            central problem with the question of the Earth’s age. He variously entertains the idea
            that the Earth is a child or an adult; a lady, “a healthy growing girl,” or “a fine
            noble young woman”; or even “in the category of decaying, nay, of decayed women” (9-10).
            But, however the Earth is figured, she is also a mother to man and a sister to the other
            planets in the solar system, and these intersecting identifications “explode” Kant’s
            problem. The Earth’s geological transformations suggest that she is, perhaps, “both
            young and old”: <quote>Young? If she is not young at present, perhaps she
                <emph>will</emph> be so in the future. Old? If she is not old at this moment,
              perhaps she <emph>has</emph> been old, and has a fair chance of becoming so again. In
              fact, she is a Phoenix that is known to have secret processes for rebuilding herself
              out of her own ashes. Little doubt there is but she has seen many a birth-day, many a
              funeral night, and many a morning of resurrection. For listen:—Where now the mightiest
              of oceans rolls in pacific beauty, once were anchored continents and boundless
              forests. (10)</quote> The ages of the Earth are “known to us geologically as facts”
            but remain “obscure as durations.” The problem of the Earth’s age emerges out of the
            collision of human and geological time; planetary revolutions, like political
            revolutions, are cycles of “ruin and restoration” (11). But cyclical time offers no
            fixed point of reference, and the two variables De Quincey identifies remain puzzlingly
            independent.</p>
                  <p>In an effort to establish a stable frame of reference—to find a “stationary meaning”—De
            Quincey turns to “the analogy of our whole planetary system” (which, he claims, Kant has
            “overlooked”) (13). He reasons that, as siblings, any difference in age between the
            planets should be negligible and asks how old “we take our brother and sister planets to
            be? For <emph>this</emph> determination as to a point in <emph>their</emph> constitution
            will do something to illustrate our own” (12). For example, if Jupiter is, as Kant
            seemed to believe, a young planet—as De Quincey puts it, “the younger brother of our
            mamma”—how can the Earth be “an old decayed lady” (13)? Moreover, if the Earth were old,
            surely we, her children, would be old as well—a claim De Quincey refutes, citing “a
            thousand indications of strength and budding youth” in the nineteenth century, including
            the promise of “Lord Rosse’s almost awful telescope” (14). While it might seem that De
            Quincey confuses planetary time and human time (men are young, so the Earth can’t be
            old), his real point has to do with their coordination. That the Earth is at once our
            mother and Jupiter’s sister reminds us that it is a part of two systems, one terrestrial
            and one celestial. Asking questions about the Earth’s age invokes the system to which it
            belongs, and inquiring about the solar system in turn entails consideration of the
            systems of which it forms merely a small part. The resolving power of the new telescope
            not only reveals worlds beyond worlds; it discovers systems beyond, and within, systems. </p>
                  <p>Lord Rosse’s telescope brings the paradoxes of system into focus. The problem with
            larger and larger telescopes, De Quincey observes, is that more power does not mean
            greater resolution: “Concurrently with all increase in the space-penetrating power,
            there arises an increasing confusion in the images reflected. As the power of this
            instrument advances in one direction, correspondingly it recedes in another” (14-15).
            Initially, it seems that Lord Rosse’s telescope has overcome this obstacle: <quote>Most
              truly we may say that he has revealed more by far than he found. The theatre to which
              he has introduced us is <emph>immeasurably</emph> beyond the old one which he found.
              To say that he found, in the visible universe, a little wooden theatre of Thespis, a
                <foreign>tréteau</foreign> or shed of vagrants, and that he presented us, at a price
              of incalculable anxiety, with a Roman colosseum—<emph>that</emph> is to say little.
              Columbus, when he introduced the Old World to the New, did in fact only introduce the
              majority to the minority; but Lord Rosse has introduced the minority to the majority.
              (15)</quote> In making Lord Rosse a greater explorer than Columbus, this passage
            ostensibly celebrates his accomplishment. But even as he praises Rosse’s discovery, De
            Quincey acknowledges that it comes “at a price.” The sheer scale of the universe made
            visible by the new telescope breeds an “incalculable anxiety”—a mirror image of the
            universe’s newly-discovered immeasurability. The transposition of Old World and New,
            majority and minority, highlights De Quincey’s concern with relative values. What is at
            stake is not size but scale, and the revaluation of these relationships carries with it
            the menacing possibility that this new universe might prove to be as hostile to man as
            the Age of Discovery was to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. What Lord Rosse has
            found is positive knowledge; what he has revealed, by comparison, is limitless. And this
            immeasurability marks the limits of our knowledge. The idea of the universe, like the
            idea of publication, is “a practicable object not reconcilable with the limitation of
            human power” (“Travelling” 232).</p>
                  <p> The universe revealed by the new telescope puts us in touch with the sublime, De
            Quincey suggests, less because it expands the scope of our knowledge than because it
            externalizes the power that lies within the human mind. “In reality,” he writes, “the
            depths and the heights which are in man, the depths by which he searches, the heights by
            which he aspires, are but projected and made objective externally in the three
            dimensions of space which are outside him.” The astronomer’s objective discoveries are
            merely the shadows of subjective power; they are “the mirror to a mightier abyss that
            will one day be expanded in himself” (“System” 15). De Quincey’s stunning description of
            the nebula of Orion imagines this sublime abyss as “a head thrown back, and raising its
            face (or eyes, if eyes it had) in the very anguish of hatred to some unknown heavens”
            (19). The image of the nebula expresses “brutalities unspeakable” and “a convolute of
            cruelty and revenge” (19, 20). In linking this allegorical visage to Milton’s allegory
            of sin and death, De Quincey makes the stars continuous with literature and religion in
            their ability to provoke pity and fear. In resolving them into a superhuman shape, he
            retains human form as his point of reference—a practice that connects him to the first
            watchers of the skies, who saw stars and created constellations. </p>
                  <p> David Masson comments on the “weird and fantastic effect” of this passage (“System”
            18, note 1). Part of its strangeness, surely, is that Rosse’s telescope actually
            contributes very little to the effect.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In fact, as
              numerous scholars have noted, the image of the nebula De Quincey describes, which
              appeared in Nichol’s book, is John Hershel’s rather than Rosse’s. See, for example,
              Smith.</note> Before Rosse, De Quincey claims, the nebula was famous for its
            resistance to “the most potent of telescopes” (17). After Rosse, it is now famous for
            its “submission … to the all-conquering telescope” (18). Whether the nebula resists or
            submits is, in a sense, irrelevant, because its significance has to do with its status
            as a mirror to the observer’s mind. In a note to the revised version of the essay
            published in 1854, De Quincey answers those who criticized his depiction of the nebula
            by insisting on the essentially subjective nature of description: “All such appearances,
            whether seen in fire, or in the clouds, or in the arbitrary combinations of the stars,
            are read differently by different people.” These differences sometimes result from
            different conditions—the appearance of the nebula is affected by its motion and the
            motion of the Earth; it changes when the power of the telescope is adjusted—but De
            Quincey insists that “even where the grouping is exactly the same, being so rigorously
            limited as to exclude all action of caprice, the result may yet be very different” (19,
            note 2). Like Wordsworth’s descriptions of the appearance of clouds or storms, the
            purpose of De Quincey’s description is not accurate representation. Instead, the nebula
            is the vehicle for the realization of an image of his subjective reflection.</p>
                  <p> If it seems that De Quincey gives away too much in asserting the fundamentally
            subjective nature of perception, it would be a mistake to allow his weak relativism to
            obscure his strong commitment to the significance of depths and heights. Spatial
            references are of course crucial to the discourse of the sublime but not merely because
            they reflect its character as Longinus or Burke described it. They also highlight the
            situation and orientation of the perceiver. It’s crucial, for De Quincey, that Lord
            Rosse and Wordsworth both look upward. In a long, seemingly bizarre footnote, he remarks
            that, “if on a public road you meet a party of four women, it is at least fifty to one
            that they are all laughing; whereas if you meet a party of [men], you may wager safely
            that they are talking gravely, and that one of them is uttering the word
              <emph>money</emph>.” He concludes that, <quote>because our sisters are too much
              occupied with the playful things of this earth, and our brothers with its gravities …
              neither party sufficiently watches the skies. And <emph>that</emph> accounts for a
              fact which often has struck myself—viz. that, in cities, on bright moonless nights,
              when some brilliant skirmishings of the Aurora are exhibiting, or even a luminous
              arch, which is a broad riband of snowy light that spans the skies, positively, unless
              I myself say to people “Eyes upwards!” not one in a hundred, male or female, but fails
              to see the show, though it may be seen <foreign>gratis</foreign>, simply because their
              eyes are too uniformly reading the earth. (32)</quote> In one sense, the point of this
            passage is that worldly preoccupations—women’s with trivialities, men’s with
              “<emph>money</emph>”—prevent us from looking outside ourselves and beyond our world.
            Lord Rosse and Wordsworth, their gazes turned upward, stand opposed to this general
            “downward direction of the eyes” (32). </p>
                  <p>In another sense, however, De Quincey’s claim marks an interest in what Kant called
            “orientation in thinking.” Anna Henchman has recently drawn attention to this
            connection, tracing the influence of Kant’s 1786 essay and his <title level="m">Theory
              of the Heavens</title> (1755) on “System of the Heavens.” For De Quincey, Henchman
            argues, “astronomical observation has disrupted the categories of subjectivity and
            objectivity by revealing that there is no fixed point in the entire universe,” and, in
            describing the “ebb and flow” of De Quincey’s estimation of Kant, she traces a
            trajectory that reproduces his shifting assessments of political economy: at first
            enthusiastic about <title level="m">The Critique of Pure Reason</title>, De Quincey
            becomes disturbed by its “emphasis on the subjective nature of external reality”;
            finally, prompted by Coleridge, he returns to Kant’s critical philosophy—in particular
            the “idea that orientation and direction are necessary parts of thinking” (Henchman 68,
            69). Henchman’s reading of De Quincey’s essay shows how its “rapid shifts in point of
            view, scale and even genre” reflect his understanding of the “universe in flux” revealed
            by Lord Rosse’s telescope, an uncertainty he worked to assuage by turning to Kant’s
            radical recasting of the relationship between subjective and objective observation
            (Henchman 72). What is perhaps most striking about her account, however, is the
            underlying sense that Kantian orientation in fact intensifies the instabilities that De
            Quincey sought to alleviate. </p>
                  <p>In “What is Orientation in Thinking?” Kant emphasizes the importance of correlating
            external objects (like “the sun in the sky”) with the “feeling” of an internal
            difference in the subject (between, for example, one’s left and right hands) (238). In
            essence, he grounds our experience of the objective world in this subjective sense of
            direction. Without this “<emph>subjective</emph> distinction,” Kant claims, “objective
            data” alone would be insufficient: <quote>… if all the constellations, while in other
              respects retaining the same shape and the same position in relation to each other,
              were one day miraculously transposed so that their former easterly direction now
              became west, no human eye would notice the slightest change on the next clear night,
              and even the astronomer, if he heeded only what he saw and not at the same time what
              he felt, would inevitably become <emph>disorientated</emph>. But in fact, the ability
              to make distinctions by means of the feeling of right and left comes quite naturally
              to his aid—an ability which, though implanted by nature, has become a habit as a
              result of frequent practice; and if he simply directs his eyes to the Pole Star, he
              will not only notice the change which has occurred, but will still be able to
                <emph>orientate</emph> himself. (239)</quote> Kant “extend[s] this geographical
            process of the concept of orientation to signify any kind of orientation within a given
            space” by offering a thought experiment: “in the darkness, I can orientate myself in a
            familiar room so long as I can touch any one object whose position I remember.” Were the
            positions of objects in that room shifted, however, “for a joke,” “in such a way that
            their relative positions remained the same but what was previously on the right was now
            on the left, I would be quite unable to find my way about” (239).</p>
                  <p>In “System of the Heavens,” De Quincey argues that we inhabit a universe in which the
            transpositions Kant imagines are perpetual. The motions of the Earth, the other planets,
            the stars, and the systems to which they belong leave us always in the dark, depriving
            us of a stable frame of reference. For left and right, De Quincey substitutes up and
            down, depth and height, space and time. In his reading of the nebula of Orion, for
            example, he asks the reader to turn Nichol’s picture upside down, “for it happens that
            in the professor’s book it is placed upside down as regards the natural position of the
            human head” (19). This shift in orientation mocks Kant’s careful reasoning—a fact De
            Quincey playfully acknowledges when he says that “were it not treasonable to insinuate
            the possibility of an error against so great a swell as Immanuel Kant, one would be
            inclined to fancy that Mr. Kant had really been dozing a little on this occasion” (11).
            But his point throughout “System of the Heavens” is to demonstrate the disorienting
            effects of the realization that the universe affords no fixed spot in relation to which
            we might orient ourselves. In a universe in flux, human heads, unlike Kant’s hands, can
            have no “natural position.”</p>
                  <p> “Great is the mystery of Space,” De Quincey writes, “greater is the mystery of Time”
            (15). Nebular astronomy after William Herschel demonstrates the continuity between these
            propositions and thus illustrates the full scope of the telescope’s power to perplex. At
            the end of the eighteenth century, Herschel’s improved telescopes, which brought nebulae
            like Orion closer, seemed to promise that these “milky spots” would eventually all be
            resolved into “starry worlds” (21). (This is, in fact, what Lord Rosse
            claimed—mistakenly it turned out—to have discerned in the nebula of Orion.) The relative
            distinctness or diffusion of these spots, it was assumed, was a function of their
            distance from the observer. “But,” De Quincey observes, “<emph>that</emph> did not
            follow: for, in the treasury of nature, it turned out that there were other resources
            for modifying the powers of distance, for muffling and unmuffling the voice of stars.” A
            world “at the distance <emph>x</emph>,” pushed back to “a double distance,” should
            become less distinct. Instead, “by compression, by deeper centralization,” it becomes
            brighter. Push it back again, and it grows faint; but repeat the operation, moving the
            starry bodies to four times their original distance, and “once again it shall shake off
            the oppression of distance” and grow brighter (22). And this, De Quincey argues, is
            merely one of several “cases of perplexity” in sidereal astronomy. The astronomer finds
            that size and distance collide (“is the size less or the distance greater?”), the
            motions of the universe and of the earth within it are “doubtfully confounded,” and the
            relative positions of two distant stars are impossible to determine (is proximity real,
            “or simply an apparent proximity from lying in the same visual line, though in far other
            depths of space?”) (24). In revealing the vastness of space and exponentially expanding
            its sublime distances, the telescope confounds the observer’s ability to find anything
            in it—or, more precisely, to speak with any degree of certainty about what he has
            found.</p>
                  <p> Lord Rosse has not just “created immeasurable worlds”; he has discovered innumerable
            occasions for confusion (23). In sidereal astronomy, distance, magnitude, and motion are
            not positive values, but relationships and thus sources of equivocation. The double
            stars that, along with the nebular hypothesis, claimed the attention of astronomers from
            Kant and Herschel to Rosse and Nichol, are “equivocal phenomena—phenomena that are
            reconcilable indifferently with either of two assumptions” (26). De Quincey argues that
            depth, height, and the vast distances of space are not cognizable by infants, animals,
            or brutes: “Man only has a natural function for expanding, on an illimitable sensorium,
            the illimitable growths of space…. To man is as much reserved the prerogative of
            perceiving space in its higher extensions as of geometrically constructing the relations
            of space. And the brute is no more capable of apprehending abysses through the eye than
            he can build upwards or analyze downwards the aerial synthesis of Geometry” (16).
            “System of the Heavens” is an attempt to make sense of the expanded, and expanding,
            universe revealed by the telescope through such “aerial synthesis.” The attempt fails,
            but its failure is precisely De Quincey’s point. Like Memnon’s head, which De Quincey
            encountered soon after it arrived at the British Museum in 1821, space “baffles and
            confounds all faculty of computation” (17).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a
              reading of the relationship between Memnon’s head and “System of the Heavens,” see
              Barrell 104-25.</note> Attempts to calculate interstellar distances yield results
            which mystify rather than enlighten: traveling at a speed three times that of the earth
            in orbit, it would take forty-one thousand years to reach a star in the constellation
            Cygnus; at the same rate, reaching “that distance to which Lord Rosse’s six-feet mirror
            has so recently extended our <emph>vision</emph>” would take two hundred and fifty
            million years. The problem is not the difficulty of the computation (calculating the
            ratio of these distances “is a simple rule-of-three problem for a child”), but that the
            result is measured in terms of human time (in <emph>years</emph>) and yet defies human
            comprehension (26). Lord Rosse’s telescope has transformed men into brutes. Faced with
            the overwhelming scale of the universe, man joins the “deer, or hares, or foxes, and the
            pack of hounds in pursuit, chaser and chased, all going headlong over a precipice
            together” (16). </p>
                  <p> De Quincey’s word-painting of the Orion nebula does not resolve this failure; it
            cannot. Instead, it takes the failure of human comprehension and, out of it, creates an
            experience of the sublime. This is the point of the essay and the point of looking up
            into the sky. The mysteries De Quincey addresses are worth his attention precisely
            because they defy his understanding and, in their defiance and cold contempt (reflected
            in “the detestable phantom” of the Orion nebula), inspire him to hold “up a mirror of
            description to appearances so grand, and in a dim sense often so symbolic” (19, note 2).
            Near the end of the essay, De Quincey imagines “a man in the last century, and an
            eminent man too” who rejected the sublimity of astronomy: “on the contrary, he regarded
            the solar system as decidedly vulgar; because the planets were so infernally punctual …
            that they forced him … to think of post-office clocks, mail-coaches, and book-keepers.
            Regularity may be beautiful, but it excludes the sublime” (29).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Henchman points out that this eighteenth-century man is likely De
              Quincey’s invention, noting, among other reasons, that “the post-office clocks he
              supposedly referred to were a nineteenth-century innovation” (245, note 15).</note>
            This complaint, he argues, was the result of living “in the days of mere planetary
            astronomy.” It is answered, and more than answered, by the discoveries that have
            transformed “our own little system” into “a subordinate province.” “We ought no longer
            to talk of astronomy, but of <emph>the astronomies</emph>” (30). With the multiplication
            of astronomical systems (De Quincey enumerates “1, the planetary, 2, the cometary, 3,
            the sidereal; … 4, the nebular”), the sublimity of the heavens is restored or revealed
            anew; systems of such amazing size and complexity necessarily produce “variety,”
            “irregularity,” and “anomalies” sufficient to sustain our sense of the sublime (30-31).
            “And,” he concludes, “for all purposes of frightening us, anomalies in systems so vast
            are as good as a ghost” (31).</p>
                  <p>Clifford Siskin has argued that the “specific mode of producing knowledge in
            writing—systems within SYSTEM—was the Enlightenment, not Enlightenment as the condition
            of modernity …, but the … temporally and geographically localized Enlightenment that did
            not make it out of the eighteenth century” (206). From this standpoint, De Quincey’s
            systematizing is a late example of how systems “tended to sink under their own weight”
            (206). We might understand De Quincey’s systems—economic and astronomical, but also the
            mail-service system as it is depicted in “The English Mail-Coach” or the mind and
            personal identity as they are constituted by memory in the <title level="m">Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title>—along these
            same lines and interpret his inability to make them make sense as failures. For De
            Quincey, though, the failures that undo systems are themselves productive—of sublimity
            and, in keeping with Kant’s larger point about the sublime, of thought. Systems are
            fictions, but they are necessary—or at least unavoidable. And they necessarily fail. If
            their creation reflects a conviction that the mind, world, and universe are governed by
            reason, their failure is a testament to the persistent desire to make sense of the
            mysteries and accidents we encounter, especially those that defy our comprehension. </p>

               <p>This essay examines two interrelated strategies Shelley uses to conceive

               <div type="section">
                  <p>Like many of his fellow Romantics, Shelley aimed to change the system. To call his
            target “the system” might sound a bit anachronistic, but Clifford Siskin sets the origin
            of this usage—of system as the totality of things as they are—in the Romantic period
            (“Novels” 202). For Shelley, the “system” includes the kind of combined economic and
            political institutions that limit human possibility, whether in medieval Venice in
              <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, in the Ottoman Empire in <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, or at home in Britain in “The Mask of Anarchy.” But the insidious
            danger of a system is that it extends from these social and political institutions to
            form the worldviews and expectations of a population. Successful revolution therefore
            requires a change in the public mind alongside changes in political structure. Shelley
            hoped to exert agency within such a totality, and in <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title> he asks how an individual can exert any change in a system and an
            associated way of thinking that are all encompassing. In <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, I argue, Shelley imagines that the best chance for change comes from
            creating “pauses” in the system. Pauses allow for some limited freedom for agency and
            change without falling prey to the self-defeating illusion that individuals control the
            direction and pace of social change. At moments when the system pauses, Shelley awaits a
            future audience to read and carry forward his ideas. And once he has conceived change in
            this way, his own poetry becomes a tool that—in its formal techniques and
            interventions—is capable of inciting a slow, gradual process of change. </p>
                  <p>In this paper, I examine two interrelated strategies Shelley uses to conceive of the
            systemic context for individual agency. In both cases, Shelley portrays agency as moving
            or acting upon air. First, drawing on new scientific accounts, Shelley examines the
            weather as a global system that is subject to local variability. Comparing the movement
            of weather to the movement of ideas, Shelley postulates that systemic change occurs when
            air from a “free” region—represented in the poem by the ocean—moves into and temporarily
            disrupts air that has been tainted by despotic social and political structures. </p>
                  <p>In this analogy, weather provides a model for the action of poetry because air is the
            medium through which the poet acts on readers by literally changing their breath. And
            the second way Shelley explores the possibility of systemic change is through adopting
            and altering poetic form to move readers’ breath. Poetic form proves such an important
            resource for Shelley not only because it shapes readers’ breathing to its metrical
            patterns but because it carries forms from the past—forms that have outlasted their
            original historical moment—into the future. As Andrew Franta argues, for Shelley “poetry
            is a process defined as much by its transmission from one generation to the next as the
            immediate circumstances that govern its production and reception,” and “this long-term
            view of the process of writing . . . claims for poetic form itself the privilege of a
            future perspective on the present” (113). For Shelley, particular poetic forms provide
            one resource for stepping outside of one’s own era, into both the past that originated
            forms and the future that will continue to adapt them. Literature is not a system of its
            own nor part of “the system” because it adopts forms and genres that outlast the
            historical systems that produced them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miranda Burgess
              and Robert Kaufman both suggest that Romantic-era literature critiques the dominant
              political-economic system. Kaufman revises Luhmann’s model of system to suggest that
              literature served a functionally differentiated system of its own (18); Burgess argues
              that Romantic writers resisted defining literature as systematic (10-14). Shelley, I’m
              arguing, defines system through the more totalizing definition of system that Siskin
              traces to the Romantic era and sees literary form as providing a position from which
              to stand outside of the system. On Shelley’s vision of the temporality of change, see
              Mitchell 163-203.</note> And when they are utilized in a new literary and historical
            context, literary forms provide a way of creating the gaps and pauses that Shelley
            thinks provide the opportunity for systemic change. The temporal distance of poetic
            form, then, means that form allows the poet a position from which to step outside the
            “system,” defined as the totality of society itself. Working within the constraints of
            the Spenserian stanza and taking advantage of the possibilities for pauses and caesuras
            it provides, Shelley makes air itself signify in what he imagines is a politically
            effective way, namely as opening literal sound gaps in an oppressive political order. As
            Shelley sees it, the Spenserian stanza’s pauses provide a structure for change even if
            the (conservative) politics of Spenser’s own <title level="m">Faerie Queene</title> did
            not recognize this potential. And in exploring Shelley’s interwoven ways of imagining
            air—one working within the global weather system, the other using a temporally distanced
            form to leverage pauses in the system—I track how Shelley envisions his own poetic forms
            as a source of potential future change. </p>

                  <head>Revolutionary Pauses</head>
                  <p>In an 1817 letter, Shelley suggests that he writes <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title> to portray “the <foreign>beau ideal</foreign> as it were of the French
            Revolution” through the story of a Greek revolt against the Ottoman Turks. As multiple
            commentators have noted, the “revolution” in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> is
            not “ideal” in the sense of successful.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See especially
              Cian Duffy, who notes that Shelley’s concept of “beau ideal” resembles his idea of
              “intellectual beauty” (171). </note> The revolt fails when surrounding nations’ armies
            come to the despot’s aid, slaughtering the remaining rebels and ushering in famine and
            plagues that decimate the population; the hero and heroine are murdered at the stake.
            The poem presents an ideal revolution, then, in the sense that it demonstrates how
            revolutions arise and why they fail, and defends even failed revolutions as necessary
            steps in human progress. In the case of the French Revolution and the Greek revolt in
              <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, the system of despotism is too strong for
            any individual revolt to succeed for long. </p>
                  <p>But Shelley suggests that revolutions inevitably fail not only because despots lend
            each other armies but because individuals who grow up surrounded by tyranny do not know
            how to embrace freedom. When revolutionaries acquire power, then, they only know how to
            use it despotically. In the preface to <title level="m">Laon and Cythna, </title>
            Shelley argues that the people’s very difficulty in acquiring genuine freedom
            demonstrates why tyranny is so pernicious: “if the revolution had been in every respect
            prosperous, then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our
            abhorrence” (101). The French Revolution failed not because its goals were incorrect but
            because it attempted large-scale social change too quickly. In <title level="m">A
              Philosophical View of Reform</title> and elsewhere, Shelley therefore argues for
            gradual change, which he says will allow people to learn the responsibilities of
            freedom. </p>
                  <p>Shelley casts his “ideal French Revolution” as a Spenserian romance, and also moves the
            rebellion from France to Greece. The romance genre offers Shelley a way of conceiving
            individuals acting for broader social classes and nations. Shelley reinterprets the
            genre to ask how any individual can effect change within a system whose coherence and
            all pervasiveness is an essential part of its power. But the Spenserian romance and the
            Spenserian stanza also themselves offer a case study for Shelley in gradual change, and
            in working within (but extending) both literary tradition and the “forms” of the day.
            Shelley’s subtitle for <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, “A Vision of the
            Nineteenth Century in the Stanza of Spenser,” emphasizes both the potential disjunction
            between Spenser’s day and the “nineteenth century” and the potential of genres to find
            new meaning in a new time. After Byron used the stanza form in his bestselling <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, the Spenserian stanza indeed became to some degree a
            “form” of Shelley’s day. Nevertheless, as Greg Kucich has argued, Shelley’s decision to
            adopt Spenser’s stanza form is somewhat surprising, given his opposition to Spenser’s
            religious and monarchical politics. And Shelley takes more than just a stanza form from
            Spenser. The plot of Shelley’s poem correlates with Book One of the <title level="m">Faerie Queen</title>, albeit revising several monarchical elements of Spenser’s plot
            into a more republican light (Kucich 272).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On
              Shelley’s revisions to Spenserian romance, see also Duff and Hubbell. </note> In
            choosing a Spenserian stanza form even as he distances himself from Spenser’s politics,
            Shelley suggests that change accrues through making small adjustments in the existing
            poetic tradition. Spenser’s stanzas will in Shelley’s hands invoke the kind of change
            that their most famous practitioner neither sought nor foresaw. And the anachronistic
            endurance of Spenser’s forms from the past remind us of the potential power of Shelley’s
            forms to stir change in ways he could not foresee. Form, precisely because no poet is
            the author of forms, allows a poem to stand in the past, present, and even future
            simultaneously. </p>
                  <p>When Shelley explains why he decided to write <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>
            in Spenserian stanzas, however, he sets aside his interests in systemic political change
            and attributes his decision solely to aesthetics. First, he suggests, he found the
            Spenserian stanza form more forgiving than other forms: in Milton’s blank verse there is
            “no shelter for mediocrity.” And second, he suggests, “I was enticed also by the
            brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical
            thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure”
            (104). Shelley aestheticizes political concerns throughout <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>. But I will argue that Shelley uses the pause for a political as well
            as aesthetic purpose and that the pause encapsulates the poem’s strategy for intervening
            in the political and social systems it indicts. </p>
                  <p>The pause illustrates one way in which a formal intervention creates the opportunity
            for systemic change without tyrannically determining the direction of that change. As
            many readers have noted, Shelley calls poets the “legislators of the world” and argues
            that they will stir the dead leaves, implant the seeds, and light the sparks of future
            change (to cite metaphors used in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> and more
            famously in the “Defence of Poetry” and “Ode to the West Wind”) but yet insists that
            poets cannot know the form this change will take; poets cannot see how the future will
            use or transform their ideas. Shelley portrays this kind of indirect agency in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> when Cythna and the Hermit, each inspired by Laon’s
            words and actions, spread his ideas and incite revolt. Cythna in particular applies
            Laon’s ideas to a new and particular goal, arguing that women and slaves should rebel
            against domestic tyranny. Because Shelley emphasizes that future readers will shape his
            ideas, in the preface to <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> he claims that he does
            not write didactic poetry, but rather hopes “to awaken the feelings, so that the reader
            should see the beauty of true virtue, and be incited to those inquiries which have led
            to my moral and political creed, and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the
            world” (100).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Critics have debated whether Shelley’s
              vision turns didactic despite his stated goals. Ulmer calls the poem didactic (56).
              White suggests that Shelley was aware that a poem showing scenes of pedagogy risks
              didacticism and in Canto 1 “appears devoted to aestheticizing these pedagogical
              scenes, replacing language with what the poet-narrator calls ‘melody’ (289) and
              didacticism with imaginative communion,” as he seeks “truth without reference” (133,
              134). </note> And as Deborah Elise White has argued, because Shelley wants to locate
            meaning in the future but cannot see the future, he resists language’s referentiality
            (103). Speaking through pauses, poetic form provides a way in which poetry can
            communicate non-semantically, non-representationally, and without specifying a
            determinate vision. Moreover, in Shelley’s use, the pause thematizes the moments in
            which speech or action awaits interpretation, in which listeners will either adopt or
            revise or reject the poet’s ideas. In <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, I’ll
            argue, Shelley uses the pause to model how one agent may transmit a revolutionary idea
            in a system pervasively inimical to such a view, and how form provides the resources for
            such systemic change. </p>

                  <head>Moving the air</head>
                  <p> Throughout <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, Shelley compares the thoughts and
            movements of characters to weather phenomena. In Canto II, which describes how Laon
            first develops an awareness of the possibilities of freedom even while living amongst
            Ottoman tyranny, Shelley is particularly aware of air currents. Laon is able to grasp an
            idea of human possibility even within tyranny for two reasons. First, the Greek ruins
            “speak” to him, providing visual evidence that there was in the past, and might someday
            be again, a different political and social order, that “such man has been, and such may
            yet become!” (766). And second, he literally grows up in different air: on the coast, at
            the edge of land and sea, he watches “o’er the still sea and jagged islets. . . the
            light of moonrise” and “the clouds near the horizon driven” (750-1, 752). Because long
            oppression has turned his fellows “evil,” he is the only one who “wandered forth / to
            see or feel” nature (699, 708-9). But it is the sea air and the ancient towers that
            provide Laon both a way of reaching out of the current tyrannical atmosphere and a
            content to transmit. </p>
                  <p>I’m interested in Shelley’s discussion of oceans, air currents, and weather more
            generally because Shelley uses descriptions of weather to consider what it means to live
            as part of a system and how it might be possible to see outside of the social and
            political system that shapes an individual. As Mary Favret has compellingly argued, the
            Romantic period saw a change in the scientific understanding of weather; the classical
            idea of weather as deriving from the peculiar geographical or topographical features of
            a specific place became less important than a model in which weather was a global
            system, in which air and moisture moved from place to place so that one place’s weather
            would become another’s.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a complete discussion of
              the changing scientific understanding of weather, see also Janković 126-30.</note> For
            Favret, weather then calls attention to mediation. In <title level="m">Laon and
              Cythna</title>, Shelley sees the weather as part of a global system and describes the
            motion of people and ideas through cloud metaphors. He compares the gathering rebels to
            “clouds inwoven in the silent sky / By winds from distant regions meting there”
            (3568-9). And when the foreign-born armies begin their killing rampage, Shelley
            describes them too as clouds: “The infantry, file after file, did pour / Their clouds on
            the utmost hills” (3888-9). In both cases, the cloud metaphors emphasize that the people
            move as a part of a transnational political system. And while clouds can transmit either
            tainted or “free” air, Shelley envisions Laon, like the clouds, moving clean ocean air
            to inland regions and “human thought” from its source to the listening masses. Laon
            comes closest to describing himself as a cloud when he leaves the Hermit and travels to
            the rebellion-in-progress. Although he does not here adopt meteorological language, his
            motion is cloud-like: “O’er many a mountain-chain which rears / Its hundred crests
            aloft, my spirit bears / My frame, o’er many a dale and many a moor (1696-8). He
            continues moving like a cloud in the next stanza: “My powers revived within me, and I
            went / As one whom winds waft o’er the bending grass, / Through many a vale of that
            broad continent” (1702-4). In describing both individuals and armies as clouds, Shelley
            suggests that they can transmit new air to a locality, but he also underlines the
            difficulty of escaping the kind of global system in which despots support each others’
            regimes. </p>
                  <p>The ocean has a particular status in Shelley’s interlocking models of meteorological
            and sociopolitical systems because it is part of the global weather system but somewhat
            independent of the socio-political system. Although certainly subject to claims of
            sovereignty and national dominance (Britannia, after all, aimed to “rule the waves”),
            the ocean is less governable than land. But Shelley solves this problem in
            correspondence between these two levels of systems by depicting the ocean as a source of
            both clouds and of the free thought or philosophical truth that cannot be perverted by
            politics. Shelley was highly observant of the clouds. Marilyn Gaull suggests that
            Shelley’s 1820 poem “The Cloud” likely relies on Luke Howard’s widely read 1803 <title level="m">Essay on Clouds, </title>which describes the transformation of clouds and
            defines the nomenclatures of cloud types still in use today (591). In “The Cloud,”
            Shelley describes the cloud’s motions as it forms from evaporated water, moves across
            spaces, and raises storms or dissipates: it “bring[s] fresh showers for the thirsting
            flowers, / From the seas and the streams” (1-2). He also emphasizes the importance of
            the ocean within this life cycle, as the vast repository for and ultimate destination of
            the water that forms clouds. Shelley depicts the ocean as the “geni” or “Spirit” that
            inspires the clouds’ motion: lightning is the “pilot” of the cloud, but the pilot is <quote>

                     </quote> The “Spirit” of the ocean is a source for clouds in the same way that
            the “intellectual beauty” or the “source of human thought” to which Shelley refers in
            “Mont Blanc” feeds thought. But if the 1820 poem defines the ocean as the ultimate
            origin for clouds, Shelley also describes water evaporating from previous downpours. A
            local climate can transform the character of the water. But the global system that
            carries water from the ocean determines that ultimately water will return to its source,
            and the oceans themselves—subject to no single tyrant—remain the pure source.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the relationship of political system to environment in
              Shelley, see also Alan Bewell, who argues that for Shelley, “diseased environments are
              not the cause of social and political disorder but are their result” (217).</note>
            Even when the lightning “dreams,” and regardless of where the cloud goes, it retains a
            knowledge of its ocean origin.</p>
                  <p> If the ocean is the “spirit,” or the “source of human thought,” it is also the source
            of Laon’s positive vision for humanity. Whether because it is the “origin” of moist air,
            or because oceans are less governable than land, ocean air communicates freedom. Even if
            tyranny fogs all land, the sea retains its own air. Shelley depicts Laon and Cythna
            taking in sea air and carrying it or breathing it back out. As we’ve seen, in Canto 2
            the sea air helps teach Laon to envision a more free humanity. In Canto 6 when Laon and
            Cythna retreat from the rebels’ losing battle to a Greek ruin on a rocky outcropping
            overlooking the ocean, they hear the “motion of water” when the steed carrying them
            “pause[s].” Shelley suggests that even if they soon lose awareness of their environment
            and “only heard, or saw, or felt the other,” their love for one another proves that they
            have absorbed “thoughts” from the “utmost Ocean / Of universal life” (2544, 2594-5). </p>
                  <p> As Cythna later sits by herself overlooking the ocean, Shelley describes her
            internalizing the sea air to create her own “atmosphere”: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> When Cythna “absorb[s] the glories of the burning skies,” she radiates
            in turn a “tremulous” atmosphere that sheds light on her. In the first two lines,
            Shelley describes her “measured breath” as if she is absorbing and then radiating poetry
            in order to create her new atmosphere. And Shelley puns on poetry’s ability to form
            reader’s breath when he inserts a double dash after the pause, “the measured breath /
            Was now heard there;--,” the “there” pointing to the space where the reader (like
            Cythna) breathes. Cythna and poetry alter the atmosphere by breathing out the ocean air,
            which is pure and free air, taken straight from the imaginative source. </p>
                  <p> When describing the air on land, Shelley’s cloud metaphors often depict clouded
            thought, the pernicious ideas rooted in a system of tyranny, that prevent individuals
            from understanding or seizing the possibilities for human freedom: Shelley, for example,
            refers to “the cloud of that unutterable curse / Which clings upon mankind (932-3).
            Calling these misperceptions clouds suggests that they might dissipate: Cythna describes
            public opinion as “more frail / Than yon dim cloud now fading on the moon / Even while
            we gaze, though it awhile avail / To hide the orb of truth” (3271-5). But these clouds
            are dependent on the overall atmosphere, and so they “wither not” in a tyrannical
            climate (3455). Tyranny, Shelley suggests, literally creates a poisonous “atmosphere”:
            people cannot escape, either physically or mentally, the air that surrounds them. When
            Laon at the beginning of the poem attempts to educate his countrymen about their
            government’s tyranny, he at first succeeds: his thoughts like “vapours,” “invested with
            the light / of language” are “bright in the outspread morning’s radiancy,” and “all
            bosoms made reply” (805-8). However, Laon’s words are only “vapours” floating through
            the despotic atmosphere, and so as soon as the listeners breathe, they take in the old
            polluted air again. Laon recalls, “I could feel the listener’s senses swim / And hear
            his breath its own swift gaspings smother/ Even as my words evoked them” (813-15). When
            the air the listener breathes is tainted by despotism, breathing, the very act that
            keeps him alive, returns him to the structures that keep him in poverty and tyranny.
            Laon himself grew up in different air, in unpopulated regions, in nature and the liminal
            space of the seashore, and so received a different moral education. </p>
                  <p>But even Laon himself must be careful how he shares his ideas, or his visions will
            oppress another. In Canto II, as Laon speaks to his listeners, “all things became /
            Slaves to my holy and heroic verse” (933-4). And when Laon shares his vision with
            Cythna, the “sway” of his thoughts was “gathering like a cloud / The very wind on which
            it rolls away” (938-9). At this moment, he imagines himself controlling the transmission
            of his own thoughts by passing them to his sister. Laon must learn to speak powerfully,
            and create air in which individuals can breathe freedom, without imposing his own vision
            of that freedom. For Shelley, ultimately the poet’s power comes precisely from not
            controlling the terms of his own transmission. And if Shelley aspires to have his own
            poetry do the work of clouds, moving moist ocean air to dry locations, he finds in the
            Spenserian stanza a resource and tool. </p>

                  <head>Pausing with Spenser</head>
                  <p>The Spenserian stanza’s rhyme scheme—ababbcbcc, with the first eight lines in iambic
            pentameter and the ninth line (the second line of the concluding couplet) an
            Alexandrine—is appropriate for a poem thematizing gradual change: the “b” rhyme at the
            end of the first quatrain is extended into a couplet, providing an initial resting point
            for the poem, which after moving forward to “c” then returns to “b” before ending with a
            “c” couplet. And even the finality of this “c” couplet is rendered less definite by the
            two lines’ uneven rhymes (iambic pentameter in line eight followed by an Alexandrine in
            line nine). As we’ve seen, however, in accounting for his choice of form, Shelley
            credits not any political use but rather the aesthetic qualities of the stanza’s pauses.
            The Spenserian stanza enables several kinds of pauses. The stanza dictates one caesura,
            in the middle of the Alexandrine in line nine. Since most of Shelley’s stanzas are
            end-stopped, he inserts pauses between stanzas. In the rhyme, the repetition of the “b”
            rhyme in the fourth and fifth lines can also create a brief pause, through a sense of
            elongation. Shelley also uses relatively frequent enjambment to create pauses in the
            iambic lines and occasionally moves the caesura in the Alexandrine. While Shelley may
            certainly appreciate the aesthetic variety of pauses, he also employs these pauses to
            comment on the conditions of and possibility for systemic change. </p>
                  <p>For Shelley, a pause is not only a temporary stop, but a moment at which the poet
            awaits—and the outcome of his speech depends on—mediation. A “pause” stops action, but
            what happens next is determined by his listeners. When Shelley in the poem’s dedication
            to Mary suggests that “Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!” he means that
            truth—through his poetry, of course—temporarily speaks to humans. He depends on
            “mankind” to listen. When the hermit tells Laon about the revolution underway, he
            repeatedly describes the action as “paused”: the rebels have been victorious, but the
            Othman’s armies continue to resist. The hermit worries that without Laon’s intervention,
            the rebels, raised in a tyrannical political system, will themselves turn tyrants and
            seek revenge on the Othman’s soldiers. Laon must convince them to lay down their arms
            and escape from the system of violence. When Laon addresses the rebels, he describes the
            effect of his speech as pausing their passion: “Ah, ye are pale,—ye weep,—your passions
            pause,— / Tis well! ye feel the truth of love’s benignant laws” (1799-1800). Shelley
            follows Godwin in critiquing passion’s sway over reason and Holbach in suggesting that
            governments structure individuals’ passion.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Holbach
              argues that while passions are “necessary to the conservation of man”—and form through
              his “organization,” “habits,” and “education”—“government gives them play, conducts
              them towards to those objects, which it believes itself interested in making desirable
              to its subjects” (I, 105). </note> Freedom requires pausing this passion in order to
            substitute a law grounded in love for tyranny. Laon himself pauses (marked with double
            dashes) repeatedly in his speech. He stops their action but must rely on their own
            emotions to feel “love” rather than rage.</p>
                  <p>It’s ironic that Shelley describes the rebels “weeping” even as their passions pause.
            In reading this scene, Timothy Morton notes not only Shelley’s critique of passion but
            his appeal to a non-verbal sympathy. The rebels are moved in part because Laon, scraped
            by a spear, is bleeding: “Full communication between creatures does not need the
            symbolization of sympathy in words: sympathy can be felt on the pulses, it is written in
            the heart.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Morton 113; on passion see esp. 125-6 and
              137-8.</note> Shelley also distinguishes here between passion, which would impose one
            person’s vision on another, and emotion that responds to and registers a shared
            humanity. “Weeping” and “love” recognize the demands of others in a way that “passion”
            does not. Similarly, when Laon stops the rebels from executing the Tyrant, the pause he
            induces allows the rebels to witness and be moved by a different kind of emotion, the
            child’s love for her father: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> The murmur of the people, slowly dying</l>

                           <l>Sobs were then heard” (2026-8). </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Here, Laon’s speech readies the crowd for compassion, but it is the
            child’s love that stirs in the rebels “soft looks and speeches meet” (2034). In both of
            these instances the “pause” allows the crowd to connect emotionally with a scene taking
            place before it. Emotion then works in the manner Robert Mitchell describes, in which
            emotion is “understood as sights of intensity which enabled the emergence of something
            new” (20). The “pause” is effective first in stopping the systemic violence, but also in
            opening the space for individuals to recognize emotions of love and compassion that
            would offer a space from which to critique the system in which they have been formed.
            And in working through a “pause,” Laon has learned how to halt others’ passions without
            turning them into slaves of his own vision. </p>
                  <p>Shelley envisions the pause as a bodily response. Thomas H. Ford has recently argued
            that the Romantics viewed air as the medium of poetry, with meter shaping its movements;
            when read out loud, poetry acts on the reader’s vocal column, reshaping air and
            determining when the reader will breathe.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Ford argues
              that “the idea that what rhythm arranges and patterns is atmosphere, is formed bodies
              of air, provides the basis for the poetics of <title level="m">Lyrical
              Ballads</title>, and indeed for the poetic age which that volume heralds” (460). Such
              an idea is possible in part because the term “atmosphere” begins in the late
              eighteenth century to refers to emotional and conceptual rather than merely physical
              environments (458). </note> Shelley puns on his control over the reader’s breath in
            one Alexandrine from <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>: he notes that “Victorious
            Evil” seeks to make women slaves “till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of
            scorn” (981). Here the line describes the way a political system teaches characters how
            to breathe as well as determining the character of the “atmosphere” they take in;
            placing the caesura after the word “breathe” calls our attention to the way that poetry,
            and not only despotism, teaches patterns of breath. Shelley envisions his poetry’s
            stresses and pauses literally shaping readers’ breath. And although Shelley most
            frequently thematizes his action on readers’ bodies in describing breath, he also draws
            poetry’s common association between metrical iambs and the human heartbeat. As Kirstie
            Blair notes, the heartbeat modeled meter both in its regular rhythm and the way that
            rhythm can vary because of emotional charge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Catherine
              Robson suggests that the connection of iamb and heartbeat was felt more prominently in
              a culture that emphasized memorization and performance of poetry, when reciters knew
              that they must calm their heartbeat to “glide into the mesmeric state of the reciter
              of the successfully memorized, fully internalized poem, when body and words beat as
              one in measured familiarity” (112). While <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> was
              too long to be memorized, reading the poem aloud could create similar effect. </note>
            A pause, for Shelley, would also momentarily stop the heartbeat to change its rhythm. </p>
                  <p>The Spenserian stanza moves readers’ voices and breath between two different metrical
            patterns (pentameter and Alexandrine). More importantly, however, Shelley plays with the
            kind of change the pause invokes, and with the ability of meter to transform both
            readers’ bodies and literary form, by moving the typical pauses within the stanza, and
            most notably the caesura. While the vast majority of Shelley’s stanzas place the caesura
            in its standard spot, in the middle of the final Alexandrine line, he moves the pause to
            thematize the movement of social systems. When in Canto 5 Laon promises that the rebels
            will forgive the tyrant’s soldiers for murdering their compatriots, Shelley uses pauses
            to mark the change in spirit that forgiveness enables. Stanza X ends with a standard
            Alexandrine: “Ye stabbed as they did sleep—but they forgive ye now” (1809). Stanza XI
            moves the pause, and allows a reading of the line as trochaic before the pause, but
            iambic after: “Even as to thee have these done ill, and are forgiven!” (1818). When
            discussing the way soldiers act for despots, then, the line takes a rhythm that could
            seem irregular or, if we compare metrical beats to heartbeats, unnaturally distorted; it
            returns to iambs when the rebels show human sympathy and forgiveness. In both examples,
            the pause separates the soldier’s vindictive action from the forgiveness that
            demonstrates that the rebels have abandoned their tyrannical mindset and are ready to
            claim freedom. If Laon’s “pause” creates a systemic break, then, Shelley uses the
            metrical pause to evoke these breaks.</p>
                  <p>In the execution scene in Canto 11, Shelley repeatedly moves the caesura to show a
            systematic change in people’s thinking, as the crowd’s sympathies waver between
            allegiance to state and religion and allegiance to Laon and Cythna. In this scene, Laon,
            Cythna, and the priest repeatedly “pause” each others’ actions. When Laon (here
            disguised as “the Stranger”) stops a man from killing him, Shelley emphasizes the
            systemic potential of his action by adding a pause to the line: the assailant “Sate
            silently—his voice then did the Stranger rear” (4004). Later, Cythna’s arrival pauses
            the execution in progress: “All thought [she] was God’s Angel come to sweep / The
            lingering guilty to their fiery grave,” and the masses turn to pray to Laon, whom they
            were about to burn at the stake (4520, 4522-3). As Cythna temporarily moves the social
            order, Shelley moves the caesura one half foot forward: the masses “With crushing panic,
            fled in terror’s altered mood’ (4530). The next stanza calls his effect a “pause,” and
            inserts an extra pause in the line between her arrival and the action it produces: “They
            pause, they blush, they gaze,--a gathering shout / Bursts like one sound” (4531-2). The
            priest then “check[s]” this “sudden rout” (4533-4). This stanza moves the final caesura
            forward as the priest moves the crowd back into the religious system: “‘But he misdeems
            / That he is wise whose wounds do only bleed / Inly for self.’—Thus thought that
            Christian Priest indeed” (4537-39). The subsequent stanza again moves the caesura as the
            priest makes his case for executing Cythna, even if this means reneging on their promise
            to Laon: “Is it mine/ To stand alone, when kings and soldiers fear, / A Woman? God has
            sent his other victim here” (4546-8). The revolt as a whole, we now see, was only (but
            still significantly) a pause in the history of tyranny. One final movement of the
            Alexandrine’s caesura occurs at the moment when the Tyrant’s (and Cythna’s) child dies,
            along with her mother: “The tyrant’s child fell without life or motion / Before his
            throne, subdued by some unseen emotion” (4592-3). After watching her mother die, the
            child exits the tyrant’s control through death.</p>
                  <p>Shelley analyzes how listeners (and readers) learn from pauses when describing the
            effects of Cythna’s victory speech. Following their defeat of the Othman’s army, Cythna
            stands atop the victory altar to address the rebels. Shelley prints the text of her
            speech, but in the subsequent stanza describes her extra-linguistic communication: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> Ere she had ceased, the mists of night entwining</l>
                           <l>Their dim woof, floated o'er the infinite throng;</l>
                           <l>She, like a spirit through the darkness shining,</l>
                           <l>In tones whose sweetness silence did prolong,</l>
                           <l>As if to lingering winds they did belong,</l>
                           <l>Poured forth her inmost soul: a passionate speech</l>
                           <l>With wild and thrilling pauses woven among,</l>
                           <l>Which whoso heard, was mute, for it could teach</l>
                           <l>To rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach. (2272-80)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Cythna speaks through “pauses” in part because the atmosphere of tyranny
            has not completely dissipated. The return of “mists” and darkness at the opening of the
            stanza prefigures the return of despotic power. The enjambed line describing the mists
            “entwining / their dim woof” emphasizes tyranny’s enduring power by carrying the mists
            across lines. Cythna “shine[s]” through the mist of tyranny and improper thinking.
            Shelley again suggests tyranny’s pervasive control when he describes “the dreamlike
            music. . . . falling in pauses, . . . . Like beams through floating clouds on waves
            below,” as if people only hear music when the “clouds” of political despotism pause
            (2084-7). Cythna’s speech and the revolution itself, then, are merely a pause in the
            despotic order. But Cythna also speaks through “pauses” because Shelley
            characteristically describes silence as more powerful than language. Cythna’s speech, of
            course, is printed in the stanzas preceding this one, so neither Cythna nor Shelley are
            actually communicating without words. But the stanza suggests that nonverbal
            communication is even more powerful than the printed words because people are able to
            take a “silent” message as their own. In the penultimate line the pauses inserted before
            and especially after “mute”—“whoso heard, was mute, for it could teach”—briefly render
            the readers mute like the listeners. If listeners can only speak the language they
            learned under tyrannical rule, then they must be mute to hear Cythna’s message. The next
            stanza describes Cythna’s speech and the listeners’ necessary silence using metaphors
            Shelley will develop more famously in “Ode to the West Wind.” He compares Cythna’s voice
            to a “mountain stream,” her listeners to the “withered leaves of Autumn” that her voice
            sweeps into a bay; while her voice “sleeps / In the shadow of the shores” the leaves
            “wake / Under the wave;” her “speechless calm” incites this “living change” in the
            “multitude so moveless” (2281-9). </p>
                  <p>In rendering her listeners “mute,” Cythna ironically speaks for freedom and stirs the
            conditions of freedom only in the act of silencing others. Such a teaching method,
            however, is compatible with Shelley’s insistence that the speaker neither imposes his or
            her ideas on listeners, nor determines the form they will take into the future. The
            message depends on the listeners’ “hearts.” The caesura in the final line occurs at the
            moment of transmission from Cythna to her listeners, between “rapture like her own” and
            “all listening hearts.” In a kind of chiasmus, the mute listeners “reach” for the
            “rapture” which Cythna’s pauses demonstrate, claiming her message as their own. Cythna
            must “pause” her listeners to enable their “hearts” to “reach.” Cythna’s effect on
            listeners’ hearts emphasizes once again that a pause allows individuals to respond with
            their own emotional reaction to the scene before them. But in making the “heart” the
            entity that learns from pauses, Shelley also depicts the body as the site of poetry’s
            teaching, as if Cythna’s pauses teach listeners’ hearts a new rhythm. </p>
                  <p> Through her “wild and thrilling pauses,” Cythna speaks in the kind of extra-linguistic
            form that Shelley envisions continuing, free of specific referents, into the unknowable
            future. And in these lines, his puns reflect his argument that the stanza form provides
            the form that will endure; the form itself creates a pause. In the mid-stanza couplet
            beginning in line four, Shelley describes Cythna’s success as a speaker by the way her
            “tones” “linger” even beyond the words she speaks: “in tones whose sweetness silence did
            prolong, as if to lingering winds they did belong.” While tone is not a formal quality,
            Shelley’s comparison of her tone to “lingering” winds here calls our attention to the
            enduring effects of the Spenserian stanza in shaping Shelley’s lines. Not only does the
            “silence” “prolong” her tones (a nice hope, perhaps, for poetry’s transmission into the
            future), the stanza form demands that Shelley “prolong” the initial quatrain by turning
            the second “b” rhyme into a couplet, and to do so he adds a simile referring to the
            ur-Romantic trope for poetic inspiration, winds. Moreover, in these lines both the form
            and content comment on poetry’s ability to step outside of its time. Cythna’s voice is
            like “lingering winds” that delay the inevitable return of tyranny’s “mists,” and the
            line uses its self-consciously poetic wind simile in the midst of narration to create
            the couplet, denoting poetic form’s ability to link past, present, and future
            utterances. The metaphor of “lingering winds” in this first couplet also references the
            “b” rhymes’ back and forth movement between the “a” and “c”; the discussion of
            “prolonging” and “lingering,” then, ultimately argues for the lingering effects of
            stanza forms themselves. Because poets rely on future listeners to reinterpret their
            message, the poet’s forms (like Cythna’s tones) will “linger” even after her words. </p>
                  <p> Cythna demonstrates the effects of form in a second sense when she circulates among
            the celebrating masses. Shelley next attributes the change she incites to her form,
            embodied in her person and her name. As Cythna circulates, Laon reports, the listeners
            “fed on her form,” and “ate, of Liberty, / And Hope, and Justice, and Laone’s name”
            along with their vegetarian, tyranny-free, banquet (2319, 2296-7). In Shelley’s model,
            form is like a vegetarian dinner, hurting no one, but also allowing individuals to take
            the ideas that Cythna represents and transform them, as a body transforms food into
            energy. Her name is a type of form because it aspires to form’s repeatability: she
            adopts the name from Laon and changes it, both by adding the feminized “e” and by
            inhabiting it to carry out her own actions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
              additional significances of the name Laone, see especially Nersessian 130.</note> Her
            name further becomes a form at the end of the rebellion, when multiple young men and
            women surrender to the executioners and die claiming to be “Laon” and “Laone.” For
            Shelley, turning an individual into a form does not mean making them the liberal
            isolated individual of political and economic theory, but rather allowing others to
            adopt and transform their identity. </p>
                  <p>Shelley uses architectural ruins as another model for and instance of the way in which
            forms create structures that will support future change. In Canto 2, when Laon describes
            his first inklings of freedom, the ancient Greek ruins teach him to stand above and
            outside of the poisoned air surrounding him. When Laon envisions his future, he
            announces that he will be a tower: “and who shall stand / Amid the rocking earthquake
            steadfast still, / But Laon? On high Freedom’s desert land / A tower whose marble walls
            the leagued storms withstand!” (789-92). The Greek towers evoke both temporal and
            spatial distance from the present air and political systems. The towers were built in a
            different political system, and their height suggests that they reach above the polluted
            air of current tyranny.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Shelley recognizes that this
              claim might be illusion, however. When imprisoned for killing a soldier, Laon
              initially imagines that he is above the clouds, as if outside the tyrant’s political
              system: from his ancient “column” on the hill, “The islands and the mountains in the
              day / Like clouds reposed afar” (1239-40). But when he sees a boat, and remembers that
              it carries Cythna into slavery, he realizes that his sense of distance was in fact
              “frenzy” and “madness;” he does not “[know his] own misery” and remains in the grip of
              the tyrant’s political order (1238). </note> And the ruins are emblematic of form for
            Shelley not only because they indicate a distance from present political systems, but
            also because they are being transformed in the present, as they both fall apart and
            provide a scaffolding for natural vegetation. </p>
                  <p> Shelley’s descriptions of the ruins emphasize the way in which nature has grown on,
            in, and through the built structures. Shelley suggests that the ruins enable the growth
            of nature and humanity in a way that the cities and the tyrannical political structures
            they host do not.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Lyndon Gladden reads
              Shelley’s vine-covered ruins as “liminal spaces in which elements of nature and
              civilization mix and meld together,” aiding and thematizing characters’ recuperation
              (246). Gladden argues that elsewhere in the poem Shelley “turns . . . to the natural
              world as a register for the unnatural condition of tyranny” (247).</note> But more
            crucially for my point, these descriptions observe what Robert Mitchell calls entwining,
            the way in which nature parasitically builds on past human structures.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mitchell, writing on Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Ruined
                Cottage</title>, describes entwining as demonstrating “nature’s colonizing
              negativity,” its tendency to “erase all remnants of human activity” (148). For
              Shelley, in contrast, it is important that the forms of the past are not completely
              erased, but remain as a scaffolding for the present. I nonetheless cite Mitchell’s
              term to call attention to the way in which Shelley’s vines, like Wordsworth’s in
              Mitchell’s description “rechanneled the powers of the dead, turning them in a
              different direction” (148). </note> For Shelley, this entwining demonstrates the
            present learning from and altering the past. When the Hermit takes Laon to a coastal
            tower to recover, Shelley calls the tower “A changeling of man’s art, nursed amid
            Nature’s brood”; the chamber is “tapestried” with “rare mosses,” and the openings in the
            lattices allow Laon to see the moon (1429-30, 1432). When Laon and Cythna retreat from
            the battle to the cliff over the sea, they take shelter in a ruin that has been
            similarly transformed by nature. On the roof of the hall, “fair clinging weeds with ivy
            pale did grow, / Clasping its gray vents with a verdurous woof” (2575-6). It is “from
            that lone ruin” that they can hear “the murmur of the motion / of waters” (2535-6). </p>
                  <p>The ruin, in these stanzas, is the spatial equivalent of the pause, with holes that
            allow Laon and Cythna to view the stars and meteors, and that allow leaves to blow
            inside and vines to grow through its walls. The holes suggest that it is the very
            changes and evolutions of the past form that enable its visionary capacity. As the ruins
            themselves decay into and are transformed by nature, they lose some of their original
            context, and instead provide a glimpse of a natural world exterior to both the present
            and the past. “(By analog, we can think of the way Shelley’s use of the Spenserian
            stanza wrests it from its Elizabethan context). And the holes, then, transform the air
            from the atmosphere of tyranny surrounding Laon and Cythna to a transparent visual and
            aural medium, enabling them to see the sky and hear the ocean. </p>
                  <p>Shelley’s reference to the meteor notably illustrates the way in which ruins allow a
            view of an “air” untainted by both past and present systems. In Shelley’s day, a
            scientific consensus had only recently emerged that meteors originated from outside of
            the earth (Janković 151). When Laon and Cythna, then, look “through a rent / Of the
            ruin” to see “from the morass, / A wandering Meteor by some wild wind sent,” Shelley
            once again implicitly argues that decayed old forms and the pauses or air they structure
            allow Laon and Cythna (and poets and readers) to see outside of the political system and
            the “atmosphere” it produces (2615-17). Tying “rent” and “sent” together in rhyme
            intensifies the connection between the hole in the ruin and the meteor it allows Laon
            and Cythna to view. Like the oceans, this meteor derives from outside the
            socio-political system in a manner that resembles the ideal sources of Shelley’s
            philosophy. And the knowledge it provides Laon and Cythna is illustrated through the
            sexual union (against custom) of brother and sister: “The Meteor showed the leaves on
            which we sate, / And Cythna’s glowing arms, and the thick ties / Of her soft hair” as
            well as her “deepening eyes,” “marble brow, and eager lips” (2623-6, 2630). I read
            Shelley’s ruins, then, as a register of the way in which form, as a decayed and
            transformed past structure, provides the “rents” that allow us to see outside of our
            atmosphere. </p>
                  <p>Shelley calls attention to the specifically poetic resonance of this formal structure
            in the next stanza when he describes the ruin as a resting place for dead leaves: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> The autumnal winds, as if spell-bound, had made</l>
                           <l> A natural couch of leaves in that recess,</l>
                           <l> Which seasons none disturbed, but in the shade</l>
                           <l> Of flowering parasites did Spring love to dress</l>
                           <l> With their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness</l>
                           <l> Of those dead leaves, shedding their stars, whene’er</l>
                           <l> The wandering wind her nurslings might caress;</l>
                           <l> Whose intertwining fingers ever there </l>
                           <l>Made music wild and soft that filled the listening air. (2578-86)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The ruin provides a space for the leaves to gather and to support
            “flowering parasites” in the Spring. Shelley’s description of the flowers and “music
            wild” suggests the wind, ruin, and leaves together make new poetry from the detritus of
            the past. Calling the fallen flower blossoms “stars” emphasizes their origin in an
            exterior time (distant like the heavens), and credits this distance for their beauty.
            But Shelley also emphasizes that poems support future change, as the wind considers the
            leaves the “nurslings” of future times. The ruins of Shelley’s poetic structures can
            also accrue new generations of dead leaves, and new blooms that array themselves
            parasitically on the support of old forms. Nancy Moore Goslee suggests that the ruins,
            like Romantic fragment poems, “tempt us to imagine a completion; yet such completions
            have a conjectural openness that might differ radically from controlling intentions,
            whether individual or cultural” (71). Shelley in particular imagines future readers
            completing his forms when his poems too become ruins. </p>
                  <p>During Laon’s execution Shelley implicitly compares him to towers, asking to what
            degree his death transforms his action into a form. Laon observes the surrounding towers
            from atop his execution pyre: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> I, Laon, led by mutes, ascend my bier</l>
                           <l> Of fire and look around; each distant isle</l>
                           <l> Is dark in the bright dawn; towers far and near,</l>
                           <l>Pierce like reposing fames the tremulous atmosphere. (4491-4)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Laon’s bier is like the towers that seem to “flame” in the atmosphere.
            As Laon literally burns into a ruin himself, he also becomes a tower, both in his
            elevated height and in his evocation of a message that does not fit his times. And the
            flames of both Laon’s execution and of the sun shining on the islands renders the
            atmosphere “tremulous;” the smoke that kills Laon, then, alters the atmosphere, and
            Shelley sees in the atmosphere the kind of vibration that turns air into a medium,
            rendering it capable of transmitting Laon’s vision even through the systematic tyranny
            surrounding him. Literally, of course, this is the effect of the smoke. But Laon and
            Cythna, in voluntarily standing (and dying) in opposition to the despot’s political
            system, bring on this smoke. And even in death, the ruined Laon may inspire others as he
            had been inspired by Greek ruins. </p>
                  <p>One of Shelley’s linguistic structures for moving the caesura illustrates the way in
            which form provides a scaffolding for individual agency. Shelley in several places moves
            the caesura by placing either a name or a noun referring to the characters, set off by
            commas, in the first feet of an Alexandrine line. For example, after Laon narrates how
            his best friend turned against him, he addresses Cythna: “Since kin were cold, and
            friends had now become / Heartless and false, I turned from all, to be, / Cythna, the
            only source of tears and smiles to thee” (853-5). In Canto 11 Shelley sets off the name
            “Laon” in describing the procession leading Laon to his execution: “I’the midst appears
            / Laon,--exempt alone from mortal hopes and fears.” In both examples, setting off the
            name also marks the character’s exclusion from their larger communities, both because of
            their separate vision and (in Laon’s case) impending death. Shelley also occasionally
            uses this positioning to mark identities which also carve people out of the mainstream,
            such as “a woman” and “an atheist.” The final appearance of this pattern occurs when the
            child speaks to Laon after their death, and announces that she belongs to him as well as
            to Cythna. This time the line carves a space for a small group, a “we”: “again / We
            meet, exempted now from mortal fear or pain” (4664-5). In each case, placing the name at
            the beginning of the line either definitely moves the caesura (leaving the remainder of
            the line to be read like iambic pentameter) or adds a second caesura.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Shelley occasionally uses a similar structure within iambic pentameter
              lines to mark Laon’s agency. As Laon leaves the Hermit, Shelley sets “I left,” “my
              way,” “my frame” each at the beginning of a line, followed by punctuation that marks a
              pause, to show Laon exerting his agency within the revolution already begun by Cythna
              and the Hermit (1694, 1696, 1698). </note> Marking an individual’s name off suggests
            that individuals find agency for themselves by using their name to move the pauses, in
            the process creating a space for themselves within the structure of the poetic line.
            Such movement also shows a fairly limited and even ambiguous degree of agency, since
            it’s possible to read the name either moving the caesura or adding a second caesura.
            Regardless of how we scan the line, though, these examples show Shelley making small
            adjustments within form to find a space for the self. And Shelley’s use of names to move
            form also provides another way to account for Shelley’s oft-remarked distancing of
            himself from his Romantic-era audiences: the poet is privileged not only by the clarity
            of his vision but by the very forms of his utterances, as his movement within form
            provides a resource for agency that everyday actors lack.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As Susan Wolfson notes, Shelley was aware that the poems he directed
              toward the lower classes were unpublishable. Wolfson sees the form of “The Mask of
              Anarchy” commenting on this distance between author and reader (196-8); Andrew Franta
              reads the form commenting as well on the temporal distance between present and future
              readers (121-2). Richard Cronin notes that Shelley holds two incompatible attitudes
              toward the lower class’s participation in reform. On the one hand, influenced by
              Cobbett, he argues that the lower classes must demand a portion of political power; on
              the other hand, he is hesitant to trust the lower classes to revolt themselves, and
              instead suggests that the Whig intellectual elite should argue on their behalf
              (164-6). </note>

                  <head>Poems against systems</head>
                  <p>Shelley portrays the socio-political system as a totality from which only a few (like
            Laon) can escape. But he simultaneously suggests that even systems that seem totalizing
            to those inside—like the political tyranny of the Ottoman Empire—do have an exterior.
            If, as Clifford Siskin suggests, Romanticism was the era in which system was no longer a
            genre that aimed to define a comprehensive totality, but rather a knowledge claim
            embedded in multiple genres, then we can see Shelley finding in the very contest between
            overlapping global and local systems a possibility of exerting change.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See “The Problem of Periodization” and “Mediated Enlightenment.”
            </note> Shelley uses the weather as a metaphor for the way in which global and local
            systems intertwine. Shelley portrays poetry as part of the global weather system.
            Poetry’s air inevitably reflects the sociopolitical systems of the author’s day, but
            also challenges these systems. First, poets employ forms from a past day that juxtapose
            past systems to the present and that hopefully endure to represent the present to the
            future. Second, poets draw from the “source of human thought” to envision and enact
            change to the both the political and metrical systems. And poetry imports ideas from the
            ineffable source of human thought in order to change society just as the weather (in
            Shelley’s vision) originates in deep ocean currents; but once both move to land they can
            also become mired in local political systems. </p>
                  <p>In his “Defence of Poetry,” Shelley calls meter a system, but somewhat qualifies this
            definition: meter is “a certain system of traditional forms for harmony and language”
            (484). Poetry more generally, he suggests, is not a system, but rather, because of its
            origin in imaginative thought, the “root and blossom of all systems of thought” (503).
            Poetry starts new systems because it can reach outside current social and political
            orders. But even if poetry at times serves systems, the best poems can never be
            completely encompassed by any particular system. In this, Shelley finds Milton
            exemplary: <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> “contains within itself a
            philosophical refutation of that system of which, by a strange and natural antithesis,
            it has been a chief popular support” (498). In <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>,
            Shelley certainly aims for a “philosophical refutation” of the systems of his day. And
            he suggests that if meter is a system, this is because it acts on its readers both
            mentally and physiologically, temporarily extricating them from other systems of which
            they are a part as it dictates their breath, alters their heartbeat, changes the rhythm
            of their speech. Meter dislodges present systems because metrical forms derive from
            prior eras, and will hopefully carry into an unforeseeable future, but also because they
            create pauses in the order. Equally importantly, since even the most regular systems of
            meter allow for variation, Shelley employs this variation to pause the reach of social
            and political structures, and to train readers’ physiological responses. And these
            physiological changes carry an ideological charge if they allow readers to even
            temporarily escape both the teaching and the air that have been tainted by despotism. </p>
                  <p>The pause models one way in which form provides a resource for change: originating in
            another era, it stands apart from the current socio-political system. If Shelley chooses
            the stanza form in part for its pauses, then, it’s not only because he finds them
            “musical.” Shelley invokes change by inhabiting the Spenserian stanza’s form and moving
            it, imagining that he will temporarily transform readers’ air and breath, and through
            them, create rents in the systems of the present. But if Shelley hopes that his
            meter—and in particular its pauses—will act as brief systems to dislodge the political
            systems of his day, he does not want his poems or their forms to harden into systems.
            Instead, he envisions his greatest success as the moment when future readers create
            rents in his own forms. This, for Shelley, is the form of systemic change. </p>

               <p>This essay offers a new perspective to German Romanticism's thinking about systems by
          exposing its indebtedness to a mechanical idea that pervades the organic model of systems and
          operates in the blind spot of organic discourse. Against the common point of view that to think
          “organically” is to think “non-mechanically,” this essay argues that these two perspectives can
          in fact co-exist, and it is precisely the particular dynamics of this co-existence that will put
          the Romantic concept of system in a new light.</p>

                  <p>Where the question of “system” in the context of German Romanticism is concerned, and
            more specifically, in the aphorisms of Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel, it is all too
            tempting to dismiss the concept out of hand: not because it has no role to play in
            Romantic thinking (it does), but because the system-concept in this historical context
            is a quagmire of competing definitions and contradictions. Certainly, there is a marked
            difference between the Romantic champions of the fragmentary, with their ironic
            oscillations, and the attempted rigor of Kant’s, Fichte’s or Hegel’s philosophical
            systems. Even Schelling’s nature-philosophical system, with its sympathies to the
            Romantic understanding of science, does not or cannot approximate the playfulness of the
            Romantic approach to thinking about systems. But think about them they do: without
            professing the desire to build and dwell in one of their own, Schlegel and Novalis
            return time and again to the notion of what a system can and cannot be, what it does and
            does not do, and what an individual’s relationship to a system should and should not be.
            The rhetorical emphasis here on drawing distinctions is not accidental and points to a
            further challenge: after Niklas Luhmann, it is no longer possible to speak of “system”
            in the same breath as German Romanticism without considering the theoretical position
            that says that those same systems to which the Romantics return time and again bear
            features of autopoietic systems as defined by Luhmann. To be sure, Luhmann’s
            understanding of “system” is nothing like Kant’s or Hegel’s. To simplify a concept that
            is arguably much more complex for Luhmann, we could say that for him, systems are
            neither perfectly defined nor perfectly stable entities, but instead undergo a process
            of continuous development as they differentiate themselves from their environments.
            Taking the Romantic art system as an example, Luhmann describes it as
            “self-referential,” “operationally closed,” and in a state of change (507). These
            dynamics “cannot be grasped according to the schema—still predominant at the time of
            Romanticism—of part and whole” (507). The schema of “part and whole” to which Luhmann
            refers is, of course, a mainstay of Romantic thinking about systems and other key
            concepts defined by agile intellectual leaps across scale: in addition to the concept of
            system this would include the fragment, the organism, and the work of art. It appears
            that Schlegel and Novalis are caught in the crossfire between different understandings
            of what a system can be. A proper understanding of systems in the context of German
            Romanticism therefore needs to bring together both an examination of the historical
            concepts that surround their understanding of a system and our contemporary
            sensibilities about systems, or we run the risk of their blind-spots becoming our
              own.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I would like to thank Edgar Landgraf for his
              comments on this paper, particularly regarding Luhmann’s systems theory.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To approach Romantic thinking about systems, Johann Christoph Adelung’s definition
            provides a solid point of departure. In the <title level="m">Grammatisch-kritisches
              Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart</title> (<title level="m">Grammatic-critical
              Dictionary of High German</title>), he defines a system as a “connection of things of
            the same kind and disposition and the order according to which they are joined amongst
            themselves” (“der Zusammenhang von Dingen einerley Art und Einrichtung und die Ordnung,
            nach welcher sie unter einander verbunden sind”) (“System” 510-511). Adelung’s
            definition leaves open both the contents of what a system may contain and any mention of
            the specific kind of order that governs them—this is left to the discretion of the
            systematician. For their part, Novalis and Schlegel divide their attention between each
            of these issues: on the one hand, they test out a range of possible candidates for
            systematic connecting (including words, fragments, and concepts from the wide array of
            disciplines which attracted their interest), and on the other hand, they think about how
            these parts relate and the behavior of systems as a whole. This entails a study of other
            systems as well as considering alternatives to systems altogether. Novalis, who refers
            to the systems of Copernicus, Helvetius, Locke, Brown, and Fichte (among others), writes
            that “one studies foreign systems in order to find one’s own” (<title level="m">Schriften</title> 2:278) and that the “actual philosophical system” must be
            “systemlessness” integrated into a system (2:289). For all their apparent differences,
            these two aphorisms undertake the same strategy of differentiation, and they do so in a
            way compatible with Luhmann’s understanding of systems. They bring a foreign element
            into the familiar in order to observe the difference and allow it to become integrated
            into further thinking about the system. </p>
                  <p>Also in line with Luhmann and current understanding of Romantic thought is Schlegel’s
            and Novalis’ tendency to decry any notion of systematic rigidity and permanence in favor
            of a highly mutable environment: the system, according to Novalis, has itself the
            ability to effect new connections (3:56). Along these lines, the metaphors associated
            with the behavior of systems are frequently drawn from the realm of the organic. “Only
            that deserves to be called system,” writes Schlegel, “which has unity and an organic
            build (<title level="m">Gliederbau</title>)” (<title level="m">Philosophical
              Lectures</title> 55).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Translations from the German
              are mine throughout. Unless otherwise specified, all quotes from Novalis are from the
                <title level="m">Schriften</title>, and all quotes from Schlegel are from the <title level="m">Kritische Friedrich-Schlegel-Ausgabe</title>.</note> He even goes so far
            as to complain about those fumbling intellectual “banausoi” who “desecrate an organic
            system through <emph>mechanical</emph> handling” (“Kritische” 18:2:15). The Romantic
            emphasis on organic language for systems and other complex, emergent environments
            underscores the notion that they are essentially incomplete and in perpetual states of
            becoming, yet this same language is so pervasive that it can be difficult to find the
            necessary vantage-point from which to consider possible alternatives. At the risk of
            bearing the brunt of Schlegel’s criticism, this essay is an attempt to do exactly what
            he warns against: to give the Romantic thinking about systems a kind of “mechanical
            handling” by exposing its indebtedness to a mechanical idea that pervades the organic
            model of systems and operates, as it were, in the blind spot of organic discourse. </p>
                  <p>I will begin by situating the Romantic interest in a simple machine—the lever—in
            historical context before explaining the kind of conceptual “work” Schlegel and Novalis
            have it perform. The next part of the paper will focus on a particular aspect of the
            lever, the fulcrum, which is an object of interest in its own right. I will then use the
            fulcrum to return to the question of system. It is a common point of view that to think
            “organically” is to think “non-mechanically,” but the examples discussed in this essay
            will show that this is not always the case. Rather, the two can co-exist, and it is
            precisely the dynamics of this co-existence that will put the Romantic concept of system

                  <head>Romantic interest in a simple machine</head>
                  <p>There is pleasure to be found in the appreciation of simple things: those objects or
            ideas that are so commonplace as to escape our attention, but that, if we happen to
            observe them more carefully, reveal their intrinsic value in ways we would not have
            expected. The mechanical lever belongs in this category. It numbers first among the
            “simple machines” described in handbooks on mechanics since the time of Archimedes,
            where it is considered alongside other devices such as the scale, the wedge, and the
            pulley. Levers and lever effects are so intrinsic to our worldview that, once we begin
            to pay attention to them, they are everywhere: they serve as the basis of more
            complicated machinery and organisms (including the musculature of the human body), as
            figures for the augmentation of human agency, and they are implicated in any causal
            connection based on an advantageous relationship of input to output. Against the
            backdrop of a subject philosophy, the Romantic interest in the lever therefore makes
            sense, but as we will see, how Schlegel and Novalis integrate the lever into their
            thinking defy conventional notions of instrumentality as embodied by the spirit of
            Archimedes.</p>
                  <p>Although the lever is the most fundamental of the six or seven simple machines of
            classical mechanics—all of which rely in some way on the laws of the lever—it has proven
            over time to be remarkably versatile as an instrument of philosophical as well as
            scientific thought. As the historian of science Domenico Meli shows in <title level="m">Thinking With Objects</title> (2006), a number of intellectuals in the modern period,
            including Kepler, Descartes, and Leibniz, to name just a few, relied on the lever’s
            theory and used it to model problems relating to theories of motion, oscillation, and
            impact for scales both great and small. He writes that “several scholars…used the lever
            in their accounts of circular and orbital motion,” such as Borelli, who “imagined the
            planets to be pushed by the sun’s light acting like a lever,” and Jakob Bernoulli, who
            “used the lever to investigate the problem of the center of oscillation” (312). Meli
            attributes the phenomenon of thinking in terms of levers to what he calls the “crucial
            role played by the geometrical diagram,” a role he describes as “heuristic and at the
            same time didactic or mnemonic” (312). In that regard, our Romantic-era mechanists are
            in good company. They too deploy the theory of lever as a heuristic tool to model
            relationships between concepts, to describe processes of generation of both the
            individual and the universe, and, more generally, as a way of addressing potential
            contradictions of philosophical thinking.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to a number of publications in the last two decades, “science” and “Romanticism”
            are no longer a contradiction in terms, even if the precise nature of that relationship
            remains open to debate. Recent scholarship has exposed in great detail the Romantic
            reception of scientific theory, especially in regard to the emerging life sciences.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As a starting point, one could refer to Helmut

              53.2 (2007), 387-412. </note> This heightened interest in one aspect of Romantic
            thinking has, however unintentionally, suppressed another aspect that also deserves
            consideration. The problem is that the well-documented Romantic interest in chemistry,
            galvanism, and early biological thinking as they relate to models of organic life would
            not necessarily seem to accommodate an equally avid interest in mechanical law or
            anything hinting at a “mechanical philosophy.” Yet this is precisely the kind of
            philosophy that any intellectual engagement with the mechanical lever would entail,
            simply because it “endeavours to explicate the Phaenomena of Nature from Mechanical
            Principles,” as one finds in John Harris’s <title level="m">Lexicon Technicum</title>
            (1704) (col. MEC). First associated with texts such as Robert Boyle’s <title level="m">The Origin of Forms and Qualities according to the Corpuscular Philosophy
            </title>(1666) and Descartes’ posthumously published <title level="m">Treatise on
              Man</title> (1664), mechanical philosophy rejects the Aristotelian viewpoint that
            there are particular forms and qualities which dictate the tendencies of objects in the
            natural world, and the mechanical philosopher holds that “everything, be it terrestrial
            or celestial, natural motion or constrained, must be explained in terms of the size,
            shape and motion of the parts that make it up, just as the behavior of a machine is
            explained” (Garber 44).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Garber’s essay in the
              Cambridge History of Science devoted to Early Modern science emphasizes the importance
              of the Cartesian idea, as expressed in the <title level="m">Principia
                philosophiae</title>, that such an understanding of the machine-like functioning of
              the universe allows the understanding of one part to be extrapolated to the whole: “In
              this way, the image of the macrocosm and the microcosm, central to chymical
              philosophies and Renaissance naturalism, found its way into mechanism after a fashion.
              For the mechanical philosopher, as for the chymist and the Renaissance naturalist,
              what happens at one level reflects and is reflected by what happens at every other
              level” (Garber 44), a perspective which also plays a role in the Romantic
              appropriation of the lever.</note> As for Schlegel and Novalis, Marshall Brown speaks
            for many when he voices the conventional wisdom that the German Romantics have advanced
            beyond the mechanistic worldview (33). My position is that such an envisioned rejection
            of “mechanical philosophy” often misrepresents the facts by disregarding mechanical
            metaphors still integral to Romantic thinking and that one should speak less of a
            wholesale abandonment of a mechanistic world view than a reconfiguration of its useful
            aspects in proximity to organic models. This point of view is substantiated by those
            aphorisms of Schlegel and Novalis where one finds an avid interest in the lever as a
            mechanical device and as an instrument of thought whose use can be tested out in
            contexts reaching far beyond “material” application,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I
              am paraphrasing an idea voiced by Immanuel Kant in his 1763 essay, “Versuch den
              Begriff der negativen Größen in die Weltweisheit einzuführen,” where he writes, with
              reference to the lever’s law of equilibrium, that it is a concept one can extend “weit
              über die Grenzen der materialen Welt” (55). </note> yet there has been relatively
            little work done on basic mechanical principles in the Romantic context.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a more general discussion of Romantic tools and

            that. </p>
                  <p>We can begin the discussion of the Romantic lever with a simple definition of this
            simple machine, taken from the most established German scientific dictionary of the late
            eighteenth century to which Schlegel and Novalis both refer—Johann Gehler’s <title level="m">Physikalisches Wörterbuch</title> (<title level="m">Physical
              Dictionary</title>). In an entry compiled verbatim from the mathematical writings of
            Johann Erxleben and Abraham Kästner,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Abraham Gotthelf
              Kästner, <title level="m">Anfangsgründe der angewandten Mathematik</title> Göttingen:
              Verlag der Wittwe Vandenhoek, 1780 and Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben, <title level="m">Anfangsgründe der Naturlehre</title> Göttingen: Johann Christian
              Dieterich, 1787.</note> Gehler’s dictionary refers to the lever as “a fixed and
            inflexible connection of three bodies—or three points—two of which turn around the
            third, the fulcrum” (“Hebel”). This definition can be taken as representative for the
            theory of static mechanics as it stands at the end of the eighteenth century, but if we
            recall the passage from Adelung’s dictionary cited earlier, it also meets the minimum
            requirements for a system in that it creates a connection between things which, for all
            their differences, are like enough in “kind” or “disposition” to allow for them to be
            connected in the first place. This analogy between lever and system has the potential to
            be productive because the conditions according to which the Romantics deploy the former
            will have implications for the latter.</p>
                  <p>While there is evidence enough that both Schlegel and Novalis were well-versed in
            mechanical theory, in the case of Novalis his most detailed notes on the working of the
            lever come not from classical mechanics but rather from the physics of Carl
            Eschenmayer’s nature-philosophy and in particular the <title level="m">Säze
              </title>[sic]<title level="m"> aus der Natur-Metaphysik auf chemische und medicinische
              Gegenstände angewandt</title> (<title level="m">Propositions from Nature-Metaphysics
              applied to Chemical and Medicinal Objects</title>). Eschenmayer’s stated purpose in
            the preface to the <title level="m">Säze</title> bears directly on the question of
            system and can, in turn, be taken as programmatic for Novalis’ approach. Eschenmayer
            envisioned his text as a guidepost for future thinking about how to apply
            nature-philosophical ideas to the fields of chemistry and medicine. Because the text of
            the <title level="m">Säze</title> does not itself accomplish the task but merely points
            the way, Eschenmayer acknowledges its status as fragment (<title level="m">Bruchstük</title> [sic]), adding, “One can take propositions from a system and apply
            them completely unsystematically to objects of experience, without their most
            meritorious aspect falling by the wayside” (iv). When Novalis read Eschenmayer’s text,
            he excerpted interesting passages and added his own commentary: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Novalis’ excerpts and commentary replicate Eschenmayer’s approach.
            Mechanical facts about the lever—for example that a weight hanging from a lever will
            move more quickly through a given angle of displacement in a given time, in proportion
            to the arm’s length—inspire in Novalis a more general reflection about force
            (Eschenmayer makes no mention of either “absolute force” or an “armature of force”). The
            same holds true for Novalis’ reformulation of the law of equilibrium through the
            concepts of “intensity” and “extensity.” Here, Novalis makes a peculiar move, in that
            his reformulation of the physical law does away with external objects (like weights
            hanging on the arms of the lever). This amounts to an internalization of perspective and
            an identification with the lever itself—an idea to which I will return below. </p>
                  <p>A broader look at the appropriation of the lever in Novalis’ aphorisms reveals the same
            willingness to rethink the lever beyond the context of mechanical law or even
            nature-philosophy. Thus, alongside statements about the lever in accordance with
            Newtonian physics (for example, when Novalis writes that the lever must be explained
            according to the laws of celestial mechanics [3:77]), one finds it used to model other
            kinds of environments that neither Newton nor Eschenmayer had in mind, such as the
            syntactical relation of nouns and verbs (3:691). The degree to which Novalis’
            philosophical thinking is connected to his thinking about the lever becomes even more
            apparent when, with reference to his physicist friend Johann Wilhelm Ritter, Novalis
            constructs an analogy between “Ritter’s way of handling physics” and “my idea about the
            principle of personality in every substance,” something he equates with the force of the
            lever’s fulcrum (3:135). In other words, Novalis’ thinking about the lever seems to be
            more in line with a philosophical approach (or “way” of doing something) than an
            isolated interest. A laconic note, “<title level="m">About the Lever</title>,” found
            just a few pages later than the aphorism cited above, raises similar questions, namely,
            to what degree the lever was merely an object of conceptual interest for Novalis, and to
            what degree its very instrumentality may lie in how it facilitates a more general
            approach to thinking about certain problems of philosophical interest. These are
            questions which ultimately have to do with the individual, as the notion of a
            “personality in every substance” and the formulation of equilibrium in terms of
            “intensity and extensity” might suggest.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Novalis thinks “about the lever” in such a way as to generalize from
            contemporary physical theory, Schlegel’s approach can best be described as the
            exploratory creation of levers themselves, which in turn aligns well with Meli’s
            discussion of the heuristic value of levers for the mechanical theory of the eighteenth
            century. It is the functional property of the lever, which is after all a machine for
            our use, that allows Schlegel to use it as an instrument of thought, as in the following
            two aphorisms that appear contiguously: <quote>

                           <l>(1) Activity and receptivity completely relative. Substance absolute, only the

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Together, these two aphorisms offer a mechanical model of a lever in a
            state of constant motion, in the service of an organic principle. The fulcrum is a locus
            of alternation, a point which embodies the interplay of forces on either side. Much like
            the points of indifference between magnetic poles—which are also privileged points in
            Romantic thinking<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Around 1800, the concept of
              “indifference” took root in the sciences. It is commonly associated with Schelling’s
              discussion of magnetism in his nature-philosophy, having based his understanding of
              the term in part on the work of Dutch scientist Anton Brugmans, who describes a plane
              of indifference between the two poles of the magnet. In his <title level="m">Erster
                Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie</title> (1799), Schelling describes a
              state of indifference as one where natural phenomena exist with the forces acting upon
              them in balance, which can be considered as an analogous phenomenon to a lever in a
              state of equilibrium. See esp. Bernhard Rang, <title level="m">Identität und
                Indifferenz. Eine Untersuchung zu Schellings Identitätsphilosophie</title>
              Frankfurt: Klostermann, 2000, for a more detailed discussion of Schelling’s use of
              indifference. This antiquated concept of the magnet was replaced by magnetic fields
              after Ritter’s death (and later by quantum theory). </note>—the fulcrum serves as a
            model for negotiating a relationship between opposing concepts, as a figure of dynamic
            opposition. The suggestion that life or living is a process of repeated disruption is
            not unique to Schlegel. Schelling’s 1798 treatise, <title level="m">Von der
              Weltseele</title> (<title level="m">On the World Soul</title>), for example, also
            speaks of an equilibrium to life that must constantly be disturbed and re-established.
            In fact, in the same passage where Schelling makes this claim, he also uses the lever as
            a metaphor when he names oxygen and hydrogen the two “negative principles of life in the
            animal body,” comparing them to “weights on the lever of life” whose local
            disequilibrium allows for the large-scale maintenance of life itself (198).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One can contrast this point of view with the Hippocratic
              tradition that associates disease and disequilibrium.</note> Schlegel’s designation of
            the lever as “philosophical” emphasizes a theoretical relationship that complies with
            mechanical law. Though the units of his lever are relatively more abstract than
            Schelling’s hydrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of life itself, there is a shared
            emphasis on movement and process (as opposed to the figure of the lever in static
            equilibrium). </p>
                  <p>The examples cited above are not unique in Schlegel’s work. One can find the blueprints
            of other levers whose terms are drawn from the key concepts that haunt his literary and
            philosophical notebooks around 1800: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>“Act and hypothesis form a lever, belief is the hypomochlion” (18:404)</l>
                           <l>“Philology is perhaps constructed from the negative arm of philosophy or logic
                  and from the positive arm of poesy” (18:391)</l>
                           <l>“Religion is the X of the encyclopedia—philology the hypomochlion. Art;
                  mythology, poesy the <emph>positive</emph> arm, philosophy, history the negative”
                  (18:391)</l>
                           <l>“Mythology is only the hypomochlion of poesy” (16:293)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> It comes as no surprise that Schlegel also states that the lever is of
            “utmost importance” for the theory of construction (18:170). Such a claim would be
            unoriginal in a mechanics handbook, but what about in the Romantic context? Much in the
            same way as the formulas in Schlegel’s notebooks draw upon the language and symbolism of
            differential calculus, we see that in the examples quoted above the logic of the lever
            allows for abstract concepts to be treated as discrete quantities and positioned into
            relationships, without, however, losing their dynamic potential or status as
            constructions-in-progress. These levers accomplish a kind of philosophical work. They
            construct by bringing concepts together and positioning them in proximity to each other
            and also by establishing connections to allow for mobility, given that one fundamental
            aspect of the lever is its movement around the fulcrum—its ability to accommodate a
            shifting relationship of forces. Within the context of Romantic writing, one can also
            speak of local and global lever effects: once the relationships are constructed (for
            example, between mythology and poesy in the last of Schlegel’s aphorisms cited above),
            they will continue to bear upon our broader understanding (i.e., the relationship will
            continue to affect our understanding of them in the context of the Romantic encyclopedia
            project and beyond). Schlegel’s lever effects continue to operate beneath the surface of
            the encyclopedia project, even when the lever or its component parts are not directly
            mentioned. </p>
                  <p>Once again, Adelung’s definition of system comes to mind, along with the thought that
            there is a homogenizing effect—at least of form, if not of content—when different
            concepts are treated as units with which to build. It is important to keep in mind,
            however, that the emphasis on the lever does not imply a reduction of Romantic thinking
            to something like a mechanical, clockwork cosmos. How Schlegel and Novalis position both
            the concept of the lever and their conceptual levers suggests a potential way of
            navigating between (and avoiding) oversimplified tropes of both the organic and the
            mechanical, even if their respective approaches are not precisely the same. In fact,
            they seem to be homing in on common ground from two different angles: Novalis, through a
            connection of the lever with the individual, and Schlegel, through a connection between
            the lever and the conceptual landscape of the intellect. As we will see, the meeting
            point of these two perspectives will be the fulcrum, which will also provide the most
            ambitious testing ground for the Romantic concept of system.</p>

                  <head>The fulcrum</head>
                  <p>Conspicuously absent from Schlegel’s notes is any mention of a hand or agency external
            to the functioning of these simple machines. Schlegel is no Archimedes: there is no
            fantasy of an ideal point from which to displace the world. Any “mechanical advantage”
            gained by the conceptual levers of his notes would seem to be re-absorbed into their
            operational dynamics rather than allocated to an external individual.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This is also referred to in the Luhmann essay as a situation when the
              “output of a system is immediately reintroduced into the system” (509).</note> What
            can be observed, however, is a special emphasis placed on the concept of the fulcrum,
            which Schlegel and Novalis refer to using the Greek term, “hypomochlion.” Meaning
            “beneath the lever,” the hypomochlion is literally where the lever is placed to do its
            work—the planetary reality that grounds any fantasy of the Archimedean point.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title level="m">The Mechanical Technology of Greek
                and Roman Antiquity</title>, A. G. Drachmann quotes the explanation provided in
              Pappus on the etymology of the hypomochlion: <quote>when people wanted to move a very
                heavy body, since the first thing they needed in moving it was to lift it from the
                ground, and there was no handle by which to handle it, because all parts of its
                bottom were on the ground, they had to find some way for this, and so they dug a
                small hole in the ground under the heavy body and took a long pole and put its end
                into the hole and pressed down the other end, and the burden came up (or ‘became
                small’). Then they placed under this pole a stone which is called ibumahliun
                [hypomochlion] and that means that which is placed under the lever, and they pressed
                down again and the burden became much lighter (or ‘was lifted higher up’). And as
                the power became known, it was understood that it was possible to move in this way
                great burdens. (52)</quote>
                     </note> From a mathematical perspective, the hypomochlion
            is a point of mediation on the lever itself and embodies the dynamic cancellation and
            maintenance of opposing forces; to think again with Luhmann, one could say that the
            hypomochlion encompasses a distinction and neutralizes it at the same time. In terms of
            thinking about systems, the hypomochlion acquires a priveleged status: it is the
            smallest conceivable model in which distinctions continue to be produced and,
            accordingly, is the smallest possible representation of the system itself. These aspects
            of the Romantic incorporation of the hypomochlion into their thinking about systems can
            be brought into even sharper relief against the backdrop of Eschenmayer’s and
            Schelling’s nature philosophy.</p>
                  <p>Eschenmayer’s initial definition of the lever and the hypomochlion, to which Novalis
            refers in his notes, is simple enough as stated in the <title level="m">Säze</title>:
            “We can imagine the arms of a lever as two moments and regard the hypomochlion as the
            point in which both moments work against each other” (Wir können uns die Aerme eines
            Hebels mit ihren Kräften als zwei Bewegungsgrössen vorstellen, und das Hypomochlion als
            den Punkt ansehen, in welchem beide Grössen gegeneinander wirken) (xiv). This is
            essentially the same as the definition in Gehler’s <title level="m">Physikalisches
              Wörterbuch</title> cited at the beginning of the paper; like Gehler’s, Eschenmayer’s
            definition refers to a mathematical lever with no regard to material constraints. In the
            course of his nature-philosophical investigations over the next two decades, however,
            Eschenmayer will eventually consider ideas that would not be found in Gehler’s
            dictionary because they involve a speculative use of the lever (and the hypomochlion) as
            a model for activities of the mind: “1) The opposition between knowledge and being is
            expressed in the objective opposition between force and weight. 2) Mediation in the self
            is expressed in the hypomochlion of the lever. 3) The equation of knowledge and being is
            expressed through the relative equilibrium of weight and force” (<title level="m">Psychologie</title> 448). These ideas, published in an 1817 volume devoted to
            empirical, pure, and applied psychology, may seem far removed from the current thinking
            about the lever around 1800, but we can see an analogous trajectory already developing
            in Schelling’s <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title> (1800). </p>
                  <p>Schelling’s reference to the lever occurs in the context of a discussion that resists
            an easy summary but which can be characterized as an attempt to describe the ego
              (<foreign>das Ich</foreign>) as a product of opposed operations within the framework
            of self-consciousness. Schelling describes such a product as both real and inactive
              (<foreign>als ein reelles Unthätiges, oder als ein unthätiges Reelles</foreign>) (
              <title level="m">System</title> 101). It is both “mere matter” and a “product of the
            imagination” which is only important as a medium (<title level="m">Mittelglied</title>)
            (101). Schelling claims that “All matter is mere expression of an equilibrium of opposed
            operations which reduce each other reciprocally to a mere substrate of operation” (101).
            In other words, the stability of the material world relies upon a relative equilibrium
            of forces whose differences, once sublated, cease to be immediately apparent. At this
            point he introduces the comparison to the mechanical lever: “One should consider the
            lever, both weights operate only on the hypomochlion which is also the common substrate
            of their operation” (101). The hypomochlion therefore embodies both the conflict and the
            potential resolution of differences. Schelling goes one step further, however, to link
            what could be described as a purely material model, applicable to any physical context,
            more directly to a model of consciousness: “What is more, that substrate does not emerge
            accidentally through free production but rather completely automatically by virtue of a
            third operation that is as necessary as the identity of the self-consciousness” (101).
            Schelling contextualizes this idea with reference to the chapter heading, which states
            that opposed operations of self-consciousness, insofar as they inform a third operation,
            create something common between them. After his reference to the lever, Schelling
            directly equates this “common” element with a “<emph>construction of the ego
              itself</emph>, not as <emph>mere </emph>object but rather as subject and object at the
            same time” (102). </p>
                  <p>What the above examples from Eschenmayer and Schelling show is that, in
            nature-philosophical thinking around 1800, the lever is removed from purely mechanical
            contexts and is deployed as a model for both the self in general and the emergence of
            self-consciousness. This model will eventually receive its most radical formulation in
            the psychological theory of Johann Herbart, who attempts with great mathematical rigor
            to use the lever and its law of equilibrium to model the recollection and suppression of
            thoughts in the brain (a topic for another day). Returning to the state of affairs
            around 1800, we can see that both Schlegel and Novalis have something more to contribute
            to the analogy between the lever and the individual. With an emphasis on a balance of
            forces, Novalis also considers the lever as a model for consciousness when he refers to
            “the temper of consciousness” as “maintained rest,” a “static force,” and “a
              <emph>constant quantity </emph>in continuous change (fulcrum on the lever)” (3:836).
            In keeping with the lever’s function as mediator between opposing forces, it is
            interesting to see how this figure of balance and reciprocity informs Novalis’ thinking
            in a more general sense: not only does Novalis “apply” the lever heuristically in new
            contexts, he also uses these same contexts for further reflection about the lever’s
            mechanical law. In another aphorism that begins with a reference to Plotinus’ idea of
            memory as the “lowest force of the soul—the basis of the others,” Novalis shows that, in
            addition to using the lever as an analogy for the operations of the mind, he can also
            use this model for further thinking about scientific theory: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>(Opposition of <emph>Basis</emph>, a concept that relates to weight, and
                    <emph>lever</emph> (from lifting) which relates to counter-weight) (New
                  deduction of the lever from the lifting point etc. through centrifugal force)
                    (<title level="m">Schriften</title> 3:907).</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> If we read these aphorisms in conjunction with the one where Novalis
            refers to his idea of “the principle of personality in every substance—or the force of
            the hypomochlion” (<title level="m">Schriften</title> 3:574), i.e., as a way of
            approaching physics, then at the very least there is mounting evidence for a model of
            the individual where the physics of the lever plays an important role (without, however,
            being reduced to a “mechanistic” philosophy in the older sense of the term). Other
            aphorisms, particularly those by Schlegel, go even further. In the same one where
            Schlegel attests that “the lever is extremely important for the theory of construction,”
            he writes that every universe has its own hypomochlion (18:170). And with reference to
            the hypomochlion as a figure of unified heterogeneity, he states that “the center of
            every universe [is] perhaps <title level="m">doubled</title> [and] actually
              <emph>heterogeneous</emph>. One from two, two at the same time from different orders”
            (18:171). What is true for the macrocosm holds true for the microcosm as well: the
            “active, free human is his own hypomochlion” (18:171). Here, more clearly than ever,
            Schlegel rewrites the Archimedean fantasy of the mighty lever by replacing it with a
            model that seems, at first glance, to be counterintuitive. For Schlegel, freedom
            is—among other things—the freedom from being indebted to any instrumental augmentation
            of power. The distinction between human agency and tool has been completely internalized
            to the point that human agency has been conceived in terms of a mechanical function. Far
            from being a philosophically reactionary maneuver, however, the identification of the
            individual with the hypomochlion does not present, in its sheer punctuality, any
            impediment to organic models of growth and generation. If anything, removing
            instrumental agency eases the way for autopoietic growth. </p>
                  <p>One of the most significant aspects of the hypomochlion as it is incorporated into
            Romantic thinking—apart from the ease with which it can be moved across scale, from the
            universe to the individual—is its ability to embody “duplicity” in a literal sense
            without losing its integral “simplicity” as a point. In the hypomochlion, differences
            are sublated (<foreign>aufgehoben</foreign>) in that they are removed, maintained, and
            held up.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It is interesting, if one refers back to
              Hegel’s introduction of this term in <title level="m">Science of Logic</title> and the
                <title level="m">Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences</title>, to observe the way
              in which Hegel integrates the mechanical law of the lever into his discussion of
                <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign>.</note> If, as Novalis suggests, the true individual is
            also a true “dividual” (<title level="m">Dividuum</title>) (3:451), then the
            hypomochlion (and the lever) provide a model to illustrate how this idea need not be
            self-contradictory, because both identity and difference can be preserved. We have come
            a long way from Gehler’s definition of the lever as a “fixed and inflexible connection,”
            but Novalis is willing to go even further in his thinking about the lever when he
            suggests removing both the “fixed lines” <emph>and</emph> “point of support” such that
            the lever is now simply to be explained by the theory of force alone (3:470). As a
            physical idea it is not entirely clear what Novalis has in mind without a corresponding
            proof; as a philosophical model, however, Novalis’ proposal raises intriguing
            possibilities. If Novalis is referring to the point of support in the context of the
            physical lever, then perhaps he has decided to appropriate it indefinitely for the
            mathematical model where the fulcrum is, for all intents and purposes, part and parcel
            of the lever, bringing Novalis’ model of the lever that much closer to a model of a
            system that is self-sustaining. </p>

                  <head>Conclusion: the mechanics of Romantic systems</head>
                  <p>The equation of the hypomochlion with the individual—and with the system—has
            ramifications for our understanding of German Romanticism. In the wake of the
            mechanistic philosophy of the eighteenth century, and the perception that Romanticism
            distances itself both from this philosophy and from related figures of thought, the
            incorporation of perhaps <emph>the</emph> most important central concept from classical
            mechanics into a model of the subject should not be underestimated. At the same time, it
            seems clear that the presence of the hypomochlion is no real threat to the organic
            models that inform Schlegel’s and Novalis’ thinking. Instead, Romantic system-organs,
            when examined in terms of their smallest components, begin to resemble a mechanical
            assemblage where the fulcrum of the lever is the figure that defines the smallest
            possible—and paradoxically also the largest possible—unit.</p>
                  <p>This suggests that a more nuanced view is required to understand precisely how a
            “mechanical” component can be embedded in Romantic nature-philosophical systems. Perhaps
            it is the elementary quality of the hypomochlion as a figure of individual duality that
            has allowed it to exist under the radar. Whereas an overt system of multiple levers
            would invariably recall older, contested models of the clockwork universe, a single
            lever—or even less than that, a single hypomochlion (and if Novalis has his way, perhaps
            even less than that: a mere tension of forces)—allows for mechanical theory to function
            uncontested in a less restrictive environment.</p>
                  <p>Although figures of part and whole are central to Romantic thought, the hypomochlion
            possesses a unique mobility. It bridges conceptual work of the encyclopedia project and
            Romantic subject philosophy, equally at home as a model of consciousness, as a
            description of the individual, as a conceptual link between concepts drawn from
            different disciplines, and as a figure of cosmological reach. As the embodiment of
            agency without instrumentality, the hypomochlion is indebted to a model of the lever
            built upon pure relationality. Without a hand to direct it, it becomes organic and
            self-guiding, even as it remains figure of unified “dividuality.” In other words, the
            hypomochlion’s defining feature is the preservation of a distinction which allows it,
            with absolute succinctness, the potential of becoming a system unto itself.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>The Eighteenth Century has been called the “age of the encyclopedia,” but
          the understanding of that word is very different in the encyclopedias of Chambers and
          Diderot on the one hand, and on the other hand the German Idealist tradition variously
          exemplified by Hegel’s <title level="m">Encyclopedia of the Philosophical
          Sciences</title>, Schelling’s <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, and Novalis’
            <title level="m">Romantic Encyclopedia</title>. In Kant’s terms, the first provides an
          aggregate of knowledge, whereas the second attempts a system that entails an
          architectonic. Focusing on Hegel’s desire to unify all the sciences through the
          meta-discipline of philosophy, this paper explores the increasing complication of his
          architectonic by the very figures he uses to safeguard it: namely the circle, the line,
          and the body. Tracing the supplementary relationship between the first and the second, I
          argue that the body with its multiple subsystems brings to a head the collapse of the
          “smooth” system Hegel intended into a “tangled’” system: a productive collapse, because
          instead of being a forced unification of knowledge, the encyclopedia becomes a
          thought-environment for transferences between disciplines and potentially the emergence of
          new disciplines. Or, in effect, it becomes a form of “Theory” avant la lettre.</p>

                  <head>Encylopedias and Encyclopedics</head>
                  <p> In encyclopedias that proliferated in the eighteenth century, the body, map and tree
            are frequent schemas for system. These figures project what Deleuze and Guattari call a
            striated space with clear coordinates (361-2) that can be compared to Kant’s equation of
            system with “architectonic,” which Kant naturalizes through the body that assigns parts
            their functions and subordinates them to a whole (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691).
            Yet what if the body is not an anatomical body, but is composed of multiple systems that
            work on different levels and in different registers: circulatory, digestive, nervous
            etc.? This paper reflects on the different conceptualizations of system generated by
            different analogues for organization, and the different models of intellectual formation
            produced by such systems. For my purposes encyclopedias that gather up all the pieces of
            information spawned by an expanding print culture can be distinguished from the
            “encyclopedics” developed by German Idealist and Romantic philosophers, such as Hegel,
            Schelling, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis. The material entities we call encyclopedias
            are multiply authored resources for information retrieval that were increasingly
            arranged in alphabetic form and intended for multiple readers. But the more metaphorical
            encyclopedias such as Hegel’s <title level="m">Encyclopedia of the Philosophical
              Sciences</title> (1817-32) or Novalis’ <title level="m">Notes for a Romantic
              Encyclopedia</title> (1798) are singly authored projects that go back to the root
            meaning of the term <foreign>enkyklos paedeia</foreign>, meaning a circle of learning
            that aims, not just at information, but at knowledge to be taken in by a single reader.
            But “metaphorical” is a misnomer, since it was only with Chambers and Diderot that the
            term encyclopedia even came to mean a work of reference rather than a general system of
            education (McArthur 103). Implicit in what I am calling encyclopedics, then, to
            distinguish it from this modern use of the word encyclopedia, is a program of learning
            or <foreign>Bildung</foreign> that occurs through a “cycle” of the sciences, or, as I
            shall argue, the problematizing of such a program.</p>
                  <p> This difference occurs across what Derrida calls “philosophical continents”: French
            and British vs. German (“Sendoffs” 243). Though there is a spectral dialogue between
            them, Hegel marks this division when he distinguishes his “philosophical encyclopedia”
            from “ordinary encyclopedias,” which are an “assemblage of sciences” that are often only
            “bits of information” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 53). To elaborate, by the
            eighteenth century encyclopedias were mostly alphabetic, crossing lines with
            dictionaries. Yet from Chambers’ <title level="m">Cyclopedia</title> onwards (1728),
            they evinced anxieties about the empiricism of the alphabet. Thus Chambers expresses
            almost the same concerns as Hegel, when he speaks of the need to dispose “a Variety of
            Materials” so as “not to make a confused Heap of incongruous Parts, but one consistent
            Whole.” This, he says, he attains “by considering the several Matters” both “as so many
            Wholes, and as so many Parts of some greater Whole” linked by a “Reference.” But in a
            version of what would be later known as the hermeneutic circle, where the parts can only
            be known through the whole and vice versa, he also discusses the advantages of a
            dictionary within a system, namely that the former keeps one apprised of the “Pins and
            Joints,” the thousand things we might ignore, which is the only way “the Whole Circle or
            Body of Knowledge can be deliver’d” (i-ii).</p>
                  <p> These material encyclopedias, in other words, tried to be both empirical and
            systematic. Indeed “system” is the battle-cry of the <title level="m">Encyclopedia
              Britannica</title> (<title level="m">EB</title>). To be sure, the <title level="m">EB</title> seems to converge with Hegel’s emphasis on disciplines, on gathering up
            all the “philosophical sciences,” since its title page claims that it is conceived on “a
            Plan entirely New” in which the “Sciences and Arts are digested into Distinct Treatises
            or Systems,” with the aim of uniting all the “detached parts” into a “system.” But the
            very word system has undergone a sea-change. The major entries are not always on
            disciplines and are also often on what we might call “practices.” These entries are
            therefore systems in the sense Clifford Siskin uses the word when he describes 1798 as
            “the year of the system” (12). Though internally architectonic in Kant’s terms, they
            exhibit a micro-specialisation in which each discipline or practice has its own system,
            the placing of disciplines and practices on the same surface itself being an example of
            this micro-specialization.</p>
                  <p> Material encyclopedias, in other words, are systematic in the sense of containing
            multiple modular systems rather than a total system of knowledge: a model that comes
            back to haunt Hegel and Schelling. Their logics of unification—such as an opening
            diagram of a tree with many branches, or in the case of Chambers, prefatory references
            to a land to be divided up into provinces, a body of knowledge, branches of knowledge,
            and the circle of knowledge (i, vii)– are strictly supplementary. For one thing, minor
            entries are cross-referenced only to the system to which they belong, and there is not
            that much cross-referencing among systems, or if there is, it is strictly indexical and
            not conceptual. And many minor entries also remain undigested into any larger system, so
            that in the end the signifier of totality is simply the material container of the book.
            Indeed, while there is a residual discourse of unity in Chambers, we could argue that by
            the time of the <title level="m">EB,</title> systematicity has come to mean method
            rather than totality. Parts of knowledge are “digested” into systems or treatises: a
            dead metaphor that we will see operating more luridly in Hegel. But these “digests” are
            themselves parts. They are just more comprehensively gathered up than in the growing
            number of periodicals that also provided summaries of books, including foreign books, so
            as to establish a transnational public sphere of communication.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For instance the <title level="m">Intelligenzblatt Der Jenaischen
                Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</title> (1804-41) provides notices of recent
              publications under a number of disciplinary headings. In addition the 1818 issues of
              this monthly journal, for example, include notices of lecture courses at the
              University of Berlin, lists of books for sale and people who received doctorates. The
              journal is a heterogeneous attempt to cover the sphere of knowledge. In Britain the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</title> has a section on
              “Scientific Intelligence” arranged under various areas.The short-lived <title level="m">German Museum</title> (1800-1) reviews new publications in Germany, and
              then has a Supplement broken down into different subject areas.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In fact, more than Chambers and his early modern precursors such as Vincent of
            Beauvais, who still pay lip-service to the circle or course of knowledge, the <title level="m">EB</title> stands on the cusp of a transition from encyclopedic knowledge to
            information, already confessing that there “is some inconvenience in ... perusing a
            whole system when we only want to consult a particular topic” (<emph>2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> ed.</emph> iv). Or as Tom MacArthur puts it, certain kinds of data –
            existing in catalogues, directories, dictionaries etc.—are better off outside the brain:
            just as we do with things, so too we can put “mental objects in the equivalent of bags"
            and carry them around. (7). While information is nothing new, what we do see in material
            encyclopedias is a shift in sensibility wherein by our own time, the modular,
            informational model will extend to the whole of knowledge, the very re-purposing of the
            word encyclopedia being a symptom of this shift.</p>

                  <p> It is in this environment that Hegel undertakes his “philosophical” as opposed to
            “ordinary” encyclopedia,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I capitalize Hegel’s
              Encyclopedia only when referring to the work that consists of the <title level="m">Logic</title>, <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, and <title level="m">Philosophy of Mind</title>. The Encyclopedia project itself is much larger,
              including lectures on aesthetics and on religion edited and published by Hegel’s
              students. Hegel published very little: among his well-known texts, only the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> (1807), <title level="m">The Science of Logic
              </title>(1812, 1813, 1816), the <title level="m">Philosophy of Right</title> (1821),
              and the Heidelberg <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> (1817) and Berlin <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> (1827/30), which are outlines. Hegel’s many lecture
              courses are subsystems that develop parts of the macrosystem that exists in outline,
              and which he began to conceptualize well before 1817, in his earlier Jena system,
              which he also did not publish. Even the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
              as it comes down to us is an eclectic text, consisting of those parts of the outline
              that pertain to nature, with <title level="m">Zusätze</title> or expansions added by
              K.L. Michelet from notes by Hegel’s students. We should not dismiss these eclectic
              texts or <title level="m">Zusätze</title> as not truly Hegel’s simply because he did
              not publish them: this is to be bound by notions of final authorial intention that are
              fundamentally not Romantic. Hegel did not publish his lectures because his living
              system had to be endlessly annotated, expanded, qualified, and complicated: because he
              was not the closed thinker posited by Derrida (<title level="m">Glas</title>, <title level="a">The Age of Hegel</title>) and Hamacher. The format of the <title level="m">Zusatz</title> is brilliantly addressed by Jean-Luc Nancy in <title level="m">The
                Speculative Remark</title>. We should note, and indeed insist, that the <title level="m">Zusatz</title> or supplement is also intrinsic to the kind of “system”
              represented by an encyclopedia. </note> and that Friedrich Schlegel says that the
            “encyclopedia of the French is totally a wrong tendency –whereas this project is native
            to Germany” (qd. Behler 284). Not that there were no ordinary encyclopedias in Germany,
            but the argument here is for an Idealist and/or Romantic rather than empiricist or
            technological encyclopedia like Diderot and d’Alembert’s <title level="m">Encyclopédie</title>. Thus Hegel’s aim, and less systematically Schelling’s in his
            lectures on <title level="m">University Studies</title>, is both to preserve the
            coherence of a circle or cycle of disciplines and to expand the provenance of philosophy
            beyond Kant’s politically cautious limitation of it to a lower faculty (<title level="m">Conflict</title> 43-58). It is to bring “Idealism ... into all the sciences,” as
            Schelling puts it (<title level="m">World-Soul</title> 94). With that in mind, while
            expanding the reach of philosophy to the life sciences, aesthetics etc., Hegel also
            strictly limits himself to “philosophical sciences,” participating in a tradition that
            goes back to Christian Wolff’s division of philosophical from historical or empirical
            knowledge, and forward to Husserl’s narrower distinction between “eidetic” and “factual”
            sciences ( Husserl, <title level="m">Ideas</title> 62-4). Hegel does include sciences
            such as aesthetics “that exist for themselves outside of philosophy in general,” but
            have a “rational basis” which also allows them to be treated philosophically (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 53). But he excludes “pseudosciences” such as heraldry
            that are “thoroughly positive” (53): a dig at British encyclopedias that include this
            topic, in one case as a way of securing commercial patronage. </p>
                  <p> Most of all Hegel is concerned to protect “philosophy” from the “English” confusion of
            it with “experimental physics” (or natural philosophy), so that “electrical machines ...
            pumps and the like are called philosophical instruments” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 49)– a use of “philosophy” that we do indeed find in British
            scientific journals at the time. Reading all knowledge that matters through philosophy,
            Hegel’s system therefore strives to be a totality. This is to say that Hegel does not
            conceive his Encyclopedia as a multi-use resource but as an integrated system of
            knowledge, in which ‘system’ is tied up with the seriousness of knowledge and the
            education (“Bildung”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miller sometimes translates the
              word <foreign>Bildung</foreign> as “culture” and sometimes as “education” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 8, 16; <title level="m">Phänomenologie </title>18,
              28). In addition to its associations with Blumenbach’s <title level="m">Bildungstrieb</title>, the German word is also connected with
                <foreign>Bild</foreign> (picture or image), the word Hegel uses at the end of the
              text to describe Spirit as having traversed a “gallery of images” in its education. It
              is therefore unfortunate that at the end of the text, where Hegel couples <title level="m">Bild</title> with <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, Miller does not translate
              the word at all (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 428; <title level="m">Phänomenologie 566).</title>
                     </note>) of self-consciousness as spirit, what Derrida
            calls an auto- and onto-encyclopedia of spirit (“Age of Hegel” 148). Hence the constant
            emphasis on system, in Hegel’s insistence that knowledge can only be “expounded as ...
            system” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 13-14), and in Schelling’s constant
            search for a system and his unworking of his various systems. Hence also Hegel’s
            narrativizing of system as something more than merely structural, when he divides his
              <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> into three parts that take the form of a journey
            or phenomenology of consciousness: “1) logic, the science of the idea in and for itself;
            2) the philosophy of nature, as the science of the idea in its otherness; 3) the
            philosophy of spirit, the science of the idea as it returns to itself from its
            otherness” (54). But needless to say this travel outwards to the margins of philosophy,
            in Hegel’s increasingly complex and multicomponent system, will result in multiple
            infractions from these margins that threaten philosophy’s systematic self-concept.</p>
                  <p> Underpinning Hegel’s conception of system according to a <foreign>pars pro toto logic
              </foreign>(<title level="m">Encylopedia</title> 51) is Kant’s notion of architectonic,
            introduced as early as the lectures on <title level="m">Physical Geography</title>,
            where it is connected to the idea of the encyclopedia. Here Kant writes that we “need to
            become acquainted with the objects of our experience <hi rend="bold">as a whole</hi>,”
            so that our knowledge will form “not an <hi rend="bold">aggregation</hi> but a <hi rend="bold">system</hi>; for in a system the <hi rend="bold">whole</hi> is prior to
            the parts, while in an aggregation the <hi rend="bold">parts</hi> have priority” (446).
            In the first <title level="m">Critique</title> Kant further develops this concept of
            “architectonic,” repeating his distinction between system/science and aggregates. System
            is not just method, but the “unity of the manifold cognitions under one idea,” within a
            whole in which “the position of the parts with respect to each other is determined
              <foreign>a priori</foreign>.” Kant’s image for this whole from which parts cannot be
            “contingent[ly]” added or subtracted is the body, a figure to which we will return
            (691). But suffice it to say that Kant’s notion of the body is essentially aesthetic,
            where aesthetics, in Baumgarten’s terms, is “ars pulchre cogitandi,” the art of thinking
            beautifully (#533). This is to say that Kant’s notion of system differs from Hegel’s in
            being purely spatial, diagrammatic. As such it is a “schema” (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691), and in the schematic mode, as Schelling says, the universal has
            not been unified with the particular; the schema is only a “rule” governing production
              (<title level="m">Philosophy of Art</title> 46-7). Kant’s spatial, synchronic
            conception of the body, and the fact that he operates within Baumgarten’s idea of
            “aesthetics as “the analogy of reason” and a supplement to logic, results in a smooth
            system, securely –even if only from a transcendental perspective– under the governance
            of philosophy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Unlike Husserl, who continues the
              German Idealist tradition of separating transcendental from empirical (or eidetic from
              factual) sciences, Kant is not driven by a passion to eradicate the “natural
              standpoint.” It simply does not fall within his domain, and when he deals with
              empirical matters such as universal history or perpetual peace, his concern is how to
              use the critical apparatus so as to think about these domains.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The terms smooth and tangled are Bruno Latour’s version of Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s
            closed vs. open systems, which I extend here to the architecture of knowledge. Objects
            that we <emph>understand</emph> smoothly have defined boundaries: we grasp them
            separately, and changes in them are accidents that do not affect their substance.
            Tangled objects are affected by neighbouring objects and unwork, destabilize and rework
            knowledge (Latour 20-3). While Kant’s work was not restricted to philosophy – he also
            lectured on anthropology and geography – he always begins by mapping the space of
            knowledge and delimiting the place of a field within it. Within a larger architectonic
            that Kant (unlike his successors) did not presume to construct, “the position of the
            parts” or individual disciplines “with respect to each other” is “determined <foreign>a
              priori</foreign>” by philosophy (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691). More
            specifically, “every science [has] its determinate position in the encyclopedia of the
            sciences” and if “it is a philosophical science, then we must assign it its position in
            either its theoretical or its practical part” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 285).
            As Kant zooms in to a particular zone of the map, the smoothness of this distinction is
            maintained, and the margins of philosophy are given their <foreign>a priori</foreign>
            location. So for instance, in the lectures on <title level="m">Physical
              Geography</title>, Kant first evokes the larger map, and divides knowledge into the
            rational and empirical. And he then divides the latter into knowledge of the internal or
            the soul and knowledge of the external, the second being subdivided into knowledge of
            man or the world and knowledge of nature. The former is anthropology and is pragmatic
            rather than speculative, and the latter is physical geography (445-6).</p>
                  <p> Following this rational/empirical division, Kant is also careful to delimit philosophy
            and not to hybridize it, even though the reality of his circumstances was that he had to
            teach outside philosophy, which had not yet institutionally become a
              <foreign>Fachwissenschaft</foreign> (or special subject). Thus even in the
            pre-Critical phase, his lectures on the Encyclopedia which he gave ten times between
            1767 and 1782, really deal only with the encyclopedia of philosophy, and unlike Hegel’s
              <title level="m">History of Philosophy</title>, which entangles philosophy with its
            history, they do so from a purely transcendental perspective.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Zammito (286-92) on the course entitled “Encyclopedia of
              Philosophy as a Whole with an abridged History of Philosophy Based on Feder’s Sketch.”
              Zammito speculates that there was more of this course than survives in printed form,
              and mentions that the Encyclopedia lectures were bound (by a buyer) with those on
              physical geography and physics (287). He thus argues for a closer connection of this
              course to the work of the <title level="m">Popularphilosoph</title> Johann Feder than
              seems warranted by the <title level="m">Enzyklopädievorlesung</title> published by
              Gerhard Lehmann, and this in turn is because he follows a division between the
              pre-Critical and Critical Kant, and sees the former, prior to the break with Herder,
              as still allied with “anthropology.” But as noted by Louden (434), Kant was required
              to use a textbook for his courses and generally paid little attention to his chosen
              text. Feder probably played this role in the Encyclopedia course, while Kant’s own
              contribution to the course is the <title level="m">Enzyklopädievorlesung</title>
              printed by Lehmann. In other words, while Kant may have been aware that one could
              think of the “encyclopedia” in a broader (mixed empirical and transcendental) sense,
              his own treatment of areas other than philosophy such as Anthropology and Physical
              Geography was consistent with the architectonic mapped out in the first <title level="m">Critique</title>, which rigorously separates the “rational” from the
              “empirical” parts of disciplines.</note> Kant begins by distinguishing historical
            sciences, which are forms of learnedness, from rational sciences which are sciences of
            insight, and he then subdivides the latter into philosophy as a discursive science and
            mathematics as a science of construction. As an encyclopedia in the sense of a digest or
            “kurzer Auszug” of philosophy (<title level="m">Vorlesung</title> 31-2), the lectures
            then sketch the principles of what would become Kant’s critical philosophy. In other
            words Kant’s sense of system, whether it is the total system of knowledge or the system
            of an individual part, is of a structure laid out in a “striated” or divisible space,
            and then partitioned according to an <foreign>a priori</foreign> logic. He therefore
            conceives the totality of knowledge as a smooth rather than tangled system, in which the
            parts may be thought through analogy but are always kept firmly separate and do not
            bleed into one another. For Kant there are no mixtures or “intersciences,” as Derrida
            calls them, and no new forms of thought that emerge in the interstices between existing
            fields. As he says quite definitely, “no science can belong to the transition” from one
            domain to the other “since that signifies only the articulation or organization of the
            system and not a place within it” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 285).</p>
                  <p> In his early lectures on <title level="m">University Studies</title>, Schelling also
            uses the figure of the body to think the system of knowledge synchronically, but with a
            crucial difference. Drawing on a Spinozist vocabulary of emanations from or modes of a
            single substance, Schelling describes how all knowledge, “flow[s] from a single centre”:
            “Those sciences which reflect primordial knowledge most directly ... are ... the
            sensorium of the organic body of knowledge. We must start from the central organs and
            trace the life that flows from them through various channels to the outermost parts”
            (42). But as mystical as this articulation of the body is, and as close as it remains to
            what Deleuze calls the “organism” as distinct from the decentralized “body without
            organs” (44-8), Schelling does not conceive the body architectonically as a striated
            space, but rather in terms of flows. We will return to this metaphor of “fluidity” in
            both Schelling and Hegel. Suffice it to say that Schelling conceives the space of
            knowledge as “smooth” in Deleuze and Guattari’s very particular sense of that term,
            which is virtually the opposite of Latour’s. Both usages valorize open over closed
            systems. But while Latour defines smooth objects as bounded and divided off, Deleuze and
            Guattari oppose an open space that they call “smooth” to a more conventional “striated”
            space, which is divisible, segmented and thus bounded (<title level="m">Thousand
              Plateaus</title> 361-2). Schelling, we could say, wants to have both kinds of
            smoothness. He wants a system that is open and not inorganically divided up. And yet he
            also wants one that is smooth in the sense of being a totality, which is impossible, as
            is evident when he writes about the world of nature, whose tangled systems
            transferentially affect the way system itself is conceived.</p>
                  <p> For purposes of this paper, I will not take up Schelling except as a dialogical gloss
            on Hegel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> But for further discussion of Schelling see
              my articles “First Outline of a System of Theory” and “The Abyss of the Past.”</note>
            For even during the period that saw the publication of his most idealistic work,
            including <title level="m">On University Studies</title> (1803) and The Philosophy of
            Art (1803/4), Schelling already recognized system as perspectival, constructing several
            systems: a <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title> (1800), but on the
            other hand numerous systems of nature. Indeed the experimentalism of these systems can
            be seen in the fact that Schelling uses, almost interchangeably, the words “system,”
            “first outline [<title level="m">Entwurf</title>]” “ideas for” and “introduction” to a
            philosophy of nature, which he may or may not be able to bring into identity with
            transcendental philosophy so as to create a system of the whole. This <title level="m">Naturphilosophie</title>, in turn, is sometimes focalized through physics and
            chemistry, as in <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature </title>(1797/1803).
            But sometimes it is focused through the life sciences, with physics and chemistry being
            part of the life sciences rather than the hard sciences, as in <title level="m">First
              Outline for a System of the Philosophy of Nature</title> (1799), which itself is nit
            one but several “systems.” Even from the beginning, then, and despite the smooth system
            he articulates in <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, Schelling’s practice
            is always mobilized by what he calls “asystasy.” As he later says in “On the Nature of
            Philosophy as Science” (1821), “the idea of finding a system of human knowledge, or ...
            of contemplating human knowledge within a system, within a form of coexistence,
            presupposes, of course, that originally and of itself it does not exist in a system,
            hence that it is an ... [<emph>asystaton</emph>], ... something that is in inner
            conflict” (210).</p>
                  <p> Leaving aside Schelling, then, I focus on Hegel, who wants to construct a
            comprehensive, complexly articulated architecture of knowledge rather than a “rhapsody”
            (Kant, <title level="m">Reason </title>691). According to Karl Rosenkranz, during the
            early Jena years when many of the elements of the encylopedia were introduced and when
            Schelling (or one side of him) was still committed to the Identity Philosophy, Schelling
            worked out the critical foundations of absolute philosophy in synchronic fashion, while
            Hegel set to work developing it as a “cycle of sciences” (qtd. by Vater 82). Yet the
            cycle is not necessarily the circle, and Hegel’s multiple, supplementary figures for his
            system compromise its smooth ambitions by entangling the architectonic within the
            temporal and the body within its organic complexities. This paper will explore three
            such figures: the line, the circle, and the body. Together they bring Hegel closer to,
            and yet mark his difference from, another idea of the encyclopedia which forms part of
            the contemporary context of Hegel’s project, but is at the opposite extreme from Kant’s
            architectonic: Novalis’ “encyclopedistics.” </p>
                  <p> In Novalis’ <title level="m">Notes for a Romantic Encyclopedia</title> (1798), which
            despite its organization in fragments has its own systematic principles, the units of
            the system are also emergent disciplines and fields. But the relations of parts and
            whole are tangled and rhizomatic, not hierarchical and smooth. The whole cannot
            determine the part as in architectonic; but unlike in an aggregative system, the part
            does not remain finite and in its own sphere, as it possesses generative consequences
            for the whole of knowledge. “Application of the system to the parts,” Novalis writes,
            “and the parts to the <emph>system</emph> and the parts to the parts” (#460).</p>
                  <p> For Novalis, then, the Encyclopedia is not an organization of knowledge but an
              <emph>asystaton</emph> that is a thought-environment for mixtures. Mixtures were
            anathema to Kant, who felt that each science should be placed in “a special system so
            that it constitutes a science of its own kind, in order to guard against the uncertainty
            arising from mixing things together” (<title level="m">Metaphysical Foundations</title>,
            9). Indeed Kant even proposes disentangling troublesome subsystems from the whole so as
            to purify them and then reinsert them into the whole (12-13). But as Walter Moser says,
            “mixture” was one of the key concepts in chemistry at the time, and chemistry occupied a
            privileged position among the early Romantics “as a discourse model that becomes the
            source” of “interdiscursive translation” (16, 6). This translation, in turn, realizes
            the creative, and not simply critical, potential of a tangled system. And what Novalis
            provides is a toolkit for such translation that involves “potentiation” and
            “application” as related procedures in the “encyclopedization of a science” (Novalis
            genuine raising to a higher power, every science can pass over into a higher
            philosophical science” (Novalis #487). It is application, however, that allows for the
            creation of a new science out of an already existing one (Moser 13), for instance
            psychopathology or psychoanalysis out of pathology, as we shall see. The goal of
            encyclopedic education is the “encyclopedization of a science” that occurs when the
            analogical implications of a science or even a “molecule of science” are potentiated so
            that the empirical, instead of being determined by the transcendental, retroacts upon it
            (Novalis #161, #489). The key here is analogy as a constitutive and not just the
            regulative procedure it is in Kant. “A science becomes applied,” according to Novalis,
            “if it serves as the analogous model and stimulus” for the development of another
            science, a process that is reciprocal, because it is also “the self-(post) development”
            of this other science (#487). To be sure, mixtures were not the goal from which Hegel
            started. But his system, unfolding philosophy through a series of histories and
            attempting to wrest the transcendental from the empirical, is nothing if not mixed.</p>

                  <head>Circles Within Circles</head>
                  <p> Let us turn, then, to Hegel’s figures for system. The most prominent is the circle,
            which goes back to the root meaning of <foreign>enkyklos paideia</foreign>, and which he
            defines through its radii “as that which takes account of the difference within it and
            so reaches a complete determinateness” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 33). One might
            think of the circle as a smooth structure. Yet this is no ordinary circle. The
            philosophical encyclopedia consists of parts, each of which “is a circle of totality
            containing itself within itself, “ though the “philosophical idea is also within each
            particular determinacy or element. ” “The circle of Nature” is thus only one circle in
            Philosophy. The whole is then “a circle of circles” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 51; <title level="m">Nature</title> 2): an immensely complicated
            structure like Milton’s cosmos: “Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb” (<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> VIII.84).</p>
                  <p> The image of circles within circles differs from the smoother image of the building or
            group of buildings that Kant, despite conceiving the whole as a “body” (<title level="m">Reason</title> 691), also uses for knowledge. For Kant “every science is of itself a
            system” and though we may move from one building to another each is a “freestanding
            building” (<title level="m">Judgment</title> 252-3). Hegel’s figure, by contrast, has
            several hazards. First, while the circle is a figure of self-enclosure and containment,
            he sees <emph>as a breach</emph> the proceeding of one circle into another, which in
            more modern terms is the process of mediation or “the adapting ... of findings from one
            level to another” (Jameson 39-40). Hegel writes: “The individual circle thus ruptures
            itself because it is in itself a totality, it breaks through the limits of its own
            elements and establishes another sphere” (<title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> 51).
            Although the circle of circles is meant to contain multiplicity in unity, what Hegel
            describes here is an exceeding of containment. To be sure, this is in one sense the
            famous procedure of <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> or sublation. Hegel annotates this
            process further, when he says that sciences which are <emph>not</emph> positive
            “recognize their concepts as finite,” thus undergoing “a transition into a higher
            sphere” (54). A rupture, however, is also an infraction, a breaking of one circle into
            another, or rather of both into each other. Elsewhere I have described one such instance
            of mediation in the last section of the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature,</title>
            where Hegel projects his own three-part dialectic onto the physiological schema of
            sensibility, irritability and reproduction that was common at the time (Rajan
            “(In)Digestible Material”). Reading physiological processes in philosophical language,
            Hegel produces a psychosomatics of Spirit that is both a psychoanalysis in embryo and
            one of the new disciplines that Novalis was fond of imagining: “pathological philosophy”
              (#638).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As always, Novalis provides little
              elaboration, but pathological philosophy seems to be a philosophy open to failure: “An
              absolute drive for perfection and completeness is morbid, as soon as it shows itself
              to be destructive and adverse to what is <emph>imperfect</emph>, and
              incomplete.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> As this example indicates, there is no guarantee that the breaking of the circle, the
            transition from one domain to another that Kant sees as incidental, is a transition into
            a <emph>higher</emph> sphere. The emergence of psychoanalysis from philosophy’s bringing
            of “Idealism” into the science of medicine is a transformative breaking of the circles
            of both empirical medicine and philosophy itself. It occurs precisely through
            potentiation: the elevation of physiology and medicine from empirical into philosophical
            sciences. And it also occurs through analogy: the analogical application of philosophy
            to physiology, which produces a new science through what Novalis calls
            “encyclopedization.” But this transition of one sphere into another establishes
            “another” and not a “higher” sphere. Indeed, rather than following an <foreign>a
              priori</foreign> logic, there is something of the accidental about it. And moreover it
            moves in more than one direction, inasmuch as physiology can also be analogically
            applied to philosophy to produce pathological philosophy, resulting in “the self-(post)
            development” of philosophy (Novalis #487). No doubt this is not exactly an accident
            Hegel wanted. Hence he must, so to speak, burn his work, so that “like the phoenix”
            Nature can “come forth from this externality rejuvenated as Spirit” and “reconcile
            itself with itself” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 444). But then Hegel also embraces
            such accidents, which are built into his seeing “substance as subject” and therefore,
            crucially, as “negativity.”As he writes in the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>:
            “The circle that remains self-enclosed and, like substance, holds its moments together,
            is an immediate relationship, one therefore which has nothing astonishing about it. But
            that an accident as such, detached from what circumscribes it, ... should attain an
            existence of its own and a separate freedom –this is the tremendous power of the
            negative” (10, 18-19).</p>
                  <p> Related to the “proceeding” of one circle into another is a further problem, which is
            the entanglement of micro and macrosystems. Where material encyclopedias move from the
            bottom up, trying to fit individual systems into a system of the whole which never
            really overcomes the empiricism of aggregation, Idealism starts deductively with a whole
            into which the parts are supposedly fitted. Nevertheless, Hegel includes many of the
            minute details we might expect to find in material encyclopedias: discussions of
            meteors, limestone, lizards, and experiments in natural philosophy that show his
            familiarity with British journals of the time. The sheer complexity of Hegel’s system
            results in a disseminative multiplication of the parts within the whole.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Arkady Plotnitsky also takes up this complexity in terms
              of Deleuze’s concept of the baroque: a “defining feature of the Baroque is the
              multiplicity of varying and curved –convex and concave– mirrors .... Baroque houses
              are full of mirrors and seem to need mirrors more than windows” (Plotnitsky 120). But
              while also reading Hegel against the grain and emphasizing the complexity of the folds
              within what he calls his “superfold” (121), Plotnitsky sees the totality of Hegel’s
              work as a “divergent harmony” (132) in which the “upward movement of Spirit and
              humanity,” albeit in “diagonal” form (127), is not jeopardized.</note> Moreover,
            circles become “spheres,” a word that Hegel uses to describe both concepts like
            existence and negativity and fields of knowledge such as physics and mechanics. Spheres
            are not quite circles: whereas the circle is a two-dimensional schema, the sphere has a
            volume and “mass” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 79), which Hegel must struggle to
            keep under control. Thus as M.J. Petry explains, the “spheres” are supposed to be
            “levels” in a “hierarchy” which is like the Chain of Being (21-39). The “sphere of
            physics” is part of the “sphere of Nature” (Hegel, <title level="m">Nature</title> 26,
            23), and “each sphere ... complete[s] itself by passing into another higher one” (21), a
            logic Hegel evokes in the “transition” from Nature to Spirit at the end of the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> (445). But this logic of subsumption can
            equally be one of complication, in which the levels risk becoming spheres in their own
            right. For as Schelling says, using the same term as Hegel, within each “determinate
            sphere of formation” “other spheres are again formed, and in these spheres others”
              (<title level="m">First Outline</title> 43-4). The result is intimated by Goethe, when
            he says that sciences “destroy themselves in two ways: by the breadth they reach and by
            the depth they plumb” (305).</p>
                  <p> The logic is that of Leibniz’ <title level="m">Monadology</title>, adapted by
            Schelling in <title level="m">The First Outline</title> into a “dynamic atomism” (21)
            that doubles as a physics of knowledge. For Leibniz the monad is both a simple unity and
            is infinitely subdivisible into further monads. Kant resolved this paradox by arguing
            that monads are not to be conceived as physically filling a space but rather as spheres
            or “orbits of activity”: it is thus not the actual substance of the monad but its sphere
            of activity that is infinitely divided (<title level="m">Physical Monadology</title>
              53-7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a helpful discussion of this issue, see
              Michael Friedman, <title level="m">Introduction</title> to <title level="m">Kant’s
                Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</title>, vii-x.</note> Ideally for Hegel
            these multiple monads or spheres will be unified by the fiction of their
            “pre-established harmony”; thus for Leibniz individual monads, though self-contained,
            are all supposedly comprehended in the supreme Monad which is God (or absolute
            knowledge). But inversely, as Schelling recognizes, these monads, which externally
            appear as simple unities, are infinitely subdivisible into further and further monads,
            each with its own life (Leibniz 261, 266, 268).</p>
                  <p> Thus even as Hegel’s macrosystems (of nature, art etc.) are compounded into ever
            larger unities, they are also infinitely particularized into microsystems with their own
            logic and so are complexly self-differing. In this way the sphere of “Organics” in the
              <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> is subdivided into the geological,
            vegetable and animal organisms, which can be placed in a hierarchy, but between which
            there are also rhizomatic connections. The animal organism is studied in terms of the
            sphere of physiology, which contains the sphere of pathology, which is inapplicable to
            the geological organism and unique to the animal (429). British Idealism is in many ways
            less tangled than its German parent, and thinkers such as Erasmus Darwin, John
            Abernethy, Joseph Henry Green, and (less successfully) Coleridge, contained pathology
            within physiology as a negative illustration of the laws of normal life, with the
            understanding that these laws could be better understood through deviations from them.
            But while this may also be Hegel’s aim, Hegel never returns from the pathological to the
            normal, as <title level="m">The Philosophy of Nature</title> ends with a section
            entitled “The Disease of the Individual” that derails the intended transition from
            Nature to Spirit. This last section becomes an accident detached from what circumscribes
            it, but one that affects the substance of Hegel’s thought precisely because that
            substance is actualized through a subject. The problem confronting Hegel is not unlike
            the dis-integration of the macro- by the micropedia in the work of his materialist
            rivals. But it has this difference, that the connections or disconnections that remain
            external in material encyclopedias are internalized as part of self-consciousness in
            encyclopedics, or perhaps, internalized as part of the text’s unconscious.</p>

                  <head>The Endangered Line</head>
                  <p> This brings us to the next problem, the entanglement of the of the circle and line.
            The encyclopedia is not just a spatial curriculum that one traverses from the outside,
            but a process of <title level="m">Bildung</title> or inner development. It is a “path”
            the “<emph>length</emph>” of which “has to be endured,” since knowledge is “a necessary
            and complete process of becoming” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 17, 20). Hegel
            criticized Schelling for being insufficiently dialectical (<title level="m">History of
              Philosophy</title> III. 334, 341-3), and by dialectic he did not simply mean a form of
            argumentation but a profoundly temporal experience: a process of remembering and working
            through, of engaging the ideal with the real, and a transposition of the philosophical
            into the historical. Unlike the Schelling of <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of
              Nature</title> (1797/1803), <title level="m">System of Transcendental Idealism</title>
            (1800), <title level="m">Bruno</title> (1802), and <title level="m">On University
              Studies</title>, (1803), Hegel could not conceive of the eternal and temporal or the
            ideal and real as synchronic, in the manner of Blake’s fourfold vision.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title level="m">Ideas for a Philosophy of
                Nature</title> (1797/1803) Schelling writes: “In Nature, therefore, the whole
              absolute is knowable, although appearing Nature produces only successively, and in
              (for us) endless development, what in true Nature exists all at once and in an eternal
              fashion” (272).</note> Thus to a degree Hegel’s distinction between the sciences of
            nature and spirit corresponds to Schelling’s distinction between the real (or life)
            sciences and the ideal sciences such as philosophy, mathematics, and religion (<title level="m">University Studies</title> 103-4). But for Hegel, as for the post-Jena
            Schelling of the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay (1809), the emergence of freedom
            from necessity must be earned through the struggle of nature to become spirit, which
            occurs along a “path,” “road” or temporal line.</p>
                  <p> This struggle is not only thematized through what Findlay calls the “dialectical
              <emph>journey</emph>” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 528); it also provides
            the structure for Hegel’s organization of knowledge. For if the eighteenth century sees
            a “temporalizing of the Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 242-3, 271-80), Hegel also temporalizes
            the cycle of disciplines along this evolutionary Chain of Being.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We should bear in mind that for Hegel evolution, as the emergence of
              one natural form from another, is not an actual series of events but a series of
              “ideal” relationships (<title level="m">Nature</title> 20-1)</note> Thus the third
            section of the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> takes in geology,
            meteorology, botany, physiology and medicine, among others. These sciences are part of
            the broader system of “Organics,” which is preceded by mechanics and physics. The three
            together comprise the sphere of Nature, which is a sphere in a scale of disciplines that
            parallels the Chain of Being, since their subject-matter proceeds from the inorganic to
            the organic, and from lower to higher organizations along this chain. The <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, in turn, is a level that is surpassed by the
            sciences of Spirit. Altogether the cycle of learning in which consciousness learns how
            to become Spirit unfolds as an ascent from matter to Spirit, or necessity to freedom,
            through the progression from the real to the ideal sciences. Indeed “Nature” herself
            learns to be Spirit by proceeding through the phenomena, from molluscs to animals, that
            are the objects of the various sciences. Here Hegel is totally unlike the Schelling of
            the lectures <title level="m">On University Studies</title>, whose arrangement of
            chapters on disciplines is random rather than following a thematic progression anchored
            in the development of a subject.</p>
                  <p> Not that there are no other systems which thematize a progressing ‘line’ of knowledge,
            for instance that projected by Coleridge, consisting of Logic, Natural [Philosophy] and
            Theology" (<title level="m">Notebooks</title> #5417). Indeed, working to put the
            ever-troublesome life sciences in their <foreign>a priori</foreign> place within this
            architectonic of knowledge, his friend and executor Joseph Henry Green more clearly
            executes Coleridge’s project of absorbing physiological into political “constitution,”
            or Nature into Spirit, by following <title level="m">Vital Dynamics</title> (1840) with
              <title level="m">Mental Dynamics or Groundwork of a Professional Education</title>
            (1847) and then <title level="m">Spiritual Philosophy</title> (1865), as a means to the
              <title level="m">Bildung</title> of Coleridge’s “clerisy.” Green, though more immersed
            in Schelling, had read some Hegel and studied with Solger in Berlin in 1817, the year
            Solger helped to bring Hegel to the University of Berlin. Nevertheless it is only Hegel
            who traverses this “road” as a “pathway of <emph>doubt</emph>” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 49), in which the sciences are not analytic systems but
            phenomenological expressions of what, in an almost fantastical prosopopeia, he calls
            “Nature’s” struggle to become Spirit. Thus, even if against their grain, the sciences
            form what Novalis calls a “pathological philosophy” in which each science is profoundly
            lacking, and must “shatter” the “inadequate form” of its “circle,” only to expose its
            own inadequacy (<title level="m">Nature</title> 443).</p>
                  <p> So as Nature, in Hegel’s personification or self-projection, struggles for
            self-consciousness, consciousness too is exposed to its human nature in the shapes or
              <foreign>Gestaltungen</foreign> (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 9) that it
            gives itself in its sciences. Hence the line that Hegel wants to organize smoothly
            within the synthetic paradigm of the dialectic is beset by accidents that disclose the
            “tremendous power of the negative.” Indeed this “road,” which he calls an “inwardizing
              [<foreign>Er-Innerung</foreign>] and Calvary” of Spirit (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 51, 493), is littered with such accidents, which Hegel, after
            “tarrying” with the “negative” (19), tries unconvincingly to elide through various
            figural somersaults. For instance as the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
            disastrously concludes with <title level="a">The Disease of the Individual,</title>
            Hegel claims that the “goal of Nature,” mired as it is in “an ever-increasing wealth of
            detail,” is to “destroy itself ... to consume itself like the phoenix in order to come
            forth from this externality rejuvenated as spirit” (444). Similarly at the end of the
              <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, almost all of which is about how this discipline
            of thinking beautifully falls afoul of the actual history of art, Hegel famously
            proclaims the end of art. The circle is likewise one of these figures that tries to
            perform what the Idea and the Concept cannot do. The circle is “the line returning into
            itself” and the “paralysis” of the dimensions of time such that present, past and future
            are “closed together in a unity,” their distinctions “sublated” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 43-4). It is “the path of a <emph>purely uniform</emph> motion” (70).
            In the closure of the circle the point “has been already at the place it is reaching”
            (43-4); the “end” is already in the “beginning” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title>
            10).</p>
                  <p> Yet this closure of the circle is a form of damage control exerted on the line, path,
            or journey. For the line figures a form of experience in which the immanent unfolding of
            the “Idea” in time and history risks removing the transcendental guarantees that exist
            in the early Schelling’s synchronicity of the eternal and temporal, or “true” and
            “appearing Nature” (<title level="m">Ideas</title> 272). Hence Hegel finds the circle
            limited as well as complete, referring to each circular totalization as an “inadequate
            form” and suggesting that there is something simplistic in the circle that “holds its
            moments together” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 443; <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 18-19). This is to say that if Hegel needs to repair the line
            with the circle, he conversely needs the line to supply the dialectic, or as Schelling
            will later call it “realism,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay Schelling writes: “Idealism, if it does not have as its basis
              a living realism, becomes just as empty and abstract a system as that of Leibniz,
              Spinoza, or any other dogmatist.... Idealism is the soul of philosophy; realism is the
              body; only both together can constitute a living whole” (26). In <title level="m">Ages
                of the World</title> he writes, “Whoever does not acknowledge the priority of
              Realism wants evolution without the involution that preceded it. ... The greatest
              glory of development is not expected from what easily unfolds. It is expected from
              what has been excluded and which only decides to unfold with opposition (107).</note>
            that is lacking in what Hegel critiques as Absolute Idealism. In the Preface to the
              <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>, which famously caused the rift with Schelling,
            though it also formatively changed Schelling’s work, Hegel calls Absolute Idealism “the
            night in which all cows are black” (9). He describes it as a “monochromatic formalism”
            that ignores “the living Substance” as a “self-originating, self-differentiating wealth
            of shapes” and “begins straight away with absolute knowledge” (9-10, 16). The “long way”
            that Spirit must “travel,” the line as opposed to the circle, figures the process of
            remembering and working through that is the labour of the negative (10, 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Erinnerung</title> or remembering, occasionally spelled as <title level="m">Er-Innerung</title> or inwardizing, is a word used throughout the <title level="m">henomenology</title>. The English translation of “knowledge” as having to
              “travel a long way and work its passage” (15) loses the proto-Freudian force of the
              original: “Um zum eigentlichen Wissen zu werden ... hat er durch einen langen Weg sich
              hindurchzuarbeiten” (<title level="m">Phänomenologie</title> 28).</note> The circle is
            nothing without the line, which undoes the circle.</p>

                  <head>The Nervous Body</head>
                  <p> Let us turn now to our final figure, the body which, like the circle, projects a
            system that holds its moments together. Thus in the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> Hegel writes that Spirit “articulates its body into a variety
            of functions, and allots one particular part for only one function” (197). In the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> he echoes Kant’s contrast between knowledge
            that is “heaped together” and knowledge as an “articulated” whole which, like the
            “animal body,” grows “internally” and not “externally” by “contingent addition” (Kant,
              <title level="m">Reason</title> 591). In the same vein of an external and aggregated
            vs. internal and integrated growth, Hegel too argues that plants grow only in size, but
            when the animal increases in size it “remains one shape” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 304).</p>
                  <p> Like Kant, then, Hegel wants to conceive the body as a whole that keeps parts in their
            place. Thus implicitly he aligns material encyclopedias with the aggregative structure
            of the vegetable body, while his own philosophical encyclopedia is like the animal body
            that grows internally and retains “one shape.” But does not such a unification become
            coercive when it is extended to the body politic or the body of knowledge? And indeed
            can Hegel uphold his analogy? For Kant’s body, as we have seen, is aesthetic or at best
            anatomical, where anatomy maps the volume of organs on a flat surface. But Hegel is
            sensitive to the difference between structure and process. Describing the “ordinary view
            of anatomy” as “the knowledge of the parts of the body regarded as inanimate,” Hegel
            writes in his “Preface: On Scientific Cognition” that in anatomy we “do not as yet
            possess the subject-matter itself,” since we do not know “the particulars” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 1). He later adds that in such a system, “the organism
            is apprehended from the abstract aspect of a dead existence; its moments so taken
            pertain to anatomy and the corpse, not to cognition and the living organism.” “The
            moments have really ceased <emph>to be</emph> for they cease to be processes.” It is
            only within these processes, within their transitions (to pick up the word Kant
            dismisses), that “anatomical parts,” or by analogy disciplines, “have a meaning,” since
            only then can “what is forcibly detached and fixed as an individual system” be returned
            to being a “fluid moment” (166).</p>
                  <p> Moreover, unlike Kant, Hegel also writes at length on the real body in the last major
            division of his <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> on “Organics.” And it is
            the physiological and not the anatomical body that he treats, breaking the circle in
            which the earlier Schelling had closed off the dangers of physiology by synchronizing it
            with anatomy (<title level="m">University Studies</title> 141). As we have seen, for
            Hegel the animal body (which includes the human) is distinguished from the plant in
            terms of the unity of the animal as an “organism” vs. the structure of the plant as an
            “aggregate” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 394). Plants grow only in size, whereas
            when the animal increases in size it “remains one shape” (304). Correspondingly plants
            “fall apart” into “a number of individuals, the whole plant being rather the basis
              (<title level="m">Boden</title>) for these individuals than a subjective unity of
            members” (303). The plant “is thus impotent to hold its members in its power” and indeed
            does not have “true members [<title level="m">Gliedern</title>]” (276); or as Hegel says
            elsewhere “every branch is a new plant and not at all ... just a single member” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.137). By contrast, in the animal organism members are
            subordinate to the whole, even as the whole “is articulated into parts that are
              <emph>separate and distinct</emph>,” so that “each member is reciprocally end and
            means” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 303, 377). Yet as a “totality of articulated
            members” (377) that respects differences the animal body is beset by problems, the first
            of which is its multiple, overlapping systems: “three” systems, like the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> itself, or as Hegel admits, “a good many more” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 359; <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 166). While the
            body “contain[s]” these systems, their very unification “produce[s] a general, concrete
            interpenetration” of systems by “one another,” so that a particular system is not
            confined to its place “but permeates all the other systems of the organism” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 372; <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 162). The
            relation of parts to the whole here is dangerously close to Novalis’ application of the
            parts to the whole. This is to say that unity itself may be something of a
              <foreign>pharmakon</foreign>, if we allow one system, for instance physiology, to
            affect another, such as the body politic, which is also discussed in terms of the
            biopolitical language of “members.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the <title level="m"> Philosophy of Right</title>, “members” are consistently opposed to
              “self-sufficient individuals” or "parts" (64, 199-200, 264, 328; cf. also 315 which
              specifically evokes the animal organism). Members are separate but in the end
              subordinate to a whole.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Indeed Schelling emphasizes precisely such “accidents”that occur through integration
            in a body, when he uses the body as a figure for complex systems. Schelling writes that
            the body contains multiple systems (“digestive etc.”), and favourably contrasts this
            tangled body to Kant’s use of geometry as a model for philosophy: “It is as though one
            preferred a stereometrically regular crystal to the human body for the reason that the
            former has no possibility of falling ill, while the latter hosts germs of every possible
            illness” ( “On the Nature of Philosophy” 212-13). Working out of the same speculative
            image cluster in which “a system or organ” establishing itself in “isolation” is
            condemned as disease (Hegel, <title level="m">Nature</title> 428), Schelling had already
            attributed a positive value to disease in the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay
            (1809): “An individual body part [<title level="m">Glied</title>], like the eye, is only
            possible within the whole of an organism; nonetheless, it has its own life for itself,
            indeed, its own kind of freedom, which it obviously proves through the disease of which
            it is capable” (18). But if it is Schelling who ambivalently valorizes this separateness
            as freedom, it is Hegel who allows, through his concept of “fluidity,” for the obstinacy
            of the part to have consequences for the whole.</p>
                  <p> While there is no space here for an extensive reading of the section on the “Animal
            Organism,” suffice it to say that just as Schelling’s dynamic atomism doubles as a
            physics of knowledge, so too Hegel’s discussions of the body double as a physiology, or
            indeed pathography, of the “full body of articulated cognition” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 9).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The “body” of cognition
              is the metaphor of Hegel’s translator A.V.Miller, but is in the spirit of Hegel, who
              does begin his Preface by using anatomy to think about the nature of knowledge. Green
              Musselman uses the term “pathography” to describe “autobiographical memoirs written by
              modern-day physicians who suffer an illness” (6).</note> This is all the more so given
            the use of the word “systems” throughout the section on the body, and given that the
            same words and concepts are often used both in the epistemic and physiological
            registers. Thus the aggregate and the organism describe plants vs. animals but also the
            form that Hegel wants a science to take: it “must present itself as an organism” rather
            than being “a simple aggregate” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 6). Indeed, it is
            because of his investment in organic, inward knowledge with deep rather than surface,
            metamorphic connections that Hegel thinks poorly of plants. In a similar mirroring of
            the literal and metaphorical, Hegel concludes the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>
            by saying that through its long journey the Self has “to penetrate and digest
              (<foreign>verdauen</foreign>) the entire wealth of its substance” (492). In the
            section on the organism in the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> he then has
            an extensive account of digestion that is overdetermined by psycho-philosophical
            concerns that make it impossible not to apply his physiology to his philosophy. In short
            the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, this “weak link in the dialectical
            chain” (Gasché 3), is a <foreign>mise-en-abime</foreign> of the Encyclopedia itself. It
            is, as Hegel says, “the Idea in the form of <emph>otherness</emph>” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 13), and as such generates a number of reflexive figures for the
            functioning of the larger system.</p>
                  <p> This is not to say with Werner Hamacher, who is similarly sensitive to Hegel’s work as
            “writing,” that Hegel’s philosophy, “closed as it is in order to round out the circle of
            the encyclopedic system,” draws “every critique which contests it, every new reading
            which addresses it, back into its own circle” (1). On the contrary Hegel, tarrying as he
            does with the negative, is pushed again and again to break the circle that he wants to
            close, and to expose his auto-encyclopedia of Spirit to its auto-immunity. Auto-immunity
            is Derrida’s word for the tendency of an organism to destroy “its own immunitary
            protections,” which he sees as a kind of vitality (<title level="m">Rogues</title> 124,
            55). And for Hegel too this auto-immunity is precisely what characterizes the organism,
            even though he hopes to endure and overcome it: “A stone cannot become diseased,” but
            the “living creature is always exposed to danger, always bears within itself an other,
            but can endure this contradiction, which the inorganic cannot” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 429, 274). Or as he also says, noting the specific character of an
            organism as an inside facing an outside, a “wound ... only becomes dangerous through
            exposure to air. Organic life alone is characterized by its perpetual self-restoration
            in the process of its destruction” (109).</p>
                  <p> As a mirror within the Encyclopedia, the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>
            generates a number of figures that react on the larger system. Let me briefly touch on
            three in the section on the animal body: digestion, disease and fluidity. First,
            digestion or “assimilation” (381): the “adaptation of the non-organic to the purposes of
            the living creature” (381), which Hegel also calls “mediation” (402). We often extend
            the verbs “digest” and “assimilate” to knowledge. Indeed, repeating his opposition of
            the organism to the non-organic, Hegel produces a peculiarly vexed metaphor for
            knowledge as a struggle with resistant material: “all externality is non-organic; as,
            e.g., for the individual, the sciences are his non-organic nature,” which he has “to
            make his own” (276). Throughout the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title>, which
            Hegel describes as an “alien existence” that is “refractory towards the unity of the
            Notion” (3, 444), we see the pathos and <foreign>agon</foreign> of Hegel’s attempt to
              <emph>organ</emph>ize these sciences within a larger system so as to convert
            “externality” into a “self-like unity” (393). These attempts at
            <emph>organ</emph>ization, at accessing “structure, as alive” (377), are always bound up
            with some kind of pain. Take, for instance, the weirdly catachrestic mediation of
            anatomical into psycho-philosophical language in Hegel’s glossing of a description of
            bones that he borrows from Autenreith’s <title level="m">Handbuch der empirischen
              menschlichen Physiologie</title> (1801): <quote> ‘Bones, simply on account of the
              larger number of their vessels in general possess more vitality’ (in comparison with
              cartilages); ‘and this is evidenced by their susceptibility to inflammation and
              pathological changes ....’ Bone, i.e. the sensibility belonging to shape as such is,
              like the wood of the plant, the simple and therefore dead force which is not yet a
              process, but abstract reflection-into-self. At the same time, however, it is the dead
              force reflected into self. (361)</quote> Or take the neuropathically intense,
            psychoanalytically prescient description of how the “sensibility which has withdrawn
            into itself,” produces a “system not yet separated out,” the sympathetic nervous system.
            “This system forms ganglia [<title level="m">Nervenknoten</title>] which can be regarded
            as little brains in the abdomen.” Here according to Autenreith digestion “is withdrawn
            from our control” into an absent body, a lapse that Hegel glosses as follows: “In the
            sommanbulistic state ...self-consciousness is turned inwards [and] this internal
            vitality passes into the ganglia, and into the brain of this dark independent
            self-consciousness” (364). If the passage on bones is an example of mediation, the
            analysis of the sympathetic nervous system is something else: one of those accidents to
            which Hegel refers, which unsettles his intentions and is part of the “self-(post)
            development” of philosophy, inasmuch as another “sphere” is beginning to be formed
            within physiology, namely psychoanalysis.</p>
                  <p> In contrast to the more thoughtful, recursive term “inwardizing” or
              <foreign>Er-Innerung</foreign>, digestion names an aggressive process of sublating
            these “externalities” or “accidents” that assault Spirit in Hegel’s reading of the
            scientific manuals of his time. Indeed the aggression of philosophy’s attempt to
            organize the “non-organic” material of physiology is evident in Hegel’s account of
            digestion as a process in which the “appetitive organism” is turned “outwards” and
            “provided with weapons” (393). The organism “overcome[s] and digest[s]” “the object or
            the negative” into its “subjectivity,” so as to master its own unwanted
              “<emph>involvement</emph> with the outer world” (395): an aggression that is bound to
            fail, given Hegel’s description of the subject itself as pure negativity, or as he also
            says “<emph>lack</emph>” (385). But what happens when the animal cannot fully digest
            what is external? Elsewhere I have described the complex psycho-metaphorics of
            digestion, in which it is not clear whether “the non-organic ‘potency’” (403) is outside
            or also inside. The animal must digest what is external, but is “repell[ed]” by itself
            because of its “entanglement with the outer thing,” and so must also cast out this
            outside that is inside. The “conclusion of the process of assimilation” is thus
            “excretion,” by which the animal, instead of making the external internal, “makes itself
            external to itself” (404): “Excrement has, therefore, no other significance than this,
            that the organism recognizing its error, gets rid of its entanglement with outside
            things” (405), and thus “rid[s] itself of [its] lack of self-confidence” (403).</p>
                  <p> But as this oddly ethical and psychological language indicates, this outside was never
            fully outside. On the one hand, excretion has to follow digestion in normal assimilation
            and so is a sign that digestive appropriation has succeeded: excrement, we are told,
            “consists mainly of digested matter, or what the organism itself has added to the
            digested material” (405). But on the other hand, excretion also seems a form of
            indigestion, since “even in the healthiest animals” the excrement is not “homogeneous”
            but contains “undecomposed food” (405), which is to say that excrement is a rem(a)inder
            of failed assimilation.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See my article “(In)Digestible
              Material” (226-9). Hegel is not the only Romantic writer obsessed with his digestion,
              Coleridge and de Quincey also being examples.</note> No wonder, then, that in
            digestion “the organism in angrily opposing itself to the outer world is divided within
            itself” (402). Or that digestion proves to be a turning on oneself, as the “organism
            converts its own members into a non-organic nature, ... lives on itself and produces its
            own self,” becoming a “self-like unity” only through a repression in which digestion is,
            in effect, a form of abjection (377, 393). If philosophy is what the organism has added
            to external matter, then the sheer weirdness of the way Hegel catachrestically converts
            matter into the language of Spirit makes philosophy a kind of undigested excrement. The
            result is that the text, whose attempt to heal the wound of nature recalls the genre of
            spiritual autobiography, is more accurately described as a pathography of the
            philosophical spirit.</p>
                  <p> The vexed nature of digestion opens up another sphere in the discussion of the animal
            organism, namely disease, which occurs when one of the body’s “systems or organs ...
            establishes itself in isolation [<foreign>sich fur sich festsetzt</foreign>] and
            persists in its particular activity against the activity of the whole” (428). Disease,
            in other words, is the part’s resistance to being digested by the whole, or the whole’s
            failure to digest its parts. Indeed Hegel goes so far as to describe disease as “an
            indigestibility in general” (433), and the language of toxicity crosses between
            digestion and illness. Digestion, “the <emph>power</emph>” of life “over its non-organic
            object,” is an “infection” (395), a curious word, since it is not clear whether the food
            or the body is being infected. On the other hand, the medicine for disease is an
              “<emph>indigestible</emph> substance” that forces the organism to rally and digest
            what is external to it (434, 436).</p>
                  <p> These ambivalences towards digestion bring Hegel closer than we might expect to
            Schelling, who, as we have seen, confers a value on disease as the freedom of the part
            from the whole (although he too is not without ambivalence). For on the surface Hegel
            does seem more committed than his erstwhile friend to the containment of members in a
            whole, and less inclined to say, as Schelling does, that “disease is a completely
            relative concept” and that what is disease in one organism may be part of another
            organism’s functioning (<title level="m">First Outline</title> 160). But it is
            significant that in his allegorization of the stages through which disease passes Hegel
            translates the physiological term “irritability” into a word with great value in his
            philosophical system: negativity. Combining terms from the physiology of Haller,
            Blumenbach, and Kielmeyer– terms that had preoccupied him from the Jena years and the
              <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> onwards–eHegel postulates three “moments” in
            the normal organism that are also moments in a disease: sensibility, irritability and
            reproduction. In effect, he then maps his three-part dialectic onto these moments.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This schema is discussed in both the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> (160-70) and the <title level="m">Philosophy of
                Nature</title>, but the former does not include a discussion of disease. The
              dialectic and the explicit relation of irritability to negativity come in only in the
              discussion of disease in the latter. </note> In sensibility the organism as
              “<emph>being-within-self</emph>” verges on the passive, on “insensibility” (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 161; <title level="m">Nature</title> 361). Likewise in
            disease, in the phase of sensibility the disease is “<emph>virtually (an sich)</emph>
            present, but without any actual morbidity” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 433). At the
            threshold of sensibility, the organism arrives at a “moment of difference” in the
            “nervous system,” which is “directed outwards and involved in external relationships”
            (361-5). This leads to the next phase, namely irritability, associated with the muscular
            rather than nervous system, where the organism is involved with “difference” and an
            “active maintenance of self” (365, 359). Finally Hegel draws on Blumenbach’s <title level="m">Bildungstrieb</title>, which was influential for Kant’s notion of teleology,
            to theorize his third moment of “reproduction.” In the normal state reproduction simply
            means the organism’s reproduction of its parts or of further organisms, or in an
            interesting variant, the constructive instinct of birds, for instance, building nests
              (<title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 161; <title level="m">Nature </title>407). But
            tellingly, in the pathography of <title level="m">The Philosophy of Nature</title>’s
            last section, the only reproduction that the organism can manage is excrement, as if to
            dis-figure teleology and epigenesis as the organism’s progressive self-organization over
            time. </p>
                  <p> Of particular interest here is the second moment of irritability and the form it takes
            in the section on disease. For irritability as difference can be simply aggressive:
            plants are sensitive, animals irritable. It is in only connection with disease that it
            becomes associated with the more self-scrutinizing language of negativity. Here
            irritability takes on a psychic dimension as the part’s separation of itself from the
            whole: “There is established in the self and in opposition to it as universal, a
            determinateness which makes its own self into a fixed self,” and now the organism,
            concentrated in a part of itself, is “restricted to itself” and “possesses within its
            own self the negative of itself” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 433, 438). The self is
            “turned against its structure” and the “negative thing is the structure itself” (429).
            While this obstinacy of the part is not desirable for Hegel’s architectonic notion of
            the body, it cannot be wholly undesirable, given that the negative (albeit as negativity
            rather than determinate negation) is the motor of Hegel’s system.</p>
                  <p> In short, the separation of the part from the whole is seen as disease, but it is this
            “indigestibility” which seems the condition of possibility for a negativity to which
            Hegel is deeply committed. Schelling’s discussion elsewhere of “indecomposable”
            substances provides an interesting parallel to Hegel’s indigestible material. Working
            out of Kant’s argument that anything which is divisible cannot be “free from
            composition” or utterly “simple” (<title level="m">Physical Monadology</title> 55),
            Schelling distinguishes between “decomposable” substances like soil, and those that are
            “absolute[ly] indecomposable” or “absolute[ly] incomposable.” Perhaps confusingly, he
            insists that the latter are also “absolute[ly] composable”: “Indecomposability and
            absolute composability ... always coexist” (<title level="m">First Outline</title>
            29-31). Schelling’s point is to keep indecomposability as a way for something to resist
            appropriation, to preserve its integrity, while allowing that such dead-ends, which do
            not fit into a system, are also always be composable, capable of being dissolved and
            dissipated in order to be recreated. Hence just as “nature makes the absolutely
            indecomposable substances composable through decomposition, so the absolutely
            indecomposable substances, conversely, are inserted once again into the universal
            circulation of matter through composition” (31). Schelling’s terms, developed as they
            are in the subject-less realm of physics, lack the affect of Hegel’s indigestibility,
            whose environment is the psycho-physiology of the organism. But the point bears on
            Hegel: the indigestible that resists assimilation, causing a dis-ease within the system
            or even an absolute stoppage, can also be decomposed and put back into intellectual
            circulation.</p>
                  <p> One such undigested or uncomposed remnant is the curious passage on the sympathetic
            nervous system as withdrawn into a “somnambulistic state” that conceals a “dark
            independent self-consciousness” (<title level="m">Nature </title>364). Like the bits of
            information in the <title level="m">EB</title>, Hegel’s translation of the ganglia into
            the terms of mesmerism as well as philosophy is neither digested nor cast out from his
            larger system. But from a later perspective we can compose it in another order, where it
            becomes part of “the self-(post) development” of Romantic philosophy as a laboratory for
            psychoanalysis, at that time a “system not yet separated out” from physiology (364).</p>
                  <p> In Novalis’ terms, this encyclopedization of a molecule of knowledge becomes possible
            by “applying” the physiological concept of “fluidity” to knowledge, thus potentializing
            it in the epistemic register. Fluidity is an important concept for both Hegel and
            Schelling. In Schelling’s <title level="m">First Outline</title> the universal fluid is
            the unconditioned (<foreign>Unbedingt</foreign>) that precedes Nature’s composition of
            products or “figures” (26, 27n), which are “bound” forms that must be decomposed or
            unbound in order to be composed again, or taken up “into the universal process of
            organization” (31). For Schelling, as Coleridge recognized in adapting him, this Primary
            Imagination at the level of Nature is the ground and analogue for the workings of the
            Secondary Imagination mediated by mind (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 304). More
            agonistically, Hegel adapts this fluidity to disease, thinking the part-whole
            relationship through his ambivalence about chronic vs. acute illness. For in disease, as
            we have seen, one system isolates itself and establishes itself against the whole, “the
            fluidity and all-pervading process of which is thus obstructed,” whereas in health all
            the body’s “organs are fluid in the universal” (<title level="m">Nature</title>
            428).</p>
                  <p> But the problem, which has ramifications for cognitive as well as physiological
            behaviour, is that this “derange[ment]” of the organism by one of its parts can involve
            either chronic or acute illness. In chronic illness, the disease “remains in one organ,”
            while other functions are “quite unimpaired, ” but in acute illness the entire organism
            is “morbidly affected”(432). And Hegel is uncertain which is less disastrous. On the one
            hand, as long as the disease “is peculiar to” and “confined” within “one particular
            system” such as the philosophy of nature, “it is easier to cure because only one organ
            is irritated or depressed.” “The system has only to be extricated from its entanglement
            with its non-organic nature and kept within bounds” (433), as Hegel tries to do in
            moving on from nature to spirit. On the other hand, chronic disease is also particularly
            associated with obstruction, as in “hardening of the liver” (432). We can understand
            this through Merleau-Ponty’s analysis of pathological behaviour as something “rigid” and
            not “integrated into a coherent and flexible field of meaning” (Wild xv; Merleau-Ponty
            86, 178). Hence when “one system” makes itself “the independent centre of activity...
            the organism too can no longer, as an independent whole, come to itself,” which is to
            say that the disease has not really been isolated in a part. So Hegel also says that
            medicine prefers acute illness, since if the whole organism is affected, “the activity
            of the whole organism too, can be released” (<title level="m">Nature</title> 432). Acute
            illness restores fluidity, facilitating a cure through what is, in effect, a kathartic
            “general, concrete interpenetration” of the systems earlier described (372), but with
            the proviso that until this katharsis happens, the rigidity, not unlike uncomposability,
            also protects what the existing field of meaning is not ready to integrate.</p>
                  <p> It is clear that Hegel himself cannot confine intellectual dis-ease, the restlessness
            of the negative, in one system. The distinction between acute and chronic illness is
            followed by an uncomposed <title level="m">Zusatz</title> “A third form of disease is
            that which originates in the universal subject, especially man. These are <emph>diseases
              of the soul ... </emph>which can even result in death” (432). The point simply sits
            there, in a silent confinement, briefly offered as information rather than knowledge, an
            uncomposed remnant of Hegel’s encyclopedic reading in the scientific literature of his
            time. Yet diseases of the soul return in another system, the Anthropology, which is part
            of the philosophy of Spirit. But conversely, it also seems that neither Hegel nor
            Schelling are quite ready to release the depression of one system into the whole. For
            even the latter’s discussion of disease in the <title level="m">First Outline</title>,
            whose germinal importance Krell has analysed (103-15), lies uncomposed in an appendix,
            and the larger work in which it is released, namely the unpublished 1815 <title level="m">Ages of the World</title>, is not a whole.</p>
                  <p> Stepping back, we see in the tremendous complexity of Hegel’s Encyclopedia what
            Bertalanffy calls an open rather than closed system. For Bertalanffy open systems emerge
            on the threshold between physics and biology. Whereas physics and mathematics model
            closed systems, what he calls “organismic” biology makes possible a system characterized
            by “continuous change, regulation, and apparent teleology,” but constantly thwarted and
            complicated by feedback loops (6, 89-92). But Bertalanffy provides an imperfect parallel
            on two grounds. In the feedback loop information is fed back and recombined till “the
            goal or target is reached,” so that his open systems are still characterized by
            homeostasis or the maintenance of balance (43-6). Second, in Hegel’s and Schelling’s
            turn away from Spinoza, substance is subject. But for Bertalanffy though substance is
            process, it is not subject; the open system in Bertalanffy or Deleuze has a
            subject-less, absolute immanence that is without what Schelling calls “personality”
              (<title level="m">Freedom</title> 33, 75). It is therefore characterized by a certain
            utopianism and abstraction, whereas Hegel’s work suffers through time. Hegel’s
            sympathetic nervous system also provides a model for the circulation of information in
            complex systems; indeed as the symptom of what it describes, the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature</title> is a system that is at once digestive, nervous and
            productive. This is to say that encyclopedics, the struggle of a single subject to
              <emph>organ</emph>ize knowledge, is the labour of the negative, a difficult education
            subject to accident and at times ruin. Sometimes, as in the <title level="m">
              Phenomenology</title> and the Introduction to the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title>, this struggle with the negative that is <title level="m">Bildung</title> is cast as a spiritual autobiography. But sometimes, as in the <title level="m">Philosophy of Nature,</title> it is the pathography of Spirit’s attempt “to
            orient [itself] in the world of sickness” and to heal itself (Musselman 6), which is
            possible only if we think of healing as an interminable analysis.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">The six essays collected here suggest that Romanticism exposes us to a
               materialism that cannot merely be overcome and an idealism with which it is not
               identical. By reading beyond the texts conventionally associated with Romanticism,
               and by recasting the critical tendencies–from thing theory to object oriented
               ontology–through the poets, genres, and critics of Romanticism, these essays position
               Romanticism (and show how Romanticism may always have been positioned) in another
               relation to things as they are–or may be. Edited and with an introduction by Sara Guyer and Celeste Langan, with essays by Brian McGrath, Sonia
                  Hofkosh, Tom Toremans, Mario Ortiz-Robles,Yoon
                  Sun Lee, &amp; Anna Kornbluh.</p>

               <head>About this Volume</head>
               <p rend="noCount">The essays in this volume probe the way that Romantic writers explored the
          limits and possibilities of thinking in terms of systems. The purpose of the collection is
          not to provide a single perspective adopted by Romantic authors, any more than it is to
          provide a single theoretical perspective with which to view those authors. Still, the
          essays do in fact collectively convey a sense that Romantic writers viewed systems with a
          complex mixture of skepticism, anxiety, and enthusiasm.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by David
            Rettenmaier, Technical Editor, with assistance from Kyle Bickoff. The initial
            transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup
            modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text in archival quality for
            better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the
            modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI
            files into HTML. The image associated with this volume is plate 16 from Edme-Gilles

                  <p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted
            to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the
            languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
            Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on
            the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
            the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical
            discussions of today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this
            terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
            scholarship.</p>
