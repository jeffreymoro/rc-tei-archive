            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This paper offers a historical and aesthetic discussion of the
                    influence that Keats’s poetry had on Japanese modern poetry. The enthusiastic
                    reception of Keats in the period roughly ranging from 1880 to 1910 coincided
                    with Meiji Japan’s obsessive appropriation of Western culture. The coincidence
                    between the acceptance of Keats and Japan’s Westernization articulates a
                    situation not solely attributable to the incorporation of Western poetic diction
                    and imagery into Japanese poetry. Rather, Keats’s influence on Japanese poetry
                    was an extension of the contemporary changes in perception that had been
                    cultivated through the reading of Chinese literature. The transformation in the
                    mode of perception illuminates how English Romantic poetry initiated a turning
                    point in the cognition of Meiji literati to reinvent landscape in a new
                    language; the acceptance of Keats in Japan advanced a process that enabled
                    modern Japanese poets to defamiliarize conventional topoi and invent a new, more
                    “real” landscape. </p>

                <head>The Invention of Landscape: Keats’s Influence on Modern Japanese Poetry</head>
                <p>The enthusiastic reception of Keats in the Meiji period from around 1880 to 1910
                    coincided with the larger process of Japan’s obsessive appropriation of Western
                    culture. In their acknowledgement of Keats’s art, Japanese poets experimented
                    with alternative voices that deviated from conventional aesthetic codes
                    embodying premodern modes of perceiving the external world. In other words,
                    introduction to Keats enabled modern Japanese poets to defamiliarize
                    conventional topoi and invent an alternative, more “real” landscape. This paper
                    considers how Keats’s poetry initiated a turning point in the cognition of Meiji
                    literati leading to their reinvention of landscape. The newly invented landscape
                    illuminates the modes of expression they acquired to project the internal space
                    of the self—the inner self that vigorously swells into expression and
                    articulates lyrical passion and intensity.<note place="foot">This is a revised

                </p>
                <p>As Augustin Berque argues, aesthetic modes invent “landscape”; without modes of
                    cognition, there can only exist the pre-artistic conditions of “circumstance”
                    (49–50). It is the aesthetically educated “eye” which composes the vision of
                    scenes into “landscape.” Similarly, in his highly influential book, <title
                        level="m">Origins of Modern Japanese Literature</title>, Karatani Kojin
                    declares how we accustom ourselves to seeing a pre-conceptualized transcendental
                    vision of the external world: <quote> [M]edieval European painting and landscape
                        painting share something in common that differentiates them from modern
                        landscape painting. In both, <emph>place</emph> is conceived of in
                        transcendental terms. For a brush painter to depict a pine grove meant to
                        depict the concept (that which is signified by) “pine grove,” not an
                        existing pine grove. This transcendental vision of space had to be
                        overturned before painters could see existing pine groves as their subjects.
                        (27) </quote> The issue is, as Karatani points out, our lack of awareness
                    that “the painter is not looking at an object but envisioning the
                    transcendental” (21). Therefore, to deviate from the established “transcendental
                    vision,” modes of poetic vision have to be replaced by <emph>new</emph> mode of
                    seeing. Karatani further argues that the rediscovery of existing phenomena
                    requires the “repression of the signification, or figurative language (Chinese
                    characters) that precedes ‘things,’ as well as the existence of a language which
                    is supposedly transparent” (61). In the Meiji period, the Japanese literary
                    milieu was strongly under the influence of Chinese literature, so that to raise
                    a voice against the established conventions meant marginalizing the original
                    Chinese modes of poetic representation. </p>
                <p>Consequently, the exploration of the unfamiliar terrain of English poetry
                    involved implementing a transformation of the conventional Japanese mode of
                    perception to a new aesthetic manner. The absorption of English Romantic poetry
                    was not only a matter of semiotic change in the relationship between language
                    and things, but it also meant inventing landscape by abandoning the
                    transcendental model which the premodern Chinese literature had historically
                    constructed in Japan. Karatani accurately regards the birth of the “inner man”
                    stationed in “an introverted, solitary situation” as the occasion in which
                    landscape was “discovered” (25). Landscape does not exist as what is outside.
                    The “external world” itself had to be “discovered” (26). For the new poetry, it
                    was the “inner man,” who did not “look outside,” that was able to reinvent
                    “landscape” and demonstrate the period’s alienation from the transcendental
                    vision of landscape (25). A more “real” landscape was formulated in the radical
                    innovative mode of expression, which was developed to project the introverted
                    self. </p>
                <p>Indeed, a metamorphosis in perception was required to engender a modern poetic
                    mode that challenged the aesthetic codes informed by the premodern legacy of
                    Japanese literature. In alignment with the reformative movement, Kunikida Doppo
                    (1871–1908), who is regarded as having instituted a new language in his novel
                        <title level="m">Musashino</title> (1898) by describing the suburbs of Tokyo
                    and focusing on a white birch never previously included as an element of
                    Japanese scenery (Berque 48), debated the issue of accommodating natural
                    imagery: <quote> I have never had any ideas about what style I should choose to
                        describe nature. Neither do I care much about a particular literary style
                        for depicting nature. In any case, you can choose whatever style you might
                        like. However, we should take it into consideration that the writers, who
                        are cultivated enough to appreciate the numerous travelogue-styled
                            <foreign>waka</foreign> compositions, and read and skillfully manipulate
                        passages from the Chinese, tend to intensively focus on the style of
                        writing, and end up ruining nature as their subject. To observe and depict
                        nature, we have to describe simply what we see and what we intuitively
                        perceive. (299)<note place="foot">The translation of the quotation from
                            Kunikida is my own.</note></quote> Kunikida proposed an appropriate
                    response to nature, aiming to drive poetry instinctively towards the “real”
                    entities of the external world. A writer’s motives to reproduce the natural
                    world originate in subjectivity, the human agency that responds dynamically to
                    the visible object. Turning away from the formats prescribed by traditional
                    criteria, the poet’s perception is valorized by envisioning “nature” <emph>per
                        se</emph>. In effect, Kunikida recognizes that a deep appreciation of
                    Japanese traditional poetry and Chinese classical literature is likely to run
                    counter to the dynamic formulation of perceived “nature” and a vital aesthetic
                    formula which could afford the writer a heightened, innovative response to the
                    outer world. Travelers searching for the picturesque fail to look beyond the
                    determined form of landscape, since pre-determined aesthetics frames a
                    prescribed picture of the external world. At stake is the issue of turning the
                    existing paradigm of cognition into a new aesthetic mode of perception. </p>
                <p>Historically, the established modes of imagery, rhythm, and diction in
                    traditional Japanese verse were overshadowed by the long-cultivated aesthetics
                    derived from Chinese literature and Japan’s own literary legacy of
                        <foreign>waka</foreign> (a five-seven-five-seven-seven-syllable Japanese
                    poem: the <foreign>tanka</foreign>). Also, figurally, the traditional landscape
                    in Japanese poetry was derived from strong affinities and interaction with
                    Chinese landscape drawings (Tanaka 54–55). For instance, the specific terrains
                    of a pine grove, the thin white ribbons of plunging water denoting a waterfall,
                    a river, and a mountain have been identified as analogues for conventional
                    elements of Chinese scenery [figure 1]. <figure rend="noThumb" n="1">

                <p>A stock visual vocabulary of signs—a mountain, a pine tree and a

                    world, the entrenched artifice in the Chinese context had exhausted the
                    possibility for profuse meanings of “real” nature, and it gradually eroded other
                    possible conceptions of the natural in poetry. In fact, in pre-Meiji poetry,
                    “real” nature had always been a vital presence, but modern Japanese poets were
                    confronted by a burgeoning awareness of “landscape” and the necessity of
                    overthrowing prolonged Chinese influence.</p>
                <p>For instance, Tayama Katai (1871–1930), who made a great contribution to the
                    original Japanese style of the <foreign>Shishosetsu</foreign> (the
                    autobiographical novel), seems to wrestle artistically with the inherited style
                    of envisaging nature in his lyric, “Araiso” (“A Rocky Shore”) composed in 1897
                    (Tayama 23–24). The poem constructs the seashore furnished with the conventional
                    icons of pine trees and waves in the seven-and-five-syllable form. Further, the
                    poet tries to integrate the archetypal seascape with the poet’s lonely self: <quote><lg>

                    poet’s alienation from the addressed beloved. However, Tayama’s utterly
                    conventional fabrication of the seascape and its environs is largely dissociated
                    from his subjectivity. The <foreign>waka</foreign> form with its
                    seven-and-five-syllable meter and brief sentences seems unable to offer room
                    enough for the poet to expand his emotional range. Eventually, the “I” wandering
                    the shore is never unified with the landscape, nor are the objects of perception
                    claimed as vital resources to express the poet’s solitary anxiety. The external
                    world is, as it were, merely a stage, because the poet rigidly projects his mood
                    on the outside world. Therefore, the delineation of “real” nature does not
                    merely involve <foreign>shaei</foreign> 写生 (observing and depicting), or the
                    projection of emotion onto nature as a backdrop, but also makes an alternative
                    process necessary—a process of establishing an innovative form of expression
                    which could unify and articulate both nature and the introverted poetic self.
                    Beyond the subject and the object, the interaction between the inner and the
                    outer was to offer a newly acquired space for lyrical passion and intensity in
                    the Western style.</p>
                <p>The year 1897 was crucial in its heralding of a new age of Japanese poetry—it was
                    the year Shimazaki Toson (1872–1943), one of the period’s leading men of
                    letters, published his first book of lyrical poems entitled <title level="m"
                        >Wakana-shu</title> (<title level="m">Seedlings</title>). In the
                    introduction to the volume of poetry he published seven years after <title
                        level="m">Wakana-shu</title>, Shimazaki provocatively declared that the time
                    had come at last to resuscitate poetry in the national context (Shimazaki,
                        <title level="m">Anthology</title> 564). Deliberately positioned as artistic
                    reinvention, his poems challenged the prevailing codes in the Japanese literary
                    heritage. For instance, “Aki no Uta” (“Song of Autumn”), one of his lyrical
                    poems in <title level="m">Wakana-shu</title>, exemplifies the drastic change in
                    perception by transforming the conventional aesthetic codes of describing the
                    autumnal period (Shimazaki, <title level="m">Wakana-shu</title> 138–39).
                    Explicitly reflecting the influence of Keats’s “To Autumn” and “Ode to a
                    Nightingale,” the poem builds up a “foreign” realm with elements of Western landscape:<quote><lg>

                        </lg></quote> Shimazaki’s “Song of Autumn” adjusts the already-established
                    codes of autumn to a sense of pathos, employing the seven-and-five-syllable
                    meter characteristic of traditional Japanese verse. However, his subtle
                    celebration of autumn reaches for the radically unconventional images of an
                    aeolian harp and a cup of wine, derived from Coleridge and Keats respectively.
                    The Japanese autumnal landscape blessed by nature’s prolific growth and
                    conventionally enhanced by the yellow and brown hues of rice fields and
                    chestnuts, is associated with Western figures of the harp and the purple wine.
                    Moreover, in the last stanza, by granting “you” a face aware of winter’s
                    approach, the poem extends the pathos of life’s transiency, so that the first
                    person narrator wishes to share this melancholy with “you,” by asking to play
                    the pipe while the “I” sings. The “I” attempts to overcome the evanescence of
                    life by finding consolation in love and in the arts; and this escapist manner of
                    lamentation is highly reminiscent of the Keats’s imaginative flight away with
                    the nightingale. In this way, the scene is embellished with Keatsian poetic
                    visions, and the poet’s attempts at observation and description reveal
                    significant adjustments to a pathetic autumnal landscape with the introduction
                    of intoxicating wine and subsequent melancholy. Eventually, Shimazaki’s “Song of
                    Autumn” renovates the formulaic autumn scene by remarking on the sensuous
                    pleasure of ripeness and the pathos of time’s transiency producing the season’s
                    dynamic disharmonies. </p>
                <p>Predictably, however, Shimazaki’s poetry was not totally dissociated from the
                    established literary criteria of traditional Japanese form, because the
                    addressed “you” is an impersonal figure, and the expressive mode of “you”
                    functions as a rhetorical figuration solely to articulate the other person to
                    whom the “I” vainly dedicates his love (Isoda, “<title level="m"
                        >Wakana-shu</title>” 460–62). Moreover, though the “I” might represent the
                    poet’s consciousness, it is not granted its own unique individuality drawn from
                    a deep interiority. Self-evidently, the piece does not attain the atmosphere of
                    high Romantic landscape, where intense feelings of love, fear, or despair imbue
                    the scene until the internal space of the self swells into expression and
                    animates the outer world. Inevitably, Shimazaki’s volume was situated between an
                    acquired Westernized sensibility and traditional Japanese aesthetics: a fusion
                    of both the innovative and the orthodox. Indeed, this could be seen as a state
                    of <emph>confusion</emph>, both maintaining the contemporary predicament and
                    aspiring to the revolutionary poetics of the late 1890s and early 1900s, which
                    were by no means limited to Meiji Japan. </p>
                <p>Intriguingly, discerning a new mode for describing nature, Shimazaki was
                    attracted to Keats’s idiosyncratic and highly subjective application of the term
                    “indolence” in reading Book II of <title level="m">Endymion</title> (Matsuura
                    299): “as when heav’d anew / Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore, /
                    Down whose green back the short-liv’d foam, all hoar, / Bursts gradual, with a
                    wayward indolence” (Keats, <title level="m">Poems</title>, 2.347–50). For
                    Japanese poets traditionally, ocean waves had been seen—or rather had been
                    conceptualized before being seen—as transcendental. A wave is a wave; yet a wave
                    might not be a wave. Shimazaki seems to have experienced a transformation in
                    aesthetic paradigm by encountering a poetic landscape inflected by “indolence.”
                    He identified the internalized landscape of the ocean in Keats’s poetry as an
                    instance of modern “pathetic fallacy” in which the centrality of the poet’s
                    inner self increasingly grows (“On Landscape Painting” 800). Significantly, he
                    articulated the modernity of Keats’s subjective description, while contrasting
                    it with Homer’s objective sublimation of waves into grand spectacle as a means
                    of embracing the infinite power of the gods (“On Landscape Painting” 800–02).
                    Just as the configuration of a pine tree or Mount Fuji epitomized customary ways
                    of viewing nature, so the Homeric epic constituted a communal narrative of the
                    Greek deities, being the accepted poetic mode of taking pride in national
                    culture and history. Shimazaki seems to have recognized the modernity of
                    internalized realms through his encounters with both the Homeric world and the
                    internalized space of Keats’s seascape. </p>
                <p>From this perspective, we can see that Japanese literature customarily shared
                    received narratives in order to embrace the public sphere, but this was never
                    received as the dissociated space of private territory. For instance, the elite
                    samurai were well-grounded in literary knowledge appropriated from Chinese
                    literature. This cultivation of literary taste endorsed an ideal which worked to
                    both the public and the private good, enabling better comprehension of how the
                    world was organized in the service of the nation, while also educating
                    individuals in aesthetic taste as a samurai’s silent but eloquent proof of
                    devotion to his lord. Instead of advocating dilettantism, the samurai’s
                    self-cultivation of tastes in Chinese literature involved a common cause of
                    loyalty and patriotism, since the style modeled on Chinese classical literature
                    was employed in contemporary political and diplomatic scenes, and the
                    acquisition of a thorough knowledge of Chinese writings meant the samurai’s
                    constant awareness of affairs of state (Saito 126–29). Therefore, the Japanese
                    literary milieu entailed a preestablished harmony between the individual and the
                    public sphere, disclaiming the deployment of the individual as an isolated
                    figure cut off from the outer world (Isoda, “English Romanticism” 150).<note
                        place="foot">Intriguingly, the negation of subjectivity toward the outer
                        world in Japanese aesthetics was embraced enthusiastically by the Western
                        art world and established its influence as Japonism, which functioned as a
                        counter system to destabilize the Cartesian cognitive manner in the late
                        nineteenth-century Europe. (Berque 66–72).</note></p>
                <p>As Augustin Berque argues, in Western aesthetics since the Renaissance, when the
                    concept of “landscape” was instituted, the cognitive mode of seeing had
                    presupposed the Cartesian model based on the demarcation between the subject and
                    the outer world, a clear division witnessed later in the device of the
                        <foreign>camera obscura</foreign> (53–58). This cognitive system, which
                    enclosed the human agent, enabled the perception of the outer world through a
                    hole, and granted a fixed stance of self-preservation (Newton 51–52). The
                    secured posture of the subject participated in part in the formulation of the
                    autonomous modern self. In this vein, the Romantic aesthetic mode can be seen as
                    embedded in a conflict-ridden oscillation between the poet’s inner self and the
                    external world. </p>
                <p>Conversely, the Meiji literati regarded themselves as socially integrated
                    presences, devoted to public virtue, and simultaneously refined both private and
                    national tastes, having acquired the aesthetic codes established through Chinese
                    literature. However, in the process of Japan’s economic and cultural
                    Westernization, a clearer articulation of inner identity was to gain prominence
                    over a harmonious attitude toward the external world. Eventually, the
                    formulation of a modern autonomous self engendered a greater sense of human
                    agency in Japanese aesthetics, which inflected the outer world with a deeper
                    interiority and invented a new phenomenology of landscape through a new mode of
                    seeing. Indeed, in the Meiji era, the literary sensibility derived from the
                    Chinese context came to be destabilized through the techniques gained from the
                    West, establishing a more engaged interaction with the modern private self. </p>
                <p>Therefore, the acceptance of Romantic poetry implies that Japanese poets were
                    conscious that the communally adopted stance with which to perceive the visible
                    object could be modified, and they confronted this by observing the phenomenal
                    presence of the outer world. Over and against the cultural climate embedded in
                    the Chinese context, the process of revolutionizing Japanese culture focused
                    less on the balance between the communal sphere and private interest than on the
                    centrality of the individual. Unlike the integrated classical chorus, modern
                    voices could be realized through the celebration of a landscape invoking the
                    introverted space of the private self. Indeed, there was a prevailing sense that
                    a <emph>new</emph> language was in need to register and explore the modern
                    Japanese self.<note place="foot">Importantly, we can find English parallels to
                        the transformation of the aesthetic paradigm in the Meiji Japan. For
                        example, T. S. Eliot formulated a definition of English Romantic poetry as
                        dissociation from a “unified sensibility” that directly relates to Dante
                        (Karatani 53). Eliot situated his notion of a “unified sensibility” in a
                        pre-Romantic and pre-Cartesian past, in the time of Dante, when “non-
                        Romantic” direct and symbolic images still existed (Patea 17). </note></p>
                <p>In effect, the Westernization movement initiated
                    <foreign>genbun-icchi</foreign>—“the unification of the written and spoken
                    language”—which was founded on Japan’s imperative to establish a modern nation
                    and a contemporary functional Japanese language that would be appropriate for
                    absorbing and disseminating Western culture. The reinvention of the national
                    language called for a prioritization of the spoken against the written word in
                    the conviction that a phonetic revision of written language guaranteed the
                    attainment of Westernization and release from the restraints of the literary
                    Chinese characters (Karatani 46–47, 69–70). In this key transition from writing
                    to orality, the new Japanese literature was to play an active and essential
                    role, and the coincidence between Japan’s acceptance of Keats and linguistic
                    reform encapsulates a situation not solely attributable to the incorporation of
                    Western poetic diction and imagery. It was also closely interrelated with
                    contemporary changes in modes of perception that had been cultivated through the
                    tradition of reading Chinese literature. </p>
                <p>In fact, as in Romantic poetry, Japanese traditional <foreign>waka</foreign> and
                    Chinese poetry projected the individual poet’s feelings onto nature (Saito
                    166–69). However, it seems that the contemporary Japanese vogue for Westernized
                    aesthetics stimulated by Romantic poetry was a symptom of Japan’s lack of its
                    own quintessential vision with which to represent the private self. The issue at
                    stake in the reception of Keats concerned the poets’ abilities to maneuver and
                    relativize their stances towards nature, rather than their total employment of
                    Westernized imagery and style. For instance, Tsubouchi Shoyo (1859–1935), who
                    was well versed in English literature, specified Keats’s “Human Seasons” as a
                    desired interfusing of the poet’s subjectivity and the seasons, actually quoting
                    Keats’s poem: “quiet coves / His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings / He
                    furleth close; contented so to look / On mists in idleness–to let fair things /
                    Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook” (Tsubouchi 620–21). The passive retreat
                    in the poet’s “soul” enacts Keats’s ambition not merely to attach a gloomy mood
                    to the autumn scene, but to evoke the introverted intensity of the poet himself,
                    who calmly “looks on” the transiency of beauty and youthful strength.</p>
                <p>Struggling to explore visions embedded in the inner self, the Japanese poets
                    needed a gestation period to invent a new mode of expression. Japanese Romantic
                    landscape was to finally gain ground in the work of Susukida Kyukin (1877–1945).
                    His first volume of poems <title level="m">Botekishu</title> (<title level="m">A
                        Pipe in the Evening</title>), published in 1899, was strongly influenced by
                    Keats. “Boshun no Fu” (“On the Late Spring”) begins with a clear invocation of
                    “Ode to a Nightingale” (Susukida 18). Just as Keats craves for a “draught of
                    vintage! that hath been / Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth”
                    (“Nightingale” 11–12), Susukida longs for the taste of fine, richly colored red
                    wine. However, while Keats is intoxicated with ecstasies reminiscent of the
                    escapist flight with the nightingale, Susukida is disturbed by Spring growing
                    dim in the dusky evening, an awareness substantiated in physical discomfort: <quote><lg>
                            <l>Brewed in the deep-cooled cellar,</l>
                            <l>Its light purple turned to a deep hue,</l>
                            <l>A cup of wine with bubbles,</l>
                            <l>Bring to my lips. </l>
                            <l>Bewildered by the waning Spring,</l>
                            <l>I found my emaciated arm getting cold. (1–6)</l>

                            <l>細き腕の冷ゆる哉。 (ho so ki ka i na no hi yu ru ka na)</l>
                        </lg></quote> Bodily imagery enters to convey agony, not through the
                    distance of metaphor, but through the immediate description of the “emaciated
                    arm,” as in Keats’s agony in his “living hand” (“This living hand” 1), or
                    Hyperion’s “giant nerve” (<title level="m">Hyperion</title>, 1.175). These
                    overtly corporeal visions offer the archetypally Romantic imagined moment in
                    which empirical sensation is imbued with the truth of human pathos. And here,
                    the intrusive effects of corporeality coalesce with the material qualities of
                    the cool cellar and the evening, fearfully conveying life’s evanescence. </p>
                <p>The next stanza witnesses <foreign>Saohime</foreign> (Flora), a traditionally
                    personified figure of Spring, traversing the evening dusk: <quote><lg>
                            <l><foreign>Saohime</foreign> in bewilderment,</l>

                            <l>She passes away, strewing cherry blossoms.</l>
                            <l>How pitiful it is to see the pleasures of Spring </l>
                            <l>Returning to the earth. (7–12)</l>

                            <l>人は夕飯に耽る間を、</l>
                            <l>花、そここゝに散りこぼれ、</l>

                            <l>快樂も土にかへりけり。</l>
                        </lg></quote> The fallen petals of the cherry blossoms resonate with the
                    transience of pleasure and the pathos of the human journey towards the ground
                    and the final burial beneath flowers. In this distinct appearance,
                        <foreign>Saohime</foreign> bridges the esoteric boundaries between the
                    immortal realm of the Spring Goddess and the earthly Japanese landscape.
                    Etymologically, the name <foreign>Saohime</foreign> derives from Mount
                        <foreign>Sao</foreign>, located to the east of the <foreign>Heijo</foreign>
                    Palace and the site of the former capital city of the <foreign>Nara</foreign>
                    period (710–784), with the east signifying Spring in ancient Chinese philosophy
                        (“<foreign>Saohime</foreign>”). Yet Susukida expands on the traditional
                    poetic tropes for Spring, such as the goddess personifying the season veiled in
                    a haze, now rendering her as an alternative embodied human presence alongside
                    that of the poet’s in a vital but non-mythological landscape. The path that
                        <foreign>Saohime</foreign> treads and the breath that she expels invoke the
                    poet’s own phenomenal actions and anxieties. </p>
                <p>Tracing <foreign>Saohime</foreign>’s journey himself, wandering in the field at
                    dusk, the poet transforms the darkness into a visionary space of deliberate and
                    powerful images in the next stanza. The poem embraces Keats’s imagery of “Ode to
                    a Nightingale” in its exploration of the darkness: “I cannot see what flowers
                    are at my feet, / Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, / But, in
                    embalmed darkness, guess each sweet / Wherewith the seasonable month endows /
                    The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild” (“Nightingale” 41–45). Susukida
                    defines the dusky evening with vigorous images of fresh verdure and
                    sweet-scented pollen, which ironically denote the paradox of the declining
                    vitality of Spring: <quote><lg>
                            <l>Under a rich shade of young leaves,</l>
                            <l>With the torch flickering and dying,</l>
                            <l>I strained my eyes in the darkness.</l>
                            <l>The moisture-laden pollen on calyxes, </l>
                            <l>Still giving forth a scent after the blossoms have all fallen,</l>
                            <l>Exhausts the last remains of Spring. (13–18)</l>
                            <l>垂るゝ若葉の下がくれ、</l>
                            <l>亂れて細き燈火に、</l>

                        </lg></quote> In the next stanza, as the poet shifts his gaze from the
                    shades of the flowers to the dusk, the bright star which heralds Summer’s return
                    holds him in derision, causing an anguished recognition of the difference
                    between the eternally glittering starlight and mortal existence, as in Keats’s
                    “Bright Star.” Then his indolent but intense sensory impressions occur within
                    the darkness: <quote><lg>

                    sensory impressions: the Japanese harp added to the peony and its fragrance.
                    Whereas according to the poetic convention, peonies, like
                        <foreign>Saohime</foreign>, symbolize spring and female beauty, here the
                    sound of the flowers shedding their petals manifests the Romantic grievances of
                    bitterness over the brevity of a life span and the vulnerability of human
                    existence; the figure of <foreign>Saohime</foreign> is similarly revitalized by
                    feelings of resentment. The renewed fragility of the poet gains apotheosis in
                    the darkness and in the diminution into a Keatsian entity of “easeful Death”
                    (“Nightingale” 52). </p>
                <p>Yet, the last stanza suddenly bursts into an unprecedented intensity of feeling:<quote><lg>

                        </lg></quote> The spring dusk might extinguish the poet’s passion, which he
                    hopes does not burn itself out, as it is the very feverish emotion that the
                    fading Flora inspired, although she too almost expires in her vitality. However
                    overwhelming the ephemeral visions in the Spring dusk seem, the landscape is
                    entirely dominated by the “burning passion” through which
                        <foreign>Saohime</foreign>’s presence intermingles with the poet’s figure.
                    The strong emotions, however poisonous or spiritual, and which are aroused by
                    resentment and curses, are dramatically sublimated into permanent passion and
                    formulate the Romantic landscape of a deeper interior.</p>
                <p>Susukida envisions the evening as the introverted darkness within the poet,
                    whereas Keats defined a valley or a bower as a place to celebrate the extreme
                    feelings of pleasure and pain. These specific spaces are also shared by
                    Susukida, who embraces the opportunity to dramatize the inner self in the
                    passion and intensity of sensuous imagery. In particular, Susukida reinvents the
                    conventional Japanese scenery with his own personalized Romantic formulae,
                    rather than restrictively borrowing from the catalogue of Westernized imagery.
                    The particular configuration of the spring dusk, <foreign>Saohime</foreign>, and
                    the poet’s inner self, induce a Romantic darkness, in which we recognize a new
                    poetic language metamorphosing the traditional Japanese spring landscape. Here,
                    neither “real” nature, nor the overt gloom of the Romantic poet’s self can be
                    clearly discerned. This critical moment invites a potentially fruitful
                    reconsideration of English Romanticism in the presence of unfamiliar Japanese
                    landscapes and semantics.</p>
