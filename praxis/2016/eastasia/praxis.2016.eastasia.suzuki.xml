                <p rend="noCount">This essay explores the ethos of early Keats scholarship in Japan,
                    focusing on three major scholars: Saito Takeshi, Sato Kiyoshi, and Hinatsu
                    Kohnosuke. Japanese scholarly investigations into Keats were pioneered by a
                    group of young scholars centered around the Imperial University of Tokyo. In the
                    first place, Saito attempted to establish a humanistic understanding of the
                    poet’s ideas, as exemplified by his Keats’ View of Poetry (1929). His love of
                    Keats reflects his early reading, higher education, and Protestantism. His
                    meeting with John Lawrence, a philologist, at the University perhaps opened the
                    way for a modern methodology of Romantic study in Japan today. Secondly, unlike
                    his fellow-scholar, Sato in The Art of Keats (1924) embraced Keats as an apostle
                    and victim of beauty, while understanding English Romanticism as a catalyst for
                    social modernization. Thirdly, Hinatsu, a scholar-poet from Waseda University,
                    authored a massive study entitled The Priest of Beauty (1939) on the
                    psychological process through which Keats composed the “Odes.” His account of
                    Keats’s artistry owes something to his early background and reclusive character.
                    The achievements of these scholars attest to their high-minded ambition in
                    guiding the progress of national literature and literary scholarship in
                    Japan.</p>

                <p>Keats criticism reached its first landmark in 1917. That year, a critic gave form
                    to his long-term devotion to so short-lived a poet. His <title level="m">John
                        Keats</title> turned out to be the first full-scale account of Keats’s life
                    and poetry, which would serve his readers for the next fifty years. The author
                    was the illustrious fine-arts critic of the day, Sir Sidney Colvin, who had
                    published a short biography of the poet (1887) as well as the authoritative
                    edition of his letters (1891) and of his poems (1915), and would help, as
                    treasurer, to raise a fund for purchasing the memorial site to be called Keats
                    House. Crowning his academic efforts, the 1917 book made the poet’s fame secure,
                    which it is easy to imagine encouraged the following book-length lives and
                    criticisms of Keats in, especially, the afterglow of the centenary of his death.
                    Indeed, Colvin’s latest achievement was revered cross-culturally, at least in
                    Japan: a copy of the book was displayed at the venue of a ceremony held for
                    commemorating Keats in 1921, occupying pride of place alongside that of the
                    facsimile of the “Hyperion” manuscript by the poet himself. Perhaps, for the
                    group of young scholars who organized this event, the exhaustive work of Colvin
                    was symbolic of the spirit of ambition and dedication they sought to bring into
                    the complacency of Japanese dilettantish academia. The 1921 celebration, in
                    fact, became a prelude to the next phase in the reception of Keats. In literary
                    circles, since first mentioned in the 1871 translation of Samuel Smiles’s <title
                        level="m">Self-Help</title>, the poet’s name had been increasingly familiar.
                    Inviting enthusiastic or sympathetic comments, his poems and love letters had
                    been partly translated, with his versification influencing the practice of
                    rising poets.<note place="foot">For the most comprehensive survey of the
                        reception of Keats in Japan, see Okada, 79–102.</note> On the other hand,
                    his genius had remained unexplored in academia, despite the fact that Keats was
                    often discussed in lectures by foreign scholars in government employ or by
                    Japanese teachers.<note place="foot">However, there seems to have been some
                        studies on Keats in unpublished form: Aizu Yaichi, a poet and Oriental art
                        historian, submitted a graduation thesis on Keats to Waseda University in
                        1906, having been inspired by Lafcadio Hearn’s lecture. See also Okada,
                        83.</note> This lengthy period of literary reception—lengthy, compared with
                    other major Romantics like Byron and Shelley—was finally taken over by its
                    scholarly counterpart in the 1920s.<note place="foot">Matsuura divides the early
                        Keats reception in Japan into three stages: the introduction to Japanese
                        readers (1871–1900), imitation and adaption (1901–25), translation and
                        criticism (1926–). See Matsuura, 40. The division, not so clear-cut in
                        practice, can be used only for convenience’s sake, as criticism was active
                        at least as early as the Keats conference, as will be shown below. Also, the
                        first translation of Keats’s poetry in book form—a disreputably inaccurate
                        rendition by the novelist Tayama Katai—appeared in 1905.</note> A brief
                    account of the Keats memorial conference mentioned above, an event long buried
                    in history, makes a good starting point from which to examine the ethos of early
                    Keats scholarship in Japan through three important Keats scholars: Saito Takeshi
                    (1887–1982), Sato Kiyoshi (1885–1960) and Hinatsu Konosuke (1890–1971).</p>
                <p>Late afternoon on the centenary day, some fifty people were found in a
                    Japanese-style building of Conference Hall, <emph>alias Sanjo Goten</emph>
                    (“Hilltop Mansion”), at Tokyo Imperial University, the predecessor of the
                    present University of Tokyo.<note place="foot"> This account of the party is
                        based on the reports in <title level="j">Bokushin</title> and <title
                            level="j">The Rising Generation</title>.</note> On the front wall of the
                    room they entered was hung an oil portrait of Keats (after Joseph Severn’s). The
                    gatherers were wearing violets on their jackets, an ornament inspired by
                    Severn’s report to the dying poet that the flower was in bloom around the tomb
                    awaiting him: the purport of the party was to delight Keats himself. The
                    conference started at six o’clock with the reading of a sonnet dedicated to the
                    poet by a Japanese scholar, Toyoda Minoru, a graduate of the Imperial
                        University.<note place="foot">Calling the poet “Rapt devotee of Beauty,
                        lover of Love, / Scion of Greece” (1-2), Toyoda yearns for his “final faith”
                        (12) in the identification of beauty with truth.</note> This was followed by
                    three lectures, the first and second by other graduates and the third by a
                    foreign lecturer working at the University, E. E. Speight. After the session,
                    some of the listeners moved on to a relaxed conversation over snacks and coffee,
                    others to peeking at tens of Keats references on show. The lack of developed
                    transportation necessitated an alternative, in Kobe, for those in the West part
                    of the country. This ceremony was also a success, with over sixty people
                    attending the lectures and over twenty the banquet. The hosts of these
                    conferences were editors of the slim, small-format monthly magazine <title
                        level="j">Bokushin</title> (“Pan”), aimed at lovers of poetry; despite the
                    brief notice given for the conference, they issued the February installment as a
                    special number, using an illustration of the poet’s profile for the title page
                    and carrying Speight’s sonnet, “John Keats,” the facsimile of both sides of a
                    leaf from Keats’s autograph of “The Eve of St. Mark,” studies and translations
                    of his work, as well as their usual run of original compositions. The limited
                    readership of the periodical—albeit influential, considering that the group was
                    headed by the major lyrist Miki Rofu—was complemented by a more academic and
                    broadly-interested journal, <title level="j">The Rising Generation</title>, and
                    their commemoration ran for four issues—fortnightly at that time—reaching the
                    wider group of English scholars and teachers. Behind this sudden outburst of
                    academic interest in Keats was Saito Takeshi, in his mid-thirties, a
                    graduate-lecturer at the Imperial University, a speaker at the Keats centenary
                    in Tokyo, and a chief contributor of Keats studies to both periodicals.<note
                        place="foot">In an annotated catalogue of studies of Keats written for a
                        special number of <title level="j">The Rising Generation</title>, Saito
                        calls Colvin’s new biography “the best and authoritative biography of J. K.
                        realized through assiduous research of thirty years and accomplished
                        critical acumen” (309). </note></p>
                <p>Where Okada rightly observes that Saito’s evaluation may have formed the basis of
                    Keats’s subsequent popularity in Japan (85), it is notable that his attitude was
                    not so much that of an evangelist as he might likely seem. In the editor’s
                    postscript to an issue of <title level="j">Bokushin</title>, reflecting on the
                    memorial event in Tokyo, the writer, most probably Saito, reveals that he had
                    expected fewer than half of those who had actually appeared. Even more
                    surprising was the impact of their special number on literary and poetic
                    circles, and the English academia, which he describes somewhat reservedly as
                    “considerable” (<title level="j">Bokushin</title> 24).<note place="foot">Here
                        and below all the quotations from Japanese-language sources are translated
                        by Suzuki.</note> His low expectation, it is explained, was because Keats
                    was unlikely to draw many readers’ attention. Saito’s view is more evident in an
                    essay he wrote for the morning issue of a leading newspaper, <title level="j"
                        >Yomiuri Shimbun</title>, dated on Keats’s centenary. Like other early Keats
                    lovers in Japan, Saito expresses great sympathy for the poet’s life of
                    adversity, and sees his love affair in terms of Lycius’s downfall in “Lamia.”
                    However, the tenor of the article opposes the prevailing view that Keats was an
                    aesthete or decadent. As proof to the contrary, Saito quotes the lines defining
                    a poet as “those to whom the miseries of the world / Are misery, and will not
                    let them rest” (“The Fall of Hyperion” 1.148–49). It was in the continued
                    suffering through which he attained this eminence, says Saito, that Keats’s
                    greatness lay. His pursuit of “my demon Poesy” (“Ode on Indolence” 30) was too
                    intense to be sustained, but was nonetheless inevitable. His work was “a living
                    flame to illuminate the world,” and he himself “a candle that must melt away” to
                    do so: poetry was his “lifeblood,” more so than in the case of Shelley. Despite
                    addressing the general public, Saito declares that Keats’s poetry is not suited
                    to them, and that it can only be understood by those who love beauty and “demon
                    Poesy,” who can “see a higher beauty in pain and conflict.” Therefore, concludes
                    Saito, his readers will remain a few, and the celebration should thus remain
                    modest: “it should be the last thing to do to carry around a portable shrine”
                    (“Keats Itte Hyakunen”). </p>
                <p>Saito’s outspoken elitism might be the result of the strong identification he had
                    with Keats, a manifestation of his unlimited esteem for a dedicated and lofty
                    spirit. His receptive but resolute nature is suggested by what happened to him
                    as a schoolboy in Fukushima at the age of seventeen. He was enthralled with
                    Wordsworth’s view of nature and human life, to an alarming degree. A precocious
                    boy, he read “The Table Turned” with a strong sense of the futility of learning,
                    thus handing in his notice. Back home he was persuaded by his father—the very
                    farmer-father who would later attempt to stop Saito from going to Tokyo so that
                    he, the eldest son, could take over the family’s trade—to resume schooling. As
                    was typical of young intellectuals of the day, Saito read avidly, amongst other
                    things, <title level="j">Imperial Literature</title>, the journal issued by a
                    literary circle at the Imperial University, and the works of Japanese Romantic
                    poets such as Shimazaki Toson and a famous devotee of Keats, Susukida Kyukin,
                    while practicing their new style of poetry himself. His arrival at the Imperial
                    University in 1908 was too late to allow direct contact with either Lafcadio
                    Hearn, a lecturer acclaimed for critical acumen, or Natsume Soseki, the
                    replacement for Hearn, who remained at his post for only four years. Saito
                    studied under the supervision of the philologist John Lawrence (1850–1916), the
                    only tenured professor in the department. Lawrence approached literary works
                    through formal disciplines such as prosody, stylistics, and phonetics, Romantic
                    poets being a subject of his special concern, which meant much to Saito and
                    other students. </p>
                <p>Lawrence’s dedication to teaching is worthy of mention at this point. In
                    explaining why he was not more productive in writing—his lifetime output
                    consists of, chiefly, the doctoral dissertation <title level="m">Chapters on
                        Alliterative Verse</title> (1893) and a monograph in <title level="s">Modern
                        Language Review </title>(1914)—his students point out that during his ten or
                    so years in office Lawrence was responsible for, at most, twelve lectures, and
                    gave seminars or tutorials that lasted from two to five hours everyday,
                    voluntarily (Saito 1.473–74, Sup. 451–52; Ichikawa 268–71).<note place="foot"
                        >Saito also admires what he calls gentlemanliness in his Quaker-teacher, a
                        composite of a sense of duty, truthfulness, benignity, courtesy, diligence
                        and regularity (1.475–79). See also Ichikawa, 270.</note> Much later, Saito
                    surmised that, although Lawrence’s commentary-based method, linguistic in focus,
                    may have lacked critical depth, and disappointed those aspiring to a writer’s
                    career, he was the father of Romantic studies in today’s form (Sup. 452, 166),
                    while he is elsewhere reckoned as an epoch-maker in the study of English
                    literature and linguistics (Tezuka 258). In truth, his teaching customs
                    anticipate the proliferation of annotative practice in the Taisho era. The
                    matchless project of “Kenkyusha English Classics,” the editions of English
                    authors annotated in Japanese which extended to a hundred volumes (1921–32), was
                    supervised by Lawrence’s follower, Ichikawa Sanki.<note place="foot">For an
                        account of the Taisho era as the age of commentary, see Narita 58. Saito
                        annotated Shelley’s poems, Keats’s <title level="m">Endymion</title>,
                        Tennyson’s <title level="m">In Memoriam</title>, and others. This series led
                        to biographies of a hundred English authors in Japanese (1933–39).</note> As
                    well as helping to measure the spread of English studies at that time, this
                    historic undertaking echoes, and links to, a shift in approach that Lawrence
                    initiated among his many students: the shift from the impressionistic, or
                    Hearnean, to the scholarly, in its strict sense. There is no clear explanation
                    as to why Lawrence often lectured on Romantic poetry, including Shelley’s <title
                        level="m">Revolt of Islam</title> or <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>, but one possibility is that he cherished their liberal
                    inclination. This may reflect his political awareness, given that Japan was at
                    the threshold of a democratic movement called in many quarters “Taisho
                    Democracy.” </p>
                <p>Saito’s early career culminated in a doctoral dissertation in English, <title
                        level="m">Keats’ View of Poetry</title>. After a long lectureship, he wrote
                    it in the autumn of 1924 while visiting Oxford, where he attended the
                    “Discussion Class” offered by Merton Professor of English Literature, George S.
                    Gordon. Gordon hosted the gathering of a few senior students selected from
                    English department, following the custom of his predecessor, Sir Walter Raleigh.
                    Upon request, Saito delivered a paper on the state of English studies in Japan.
                    Back home, he adapted this extracurricular “Class” for his workplace (1: 130).
                    When Saito’s thesis was published by Cobden-Sanderson in 1929, with the
                    endorsement of his colleague Edmund Blunden, it was favorably reviewed in <title
                        level="j">The Times Literary Supplement</title> with a comment: “it is,
                    within certain limits, a valuable addition to the growing body of criticism of
                    that great poet” (1094).<note place="foot">The review, entitled “A Japanese View
                        of Keats,” praises Saito’s rare virtue of detachment as something lacking in
                        English criticism; he, “the fortunate inheritor of a [Japanese] spiritual
                        tradition,” can “look upon Keats with sympathy, but also with detachment,”
                        in a way that is not possible for English critics (<title level="j"
                            >TLS</title> 1094).</note> The study captured the attention of Clarence
                    D. Thorpe, thus prompting his reviews, and was added to the reading list at the
                    University of Michigan. Indeed, Saito’s focus and approach prefigures Thorpe’s
                    work, <title level="m">The Mind of John Keats </title>(1926). Saito presents
                    Keats as a poet of humanistic conceptions, discussing his notions of beauty and
                    truth, and of the function of poetry, and his axioms of poetry. In a section of
                    the first chapter, Saito challenges the current interpretation of the Grecian
                    Urn’s cryptic axiom—“Beauty is truth, truth beauty” —as being an announcement of
                    the art-for-art’s sake doctrine. The word “truth” is used in a sense of reality,
                    Saito argues, suggesting that “what is absolutely beautiful must be essential
                    and real, and what is essential and real must be beautiful if adequately
                    expressed” (42). This reading, coupled with a moral edge in the poet’s
                    conception of beauty and art, suggests that, far from subscribing to hedonism,
                    his view is rather, in Saito’s words, “art for life’s sake” (43). As shown in
                    this transformation of the Victorian—or sensuous—Keats, one of Saito’s
                    advantages lies in a careful analysis of the complex network of ideas formed in
                    the poet’s mind. Another is his access to Keats’s artistry through a knowledge
                    not only of Romantics but also of Japanese and Chinese poets. After bringing to
                    light unique elements of Keats’s descriptive imagination in comparison with
                        <foreign>sumie</foreign>, Japanese brush art, he describes the poet’s method
                    of concentration and suggestion as akin to a haiku master’s condensed use of
                    words. For example, he quotes from “Ode to a Nightingale,” “Charm’d magic
                    casements, opening on the foam / Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn”
                    (69–70), arguing that “Twenty pages might be written in interpretation of this
                    wonder-working couplet—interpretation which would vary, according to the mood
                    and culture of the exponent” (109). He goes on to introduce some associations
                    with the magic-casement scene traced by critics, then adds Wordsworth’s phrase:
                    “Lady of the Mere, / Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance” (“A Narrow
                    Girdle of Rough Stones and Crags” 37–38). His intention is not to exclude
                    others: <quote>Such is the extraordinary richness of the impression made by
                        Keats on the reader, that each of these interpretations may be of help in
                        approaching the poet, who very likely fused all those sources and
                        concentrated them with his poetic alchemy into those miraculous lines.
                        (110)</quote></p>
                <p>A question may arise: how did Saito <emph>discover</emph> the humanistic Keats at
                    all? This may be explained, oddly enough, with reference to his Christian
                    background. Both in his religious and academic lives, Saito was inspired by
                    Uemura Masahisa, a high-profile Calvinist thinker and preacher. His mind had
                    undergone the transition from Nietzschean egocentrism to Christian submission,
                    “the mental journey traced by all young people in the early nineteenth century”
                    (Sup. 447), which led him to receive baptism at the age of nineteen. Uemura
                    affected not only Saito’s outlook on life, puritanical as he was, but also the
                    subject of his graduate work, Milton and Spenser. Apparently these poets’
                    Protestant ethics and epic self-empowerment enabled him to perceive a comparable
                    cause in Keats’s humanitarian pursuit of “demon Poesy”: “Keats was not a
                    religious poet,” says Saito, “but his humanitarianism is based on Christianity”
                    (Sup. 438). </p>
                <p>Among several other scholars who contributed to the rise of Keats scholarship was
                    Sato Kiyoshi, a graduate of the Imperial University with a background similar to
                    Saito’s. Sato attended the same preparatory course in Sendai, and was taught by
                    the same teacher, Doi Bansui, a poet as dominant as Shimazaki and translator of
                    Byron’s <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title> and Carlyle’s
                    essays. Although his baptism at the age of sixteen did not affect Sato so
                    profoundly in terms of his reading, he was bent on Japanese Romantic poets, and
                    felt the creative urge—in fact, two-thirds of the posthumous collection of his
                    writing is devoted to his original poetry. After some years of teaching, and two
                    years of unaided research in England, Sato began writing on Keats in the
                    centenary year and administered the memorial conference in Kobe. In 1924, while
                    Saito was writing his thesis abroad, Sato became the author of the first book on
                    Keats in Japan—and in Japanese—entitled <title level="m">The Art of
                        Keats</title>.<note place="foot">So was the study advertised in <title
                            level="j">Yomiuri Shimbun, </title>with Keats being “a martyr to love
                        and poetry” and his life that of “a moth to a flame.”</note></p>
                <p>In contrast to Saito’s conceptually oriented thesis, <title level="m">The Art
                    </title>analyzes chronologically the poet’s major works, furnished with their
                    entire translations or outlines in Japanese. The preface records the author’s
                    repeated visits to Hampstead, expressing his strong sense of pity for the
                    “unhappy genius” (1). The study may be less ambitious than Saito’s, introducing
                    the outline of each poem together with others’ critical comments, but Sato’s
                    chapter on “Lamia” is more independent from his predecessors, coming to a
                    remarkable conclusion. Sato defended the narrative poem against the complaint
                    made by critics such as Robert Bridges that, to the work’s disadvantage, the
                    main characters lack nobility. Instead, Sato argues that the story points to a
                    new axiom derived from the poet’s first-hand experience of love; that is,
                    “beauty is supreme, though illusory” (220). This notion is of a radical aesthete
                    who admits the frightful linkage between beauty and death, says Sato. Keats
                    abandoned the moral life he was pursuing, so the poem forms a new category that
                    can be called “the art of failure” (222). As if in reaction to Saito’s
                    humanistic Keats, Sato holds to, and refines, the poet’s traditional image,
                    observing that “Keats will ever remain among us an apostle of beauty, a creator
                    of beauty, and a victim of beauty” (236). His later <title level="m">A Study of
                        Keats: Psychology in Composition</title> (1949) is a collection of the
                    critical essays that prove his abiding commitment to the poet; the first
                    Japanese edition of Keats’s letters (1952) is also his work. </p>
                <p>Sato’s real strength, however, may be shown in his criticism of Japanese modern
                    poetry, and of poetry in general, considering that these spheres of writing
                    could more directly interact with his identity as poet. As the years passed,
                    Sato grew impatient with his contemporaries in poetic circles because of their
                    soullessness or lack of sincerity; he felt similarly about his scholarly
                    colleagues. He found in them a tendency to avoid Romanticism, and to be
                    dilettantish and feudalistic in their choice of subject matter, as discussed in
                    an essay written a few years after World War II. The Japanese, argues Sato,
                    neglect a duty to strengthen the national character and literature by
                    assimilating Romanticism, which he calls the “fearful stream of English
                    literature” that seeks freedom, flowing from Milton through the Romantics down
                    to Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis, and which is the nobler and more
                    venerable for the absence of an equivalent in the Japanese tradition;
                    Romanticism is “calcium to form the bones” (3.251–52). In his opinion, the
                    Japanese mind is in need of further modernization; hence the understanding of
                    the trends in European political life during the last two centuries (3.250).</p>
                <p>This view of Romanticism explains why Sato favored the political Keats. In <title
                        level="m">The Art</title>, discussing “Isabella,” he introduces George
                    Bernard Shaw’s anti-capitalist reading of Stanza XIV–XVI and William Morris’s
                    critique of commercialism, in tones of delighted approval (44–45). Importantly,
                    Sato seems to have believed that, for Keats, politics was not incompatible with
                    a pursuit of beauty, but rather a part of it. In one of his essays, Sato
                    distances himself from the doctrine of “art for art’s sake” which critics found
                    in his poetry, and shows sympathies with proletarianism and the masses of the
                    world as well as those who in modern Japan were struggling for their political
                    rights. “I make it my life principle to transmute all such distresses and
                    struggles into art,” says Sato (3.8).</p>
                <p>Sato’s study of Romantics and other English authors was intended to serve the
                    literature of his own country. Keats’s celebrated idea of the poetical character
                    offered him a hint through which to strive for cultural success. At the
                    conclusion of an article on Doi, with whom he formed a lasting friendship based
                    on respect and affection, Sato articulates this point as follows: <quote>The
                        great poet is someone who identifies oneself with everything. In the case of
                        a critic, brandishing a certain fixed principle and abusing others in
                        various, cruel ways is not something laudable. Great literature does not
                        emerge in a country with such a climate. Since authors vary in
                        individuality, we must accept a type of literature that embraces all
                        individuality. Japanese literary art must henceforth accept diversities.
                        (3.136)</quote> It is interesting in this context to note Sato’s engagement
                    with a different culture overseas. Two years after the publication of <title
                        level="m">The Art</title>, at government request, he went across to Seoul to
                    be installed as Professor of English at Keijo Imperial University—later a part
                    of Seoul National University—when it was founded, allegedly, in an effort to
                    modernize the Peninsula, which had been annexed to Japan in 1910. His twenty
                    years’ service produced eighty-five graduates, including many Koreans. In a
                    speech given on the occasion of his retirement, Sato mentioned his participation
                    in a section of the local literary movement; it was based on his belief that
                    “literature consists in practice” (3.258). His activity extended to the
                    contribution of his poems and essays to <title level="j">National
                        Literature</title>, a Japanese journal edited by his Korean student, Choi
                    Jae Seo (Choe Jae-seo), who believed in the wartime notion of “Greater East
                    Asia” and promoted Japanese as its common language. Sato also prepared a
                    collection of poems (unpublished), including his long works on the Korean
                    priests who helped the establishment of a Buddhist culture called “Asukabunka”
                    in ancient Japan (3.162). There is no doubt that the priests were the alter ego
                    of the overseas teacher Sato. His nationalism may show the limitations of a
                    government official of Imperial Japan, but it was free from chauvinistic
                    arrogance: “I was moved to know how earnestly they [his Korean students] were
                    seeking to discover in their study of English literature a way that might lead
                    to the deliverance and freedom of their own race” (3.259).</p>
                <p> The third of the scholars who characterize early scholarship on Keats is Hinatsu
                    Konosuke, who earned more fame as poet than as a scholar of English, producing
                    only translations and a thesis on Keats, but whose contribution is nonetheless
                    unique and suggestive. Immediately after the Keats commemorative year, the
                    scholar-poet started lecturing at Waseda University, a stronghold of English
                    scholarship rivaling the Imperial University in tradition and influence.
                    Hinatsu’s doctoral thesis, published in 1939 under the title, <title level="m"
                        >The Priest of Beauty: A Study of Psychological Processes in the Composition
                        of John Keats’s Odes</title>, was his only noteworthy work in this field.
                    However, this work was of symbolic relevance to his life, “a direct result of
                    fourteen years of my lecturing life and a clue to one side of the thirty years
                    of my poetic career,” as he calls it in the preface (3–4). As massive as any
                    study on Keats published before or since, at home or abroad, it attempts to
                    elucidate intentions and aims in the composition of the poet’s major odes
                    through the method of close reading based on the author’s own experience, a
                    thorough consideration of preceding scholarship, and the contexts of literary
                    traditions, not only English and European but also Chinese and Japanese. His
                    reading is as subtle—if not as lucid, due to his meandering discussion—as Earl
                    R. Wasserman’s in <title level="m">The Finer Tone</title> (1953), while the
                    wide, cross-cultural learning it shows throughout its 918 pages is unparalleled,
                    which makes it doubly regretful that the Japanese-language thesis remains
                    unapproachable for most foreign scholars.</p>
                <p>The inaccessibility of Hinatsu’s language, in fact, is not limited to this
                    respect. Whether scholarly or poetic, it forbids any Japanese scholar’s easy
                    access due to its archaism. Hinatsu adhered to the classical style of writing;
                    he objected to a growing trend to write poetry in colloquial style, an extension
                    of the campaign set by novelists of the previous generation. His vocabulary is
                    based on classical Chinese, a vital part of traditional education that had
                    fallen from public favor. His symbolic, even mystic, style—as he calls it,
                    “Gothic-Roman”—sometimes bars sympathetic understanding on account of the
                    pedantic impression it might cause, even if it is intended to pursue the refined
                    beauty of the language. Recalling Coleridge’s grudges against the reading public
                    or Keats’s occasional bouts of irritability over the unthinking masses, Hinatsu
                    is reported to have felt “no need to make himself understood to those who cannot
                    understand” (Maihashi 123). When published, his thesis on Keats appeared in a
                    limited edition of six hundred copies, which was the extension of his usual
                    publishing custom as poet. </p>
                <p>Hinatsu’s uncompromisingly unfashionable attitudes may go some way toward
                    explaining his attachment to Keats, perhaps deeply seated in his psyche. As a
                    schoolboy Hinatsu was so weak-framed, bookish, and morbid in sensibility, and
                    his lineage so distinguished in the locality (Iida, in Nagano), that he was an
                    isolated character, even among his family; the only ally he could find was his
                    mother. He chose Waseda, not the Imperial University, partly because it was his
                    mother’s preference, and partly because he aspired to the liberal climate of the
                    one and hated the bureaucratic atmosphere of the other, as recalled by his
                    brother (Maihashi 43–44). This, somewhat ironically, resulted in his drifting
                    away from mainstream English studies, as the Imperial University became the
                    parent of English Literary Society of Japan in 1929, a society that, from the
                    outset, boasted more than a thousand members across the nation. Meanwhile,
                    Waseda tended to be a closed society. What follows is a regret expressed by an
                    unidentified Tokyo University Professor Emeritus: “it is a loss to the academia
                    to let such an erudite, genuine scholar as Hinatsu be retired in the unrewarding
                    Waseda” (Maihashi 56).</p>
                <p>What Hinatsu saw in Keats echoes the solitariness of his artistic-scholarly self.
                    In his thesis’s conclusion, Hinatsu characterizes Keats’s work as part of the
                    retirement literature, by which he means more than escapism—that is, “part of
                    the necessary and serious action produced by a poet’s unusual passion for human
                    possibilities.” This type of literature is “not of a cowardly nature”; it
                    represents “an unlimited attachment to the fragrance pertaining only to the
                    literary effect of withdrawal,” he writes (555–56). Even if Hinatsu owed more to
                    French symbolists such as Baudelaire and Mallarmé than to Keats in poetic
                    practice, the Odes embodied a lyrical state to which he had aspired, the state
                    in which “the existence of nature outflowing from images of the mind expresses
                    the so-called aspect of thought in a unified whole,” not showing “the slightest
                    shadow of the burden of ‘thought’” (560). Hinatsu regarded it as a manifestation
                    of “the spirit of symbolist literature which had walked in English poetry since
                    the eighteenth century,” a tradition which he says professors of English and
                    critics rarely note, but which, as a French critic has pointed out, was passed
                    down to French symbolists by Keats and Shelley (561). His prolonged, in-depth
                    analysis of Keats thus provided Hinatsu with a symbolist’s conviction,
                    furthering his own seclusion as, say, a priest of beauty himself.</p>
                <p>To conclude, the early Keats scholars discussed above accessed the poet with a
                    zeal often approximating devotion, and their efforts proved to be extremely
                    ambitious: as heir to an enthusiasm that had captured the Keats readers before
                    their generation, they all accommodated it to the establishment of their
                    scholarly or creative identity, or of both. Such an undertaking suggests the
                    unique potential of Keats’s reception at a time when English scholarship was
                    becoming specialized and author-based, but still allowed other disciplines or
                    careers, in Japan. Saito, Sato, and Hinatsu were among the first to survey the
                    existing criticisms of Keats, to discuss his poetics and works, and to be
                    abundantly rewarded in their own ways. In the case of Sato and Hinatsu, whose
                    principal aim was to serve the cause of national literature, a deep
                    understanding of Keats helped to foster their sensibilities and poetic beliefs,
                    thus contributing to their own poetry, on which, especially, Hinatsu’s fame
                    seems to rest today. This kind of achievement, a result of English scholarship
                    and Japanese creativity going hand-in-hand for mutual benefit, has long passed
                    into history; their achievement is of a nature possible only in their time, when
                    young intellectuals were often enthusiastic lovers of poetry. But, for this very
                    reason, the two poet-scholars should deserve a page in the reception history of
                    Romanticism, or rather, English literature, in Japan. Meanwhile, Saito’s
                    achievement belongs to a different order. Although his writing covered the old
                    Chinese poet Du Fu and Christian thought, he was more devoted to English
                    scholarship than the other two, and became the editor of <title level="j">The
                        Kenkyusha Dictionary of British and American Literature </title>(1937), and
                    the author of the long-selling, authoritative <title level="j">A History of
                        British Literature</title> (1957). With his Calvinistic self-discipline and
                    awe-inspiring character, Saito influenced many scholars of the next generations,
                    thus setting the tone for today’s English scholarship in Japan. “Scholars need
                    only to contribute to the academia of their subject, not keeping in mind their
                    works’ connections with the national culture,” Saito wrote in 1954; “if you
                    achieve a result on a par with native scholars’, it proves to be a respectable
                    work.” He then went on to predict a day when Japanese scholars would publish in
                    English and serve other cultures (6.457–58). This disinterested, scholarly
                    ambition presumably originated in his thesis on Keats, an isolated example of a
                    published thesis in English before World War II, and a noble landmark for the
                    future projects of Japanese scholars.</p>
