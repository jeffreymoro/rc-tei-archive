            <p class="noCount">This paper puts together a trajectory of Keats’s reception in China from appropriation
               to oblivion and then to restoration in line with three distinctive moments in Chinese
               modern history. It explores the interaction between the original text and its foreign
               context, particularly complex in Keats’s case for his often misconceived image as
               an escapist aesthete who seemed much out of place in 20th China undergoing violent
               political and ideological changes. While this aestheticism confined Keats’s influence
               to a smaller circle than that of his more radical contemporaries such as Byron and
               Shelley, his less discursive and more ambiguous poetry also ensured its survival in
               a repressive political context and continued to appeal to different generations of
               Chinese readers with its deep sympathy for fellow human beings and honesty about the
               human condition. </p>

               <h1><span class="head">Keats’s Afterlife in Twentieth-Century China</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>Ever since his Chinese readers introduced Keats to China at the beginning of the twentieth
               century, Keats’s afterlife in China has gone through drastic changes alongside the
               violent alterations experienced by the nation. Just as Auden writes of Yeats who,
               after his death, “became his admirers” and whose words “are modified in the guts of
               the living” (“In Memory of W. B. Yeats”), so Keats’s reception in twentieth-century
               China has involved the author and the text as much as his Chinese readers, translators,
               and critics, the latter of whom admired Keats with their own cultural perspectives
               on the one hand and embraced him for his foreignness on the other. Since different
               generations of his Chinese readers shaped Keats’s reception in China, and all of them
               had to wrestle with their own historical context, the ensuing discussion of Keats’s
               afterlife in twentieth-century China is divided into three stages, roughly following
               the periodization of the national history: first, from the beginning of the twentieth
               century to 1949, the late Qing to the Republican era when Keats was introduced and
               popularized; second, from 1949 to the late 1970s, the Communist China era leading
               up to the Cultural Revolution when Keats was slighted and almost silenced; and third,
               from the late 1970s to the end of the century, the post-Cultural Revolution era in
               which Keats underwent a revival. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While a similar fate was shared by all the major English Romantics introduced to China,
                  Keats, who is often misconceived as the pure artist, presented a rather unique case,
                  different from his more radical contemporaries such as Byron and Shelley, whose more
                  explicitly political poetry had greater bearing on or underwent fiercer contention
                  with the local context throughout China’s history.

                           of British Romanticism in China, which also includes a study of Byron’s reception
                           in twentieth-century China that is forthcoming elsewhere.</span></div>
                  </div> When Keats’s apparently apolitical poetry was caught in the tumultuous historical
                  changes of twentieth-century China, the interaction between the original text and
                  its foreign context became more complex and had to be teased out more carefully. From
                  the initial introductory stage, Keats was read and admired in a small circle of Chinese
                  readers, mostly poets and scholars, while Byron and Shelley were popular among a big
                  audience that included writers and radical intellectuals alike. Yet with his aesthetic
                  appeal, Keats influenced several leading Chinese poets in their exploration of new
                  forms of Chinese poetry, and in this sense his aestheticism became no less revolutionary
                  than the ideological iconoclasm of Byron and Shelley, only subtler and more profound.
                  On the other hand, during the politically more repressive Communist era, when literature
                  and art were reduced to mere instruments of party propaganda, Keats’s poetry, although
                  suffering no less than other Romantics’, managed to survive less scathed exactly for
                  its comparatively less discursive and inciting nature. If Byron’s rebellious spirit
                  posed a threat to an authoritarian state and thus needed to be severely censured and
                  obliterated, then Keats’s aestheticism simply fell into neglect and dismissal. Ironically,
                  however, when Western poetry and art began regaining their ground in China in the
                  late twentieth century, Keats was read and studied chiefly among specialists rather
                  than common readers. Throughout the twentieth century in China, Keats was very much
                  an odd figure whose seemingly innocuous aestheticism paradoxically posed a strong
                  challenge to a nation reeling with political metamorphoses. This paper, therefore,
                  while putting together a trajectory of Keats’s fate in twentieth-century China, aims
                  to explore the more acute, though veiled, tension between the violent shaping force
                  of China’s historical and cultural context and Keats’s poetry that nevertheless constantly
                  resisted the force with its own steadfastness.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Keats entered into China at roughly the same time as other Romantics in the late Qing
                     period when Western and traditional Chinese cultures clashed most intensely, and when
                     the first wave of Western literature rushed into China in sweeping power. Keats is
                     first mentioned by Lu Xun, the leading figure of modern Chinese literature and the
                     New Culture Movement, in his early essay “On the Demoniac Poets,” published in 1907.
                     Lu Xun, however, includes Keats only for dismissal: “John Keats, despite his being
                     labeled as a demoniac poet, does not belong to the same school as Byron, and so will
                     not be discussed here” (1:85).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The quotation here and those hereafter from Chinese sources in this article are my
                              own translations. </span></div>
                     </div> The editor’s note explains: “Keats’s works exemplify liberalism and were affirmed
                     by Byron and Shelley. But he has an ‘art for art’s sake’, aesthetic inclination, hence
                     not belonging to Byron’s school according to Lu Xun” (1:112.100). This is not the
                     only time Lu Xun mentions Keats. In “A Happy Family” written in 1924, Lu Xun satirically
                     depicts a writer composing a story with such a title. While the writer is busy defining
                     standards for “a happy family,” he decides that the married couple should be reading
                     Byron’s or Keats’s poetry, but then decides against it and settles for Wilde’s <em>An Ideal Husband </em>instead (2:37). In “From Self to Others,” published in 1934, Lu Xun starts the essay
                     with the example of Keats as “one of the geniuses who were killed by the words of
                     philistines” (5:502).</p>
               </div>
               <p>These references to Keats are too brief to give one a definite idea as to Lu Xun’s
                  stance towards Keats, but in comparison to Byron, who is the hero in his essay on
                  the demoniac poets, Keats is obviously less attended to by Lu Xun. One does not know
                  whether Lu Xun had read any of Keats’s poetry either. If he had, it would be in translation,
                  for he did not speak English. Lu Xun’s knowledge about Keats and English Romantic
                  poets in general must have come indirectly from Japanese or German sources, two foreign
                  languages in which he was versed. From the distinction he makes between Keats and
                  Byron and his presentation of Keats as a victim of the philistine world, one can detect
                  in Lu Xun traces of the mainstream Victorian view on Keats as the weak aesthete, which
                  must have been passed on to Lu Xun through Keats critics in Japan or Germany. With
                  his tremendous influence during his lifetime and afterwards, particularly after 1949,
                  Lu Xun’s take on Keats as a major poet who stands alone shaped the ensuing reception
                  of Keats in China to considerable degrees. But one should not overestimate his influence,
                  since many Chinese readers of Keats after Lu Xun had direct access to English sources,
                  which gave them a more holistic picture of Keats, especially after the reputation
                  of Keats steadily rose from the 1920s onwards in Britain and America.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lu Xun’s references to Keats correspond to the gradual popularization of Keats in
                     China in the first three decades of the twentieth century, with the 1921 commemoration
                     of Keats’s centenary as a milestone. In April 1921, a two-page article, “Centennial
                     Commemoration for the British Poet Keats,” written by Yu Zhi,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)

                     </div> scholar and social activist, was published in <em>The Eastern Miscellany</em>. It quotes the epigrammatic ending of “Ode on a Grecian Urn” and the opening of <em>Endymion</em> (in translation), and includes a portrait of Keats as well as photographs of Keats’s
                     tomb and Keats House at Hampstead. Considering Keats a precursor of Aestheticism,
                     the author claims, “taking Beauty as Truth is both Keats’s strength and weakness”
                     (71). When discussing Keats’s poems, he also exemplifies an attitude similar to the
                     Victorians’ toward Keats. Commenting on Keats’s sensuousness, he writes not without
                     condescension, “Keats’s life was nothing but a series of sensations” (71). He also
                     promotes the same myth as did the Victorians: “having always been weak in health,
                     Keats became sick after working too hard on poetry from 1818 to 1820” (72). Biased
                     as it sounds, the article made the first proper introduction of Keats to China.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The following month saw the publication of another memorializing article, “Keats in
                     the Centennial Commemoration” by Shen Bing,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> novelist and critic, in <em>Fiction Monthly</em>. The one-page article opens the issue and states that Keats “has long been known
                     by all,” suggesting Keats’s familiarity among the Chinese readership by then (1).
                     The author laments Keats’s fate, for Keats, like many other geniuses, lived a life
                     of obscurity and remained neglected and misunderstood after death. The article concludes
                     by quoting Keats’s famous words in the original, “I think I shall be among the English
                     poets after my death” (<em>Letters</em> 1:394), reminding one of Matthew Arnold’s memorable quotation of the same words and
                     his warmly reassuring affirmation, “he is; he is with Shakespeare” (Arnold 291). The
                     same author reports in the following issue of <em>Fiction Monthly</em> on the London exhibition in commemoration of Keats’s centenary (5).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The commemoration, however, was rather moderate in comparison with the celebration
                  of Byron’s centenary three years later conducted by various journals. The most extravagant
                  one was carried out by <em>Fiction Monthly</em>, which compiled a special issue for Byron composed of eleven articles written by
                  a team of most influential poets and intellectuals of the time. This is hardly surprising,
                  for Byron’s (and Shelley’s) more openly radical poetry resonated among Chinese readers
                  who were anxious for the future of their own country, which was caught in chaos and
                  unrest after it had experienced a Revolution in 1911 and a Restoration in 1915 in
                  quick succession. In comparison, Keats appeared less provocative, since his poetry
                  was considered set in a realm remote from reality. After these passionate but brief
                  celebrations of Keats in 1921, Keats’s popularity was confined to a small group of
                  poets and scholars, almost slight in comparison with the idolatry Byron inspired.
                  Even in his admirers’ eyes, Keats was a pure artist with no concern for the actual
                  world. Keats therefore was popularized together with other Romantics in China in the
                  wake of the New Culture Movement, but with his image as an aesthete, he was overshadowed
                  by his more overtly political contemporaries.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Small as the scale of Keats’s influence might be, the common admiration for Keats
                     shown by some leading Chinese poets powerfully suggests the profound impact Keats
                     had upon the formation of the modern Chinese poetic tradition. In the 1920s, a handful
                     of poets, Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, and Zhu Xiang, stood out as Keats’s ardent admirers
                     and earliest translators. All three poets were associated with the Crescent Moon Society,
                     a prominent poetic school in the New Culture Movement co-founded by Xu Zhimo and Wen
                     Yiduo in the 1920s. It was often labeled as promoting aestheticism for its emphasis
                     on formalistic elements of “new poetry,” that is, modern Chinese poetry written in
                     vernacular Chinese as opposed to traditional Chinese poetry written in classical Chinese
                     language and meter. All three poet-admirers of Keats died young. Xu Zhimo (1897–1931),
                     usually regarded as the most important modern Chinese poet, died in a plane crash
                     at the age of thirty-four. Wen Yiduo (1899–1946), a major modern Chinese poet who
                     contributed to a more regulated form of “new poetry,” was assassinated by secret agents
                     of Kuomintang for his political activism at the age of forty-seven; and Zhu Xiang
                     (1904–33), poet and translator, committed suicide at the age of twenty-nine. All three
                     poets, like most of their older and younger contemporaries mentioned above and below,
                     had studied overseas, an experience that not only exposed them to Keats and other
                     Western authors but shaped their own paths as Chinese poets. In fact, among modern
                     Chinese writers, more than half had overseas studying experiences which in a sense
                     became a shaping force for modern Chinese literature (Zheng 12–13), in the same way
                     that students specialized in other fields in their study abroad led China to its path
                     of modernization after their return.

                              Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, a partial remission of the indemnity China had to pay

                              the Boxer Rebellion. Wen Yiduo and Zhu Xiang, for example, were Boxer Indemnity scholars,

               <p>Xu Zhimo began to admire Keats as well as other Romantics in his Cambridge years,
                  1921–22. His article “Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale,’” published in <em>Fiction Monthly </em>in 1925, reads like lecture notes on Keats’s famous ode and translates its first five
                  stanzas in prose. It interweaves the prose translation with commentary, which emphasizes
                  Keats’s chameleonic quality, paralleling him with Shakespeare, the wording of the
                  passage a loose translation of Keats’s “camelion poet” letter. He comments in admiration
                  that Keats becomes a weeping cloud when singing to Melancholy and turns into a sweet
                  kernel while celebrating Autumn (2). The article also includes excerpts from “Why
                  did I laugh tonight?” and “After dark vapours have oppressed our plains,” both in
                  English, and concludes with a portrait of Keats and the original “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  in English.</p>

                     Keatsian poem “Autumn Colors,” the poet addresses the season as Keats did a hundred

                     the disparagement of aestheticism by empowering Keats with political metaphors to
                     be the only loyal minister serving the King of Art whose name will be immortalized.
                     By inverting Keats’s original words, “Here lies one whose name was writ in water,”
                     Wen literally inscribes Keats’s name in his poem. In elevating Keats above other poets,
                     Wen pledges his allegiance not only to Keats but to Art as a loyal devotee himself.
                     The importance he attached to the formal beauty of “new poetry,” a significant contribution
                     he made to the modern Chinese poetic tradition, cannot be dissociated from his unreserved
                     devotion to Keats as most fully exemplified in this poem.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Keats often appears as Wen’s presider in his prose as well as in his poetry. In his
                  article, “On the New Poems Published in This Year’s <em>Weekly</em>,” Wen cites the last lines of “When I have fears that I will cease to be” in English
                  as an example of “true poetry” (<em>New Poetry </em>4). In his “Commentary on <em>Winter Night</em>,” the first collection of “new poems” by Yu Pingbo, he uses Keats again as the exemplar
                  of true poetry on account of Keats’s firm command of words, supporting his view with
                  the quotation of the original lines in <em>Endymion</em>: “Obstinate, silence came heavily again / Feeling about for its old couch of space
                  / And airy cradle” (<em>New Poetry </em>35–36).</p>
               <p>One of Wen’s poems, “Rain of Tears,” was reviewed in <em>Supplement to Beijing Daily</em> on 2 April 1925: “the poem does not have the kind of verbal painting as found in
                  Keats, but it is still a poem that could only have been composed by Keats” (Zhu, <em>Essays</em> 2:346). The same reviewer also criticizes Wen’s wordiness in another article, “On
                  Wen Yiduo’s Poetry,” in which he suggests that one can compare Wen with Keats in the
                  sense that Keats’s earlier works are also extravagant, with images crowded like “summer
                  reeds or unpruned branches” (Zhu, <em>Prose</em> 122)—different than his mature ones in which not a single world can be added or taken
                  off. The commentator is Zhu Xiang, another fervent poet-admirer of Keats in China.
                  In his correspondence with Xiang Peiliang on 23 April 1925, Lu Xun writes: “Zhu Xiang
                  seems to have fallen as well, and nobody mentions him any more—even though he is ‘the
                  Chinese Keats’” (7:283). As the editor speculates, Lu Xun may have misremembered Zhu
                  Xiang’s comment on Wen’s poem quoted above (7:284.8), but the identification with
                  Keats stayed with Zhu Xiang ever since. By “fallen,” Lu Xun seems to refer to Zhu’s
                  increasing association with the Crescent Moon Society (7:284.7); Lu Xun did not share
                  the Society’s aesthetic pursuits.</p>
               <p>Zhu Xiang himself, however, was not happy with the label of “the Chinese Keats.” In
                  his poem “Returning South,” included in his first collection of poems <em>Summer</em> published in 1925, he expresses nostalgia for his hometown in the south by comparing
                  himself to a lonely young swallow:</p>

               <p> Apparently self-deprecating, the poet refuses to take his friends’ well-meaning suggestions
                  by insisting on his own cultural identity: “They don’t know that I am only a small
                  bird of the Orient” (<em>Zhu</em> 16).</p>

                     to the famous site, the poet cannot help but remember lines of Keats’s “Fancy” when
                     raindrops begin to fall on the lake:

                     (<em>Zhu </em>200). In another essay on “Ancient Ballads,” he pays tribute to Keats’s “wonderfully
                     sensuous” poetry, citing “I stood tiptoe on a little hill” and <em>The Eve of St. Agnes </em>as having qualities that can be “rarely found in Chinese poetry.” On the other hand,
                     he also gives several examples from ancient Chinese ballads that, he writes, “can
                     only be barely rivaled by Keats even when Keats is at his best” (<em>Prose</em> 80–81). In his correspondence with his friend Luo Niansheng (“Letter to Luo Niansheng”),
                     he acknowledges Keats’s influence on his own poetry, mentioning that his poem “Wang
                     Jiao” is more lyrical than narrative, belonging to the same category as Keats’s <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em> (<em>Prose </em>246). Like <em>Eve</em>, “Wang Jiao” is a narrative romance, ending tragically with the titled heroine dead
                     after being abandoned by her lover.</p>
               </div>
               <p>From Keats’s prominent presence in his poetry and prose, one can clearly see Keats’s
                  influence on Zhu Xiang, but the influence seems to have also brought him a sense of
                  anxiety. The tension between the awareness of his own cultural roots and his fascination
                  with English poetry seems particularly strong in him, which may have something to
                  do with his continuous endeavor to blend the two cultures in his short life, as seen
                  in his pioneering work in translation, especially of English Romantic poetry. In his
                  translations, Keats is given an eminent position as well. His collection of translated
                  poems, titled <em>Myrtles: Translations of Foreign Poems</em>, published in 1936 posthumously but actually translated in 1928 while he was studying
                  in Chicago, includes five poems by Keats, only next in number to the nine selections
                  from Shakespeare. They are “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Ode to a Nightingale,” “To Autumn,”
                  “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” and <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em>. All the translations are rendered in the form of Chinese “new poetry,” that is,
                  in vernacular Chinese and often with a loose sense of meter or rhyme. After Zhu Xiang,
                  other translators of Keats followed him in adopting the free verse form, with some
                  trying to capture the original metrical pattern wherever it was possible.</p>
               <p>After the 1920s, Keats’s haunting presence in China continued to be felt not only
                  in poetry but in scholarship as well. Fei Jianzhao, professor at Wuhan University,
                  stood out in the 1930s as the most important Keats scholar in China; he admired Keats
                  so much that he would only dress up when teaching Keats, and even blamed Fanny Brawne
                  for killing Keats. He died of tuberculosis as well. His writings on Keats’s life,
                  aesthetics, and philosophy were mainly published in <em>Monthly Journal of Literature and Art</em>. In “Keats and Shakespeare,” from the April 1934 issue, Fei extensively quotes, in
                  translation, from Keats’s letters while tracing Shakespeare’s influence on Keats.
                  The article covers almost all key passages on Keats’s poetics, such as Shakespeare
                  as Keats’s presider and as the man with neutral intellect, Shakespeare’s intensity
                  and negative capability, and Keats’s poetic axioms and dramatic ambition. It also
                  includes a passage from <em>King Stephens </em>in the original, possibly the first mention of Keats’s drama in China (147).</p>
               <p>On 1 December 1940, the fourth issue of <em>Western Literature</em> included a special column on Keats, collecting Keats’s poems translated by Wu Xinghua,
                  poet, translator, and scholar regarded by many as a young genius. The collection includes
                  “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer,” “Human Seasons,” “Ode to Psyche,” “Ode on
                  Melancholy,” “Bright Star” (retitled as “Last Sonnet”), and “When I have fears.” Translations
                  of Keats’s letters by Song Tifen (Song Qi) are found in the column as well, containing
                  Keats’s self-reflection on <em>Endymion</em>, his confession of his dramatic ambition, discussion of Milton, as well as a letter
                  to Fanny.</p>
               <p>By 1949, Keats had already been commonly taught in universities. In Taiwanese scholar
                  Qi Bangyuan’s autobiography <em>Ju Liu River</em>, she recalls the English Poetry course taught by Zhu Guangqian, the founder of aesthetics
                  in twentieth-century China, at Wuhan University during the Sino-Japanese War years.
                  Zhu started the course with the Romantic Era rather than following the chronological
                  order in <em>The Golden Treasury </em>edited by Francis T. Palgrave, and Qi remembers her first looking into Keats’s “Ode
                  to a Nightingale” (195) and about ten other poems by Keats, including “Ode on a Grecian
                  Urn,” “To Autumn,” “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” and <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em> (208–09).</p>

                  as an undergraduate. Like Zhu Guangqian, Bian’s American professor also started the
                  course directly with the fourth chapter of <em>The Golden Treasury</em>, “Romantic Poetry.” When he was in his second year, the course was taught by Xu Zhimo,
                  whose syllabus was entirely confined to the nineteenth century, with particular attention
                  to the Romantics. This preference for Romanticism, Bian reflects, had its historical
                  inevitability, for the tensions between revolutionary fervor and escapism and between
                  idealism and disillusionment, which were most fully exemplified in Romantic poetry,
                  had a particular resonance for Chinese readers, who had been caught in complex fluxes
                  of “colonial, bourgeois, and proletarian revolutions” ever since 1911 (32). Byron,
                  Shelley, and Keats, the best-known Western poets in China then, Bian writes, were
                  “revolutionary poets,” but their revolution was bourgeois, and they gradually became
                  escapists when their ideals failed to be realized (31). After cataloguing the escapism
                  in Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley, Bian acknowledges Keats’s difference determined
                  by his humbler “petty bourgeois” background, but he concludes that the cruel reality
                  Keats faced only turned him away to romance and the sensuous imaginary world with
                  the “wings of poesy” (31). It was Keats’s poetry “that defined the course of ensuing
                  bourgeois poetry, which turned from ‘revolutionary efforts’ to ‘escapism’” (31). Bian
                  also discusses the influence of Romanticism on modern Chinese poetry, especially the
                  Crescent Moon poetry, which became increasingly escapist and bourgeois. This tendency
                  did not change until Mao Zedong’s 1942 “Yan’an Talks on Literature and Art” (32).</p>
               <p>The politicized reading of Keats and other “bourgeois poets” in Bian’s article published
                  right at the beginning of Communist China suggests the dramatic change of the political
                  climate, when the nation began to be firmly controlled by the official ideology established
                  by Mao’s “Yan’an Talks.” Given in 1942, Mao’s “Yan’an Talks” became the most important
                  guideline for literature and art in Communist China. Their essence was the politicization
                  of literature and art, which were deprived of their autonomy and reduced to the means
                  to serve the end of achieving the Party’s political aims. In the field of foreign
                  literature, the author’s class stance, particularly relevant because of his or her
                  bourgeois background, was the most important standard in determining the value of
                  a literary work. In the field of Chinese literature and art, the Westernized tendency
                  after the May Fourth Movement was criticized; whether or not a writer or an artist
                  would employ Chinese or nationalist artistic forms was no longer a matter of taste,
                  but a vital issue of political stance (Gao 352). In such a context, the apolitical
                  Keats well established before 1949 was naturally disfavored and became an increasingly
                  marginalized figure. Even when touched upon, Keats was viewed with reservation as
                  someone who, starting from a lower class background, could have become, but eventually
                  failed to be, a thorough revolutionary. This politicized Keats took almost a U-turn
                  from the pre-1949 overaestheticized Keats. While in both cases Keats was appropriated,
                  the pre-1949 appropriation was essentially literary in nature, whereas the post-1949
                  one was ideological. As a result, Keats almost sank into oblivion in both translation
                  and scholarship in Communist China, even when translations of Western literary classics
                  were organized by the government in early 1950s.</p>
               <p>The politicization of Keats as well as other Romantics in China further was exacerbated
                  by the introduction of the Soviet literary theory of progressive and reactionary Romanticism.
                  The 1953 <em>British Literary History </em>edited by Gorky World Literature Research Institute at Moscow, for example, became
                  almost the official guide in reading English literature in China. Its preface first
                  analyzes the increasingly intensified social conflicts in Romantic Britain so as to
                  determine the nature of the class struggle, thus defining British Romanticism as the
                  “product” of the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution (3). It then divides
                  the British Romantics into two camps: the reactionary, that is, the Lakers; and the
                  progressive, unsurprisingly consisting of Byron and Shelley, who take up most of the
                  space in the entire book as well as in the preface. The Byron chapter is more than
                  a hundred and thirty pages long, the Shelley one a hundred pages, whereas Keats is
                  given less than thirty pages.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Keats chapter in <em>British Literary History </em>opens by calling Keats a “complex and important phenomenon,” occupying a special position
                     in English Romanticism (158). It defines Keats as divided from the Lake poets because
                     of his humanitarianism, materialism, and limited radicalism, and notes his affinity
                     with the revolutionary Romantics, citing Shelley’s and Byron’s championship of Keats
                     as evidence. However, his aestheticism, according to the chapter, also made him different
                     from the two, who regarded poetry as weapon for political protest (158). The chapter
                     then introduces Keats’s life briefly and discusses his poetry, with emphasis on his
                     early “political” poems, such as “On Peace” and several poems dedicated to Hunt, which
                     are considered progressive but still remote from the actual condition of British political
                     struggle (162). The sensuous love celebrated in <em>Endymion</em> is regarded as a protest against the puritan hypocrisy of British bourgeoisie, and
                     Keats’s Hellenism is aligned with the revolutionary Byron and Shelley, suggesting
                     his dissatisfaction with reality (167). The post-<em>Endymion</em> stage is described as revealing Keats’s awakening social consciousness, exemplified
                     in his keen awareness of hardships endured by the Scottish and Irish people he witnessed
                     on his Northern tour (168–69). <em>Hyperion</em> is interpreted as manifesting great social revolution, namely the replacement of feudal
                     society by the capitalist one, and the historical idea conveyed by the poem that the
                     new will triumph over the old suggests Keats’s deep doubts about the prospect of the
                     capitalist society (173–75). The three narrative poems, <em>Isabella</em>, <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em>, and <em>Lamia</em>, reveal Keats’s hostility or even hatred towards private ownership and exploitative
                     society, echoing Shaw’s famous comment on <em>Isabella</em> (176–77).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Shaw famously writes, “Keats achieved the very curious feat of writing one poem of
                              which it may be said that if Karl Marx can be imagined as writing a poem instead of
                              a treatise on Capital, he would have written Isabella” (175).</span></div>
                     </div> <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> is considered Keats’s greatest poem, in which he criticizes his own earlier aestheticism,
                     and replaces it with a new understanding of humanitarianism that develops into a deep
                     sympathy for the people enslaved by the pernicious social system (178–79). The great
                     odes, melancholy as they are, bespeak optimism for future mankind despite present
                     social injustice (180). “To Autumn,” for example, depicts the agricultural labor of
                     a female peasant (182). <em>The Cap and Bells</em> is also mentioned for its satire of aristocracy and royalty (183). The last part of
                     the chapter discusses Keats’s style, and attributes his concrete imagery to his realism
                     and materialism, thus distinguishing Keats from the reactionary Romantics (184–86).
                     The chapter concludes that, although Keats gave up imaginary beauty and came closer
                     to heroic beauty found in reality, he failed to fully develop it (186). This was achieved
                     only by Byron and Shelley, who participated in people’s political struggle for liberation
                     (186).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Another key Soviet reference that Chinese scholars often resorted to was Anikst’s
                  <em>Outline of British Literary History</em>, published in Moscow in 1956 and translated in China in 1959 by several renowned
                  Chinese scholars of Western literary studies. The chapter on Romanticism makes the
                  same division of the Romantics into the reactionary or passive and the progressive
                  or revolutionary, but the division is based on the two camps’ differing attitudes
                  toward the French Revolution. The reactionary side was represented by Burke, the progressive
                  by Priestly, Paine, and Wollstonecraft (274–75). Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey
                  are examples of turncoats (282). The publication of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> in 1812 marked the formation of revolutionary Romanticism, but Anikst points out
                  that Byron failed to transcend bourgeois democratic principles, whereas Shelley was
                  the spokesman for the masses’ socialist struggles (282). Keats is not even mentioned
                  in the introductory section. Again, the space the author gives to each Romantic in
                  the chapter is telling enough: the Lakers, en masse, take up ten pages; Byron alone,
                  thirty two; Shelley, fourteen; and Keats, faring better than the Lakers, eight pages.
                  Scott, for his affinity with realism, is allotted twenty pages.</p>
               <p>The eight-page section on Keats defines him as the third progressive Romantic; this
                  claim is supported by his association with Leigh Hunt, whose circle was “against the
                  ruling class in Britain” (359), and by the affirmative comments of Byron and Shelley
                  on Keats. According to Anikst, “Keats was disapproved of by the capitalist aristocracy
                  but deemed a comrade by the revolutionary Romantics. This fact alone is sufficient
                  to determine which camp Keats belonged to in his age” (340). Again, Keats’s early
                  political poems are cited, and <em>Isabella</em> is also singled out for its accusation of the capitalist exploitation of the laboring
                  class (341). Keats’s progressive Hellenism is contrasted with the reactionary Romantics’
                  ideals in medievalism (342), with the medievalism in <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em> conveniently disregarded. <em>Hyperion</em> is interpreted as an allegory of the failure of the French Revolution, and affirmed
                  for its overall revolutionary stance (343). Anikst seems on the whole quite sympathetic
                  with Keats, fiercely against the bourgeois aesthetes who claim Keats as their precursor,
                  but her remark that Keats’s death was “probably” caused by reactionary critics’ malicious
                  mockery and attack still betrays the deep-seated influence of the myth surrounding
                  Keats’s death propagated chiefly by these bourgeois aesthetes (339–40).</p>
               <p>The dominant influence of the Soviet theory is evident in Zha Liangzheng’s (Mu Dan’s)
                  preface to his translation, <em>Selected Poems of Keats</em>, the publication of which in 1958 went much against the current. A leading Chinese
                  modernist poet under the influence of William Empson, with whom he studied at the
                  National Southwestern Associated University before getting his PhD at Chicago, Zha
                  was also the most prestigious and affinitive poet-translator of Keats and other Romantic
                  poets (Byron and Pushkin most famously) in twentieth-century China. Given the harsh
                  political climate, the poet-translator is clearly on guard in the preface, quoting
                  from the authoritative 1953 <em>British Literary History</em> discussed above to define Keats’s class stance “as oppositional to the reactionary
                  Lakers and affinitive to the revolutionary romantics,” as well as emphasizing Keats’s
                  liberalism and social awareness through his association with Leigh Hunt and his early
                  poems such as “To Kosciusko” (365–66). Zha also attempts to legitimize Keats by his
                  high reputation among Soviet readers (368). Dancing with shackles, he can only convey
                  his admiration for Keats in these politically correct terms. Had he not done so, it
                  is questionable whether the publication of the translation of Keats, the less progressive
                  Romantic, would have been permitted in the first place. On the other hand, even in
                  Soviet standard, Keats was a safer choice than “reactionary” Romantics. In this case,
                  it was probably Keats’s middling political position that saved him from the fate of
                  being completely forbidden. The translation, though not likely to have reached a big
                  readership, nevertheless ensured that Keats’s poetry continued to survive, however
                  precariously, even in such a repressive time. As to whether or not Zha picked Keats
                  exactly for his not so overtly political poetry under his own restraining political
                  circumstances, however, one is only left with conjecture. In the preface, however,
                  Zha strives to give Keats a fair aesthetic evaluation as much as he is allowed. He
                  highlights Keats’s unrivalled influence upon subsequent poetry, and vindicates Keats
                  by freeing him from the charges of being an exemplar of art for art’s sake and progenitor
                  of sensuous decadents made by “bourgeois critics” (365). More importantly, he was
                  the first Chinese scholar and translator to point out the sane and healthy nature
                  of Keats’s poetry, the concrete and truthful qualities of Keatsian beauty, and the
                  underlying sense of irony in Keats’s celebration of artistic immortality, despite
                  the fact that Keats “was not a revolutionary Romantic as Byron and Shelley” (366).
                  He concludes that Keats’s poetry is “bright, tough, and genuine,” with neither Byron’s
                  pessimism and despair nor Shelley’s utopianism, but contains “a half-illusory, half-concrete
                  world full of human warmth,” “hence conducive to the fostering of socialist taste
                  of the readership”—the last note betraying the repressive political environment again
                  (367–68).Soon after the publication of the translation, Zha was labeled as a counterrevolutionary
                  for his enlistment in the Chinese Expedition Force for Burma to aid the British forces
                  against the Japanese during WWII, and then worked in a library under surveillance
                  for almost two decades. He translated <em>Don Juan </em>during this period (1962–65).</p>
               <p>Zha’s Keats translations were quickly drowned in the overall enthusiasm for the headlong
                  Great Leap Forward Campaign launched in 1958. This was Mao’s ambitious scheme to rapidly
                  transform the agrarian China into a socialist nation through industrialization and
                  collectivization, which ended up in famine. In the field of literature and art, the
                  “Great Leap Forward” meant to attack the tendencies to “elevate the classic and debase
                  our contemporary literature” and those that “preferred Western to Chinese literature.”
                  Keats became an increasingly minor poet in Chinese readership and scholarship, as
                  evident in the standard university textbook <em>Western European Literary History</em>, first published in 1964 and used until almost the end of the twentieth century.
                  As the title of the Romanticism section, “British Romanticism, Byron, Shelley,” indicates,
                  Keats is given much lighter weight than the other two poets. His class stance is defined
                  as anti-feudal in <em>Isabella</em> and <em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em>, progressive in <em>Hyperion</em>, but escapist after all in his “aestheticism” (2:67–68).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III.</span></h2>
               <p>With the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the ensuing sudden outburst
                  of the long-repressed craving for art and poetry, especially Western ones, among Chinese
                  readers, the last two and a half decades of the twentieth century witnessed a gradual
                  revival of Keats. In 1983, Zhu Weiji’s translation of Keats’s poetry, <em>Selected Poems of Keats</em>, was published, but Zhu, also the translator of <em>Don Juan</em>, <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, and <em>Paradise Lost</em>, had already died during the Cultural Revolution. By also including <em>Endymion</em>, <em>Hyperion</em>, and <em>Lamia</em>, this selection significantly expands Zha’s translation of sixty-five poems which
                  are mainly short lyrics, the longest being <em>Isabella</em> and<em>The Eve of St. Agnes</em>.</p>
               <p>In 1991, the most authoritative scholarly work on English Romanticism in China, Wang
                  Zuoliang’s <em>History of English Romantic Poetry</em>, was published, giving the most holistic, in-depth, and sympathetic review of Keats
                  up to the day. Wang, who returned to China in 1949 after obtaining B. Litt at Oxford,
                  was a leading scholar of British literary studies in the latter half of the twentieth
                  century. He was also an enthusiastic champion of Zha Liangzheng’s poetry and translation,
                  on top of being Zha’s fellow student at the Southwestern Associated University and
                  his dear friend for a lifetime. Wang’s scholarly work became a milestone on the path
                  of Keats’s restoration in China. Unlike the two Soviet literary histories, the Keats
                  chapter in Wang’s <em>History</em> is the longest, longer than all the other five chapters on the rest of the “Big Six,”
                  reaching almost a hundred pages, whereas Byron is given thirty pages, and Shelley,
                  sixty. The chapter is a thoroughgoing introduction with generous quotations from Keats’s
                  poetry (in translation), starting from the very first “Imitation of Spenser” and going
                  through the early poems, <em>Endymion</em>, post-<em>Endymion</em> sonnets, short lyrics, narratives, the plays, the two <em>Hyperion</em>s, and the great odes. Quotations from Keats’s letters (in translation) are also extensive,
                  including the most important passages on poetics, such as the “authenticity of the
                  Imagination,” “negative capability,” “the camelion poet,” poetry with “a palpable
                  design,” Keats’s “poetic axioms,” “mansion of many apartments,” and the “vale of soul-making.”
                  The last part of the chapter concludes with Keats’s distinctive features, including
                  his poetic status as among the greatest English poets, his amazingly rapid progress
                  made especially in his “Great Year,” his deep insights into life and poetry conveyed
                  in his letters, and his transitional role in taking after Spenser, Shakespeare, and
                  Milton and passing his legacy on to Tennyson, the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne, Wallace
                  Stevens, and most relevantly, to Xu Zhimo and Wen Yiduo in China. As Wang concludes,
                  Keats is both a nineteenth-century man and our contemporary, having had to face many
                  problems of modernity. He thus highlights Keats’s post-Romantic qualities (292), which
                  has been a central issue in Western Keats scholarship in the latter half of the twentieth
                  century as well. Throughout the chapter, one can see that Wang had kept up-to-date
                  with Keats scholarship in the English-speaking world for the past four decades from
                  his citation of secondary sources, which include leading Keats scholars from the beginning
                  of the century to the 1980s, such as John Middleton Murry, Douglas Bush, Walter Jackson
                  Bate, Robert Gittings, and the more recent Helen Vendler. The fact that China had
                  been cut off from the West for about four decades made Wang’s work all the more impressive
                  a feat. Wang’s work is therefore historic in the sense that it resumes the dialogue
                  between Chinese and Western scholars and in turn, Keats’s afterlife is regenerated
                  when China itself was experiencing a regeneration.</p>
               <p>In 1995, a symposium was jointly hosted by Chinese Translators Association and Renmin
                  Wenxue Chubanshe (People’s Literature Press) to commemorate Keats’s bicentennial,
                  two years after which the current standard Keats translation by Tu An was put to press.
                  The translation opens with the great odes, followed by fifty-five sonnets, lyrics
                  and ballads, narratives, and finally romances and epics, which include the entire
                  <em>Endymion</em> and <em>Hyperion</em>. The translator’s preface encapsulates the sense of transition from the politicized
                  reading of the last four decades that slighted Keats to the recent revival of the
                  poet’s reputation. Keats’s political stance is stressed as before: “In terms of his
                  opposition to tyranny and oppression and longing for democracy and freedom, Keats
                  stands together with Byron and Shelley, even though he has not suggested revolution
                  and reform like they have” (3).Citing even more early poems to demonstrate Keats’s
                  “democratic awareness,” Tu An also quotes Shaw’s association of <em>Isabella</em> with <em>The Capital</em> as Soviet critics did. On the other hand, he points out the Shakespearean qualities
                  in Keats and discusses Keats’s letters. Most remarkably, the translator introduces
                  the more up-to-date criticism from the English-speaking world, which challenges the
                  earlier evaluation of Keats as a sensuous aesthete with more recent findings on the
                  poet’s close engagement with history and politics (3). Though not directly citing
                  any English secondary source, his remark reveals an awareness of the historicized
                  reading of Keats prevalent from the late 1970s onward in Britain and America. In this
                  sense, Tu An carried on the dialogue between Chinese and Western Keats scholars resumed
                  in Wang Zuoliang’s work. He finally pays tribute to the preceding generations of Keats
                  translators, namely, Zhu Xiang, Zha Liangzheng, and Zhu Weiji, at the close of his
                  preface, thus writing the past into the present of Keats scholarship in China and
                  extending Keats’s afterlife in China to the turn of the century.</p>
               <p>However, for all the strenuous efforts Wang and Tu made to restore Keats to the eminent
                  status he deserved among English poets, one should not be over-optimistic in estimating
                  the impact of their works, which, after all, were mainly circulated among specialists.
                  Even in the post-Mao era, Keats remained the lesser English Romantic than Byron and
                  Shelley among common readers. Within the academic circle, the number of scholarly
                  publications on Keats, much lower than that of works on Byron, shows no sign that
                  Keats’s reputation in China was growing dramatically. </p>
               <p>This can be corroborated with a brief look at the state of Keats translation and study
                  in the twenty-first century. <em>Keats’s Letters</em>, translated by Wang Xinruo, was published in 2003, but the preface penned by the
                  translator makes an evident mistake in stating that Keats’s father “was murdered”
                  when he was eight (1). Another important work was Fu Yanxiu’s <em>Keats: A Critical Biography</em> published in 2008. In the preface and the afterword, the author points out rightly
                  that in China, Keats had long been overshadowed by Byron and Shelley, both of whom
                  inspired admiration more easily than Keats in the turbulent context of the early twentieth
                  century (11). One of the purposes of his biography, he claims, is to correct the misleading
                  portrayal of Keats as “a second-rate figure” provided by some textbooks in China and
                  the dated misconception of Keats as an aesthete and a weakling killed off by his reviewers
                  (464). He also draws a parallel between Keats’s England and contemporary China in
                  the rapid process of commercialization and suggests, “some phenomena that took place
                  in Manchester and Glasgow are replaying in many cities in China” (12). One is not
                  sure whether he has the dark Satanic mills or Peterloo Massacre in his mind when writing
                  this. It is for this parallel, he concludes, that Keats is most needed now in China
                  for his humanism and passion for poetry (11–12).</p>
               <p>By looking at the trajectory of Keats’s reception that underwent appropriation, oblivion,
                  and restoration in twentieth-century China where tempestuous ideological changes had
                  taken place, one can see that the original text had been constantly reshaped by its
                  foreign context. Keats’s poetry, however, with its tranquil resistance, refused to
                  be trodden down by these hungry generations and still survives. In this unfamiliar
                  nation, Keats “[found] his happiness in another kind of wood,” and “[was] punished
                  under a foreign code of conscience” (“In Memory of W. B. Yeats”). Throughout the twentieth
                  century, Keats had been evoked for various causes—as the other to the Satanic poets,
                  as the other to both the reactionary and the revolutionary Romantics, as a poetic
                  hero for modern Chinese poets, and as a humanist against the rampant modernization
                  and industrialization in China. These multiple Keatses (Stillinger 10), partial as
                  they all are, testify to Keats’s multi-faceted richness and indeterminacy achieved
                  by his remarkably sympathetic imagination and honesty about the human condition that
                  lend his poetry a peculiar contemporaneousness for different generations of his Chinese
                  readers. As Keats famously writes about “the poetical Character,” “that sort of which,
                  if I am anything, I am a member,” a poet “has no identity—he is continually in for—and
                  filling some other Body” (1:386–87). In those foreign bodies of others that he continually
                  fills, Keats’s afterlife is carried on vigorously. </p>

               the U.S., Britain and several other Western countries for the damages caused during
