            <p class="noCount">This paper offers a historical and aesthetic discussion of the influence that Keats’s
               poetry had on Japanese modern poetry. The enthusiastic reception of Keats in the period
               roughly ranging from 1880 to 1910 coincided with Meiji Japan’s obsessive appropriation
               of Western culture. The coincidence between the acceptance of Keats and Japan’s Westernization
               articulates a situation not solely attributable to the incorporation of Western poetic
               diction and imagery into Japanese poetry. Rather, Keats’s influence on Japanese poetry
               was an extension of the contemporary changes in perception that had been cultivated
               through the reading of Chinese literature. The transformation in the mode of perception
               illuminates how English Romantic poetry initiated a turning point in the cognition
               of Meiji literati to reinvent landscape in a new language; the acceptance of Keats
               in Japan advanced a process that enabled modern Japanese poets to defamiliarize conventional
               topoi and invent a new, more “real” landscape. </p>

               <p>The enthusiastic reception of Keats in the Meiji period from around 1880 to 1910 coincided
                  with the larger process of Japan’s obsessive appropriation of Western culture. In
                  their acknowledgement of Keats’s art, Japanese poets experimented with alternative
                  voices that deviated from conventional aesthetic codes embodying premodern modes of
                  perceiving the external world. In other words, introduction to Keats enabled modern
                  Japanese poets to defamiliarize conventional topoi and invent an alternative, more
                  “real” landscape. This paper considers how Keats’s poetry initiated a turning point
                  in the cognition of Meiji literati leading to their reinvention of landscape. The
                  newly invented landscape illuminates the modes of expression they acquired to project
                  the internal space of the self—the inner self that vigorously swells into expression
                  and articulates lyrical passion and intensity.

            <p>As Augustin Berque argues, aesthetic modes invent “landscape”; without modes of cognition,
               there can only exist the pre-artistic conditions of “circumstance” (49–50). It is
               the aesthetically educated “eye” which composes the vision of scenes into “landscape.”
               Similarly, in his highly influential book, <em>Origins of Modern Japanese Literature</em>, Karatani Kojin declares how we accustom ourselves to seeing a pre-conceptualized
               transcendental vision of the external world: <span class="quote">‘[M]edieval European painting and landscape painting share something in common that
                  differentiates them from modern landscape painting. In both, <em>place</em> is conceived of in transcendental terms. For a brush painter to depict a pine grove
                  meant to depict the concept (that which is signified by) “pine grove,” not an existing
                  pine grove. This transcendental vision of space had to be overturned before painters
                  could see existing pine groves as their subjects. (27)’</span> The issue is, as Karatani points out, our lack of awareness that “the painter is
               not looking at an object but envisioning the transcendental” (21). Therefore, to deviate
               from the established “transcendental vision,” modes of poetic vision have to be replaced
               by <em>new</em> mode of seeing. Karatani further argues that the rediscovery of existing phenomena
               requires the “repression of the signification, or figurative language (Chinese characters)
               that precedes ‘things,’ as well as the existence of a language which is supposedly
               transparent” (61). In the Meiji period, the Japanese literary milieu was strongly
               under the influence of Chinese literature, so that to raise a voice against the established
               conventions meant marginalizing the original Chinese modes of poetic representation.</p>
            <p>Consequently, the exploration of the unfamiliar terrain of English poetry involved
               implementing a transformation of the conventional Japanese mode of perception to a
               new aesthetic manner. The absorption of English Romantic poetry was not only a matter
               of semiotic change in the relationship between language and things, but it also meant
               inventing landscape by abandoning the transcendental model which the premodern Chinese
               literature had historically constructed in Japan. Karatani accurately regards the
               birth of the “inner man” stationed in “an introverted, solitary situation” as the
               occasion in which landscape was “discovered” (25). Landscape does not exist as what
               is outside. The “external world” itself had to be “discovered” (26). For the new poetry,
               it was the “inner man,” who did not “look outside,” that was able to reinvent “landscape”
               and demonstrate the period’s alienation from the transcendental vision of landscape
               (25). A more “real” landscape was formulated in the radical innovative mode of expression,
               which was developed to project the introverted self. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Indeed, a metamorphosis in perception was required to engender a modern poetic mode
                  that challenged the aesthetic codes informed by the premodern legacy of Japanese literature.
                  In alignment with the reformative movement, Kunikida Doppo (1871–1908), who is regarded
                  as having instituted a new language in his novel <em>Musashino</em> (1898) by describing the suburbs of Tokyo and focusing on a white birch never previously
                  included as an element of Japanese scenery (Berque 48), debated the issue of accommodating
                  natural imagery: <span class="quote">‘I have never had any ideas about what style I should choose to describe nature. Neither
                     do I care much about a particular literary style for depicting nature. In any case,
                     you can choose whatever style you might like. However, we should take it into consideration
                     that the writers, who are cultivated enough to appreciate the numerous travelogue-styled <span class="foreign">waka</span> compositions, and read and skillfully manipulate passages from the Chinese, tend to
                     intensively focus on the style of writing, and end up ruining nature as their subject.
                     To observe and depict nature, we have to describe simply what we see and what we intuitively
                     perceive. (299)
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The translation of the quotation from Kunikida is my own.</span></div>
                     </div>’</span> Kunikida proposed an appropriate response to nature, aiming to drive poetry instinctively
                  towards the “real” entities of the external world. A writer’s motives to reproduce
                  the natural world originate in subjectivity, the human agency that responds dynamically
                  to the visible object. Turning away from the formats prescribed by traditional criteria,
                  the poet’s perception is valorized by envisioning “nature” <em>per se</em>. In effect, Kunikida recognizes that a deep appreciation of Japanese traditional
                  poetry and Chinese classical literature is likely to run counter to the dynamic formulation
                  of perceived “nature” and a vital aesthetic formula which could afford the writer
                  a heightened, innovative response to the outer world. Travelers searching for the
                  picturesque fail to look beyond the determined form of landscape, since pre-determined
                  aesthetics frames a prescribed picture of the external world. At stake is the issue
                  of turning the existing paradigm of cognition into a new aesthetic mode of perception.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Historically, the established modes of imagery, rhythm, and diction in traditional
               Japanese verse were overshadowed by the long-cultivated aesthetics derived from Chinese
               literature and Japan’s own literary legacy of <span class="foreign">waka</span> (a five-seven-five-seven-seven-syllable Japanese poem: the <span class="foreign">tanka</span>). Also, figurally, the traditional landscape in Japanese poetry was derived from
               strong affinities and interaction with Chinese landscape drawings (Tanaka 54–55).
               For instance, the specific terrains of a pine grove, the thin white ribbons of plunging
               water denoting a waterfall, a river, and a mountain have been identified as analogues
               for conventional elements of Chinese scenery [figure 1]. </p>

            <p>A stock visual vocabulary of signs—a mountain, a pine tree and a waterfall—pre-conceptualizes
               the actual scenery to the extent that in the <span class="foreign">waka</span> form these signs are shared, stable, communal referents of beauty, independent of
               any actual travel experience and witnessing of their reality. Artistic landscape provided
               a means with which to view the phenomenal world, but not <em>vice versa</em> [figure 2].</p>

            <p>While people traditionally shared enculturated perspectives for viewing the world,
               the entrenched artifice in the Chinese context had exhausted the possibility for profuse
               meanings of “real” nature, and it gradually eroded other possible conceptions of the
               natural in poetry. In fact, in pre-Meiji poetry, “real” nature had always been a vital
               presence, but modern Japanese poets were confronted by a burgeoning awareness of “landscape”
               and the necessity of overthrowing prolonged Chinese influence.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For instance, Tayama Katai (1871–1930), who made a great contribution to the original
                  Japanese style of the <span class="foreign">Shishosetsu</span> (the autobiographical novel), seems to wrestle artistically with the inherited style
                  of envisaging nature in his lyric, “Araiso” (“A Rocky Shore”) composed in 1897 (Tayama
                  23–24). The poem constructs the seashore furnished with the conventional icons of
                  pine trees and waves in the seven-and-five-syllable form. Further, the poet tries
                  to integrate the archetypal seascape with the poet’s lonely self:

                  </blockquote> The illustrations of pine trees and rocky shore convey the poet’s alienation from
                  the addressed beloved. However, Tayama’s utterly conventional fabrication of the seascape
                  and its environs is largely dissociated from his subjectivity. The <span class="foreign">waka</span> form with its seven-and-five-syllable meter and brief sentences seems unable to offer
                  room enough for the poet to expand his emotional range. Eventually, the “I” wandering
                  the shore is never unified with the landscape, nor are the objects of perception claimed
                  as vital resources to express the poet’s solitary anxiety. The external world is,
                  as it were, merely a stage, because the poet rigidly projects his mood on the outside
                  world. Therefore, the delineation of “real” nature does not merely involve <span class="foreign">shaei</span> 写生 (observing and depicting), or the projection of emotion onto nature as a backdrop,
                  but also makes an alternative process necessary—a process of establishing an innovative
                  form of expression which could unify and articulate both nature and the introverted
                  poetic self. Beyond the subject and the object, the interaction between the inner
                  and the outer was to offer a newly acquired space for lyrical passion and intensity
                  in the Western style.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The year 1897 was crucial in its heralding of a new age of Japanese poetry—it was
               the year Shimazaki Toson (1872–1943), one of the period’s leading men of letters,
               published his first book of lyrical poems entitled <em>Wakana-shu</em> (<em>Seedlings</em>). In the introduction to the volume of poetry he published seven years after <em>Wakana-shu</em>, Shimazaki provocatively declared that the time had come at last to resuscitate poetry
               in the national context (Shimazaki, <em>Anthology</em> 564). Deliberately positioned as artistic reinvention, his poems challenged the prevailing
               codes in the Japanese literary heritage. For instance, “Aki no Uta” (“Song of Autumn”),
               one of his lyrical poems in <em>Wakana-shu</em>, exemplifies the drastic change in perception by transforming the conventional aesthetic
               codes of describing the autumnal period (Shimazaki, <em>Wakana-shu</em> 138–39). Explicitly reflecting the influence of Keats’s “To Autumn” and “Ode to a
               Nightingale,” the poem builds up a “foreign” realm with elements of Western landscape:</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p> Shimazaki’s “Song of Autumn” adjusts the already-established codes of autumn to a
               sense of pathos, employing the seven-and-five-syllable meter characteristic of traditional
               Japanese verse. However, his subtle celebration of autumn reaches for the radically
               unconventional images of an aeolian harp and a cup of wine, derived from Coleridge
               and Keats respectively. The Japanese autumnal landscape blessed by nature’s prolific
               growth and conventionally enhanced by the yellow and brown hues of rice fields and
               chestnuts, is associated with Western figures of the harp and the purple wine. Moreover,
               in the last stanza, by granting “you” a face aware of winter’s approach, the poem
               extends the pathos of life’s transiency, so that the first person narrator wishes
               to share this melancholy with “you,” by asking to play the pipe while the “I” sings.
               The “I” attempts to overcome the evanescence of life by finding consolation in love
               and in the arts; and this escapist manner of lamentation is highly reminiscent of
               the Keats’s imaginative flight away with the nightingale. In this way, the scene is
               embellished with Keatsian poetic visions, and the poet’s attempts at observation and
               description reveal significant adjustments to a pathetic autumnal landscape with the
               introduction of intoxicating wine and subsequent melancholy. Eventually, Shimazaki’s
               “Song of Autumn” renovates the formulaic autumn scene by remarking on the sensuous
               pleasure of ripeness and the pathos of time’s transiency producing the season’s dynamic
               disharmonies.</p>
            <p>Predictably, however, Shimazaki’s poetry was not totally dissociated from the established
               literary criteria of traditional Japanese form, because the addressed “you” is an
               impersonal figure, and the expressive mode of “you” functions as a rhetorical figuration
               solely to articulate the other person to whom the “I” vainly dedicates his love (Isoda,
               “<em>Wakana-shu</em>” 460–62). Moreover, though the “I” might represent the poet’s consciousness, it is
               not granted its own unique individuality drawn from a deep interiority. Self-evidently,
               the piece does not attain the atmosphere of high Romantic landscape, where intense
               feelings of love, fear, or despair imbue the scene until the internal space of the
               self swells into expression and animates the outer world. Inevitably, Shimazaki’s
               volume was situated between an acquired Westernized sensibility and traditional Japanese
               aesthetics: a fusion of both the innovative and the orthodox. Indeed, this could be
               seen as a state of <em>confusion</em>, both maintaining the contemporary predicament and aspiring to the revolutionary
               poetics of the late 1890s and early 1900s, which were by no means limited to Meiji
               Japan.</p>
            <p>Intriguingly, discerning a new mode for describing nature, Shimazaki was attracted
               to Keats’s idiosyncratic and highly subjective application of the term “indolence”
               in reading Book II of <em>Endymion</em> (Matsuura 299): “as when heav’d anew / Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,
               / Down whose green back the short-liv’d foam, all hoar, / Bursts gradual, with a wayward
               indolence” (Keats, <em>Poems</em>, 2.347–50). For Japanese poets traditionally, ocean waves had been seen—or rather
               had been conceptualized before being seen—as transcendental. A wave is a wave; yet
               a wave might not be a wave. Shimazaki seems to have experienced a transformation in
               aesthetic paradigm by encountering a poetic landscape inflected by “indolence.” He
               identified the internalized landscape of the ocean in Keats’s poetry as an instance
               of modern “pathetic fallacy” in which the centrality of the poet’s inner self increasingly
               grows (“On Landscape Painting” 800). Significantly, he articulated the modernity of
               Keats’s subjective description, while contrasting it with Homer’s objective sublimation
               of waves into grand spectacle as a means of embracing the infinite power of the gods
               (“On Landscape Painting” 800–02). Just as the configuration of a pine tree or Mount
               Fuji epitomized customary ways of viewing nature, so the Homeric epic constituted
               a communal narrative of the Greek deities, being the accepted poetic mode of taking
               pride in national culture and history. Shimazaki seems to have recognized the modernity
               of internalized realms through his encounters with both the Homeric world and the
               internalized space of Keats’s seascape.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From this perspective, we can see that Japanese literature customarily shared received
                  narratives in order to embrace the public sphere, but this was never received as the
                  dissociated space of private territory. For instance, the elite samurai were well-grounded
                  in literary knowledge appropriated from Chinese literature. This cultivation of literary
                  taste endorsed an ideal which worked to both the public and the private good, enabling
                  better comprehension of how the world was organized in the service of the nation,
                  while also educating individuals in aesthetic taste as a samurai’s silent but eloquent
                  proof of devotion to his lord. Instead of advocating dilettantism, the samurai’s self-cultivation
                  of tastes in Chinese literature involved a common cause of loyalty and patriotism,
                  since the style modeled on Chinese classical literature was employed in contemporary
                  political and diplomatic scenes, and the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of Chinese
                  writings meant the samurai’s constant awareness of affairs of state (Saito 126–29).
                  Therefore, the Japanese literary milieu entailed a preestablished harmony between
                  the individual and the public sphere, disclaiming the deployment of the individual
                  as an isolated figure cut off from the outer world (Isoda, “English Romanticism” 150).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Intriguingly, the negation of subjectivity toward the outer world in Japanese aesthetics
                           was embraced enthusiastically by the Western art world and established its influence
                           as Japonism, which functioned as a counter system to destabilize the Cartesian cognitive
                           manner in the late nineteenth-century Europe. (Berque 66–72).</span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>As Augustin Berque argues, in Western aesthetics since the Renaissance, when the concept
               of “landscape” was instituted, the cognitive mode of seeing had presupposed the Cartesian
               model based on the demarcation between the subject and the outer world, a clear division
               witnessed later in the device of the <span class="foreign">camera obscura</span> (53–58). This cognitive system, which enclosed the human agent, enabled the perception
               of the outer world through a hole, and granted a fixed stance of self-preservation
               (Newton 51–52). The secured posture of the subject participated in part in the formulation
               of the autonomous modern self. In this vein, the Romantic aesthetic mode can be seen
               as embedded in a conflict-ridden oscillation between the poet’s inner self and the
               external world.</p>
            <p>Conversely, the Meiji literati regarded themselves as socially integrated presences,
               devoted to public virtue, and simultaneously refined both private and national tastes,
               having acquired the aesthetic codes established through Chinese literature. However,
               in the process of Japan’s economic and cultural Westernization, a clearer articulation
               of inner identity was to gain prominence over a harmonious attitude toward the external
               world. Eventually, the formulation of a modern autonomous self engendered a greater
               sense of human agency in Japanese aesthetics, which inflected the outer world with
               a deeper interiority and invented a new phenomenology of landscape through a new mode
               of seeing. Indeed, in the Meiji era, the literary sensibility derived from the Chinese
               context came to be destabilized through the techniques gained from the West, establishing
               a more engaged interaction with the modern private self. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Therefore, the acceptance of Romantic poetry implies that Japanese poets were conscious
                  that the communally adopted stance with which to perceive the visible object could
                  be modified, and they confronted this by observing the phenomenal presence of the
                  outer world. Over and against the cultural climate embedded in the Chinese context,
                  the process of revolutionizing Japanese culture focused less on the balance between
                  the communal sphere and private interest than on the centrality of the individual.
                  Unlike the integrated classical chorus, modern voices could be realized through the
                  celebration of a landscape invoking the introverted space of the private self. Indeed,
                  there was a prevailing sense that a <em>new</em> language was in need to register and explore the modern Japanese self.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Importantly, we can find English parallels to the transformation of the aesthetic
                           paradigm in the Meiji Japan. For example, T. S. Eliot formulated a definition of English
                           Romantic poetry as dissociation from a “unified sensibility” that directly relates
                           to Dante (Karatani 53). Eliot situated his notion of a “unified sensibility” in a
                           pre-Romantic and pre-Cartesian past, in the time of Dante, when “non- Romantic” direct
                           and symbolic images still existed (Patea 17). </span></div>

            </div>
            <p>In effect, the Westernization movement initiated <span class="foreign">genbun-icchi</span>—“the unification of the written and spoken language”—which was founded on Japan’s
               imperative to establish a modern nation and a contemporary functional Japanese language
               that would be appropriate for absorbing and disseminating Western culture. The reinvention
               of the national language called for a prioritization of the spoken against the written
               word in the conviction that a phonetic revision of written language guaranteed the
               attainment of Westernization and release from the restraints of the literary Chinese
               characters (Karatani 46–47, 69–70). In this key transition from writing to orality,
               the new Japanese literature was to play an active and essential role, and the coincidence
               between Japan’s acceptance of Keats and linguistic reform encapsulates a situation
               not solely attributable to the incorporation of Western poetic diction and imagery.
               It was also closely interrelated with contemporary changes in modes of perception
               that had been cultivated through the tradition of reading Chinese literature.</p>
            <p>In fact, as in Romantic poetry, Japanese traditional <span class="foreign">waka</span> and Chinese poetry projected the individual poet’s feelings onto nature (Saito 166–69).
               However, it seems that the contemporary Japanese vogue for Westernized aesthetics
               stimulated by Romantic poetry was a symptom of Japan’s lack of its own quintessential
               vision with which to represent the private self. The issue at stake in the reception
               of Keats concerned the poets’ abilities to maneuver and relativize their stances towards
               nature, rather than their total employment of Westernized imagery and style. For instance,
               Tsubouchi Shoyo (1859–1935), who was well versed in English literature, specified
               Keats’s “Human Seasons” as a desired interfusing of the poet’s subjectivity and the
               seasons, actually quoting Keats’s poem: “quiet coves / His soul has in its Autumn,
               when his wings / He furleth close; contented so to look / On mists in idleness–to
               let fair things / Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook” (Tsubouchi 620–21). The passive
               retreat in the poet’s “soul” enacts Keats’s ambition not merely to attach a gloomy
               mood to the autumn scene, but to evoke the introverted intensity of the poet himself,
               who calmly “looks on” the transiency of beauty and youthful strength.</p>
            <p>Struggling to explore visions embedded in the inner self, the Japanese poets needed
               a gestation period to invent a new mode of expression. Japanese Romantic landscape
               was to finally gain ground in the work of Susukida Kyukin (1877–1945). His first volume
               of poems <em>Botekishu</em> (<em>A Pipe in the Evening</em>), published in 1899, was strongly influenced by Keats. “Boshun no Fu” (“On the Late
               Spring”) begins with a clear invocation of “Ode to a Nightingale” (Susukida 18). Just
               as Keats craves for a “draught of vintage! that hath been / Cool'd a long age in the
               deep-delved earth” (“Nightingale” 11–12), Susukida longs for the taste of fine, richly
               colored red wine. However, while Keats is intoxicated with ecstasies reminiscent of
               the escapist flight with the nightingale, Susukida is disturbed by Spring growing
               dim in the dusky evening, an awareness substantiated in physical discomfort: </p>

            <p> Bodily imagery enters to convey agony, not through the distance of metaphor, but
               through the immediate description of the “emaciated arm,” as in Keats’s agony in his
               “living hand” (“This living hand” 1), or Hyperion’s “giant nerve” (<em>Hyperion</em>, 1.175). These overtly corporeal visions offer the archetypally Romantic imagined
               moment in which empirical sensation is imbued with the truth of human pathos. And

               flowers. In this distinct appearance, <span class="foreign">Saohime</span> bridges the esoteric boundaries between the immortal realm of the Spring Goddess
               and the earthly Japanese landscape. Etymologically, the name <span class="foreign">Saohime</span> derives from Mount <span class="foreign">Sao</span>, located to the east of the <span class="foreign">Heijo</span> Palace and the site of the former capital city of the <span class="foreign">Nara</span> period (710–784), with the east signifying Spring in ancient Chinese philosophy (“<span class="foreign">Saohime</span>”). Yet Susukida expands on the traditional poetic tropes for Spring, such as the
               goddess personifying the season veiled in a haze, now rendering her as an alternative
               embodied human presence alongside that of the poet’s in a vital but non-mythological
               landscape. The path that <span class="foreign">Saohime</span> treads and the breath that she expels invoke the poet’s own phenomenal actions and
               anxieties.</p>
            <p>Tracing <span class="foreign">Saohime</span>’s journey himself, wandering in the field at dusk, the poet transforms the darkness
               into a visionary space of deliberate and powerful images in the next stanza. The poem
               embraces Keats’s imagery of “Ode to a Nightingale” in its exploration of the darkness:
               “I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, / Nor what soft incense hangs upon the
               boughs, / But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet / Wherewith the seasonable month
               endows / The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild” (“Nightingale” 41–45). Susukida
               defines the dusky evening with vigorous images of fresh verdure and sweet-scented
               pollen, which ironically denote the paradox of the declining vitality of Spring: </p>

            <p> In the next stanza, as the poet shifts his gaze from the shades of the flowers to
               the dusk, the bright star which heralds Summer’s return holds him in derision, causing
               an anguished recognition of the difference between the eternally glittering starlight
               and mortal existence, as in Keats’s “Bright Star.” Then his indolent but intense sensory

            <p> Susukida expands his poetic effects in a further range of sensory impressions: the
               Japanese harp added to the peony and its fragrance. Whereas according to the poetic
               convention, peonies, like <span class="foreign">Saohime</span>, symbolize spring and female beauty, here the sound of the flowers shedding their
               petals manifests the Romantic grievances of bitterness over the brevity of a life
               span and the vulnerability of human existence; the figure of <span class="foreign">Saohime</span> is similarly revitalized by feelings of resentment. The renewed fragility of the
               poet gains apotheosis in the darkness and in the diminution into a Keatsian entity
               of “easeful Death” (“Nightingale” 52).</p>
            <p>Yet, the last stanza suddenly bursts into an unprecedented intensity of feeling:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">O, in the resentful Spring darkness,</div>

            <p> The spring dusk might extinguish the poet’s passion, which he hopes does not burn
               itself out, as it is the very feverish emotion that the fading Flora inspired, although
               she too almost expires in her vitality. However overwhelming the ephemeral visions
               in the Spring dusk seem, the landscape is entirely dominated by the “burning passion”
               through which <span class="foreign">Saohime</span>’s presence intermingles with the poet’s figure. The strong emotions, however poisonous
               or spiritual, and which are aroused by resentment and curses, are dramatically sublimated
               into permanent passion and formulate the Romantic landscape of a deeper interior.</p>
            <p>Susukida envisions the evening as the introverted darkness within the poet, whereas
               Keats defined a valley or a bower as a place to celebrate the extreme feelings of
               pleasure and pain. These specific spaces are also shared by Susukida, who embraces
               the opportunity to dramatize the inner self in the passion and intensity of sensuous
               imagery. In particular, Susukida reinvents the conventional Japanese scenery with
               his own personalized Romantic formulae, rather than restrictively borrowing from the
               catalogue of Westernized imagery. The particular configuration of the spring dusk,
               <span class="foreign">Saohime</span>, and the poet’s inner self, induce a Romantic darkness, in which we recognize a new
               poetic language metamorphosing the traditional Japanese spring landscape. Here, neither
               “real” nature, nor the overt gloom of the Romantic poet’s self can be clearly discerned.
               This critical moment invites a potentially fruitful reconsideration of English Romanticism
               in the presence of unfamiliar Japanese landscapes and semantics.</p>

               was embraced enthusiastically by the Western art world and established its influence
               as Japonism, which functioned as a counter system to destabilize the Cartesian cognitive

               Romantic poetry as dissociation from a “unified sensibility” that directly relates
               to Dante (Karatani 53). Eliot situated his notion of a “unified sensibility” in a
               pre-Romantic and pre-Cartesian past, in the time of Dante, when “non- Romantic” direct
               and symbolic images still existed (Patea 17). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
