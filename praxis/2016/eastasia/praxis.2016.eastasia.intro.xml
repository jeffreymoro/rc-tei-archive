                <p rend="noCount">This volume brings together essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and
                    Korea to offer an unprecedented view of English Romanticism’s presence in the
                    modern literature and literary criticism of East Asia. Going beyond simply
                    tracing the influence of English Romantic writing on East Asian writers and
                    critics, each essay reveals an intrinsic and often surprising interconnectedness
                    in the Romantic aesthetics and mode of thought across the borders of East and
                    West. This collection’s reflection on English Romanticism through the historical
                    particularities of East Asian nations at the onset of modernity sheds light on
                    Romanticism as a still valid form of cultural critique against the shared yet
                    divergent forms, experiences, and questions of modernity.</p>

                    <p>East Asian countries, traditionally belonging to a common “Chinese character
                        cultural sphere,” have shared the same written sign to refer to the
                        “Romantic”: 浪漫. The origin of this word is the French
                            <foreign>roman</foreign>, which the Japanese began to transcribe
                        phonetically with these very Chinese characters in the late nineteenth
                        century. Inscribed within the word itself is the history of East Asia’s
                        import of Romanticism from European cultures. To break ground on what may be
                        a bewilderingly large project, I begin this introduction to English
                        Romanticism in East Asia with three figurative junctures in the literary
                        histories of China, Japan, and Korea. These synecdochic sketches, each
                        showing an archetypal Romantic figure taking root in a new host and mutating
                        into an uncanny form of revolution, melancholy, or rebellion, evoke some of
                        the main historical and aesthetic issues that entailed the presence of
                        Romanticism in the modern imagination of East Asia. </p>

                            writers and critics of Asian nationality will be marked in their
                            original form—the family name preceding the given name. The names of the
                            contributors to this volume will be the only exception, following the
                            English convention for index purposes.</note> (1881–1936), one of the
                        most influential writers of twentieth-century China, is well known for
                        writing novels that embody the trials of a nation undergoing radical
                        transformation. Not many know that he was also one of the most important
                        translators of modern China, committed to translating Marxist literary
                        theories to define himself as a leftist intellectual in the midst of
                        vigorous debates on revolutionary literature. In his essay “‘Hard
                        Translation’ and the ‘Class Character of Literature’” (1930), Lu Xun cuts a
                        unique figure for the translator: <quote>To chew and anatomize the enemy now
                            seems inevitable, but if we have a book of anatomy and a book of cuisine
                            to guide our practice, then the structure [for anatomy] and the taste
                            [for chewing] can be clearer and better. People like to compare
                            Prometheus, the legendary figure in the Greek mythology, to
                            revolutionaries, believing that the magnanimity and forbearance, which
                            Prometheus showed when he was punished by Zeus but remained unrepentant
                            for stealing fire for man, are the same [as that of a revolutionary].
                            But I stole fire from foreign countries only with the intention of
                            cooking my own flesh, in the hope that if I find the taste agreeable, it
                            would benefit more to those who chew [my flesh], and the consumption of
                            my body would not prove in vain.<note place="foot">Wang Pu 330–31,
                                quoted from Lu Xun, “‘Hard Translation’ and the ‘Class Character of
                                Literature,’” <title level="m">Selected Works of Lu Hsun</title>,
                                trans. Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang, vol. 3 (Beijing: Foreign
                                Languages Press, 1960) 82.</note></quote> Casting the translator
                        into a Promethean figure, Lu Xun not only redefines the role of the Chinese
                        translator in modern China but also reshapes the Promethean figure by
                        dislocating it from the Western context. The Promethean translator steals
                        fire from foreign countries not merely to pass it on to Chinese readers; he
                        uses the fire to cook his own flesh, making it more palatable to both
                        himself and the readers. As Wang Pu astutely notes, “[c]ooking one’s own
                        body with the foreign fire and tasting one’s own cooked flesh is evidently
                        an allegorical scenario of meticulous self-criticism and self-dissemination”
                        (333). Lu Xun’s self-annihilating translator emerges from a rigorous
                        criticism of the revolutionary possibilities of simply transplanting foreign
                        ideas to the Chinese consciousness. The corporeality of the cannibalistic
                        allegory overrides and distorts the enlightened idealism of the rebellious
                        Prometheus, echoing Mary Shelley’s perversion of Percy Shelley’s
                        revolutionary idealism through the monstrous creation of her modern
                        Prometheus. However, the self-sacrifice and martyrdom of Lu Xun’s translator
                        go beyond Romantic self-criticism or self-ironization in the vein of Mary
                        Shelley or even Byron. The near Eucharistic practice of the translator
                        suggests the possibility of benevolence and common good after a painful
                        trial of self-sacrifice. </p>
                    <p>Lu Xun’s Promethean translator embodies the predicament of a nation for which
                        opening up to the modern culture of the West meant doing away with a
                        four-thousand-year-old tradition. At the turn of the century, China could no
                        longer ignore pressures both internal and external to modernize, compelled
                        to remake itself into a modern nation while defending itself against foreign
                        aggression. The Chinese Revolution of 1911, also known as the Xinhai
                        Revolution, allowed the Chinese people to overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and
                        establish the Republic of China. The Japanese writer Natsume Soseki likened
                        this event to the French Revolution, feeling the terror of witnessing the
                        revolutionary spirit quickly translating to violent upheaval and radical
                        break with the past—a lesson in historical feeling that the British knew
                        well, as noted by Soseki (Hiyama 44). That Lu Xun’s Prometheus steals a
                        “foreign” fire, however, marks a crucial difference between Eastern and
                        Western histories of modernization: modernity for the East was a condition
                        shaped by essentially extraneous and often dissonant forces while modernity
                        for the West was comparatively a condition of internal necessity and
                        voluntary progress. With rapid import of Western ideas and technologies,
                        ever intensified by such cultural reform movements as the May Fourth and New
                        Culture Movements, tradition had become an excessive vestige that needed to
                        be either removed from or incorporated into the process of modernization. Lu
                        Xun’s vehement condemnation of those foreigners who opposed China’s
                        Westernization in order to protect the exotic culture of the natives was
                        already a sign that the natives could no longer view their tradition
                        divorced from the larger historical milieu. The radical self-renovation of
                        the Promethean translator, who “cooks” his own consciousness with foreign
                        thought in order to transform Chinese culture into a much more consumable
                        form, is in line with Lu Xun’s belief that the right way to China’s
                        modernity lies in actively reorganizing and renewing tradition itself.
                        Burning one’s flesh and offering it up for people’s nourishment are the
                        price to pay for China’s modernization.</p>

                    <p>Natsume Soseki (1867–1916) is a writer without whom the discussion of modern
                        Japanese literature would be severely circumscribed. Well-versed in
                        Japanese, Chinese, and English literatures, Soseki<note place="foot">Born
                            Natsume Kinnosuke, the novelist took on the pen name of Soseki in
                            1889.</note> was acutely attentive to the state of Japanese literature
                        in the context of international literary milieu. One of his earlier novels,
                            <title level="m">Kusamakura</title> (literally meaning “grass pillow”),
                        is exemplary of the novelist’s modern consciousness. The novel, published in
                        1906, is a <foreign>Künstlerroman</foreign> composed of the inner
                        reflections and thought experiments of a young artist who goes on a walking
                        trip through the mountains and stays at a remote hot spring inn where he
                        meets a woman named Nami. The opening scene of the novel presents the artist
                        contemplating on the perfect artistic vision through which life becomes art:
                        “You have only to conjure up the world before you, and there you will find a
                        living poem, a fount of song. No need to commit your thoughts to paper—the
                        heart will already sing with a sweet inner euphony. No need to stand before
                        your easel and limn with brush and paint—the world’s vast array of forms and
                        colors already sparkles within the inner eye” (4). However, this
                        transcendental vision of unity is broken when the artist slips on a loose
                        piece of rock and ends up on his bottom. The artist’s rude awakening to the
                        physicality of the solitary walk and the ensuing reveries bring to light the
                        difficulty of life and art, which also colors his perception of a skylark
                        that “suddenly bursts into song” beneath his feet in a valley (6). As in
                        Shelley’s poem “To a Skylark,” which incidentally “leaps to my [the
                        artist’s] mind” upon hearing the skylark’s song, the unseen bird fills the
                        air with a song that soars along with the creature high up into the clouds
                        (6–7). However, Soseki’s skylark is far less ethereal and otherworldly than
                        Shelley’s in that the artist exerts his imagination to envision a bird
                        tumbling in the valley: “Then I imagine the tumbling skylark crossing paths
                        with another as it rises. My final thought is that, whether falling or
                        rising or crossing midair, the wild, vigorous song of the skylark would
                        never for an instant cease” (6). The arduousness of the artist’s climb and
                        the skylark’s flight deflects the transcendental power of the artist’s
                        imagination and the skylark’s song, and what may have been a seamless flight
                        of mental association between the skylark’s song and Shelley’s poem is
                        skewed by the recitation of a fragment from Shelley’s “To a Skylark,” which
                        the artist struggles to remember: <quote><lg>
                                <l>We look before and after</l>
                                <l> And pine for what is not:</l>
                                <l>Our sincerest laughter</l>
                                <l> With some pain is fraught;</l>
                                <l>Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
                                    (Soseki 7)</l>
                            </lg></quote> This quotation is a strange representation of Shelley, who
                        momentarily dwells here on the pain and sadness of life transcended by the
                        skylark’s song. Soseki’s emphasis falls on the other, darker side of
                        Shelley’s uplifting vision, recalling for the artist a common expression
                        found in Chinese poetry: “a hundredweight of sorrows” (7). Heightened by the
                        hyperbolic expression of sorrow, the poignant conclusion reached by the
                        artist is that “poets are great sufferers; they seem to have more than
                        double the nervous sensitivity of the average person” (7). </p>
                    <p>Compared to China’s history, Japan’s process of modernization was relatively
                        gradual and voluntary. Japan abandoned its isolationist policy with the
                        advent of the Meiji era in 1868, after which the nation worked actively to
                        Westernize its governmental system and social and cultural practices. Soseki
                        was a beneficiary of Japan’s modernization policy, being granted a
                        government scholarship to study in London for two years. Ironically, what
                        Soseki gleaned from the overseas experience, at the price of a nervous
                        breakdown due to intense loneliness in a foreign city, was a clearer vision
                        of Japan’s national character and historical fate in relation to the West.
                        Soseki criticizes Japan’s idolization of the West as the common evil of a
                        “forgetful” people intent on imitating the West in the name of progress
                        (Hiyama 25–26). Putting the Chinese classics, which he had studied since
                        boyhood, into perspective against English literature, Soseki also realizes
                        that the two literatures are so radically different as to defy common
                        categorization. Ruptures are formed in Soseki’s double consciousness, and it
                        is out of these ruptures that a true understanding of what is Japanese or
                        Eastern is gained. As seen in the scene from <title level="m"
                            >Kusamakura</title> above, the aesthetic vision of a Japanese artist
                        emerges in genuine form only after he awakens from his “forgetfulness” in
                        Shelleyan transcendentalism. What little Shelley the artist can quote from
                        memory is not quite so transcendental or sublime, but with this Shelley the
                        expression taken from Chinese poetry rings more authentic. The rest of the
                        novel, written in Haiku style, explores the uniquely Japanese consciousness
                        of “non-sentiment,” a way of considering sentiment as a thing of nature
                        rather than human (Hiyama 83). Soseki’s “unforgetting” is a sign of negative
                        resistance to Western dominance, exposing Japan’s mock modernity under the
                        Western-oriented regime of the Meiji era while bring the East into relief
                        against the West. </p>

                    <p>Yun Dong-ju (1917–1945), it is safe to say, is one of the most popular poets
                        in modern Korea, known for his lyricism and spirit of resistance underlying
                        a unique body of anti-colonial poetry. With his posthumous collection of
                        poems entitled <title level="m">Sky, Wind, Star and Poetry</title> (1948), Yun
                        also makes a mark in the tradition of Korean Romantic literature, one trend
                        of which was revolutionary and politically radical (Park 28–52). The
                        following poem “Liver” (1941) is one from the collection, written when
                        colonial aggression was growing ever more heavy-handed with Japan’s wartime mobilization:<quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> This poem is a strange amalgam of the Prometheus myth and
                        a popular Korean folktale. Like the Romantic Prometheus, the rabbit in the
                        Korean fable symbolizes resistance against oppressive power. The rabbit is
                        lured by the tortoise with promises of great riches to the dragon king’s
                        underwater palace only to discover that the king is in dire need of a
                        rabbit’s liver to cure his deathly illness. The quick-witted rabbit fibs to
                        the king that rabbits hide their precious livers in secret places and that
                        he will quickly retrieve his if the king would allow him a trip back
                        aboveground. Of course, the rabbit runs away as soon as he reaches land, and
                        his clever trick has traditionally been associated with the powerless
                        peasants’ survival tactic against despotic authority. In Yun’s poetic remake
                        of the traditional folklore, the tortoise stands for Japanese colonial
                        power, to which the speaker stands up defiantly. If the wet liver preserved
                        and guarded by the rabbit alludes to the unwavering spirit of autonomy, the
                        starved eagle is less the Promethean symbol of punitive authority than a
                        historically marked figure for the colonized people’s desire for liberation.
                        The rabbit escaping from the Caucasus Mountains reinforces the cause of
                        liberty by bringing the two stories of rebellion together in hybridized
                        form. </p>
                    <p>However, the hybridity between traditional and foreign narratives also
                        exposes the double bind in which the colonized speaker finds him- or
                        herself—a situation in which neither Korean tradition nor Western thought
                        can have resistant power against Japanese oppression. As seen in the last
                        stanza of Yun’s poem, Prometheus is found in an alien context, paying for
                        his sin by drowning in the sea with a millstone around his neck. The fall of
                        Prometheus is figured forth in biblical terms, but the allusion to the
                        undersea menace in the Korean folklore is also clear. Prometheus’s
                        foreignness becomes noticeable as he fails to emerge as the universal symbol
                        of resistance and liberation. Prometheus’s despair is that of the wasted
                        speaker’s—the one whose defiant act of feeding the salvaged liver to the
                        eagle does not quite square with his rebellious tone against the tortoise.
                        Both Prometheus and the speaker find their acts of defiance missing the mark
                        in this strange wonderland of mixed-and-matched tales. Such impotence is the
                        plight of the colonized Koreans, whose history of modernization and
                        Westernization significantly overlapped with their colonial history.
                        Prometheus’s theft and the rabbit’s wit, seen out of its original context,
                        can even call the legitimacy of the rebel’s defiance into question,
                        obscuring the fact that the original thief and trickster is the tortoise.
                        For a people whose liberation “came like a thief in the night” at the end of
                        World War II (Kim 499), not much was in its power to change against the
                        throes of imperialist world history. Yun may have read and been inspired by
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as an English major at
                        Yeonhui College in Korea and Doshisha University in Japan (Park 44). He
                        certainly lived a Shelleyan life, finishing his short life of twenty-eight
                        years in prison for anti-Japanese activities. Yet, his Prometheus remains
                        bound and fallen as the unclaimed liver is fed to the eagle starved for
                        liberation. </p>

                    <head>Opening a Dialogue: Romanticism beyond East and West</head>
                    <p>Lu Xun’s reengagement with the past, Soseki’s interiorization of the artistic
                        spirit, Yun’s struggle for freedom and justice—these are responses
                        hauntingly similar to those of English Romantics towards the onset of
                        modernity a century ago during the Enlightenment era. It is no simple
                        coincidence that the three “national” writers of East Asia rigorously
                        employed the literary figures and works of English Romanticism in coming to
                        terms with their experiences of loss and change in the face of radical
                        historical rupture. Yi Zheng, in her study of the modern sublime in Chinese
                        literature, grounds her idea of the “commensurability” between British and
                        Chinese aesthetics of the sublime on a “shared modern history” (3). The
                        three vignettes above suggest that this commensurability may extend to
                        Europe and Asia, West and East. From this broader perspective, we can
                        historically verify that reaction to modernity is an intrinsic part of the
                        literary and cultural phenomenon we know as Romanticism. As Löwy and Sayre
                        argue, “Romanticism is a modern critique of modernity”—that is, “the
                        Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism” (21). Romanticism is
                        not just <emph>against</emph> modernity but <emph>of</emph> modernity,
                        offering a critique of modernity from within modernity itself. As long as
                        modernity retains the capability of self-reflection, Romanticism will
                        continue to be a valid form of cultural critique beyond spatial and temporal
                        boundaries. Thomas Pfau and Robert Mitchell have noted that this element of
                        self-criticism is what makes the conceptualization of Romanticism
                        particularly difficult: “Romanticism’s marked ambivalence and resistance to
                        decisive conceptualization arise from the fact that it simultaneously
                        extends the project of European modernity while offering itself as a
                        sustained critical reflection on that very process” (267). The ambivalence
                        and difficulty of defining Romanticism are certainly exacerbated by
                        exploring its instantiation in multiple forms, circumstances, and
                        articulations of modernity. However, such historically diverse explorations
                        should also offer new possibilities for understanding the complexities and
                        urgencies of Romanticism. </p>
                    <p>The Romantic consciousness of East Asian writers is a product of East Asian
                        modernity. The term “modernization,” along with “Westernization,” is the
                        more customary and perhaps more critically apt way of referring to that
                        historical phase in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century when
                        Western thought and way of life were quickly saturating and tangibly
                        supplanting the traditional ways of the East. The political and cultural
                        resistance, which we can detect in the three authors above, is symptomatic
                        of an acute sense of asymmetry between West and East in the political agency
                        and cultural influences asserted by the two powers as their histories
                        intertwined ever more closely in the context of global politics and economy.
                        Some critics, like Tani E. Barlow, call Asian modernity “colonial,” which in
                        truth spawns confusion and alarm about the obfuscation between actual and
                        virtual colonialisms, but there is an element of truth in finding the common
                        ground of Asian modernity in the colonial. As suggested by the concept of
                        “semi-colonialism,” used by Lenin and Mao to explain the state of nations,
                        like China, that officially preserved juridical independence but was de
                        facto controlled by Western imperialist powers, the question of coloniality
                        in East Asia is not confined to matters of juridical autonomy.<note
                            place="foot">For many critics of East Asian studies, this is one of the
                            main points on which the postcolonial critique of Asian history breaks
                            paths with Anglo-Indian postcolonialism (Barlow 4–5).</note> In the case
                        of China and Taiwan, the civil war in mainland China and the eventual
                        separation of the two states were the consequences of severe internal
                        conflicts overdetermined by an ideological war between communism and
                        republicanism—the two mainstays of modern nation-building founded on Western
                        political thought. The more perplexing case would belong to Japan, which had
                        maintained autonomy against European aggression only to be a major contender
                        in the Western imperialist powers’ race toward the acquisition of Asian
                        colonies. Japanese imperialism was heavily grounded on the idea of building
                        “one Asia”—a modern form of Eastern civilization in the likes of modern
                        Europe—thereby marking its difference from and resistance to Western
                        imperialism while ideologically inheriting the expansionist vision. Korea,
                        like other nations colonized by Japan, became a scapegoat of conflicting
                        imperialist interests between East and West and could not separate its
                        process of Westernization from Japan’s colonial projects. Whether Korea’s
                        modernization is indebted to Japanese rule is still under vigorous debate,
                        but it is undeniable that Korean modernity constitutes a prominent part of
                        Asia’s colonial modernity. That the Koreans had to adjust abruptly to the
                        modern nation-state system and resort to the Western notion of national
                        sovereignty for their fight against imperialist aggression is another sign
                        that Asia’s connection to the Western form of modernity is always vexed and
                        double-sided.</p>
                    <p>What becomes clear here is that the Enlightenment project originating in the
                        West had decidedly far-reaching consequences in fulfilling its totalitarian
                        nature across the globe. As Horkheimer and Adorno claim, Enlightenment is
                        inherently totalitarian whereby knowledge is power and “[t]he awakening of
                        the subject is bought with the recognition of power as the principle of all
                        relationships” (5). The form of power relation itself changes as
                        “Enlightenment dissolves away the injustice of the old inequality of
                        unmediated mastery, but at the same time perpetuates it in universal
                        mediation, by relating every existing thing to every other” (8). The notion
                        that unjust power relations are perpetuated by the universal
                        commensurability and conformity of all existing things becomes the
                        philosophical grounds for acknowledging the commensurability between Western
                        and Eastern modernities under the aegis of Enlightenment. What I hope our
                        exploration of English Romanticism in East Asia may suggest is that the
                        Romantic mindset serves as a universally applicable antidote to a
                        totalitarian system of knowledge and power. Romanticism emerges as one form
                        of Enlightenment’s self-criticism, bringing into critical discourse a
                        Kantian insistence on universal hospitality and cosmopolitan right against
                        the aggravation of global wars and colonial violence.<note place="foot">It
                            is not coincidental that Kant in “Toward Perpetual Peace” points to
                            China and Japan as examples of a nation exercising universal hospitality
                            by authorizing the foreigner the right to visit—not to enter and stay as
                            had the peoples of the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, and India
                            (329). China and Japan had been defending themselves against the
                            aggressions of the Dutch, Portuguese, and British, and Kant singles out
                            Japan for successfully fending off colonial powers by limiting its
                            international relations to commercial trade with the Dutch, who were
                            excluded from any other forms of interaction with the natives
                            (330).</note> Asia’s critical adoption of the Romantic standpoint in
                        response to different historical exigencies ultimately testifies to the
                        intrinsically historical consciousness of Romanticism. It is the
                        interconnectedness rather than the commonality or homogeneity among diverse
                        forms of modernity and its discontents that should emerge through such a
                        global scope of inquiry. Far from erasing historical differences and local
                        particularities, rethinking East and West and their relationship through the
                        prism of Romanticism will allow us to contemplate the shared
                            <emph>and</emph> divergent forms, experiences, and questions of
                        modernity.</p>
                    <p>The following collection of essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea is
                        the first attempt to explore English Romanticism in East Asia in a
                        multinational and cross-cultural context. The history of each nation’s
                        reception of English Romanticism has mostly been studied locally in isolated
                        form, and the scope of these studies varies widely for each nation. Japan
                        has the longest history of the literary reception of English Romanticism and
                        the critical investigation of this reception history. The first anthology of
                        English poetry translated into Japanese was published in 1882 under the
                        title <title level="m">Shintai-shisho</title> (<title level="m">New-Style
                            Poetry</title>), which soon after instigated scholarly interest in
                        English Romanticism in Japan. Critical interest in Japan’s reception of
                        English Romantic literature bloomed after World War II, with Matsuura Tohru
                        producing the earliest study on Keats in Japan in 1959. Reception studies in
                        Japan have become strikingly popular in the last decade or two, and English
                        publications on the subject have recently been on the rise—Okada on Keats
                        (2006), Clark and Suzuki on Blake (2006), and Vallins et al. on Coleridge
                        (2013). In China, occasional discussions of foreign literature’s impact on
                        Chinese literature began to surface in the 1940s, but a systematic study of
                        reception history did not take off until the late 1990s and has continually
                        been on the rise since the 2000s. Leo Lee’s work on the Romantic writers of
                        modern China (1973) has been influential in understanding English
                        Romanticism’s impact on modern China’s political and cultural movements.
                        Taiwan and Korea have come relatively late into the field of reception
                        studies, having yet to produce sustained criticisms on how English
                        Romanticism influenced their respective national literatures.<note
                            place="foot"> Taiwanese scholars Wu Ya-feng and Wang Chih-ming have
                            written essays on English Romantic studies and foreign literary studies
                            emerging in Taiwan in the middle of the twentieth century. Studies of
                            Korea’s reception of English Romantic literature have been performed
                            sporadically by scholars of Korean literature. I would like to thank all
                            of our contributors for this historical overview of English
                            Romanticism’s reception studies in East Asia.</note> What I hope this
                        volume of the Praxis Series will achieve is to open a new critical sphere
                        where more rigorous and integrated discussions of Romanticism within Asia
                        and across Eastern-Western borders can take place. These efforts will not
                        only help us to relativize and historicize our understanding of Romanticism;
                        they will also lay the foundation for a much-needed conversation among Asian
                        nations toward a more serious and less ideologically inflected reflection on
                        their intricately connected histories of modernization. </p>
                    <p>This volume of the Praxis Series presents select papers from the NASSR
                        Supernumerary Conference that took place under the theme “Romantic
                        Connections” in June 2014 at the University of Tokyo, Japan. The national
                        and thematic diversity of these papers contributes to a comparative
                        understanding of the different historical and aesthetic issues faced by
                        Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea with the onset of modernity. Mie Gotoh’s
                        opening essay focuses on the poets of Meiji Japan and their invention of
                        modern landscape, arguing that Keats’s poetry provided crucial momentum for
                        the development of “a new phenomenology of landscape through a new mode of
                        seeing.” For the Meiji poets, this meant a turn towards the inner self,
                        which not only inflected their modes of perceiving nature and the outer
                        world but also transformed Japan’s poetic language into a vehicle for a more
                        “real” landscape. According to Gotoh, these epistemological and formal
                        changes reflect the historical transition Japanese poetry underwent in the
                        late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the poets were
                        developing a modern aesthetics by appropriating Western literature as well
                        as recasting the traditional influence of Chinese classics. </p>
                    <p>Ou Li’s essay, in contrast, discusses the influence of Keats on the poets of
                        modern China and contextualizes the shifting implication of Keats’s poetics
                        in the tumultuous history of twentieth-century China. The discord between
                        Keats’s so-called escapist aestheticism and China’s violent political and
                        ideological upheavals makes for a particularly complex case of interaction
                        between the original text and its foreign context. Marking the three
                        distinctive stages of Keats’s reception in China, Li demonstrates how Keats
                        continued to affect China’s literary imagination and the making of its
                        modern literature by surviving the oppressive mood of the Mao regime and
                        satisfying the need for a literature that transcends political ideology. Li
                        attributes this tenacious appeal of Keats to the “multi-faceted richness and
                        indeterminacy achieved by his remarkable sympathetic imagination and honesty
                        about the human condition”—something that becomes clear through Keats’s long
                        afterlife on foreign soil. </p>
                    <p>In Terence H. W. Shih’s essay, we learn how English Romanticism was
                        transmitted from mainland China to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War
                        between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and the consequent withdrawal
                        of the latter’s Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949. Following the life and
                        legacy of Hsu Chih-Mo, a.k.a. “the Chinese Shelley,” Shih traces the course
                        in which Percy Shelley’s radical spirit affected Hsu’s poetry and eventually
                        had a wider repercussion through the political and poetic influence that
                        Hsu’s writing exerted on Taiwan’s student movements and campus ballads. The
                        campus ballad is a uniquely Romantic genre of musical songs, which inspired
                        a sense of freedom and national identity in the young people of Taiwan and
                        allowed them an imaginative space of autonomy against a history of colonial
                        rule, the threats of communist China, and the authoritarian regime of the
                        Kuomintang. </p>
                    <p>Through the last two essays in this volume, we can compare how modern
                        literary criticism developed under the influence of English Romanticism in
                        Japan and Korea, whose inextricable historical ties prompted interesting
                        connections in their critical histories. Yoshikazu Suzuki’s essay explores
                        early Keats scholarship in Japan through the works of three main scholars:
                        Saito Takeshi, Sato Kiyoshi, and Hinatsu Kohnosuke. Saito set the tone for
                        Keats criticism in Japan with his keen attention to the form and language of
                        Keats’s poetry and a rigorous method of scholarship. While Saito found the
                        significance of Keats’s aesthetics in its humanistic spirit based on
                        Christian ethics, Sato and Hinatsu were more attuned to a critique of
                        national literature through and against Keats. Sato was the more politically
                        conscious of the two, discovering in English Romanticism a love for freedom,
                        which he believed should serve to strengthen the national literature of
                        Japan as the well as the national spirit of the Korean students he was
                        teaching at Keijo Imperial University in occupied Korea. Hinatsu’s national
                        consciousness emerged in a more mediated form through his archaism and a
                        classical style of writing reflecting Keats’s poetic refinement and
                        sensibility. Suzuki notes these three scholars for their significant
                        contributions to building the foundation for Japan’s national consciousness
                        and modern literary studies.</p>
                    <p>Suh-Reen Han picks up where Suzuki leaves off, tracing the critical career of
                        Choe Jae-seo, one of the first Korean scholars of English literature who was
                        incidentally a student of Sato Kiyoshi’s at Kyungsung Imperial University
                        (the Korean appellation for Keijo Imperial University). Having inherited his
                        professor’s interest in English Romanticism, Choe worked through the
                        different implications of Romantic aesthetics in the whirlwind of Korea’s
                        modern history. Choe’s perspectives on Romanticism bear the burden of a
                        historical and political consciousness reacting to the turbulent experiences
                        of colonial oppression, totalitarian militarism, and a civil war between
                        North and South. In his struggle to find the voice of a colonized critic,
                        Choe negatively comes across the possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan
                        criticism against the frailty of a creative and critical spirit exposed to
                        political violence. </p>
