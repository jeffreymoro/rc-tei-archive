            <p class="noCount">This essay explores the ethos of early Keats scholarship in Japan, focusing on three
               major scholars: Saito Takeshi, Sato Kiyoshi, and Hinatsu Kohnosuke. Japanese scholarly
               investigations into Keats were pioneered by a group of young scholars centered around
               the Imperial University of Tokyo. In the first place, Saito attempted to establish
               a humanistic understanding of the poet’s ideas, as exemplified by his Keats’ View
               of Poetry (1929). His love of Keats reflects his early reading, higher education,
               and Protestantism. His meeting with John Lawrence, a philologist, at the University
               perhaps opened the way for a modern methodology of Romantic study in Japan today.
               Secondly, unlike his fellow-scholar, Sato in The Art of Keats (1924) embraced Keats
               as an apostle and victim of beauty, while understanding English Romanticism as a catalyst
               for social modernization. Thirdly, Hinatsu, a scholar-poet from Waseda University,
               authored a massive study entitled The Priest of Beauty (1939) on the psychological
               process through which Keats composed the “Odes.” His account of Keats’s artistry owes
               something to his early background and reclusive character. The achievements of these
               scholars attest to their high-minded ambition in guiding the progress of national
               literature and literary scholarship in Japan.</p>

               <p>Keats criticism reached its first landmark in 1917. That year, a critic gave form
                  to his long-term devotion to so short-lived a poet. His <em>John Keats</em> turned out to be the first full-scale account of Keats’s life and poetry, which would
                  serve his readers for the next fifty years. The author was the illustrious fine-arts
                  critic of the day, Sir Sidney Colvin, who had published a short biography of the poet
                  (1887) as well as the authoritative edition of his letters (1891) and of his poems
                  (1915), and would help, as treasurer, to raise a fund for purchasing the memorial
                  site to be called Keats House. Crowning his academic efforts, the 1917 book made the
                  poet’s fame secure, which it is easy to imagine encouraged the following book-length
                  lives and criticisms of Keats in, especially, the afterglow of the centenary of his
                  death. Indeed, Colvin’s latest achievement was revered cross-culturally, at least
                  in Japan: a copy of the book was displayed at the venue of a ceremony held for commemorating
                  Keats in 1921, occupying pride of place alongside that of the facsimile of the “Hyperion”
                  manuscript by the poet himself. Perhaps, for the group of young scholars who organized
                  this event, the exhaustive work of Colvin was symbolic of the spirit of ambition and
                  dedication they sought to bring into the complacency of Japanese dilettantish academia.
                  The 1921 celebration, in fact, became a prelude to the next phase in the reception
                  of Keats. In literary circles, since first mentioned in the 1871 translation of Samuel
                  Smiles’s <em>Self-Help</em>, the poet’s name had been increasingly familiar. Inviting enthusiastic or sympathetic
                  comments, his poems and love letters had been partly translated, with his versification
                  influencing the practice of rising poets.

                  </div> On the other hand, his genius had remained unexplored in academia, despite the fact
                  that Keats was often discussed in lectures by foreign scholars in government employ
                  or by Japanese teachers.

                           Yaichi, a poet and Oriental art historian, submitted a graduation thesis on Keats
                           to Waseda University in 1906, having been inspired by Lafcadio Hearn’s lecture. See
                           also Okada, 83.</span></div>
                  </div> This lengthy period of literary reception—lengthy, compared with other major Romantics
                  like Byron and Shelley—was finally taken over by its scholarly counterpart in the
                  1920s.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Matsuura divides the early Keats reception in Japan into three stages: the introduction
                           to Japanese readers (1871–1900), imitation and adaption (1901–25), translation and
                           criticism (1926–). See Matsuura, 40. The division, not so clear-cut in practice, can
                           be used only for convenience’s sake, as criticism was active at least as early as
                           the Keats conference, as will be shown below. Also, the first translation of Keats’s
                           poetry in book form—a disreputably inaccurate rendition by the novelist Tayama Katai—appeared
                           in 1905.</span></div>
                  </div> A brief account of the Keats memorial conference mentioned above, an event long buried
                  in history, makes a good starting point from which to examine the ethos of early Keats
                  scholarship in Japan through three important Keats scholars: Saito Takeshi (1887–1982),
                  Sato Kiyoshi (1885–1960) and Hinatsu Konosuke (1890–1971).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Late afternoon on the centenary day, some fifty people were found in a Japanese-style
                  building of Conference Hall, <em>alias Sanjo Goten</em> (“Hilltop Mansion”), at Tokyo Imperial University, the predecessor of the present
                  University of Tokyo.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> On the front wall of the room they entered was hung an oil portrait of Keats (after
                  Joseph Severn’s). The gatherers were wearing violets on their jackets, an ornament
                  inspired by Severn’s report to the dying poet that the flower was in bloom around
                  the tomb awaiting him: the purport of the party was to delight Keats himself. The
                  conference started at six o’clock with the reading of a sonnet dedicated to the poet
                  by a Japanese scholar, Toyoda Minoru, a graduate of the Imperial University.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           Toyoda yearns for his “final faith” (12) in the identification of beauty with truth.</span></div>
                  </div> This was followed by three lectures, the first and second by other graduates and the
                  third by a foreign lecturer working at the University, E. E. Speight. After the session,
                  some of the listeners moved on to a relaxed conversation over snacks and coffee, others
                  to peeking at tens of Keats references on show. The lack of developed transportation
                  necessitated an alternative, in Kobe, for those in the West part of the country. This
                  ceremony was also a success, with over sixty people attending the lectures and over
                  twenty the banquet. The hosts of these conferences were editors of the slim, small-format
                  monthly magazine <em>Bokushin</em> (“Pan”), aimed at lovers of poetry; despite the brief notice given for the conference,
                  they issued the February installment as a special number, using an illustration of
                  the poet’s profile for the title page and carrying Speight’s sonnet, “John Keats,”
                  the facsimile of both sides of a leaf from Keats’s autograph of “The Eve of St. Mark,”
                  studies and translations of his work, as well as their usual run of original compositions.
                  The limited readership of the periodical—albeit influential, considering that the
                  group was headed by the major lyrist Miki Rofu—was complemented by a more academic
                  and broadly-interested journal, <em>The Rising Generation</em>, and their commemoration ran for four issues—fortnightly at that time—reaching the
                  wider group of English scholars and teachers. Behind this sudden outburst of academic
                  interest in Keats was Saito Takeshi, in his mid-thirties, a graduate-lecturer at the
                  Imperial University, a speaker at the Keats centenary in Tokyo, and a chief contributor
                  of Keats studies to both periodicals.

                           critical acumen” (309).</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Where Okada rightly observes that Saito’s evaluation may have formed the basis of
                  Keats’s subsequent popularity in Japan (85), it is notable that his attitude was not
                  so much that of an evangelist as he might likely seem. In the editor’s postscript
                  to an issue of <em>Bokushin</em>, reflecting on the memorial event in Tokyo, the writer, most probably Saito, reveals
                  that he had expected fewer than half of those who had actually appeared. Even more
                  surprising was the impact of their special number on literary and poetic circles,
                  and the English academia, which he describes somewhat reservedly as “considerable”
                  (<em>Bokushin</em> 24).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                           (7)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Here and below all the quotations from Japanese-language sources are translated by
                           Suzuki.</span></div>
                  </div> His low expectation, it is explained, was because Keats was unlikely to draw many
                  readers’ attention. Saito’s view is more evident in an essay he wrote for the morning
                  issue of a leading newspaper, <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em>, dated on Keats’s centenary. Like other early Keats lovers in Japan, Saito expresses
                  great sympathy for the poet’s life of adversity, and sees his love affair in terms
                  of Lycius’s downfall in “Lamia.” However, the tenor of the article opposes the prevailing
                  view that Keats was an aesthete or decadent. As proof to the contrary, Saito quotes
                  the lines defining a poet as “those to whom the miseries of the world / Are misery,
                  and will not let them rest” (“The Fall of Hyperion” 1.148–49). It was in the continued
                  suffering through which he attained this eminence, says Saito, that Keats’s greatness
                  lay. His pursuit of “my demon Poesy” (“Ode on Indolence” 30) was too intense to be
                  sustained, but was nonetheless inevitable. His work was “a living flame to illuminate
                  the world,” and he himself “a candle that must melt away” to do so: poetry was his
                  “lifeblood,” more so than in the case of Shelley. Despite addressing the general public,
                  Saito declares that Keats’s poetry is not suited to them, and that it can only be
                  understood by those who love beauty and “demon Poesy,” who can “see a higher beauty
                  in pain and conflict.” Therefore, concludes Saito, his readers will remain a few,
                  and the celebration should thus remain modest: “it should be the last thing to do
                  to carry around a portable shrine” (“Keats Itte Hyakunen”).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Saito’s outspoken elitism might be the result of the strong identification he had
               with Keats, a manifestation of his unlimited esteem for a dedicated and lofty spirit.
               His receptive but resolute nature is suggested by what happened to him as a schoolboy
               in Fukushima at the age of seventeen. He was enthralled with Wordsworth’s view of
               nature and human life, to an alarming degree. A precocious boy, he read “The Table
               Turned” with a strong sense of the futility of learning, thus handing in his notice.
               Back home he was persuaded by his father—the very farmer-father who would later attempt
               to stop Saito from going to Tokyo so that he, the eldest son, could take over the
               family’s trade—to resume schooling. As was typical of young intellectuals of the day,
               Saito read avidly, amongst other things, <em>Imperial Literature</em>, the journal issued by a literary circle at the Imperial University, and the works
               of Japanese Romantic poets such as Shimazaki Toson and a famous devotee of Keats,
               Susukida Kyukin, while practicing their new style of poetry himself. His arrival at
               the Imperial University in 1908 was too late to allow direct contact with either Lafcadio
               Hearn, a lecturer acclaimed for critical acumen, or Natsume Soseki, the replacement
               for Hearn, who remained at his post for only four years. Saito studied under the supervision
               of the philologist John Lawrence (1850–1916), the only tenured professor in the department.
               Lawrence approached literary works through formal disciplines such as prosody, stylistics,
               and phonetics, Romantic poets being a subject of his special concern, which meant
               much to Saito and other students.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Lawrence’s dedication to teaching is worthy of mention at this point. In explaining
                  why he was not more productive in writing—his lifetime output consists of, chiefly,
                  the doctoral dissertation <em>Chapters on Alliterative Verse</em> (1893) and a monograph in <em>Modern Language Review </em>(1914)—his students point out that during his ten or so years in office Lawrence was
                  responsible for, at most, twelve lectures, and gave seminars or tutorials that lasted
                  from two to five hours everyday, voluntarily (Saito 1.473–74, Sup. 451–52; Ichikawa
                  268–71).

                           See also Ichikawa, 270.</span></div>
                  </div> Much later, Saito surmised that, although Lawrence’s commentary-based method, linguistic
                  in focus, may have lacked critical depth, and disappointed those aspiring to a writer’s
                  career, he was the father of Romantic studies in today’s form (Sup. 452, 166), while
                  he is elsewhere reckoned as an epoch-maker in the study of English literature and
                  linguistics (Tezuka 258). In truth, his teaching customs anticipate the proliferation
                  of annotative practice in the Taisho era. The matchless project of “Kenkyusha English
                  Classics,” the editions of English authors annotated in Japanese which extended to
                  a hundred volumes (1921–32), was supervised by Lawrence’s follower, Ichikawa Sanki.

                  undertaking echoes, and links to, a shift in approach that Lawrence initiated among
                  his many students: the shift from the impressionistic, or Hearnean, to the scholarly,
                  in its strict sense. There is no clear explanation as to why Lawrence often lectured
                  on Romantic poetry, including Shelley’s <em>Revolt of Islam</em> or <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, but one possibility is that he cherished their liberal inclination. This may reflect
                  his political awareness, given that Japan was at the threshold of a democratic movement
                  called in many quarters “Taisho Democracy.”</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Saito’s early career culminated in a doctoral dissertation in English, <em>Keats’ View of Poetry</em>. After a long lectureship, he wrote it in the autumn of 1924 while visiting Oxford,
                  where he attended the “Discussion Class” offered by Merton Professor of English Literature,
                  George S. Gordon. Gordon hosted the gathering of a few senior students selected from
                  English department, following the custom of his predecessor, Sir Walter Raleigh. Upon
                  request, Saito delivered a paper on the state of English studies in Japan. Back home,
                  he adapted this extracurricular “Class” for his workplace (1: 130). When Saito’s thesis
                  was published by Cobden-Sanderson in 1929, with the endorsement of his colleague Edmund
                  Blunden, it was favorably reviewed in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> with a comment: “it is, within certain limits, a valuable addition to the growing
                  body of criticism of that great poet” (1094).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The review, entitled “A Japanese View of Keats,” praises Saito’s rare virtue of detachment
                           as something lacking in English criticism; he, “the fortunate inheritor of a [Japanese]
                           spiritual tradition,” can “look upon Keats with sympathy, but also with detachment,”
                           in a way that is not possible for English critics (TLS 1094).</span></div>
                  </div> The study captured the attention of Clarence D. Thorpe, thus prompting his reviews,
                  and was added to the reading list at the University of Michigan. Indeed, Saito’s focus
                  and approach prefigures Thorpe’s work, <em>The Mind of John Keats </em>(1926). Saito presents Keats as a poet of humanistic conceptions, discussing his notions
                  of beauty and truth, and of the function of poetry, and his axioms of poetry. In a
                  section of the first chapter, Saito challenges the current interpretation of the Grecian
                  Urn’s cryptic axiom—“Beauty is truth, truth beauty” —as being an announcement of the
                  art-for-art’s sake doctrine. The word “truth” is used in a sense of reality, Saito
                  argues, suggesting that “what is absolutely beautiful must be essential and real,
                  and what is essential and real must be beautiful if adequately expressed” (42). This
                  reading, coupled with a moral edge in the poet’s conception of beauty and art, suggests
                  that, far from subscribing to hedonism, his view is rather, in Saito’s words, “art
                  for life’s sake” (43). As shown in this transformation of the Victorian—or sensuous—Keats,
                  one of Saito’s advantages lies in a careful analysis of the complex network of ideas
                  formed in the poet’s mind. Another is his access to Keats’s artistry through a knowledge
                  not only of Romantics but also of Japanese and Chinese poets. After bringing to light
                  unique elements of Keats’s descriptive imagination in comparison with <span class="foreign">sumie</span>, Japanese brush art, he describes the poet’s method of concentration and suggestion
                  as akin to a haiku master’s condensed use of words. For example, he quotes from “Ode
                  to a Nightingale,” “Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam / Of perilous seas,
                  in faery lands forlorn” (69–70), arguing that “Twenty pages might be written in interpretation
                  of this wonder-working couplet—interpretation which would vary, according to the mood
                  and culture of the exponent” (109). He goes on to introduce some associations with
                  the magic-casement scene traced by critics, then adds Wordsworth’s phrase: “Lady of
                  the Mere, / Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance” (“A Narrow Girdle of Rough
                  Stones and Crags” 37–38). His intention is not to exclude others: <span class="quote">‘Such is the extraordinary richness of the impression made by Keats on the reader,
                     that each of these interpretations may be of help in approaching the poet, who very
                     likely fused all those sources and concentrated them with his poetic alchemy into
                     those miraculous lines. (110)’</span></p>
            </div>
            <p>A question may arise: how did Saito <em>discover</em> the humanistic Keats at all? This may be explained, oddly enough, with reference
               to his Christian background. Both in his religious and academic lives, Saito was inspired
               by Uemura Masahisa, a high-profile Calvinist thinker and preacher. His mind had undergone
               the transition from Nietzschean egocentrism to Christian submission, “the mental journey
               traced by all young people in the early nineteenth century” (Sup. 447), which led
               him to receive baptism at the age of nineteen. Uemura affected not only Saito’s outlook
               on life, puritanical as he was, but also the subject of his graduate work, Milton
               and Spenser. Apparently these poets’ Protestant ethics and epic self-empowerment enabled
               him to perceive a comparable cause in Keats’s humanitarian pursuit of “demon Poesy”:
               “Keats was not a religious poet,” says Saito, “but his humanitarianism is based on
               Christianity” (Sup. 438).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Among several other scholars who contributed to the rise of Keats scholarship was
                  Sato Kiyoshi, a graduate of the Imperial University with a background similar to Saito’s.
                  Sato attended the same preparatory course in Sendai, and was taught by the same teacher,
                  Doi Bansui, a poet as dominant as Shimazaki and translator of Byron’s <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> and Carlyle’s essays. Although his baptism at the age of sixteen did not affect Sato
                  so profoundly in terms of his reading, he was bent on Japanese Romantic poets, and
                  felt the creative urge—in fact, two-thirds of the posthumous collection of his writing
                  is devoted to his original poetry. After some years of teaching, and two years of
                  unaided research in England, Sato began writing on Keats in the centenary year and
                  administered the memorial conference in Kobe. In 1924, while Saito was writing his
                  thesis abroad, Sato became the author of the first book on Keats in Japan—and in Japanese—entitled <em>The Art of Keats</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>So was the study advertised in Yomiuri Shimbun, with Keats being “a martyr to love
                           and poetry” and his life that of “a moth to a flame.”</span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>In contrast to Saito’s conceptually oriented thesis, <em>The Art </em>analyzes chronologically the poet’s major works, furnished with their entire translations
               or outlines in Japanese. The preface records the author’s repeated visits to Hampstead,
               expressing his strong sense of pity for the “unhappy genius” (1). The study may be
               less ambitious than Saito’s, introducing the outline of each poem together with others’
               critical comments, but Sato’s chapter on “Lamia” is more independent from his predecessors,
               coming to a remarkable conclusion. Sato defended the narrative poem against the complaint
               made by critics such as Robert Bridges that, to the work’s disadvantage, the main
               characters lack nobility. Instead, Sato argues that the story points to a new axiom
               derived from the poet’s first-hand experience of love; that is, “beauty is supreme,
               though illusory” (220). This notion is of a radical aesthete who admits the frightful
               linkage between beauty and death, says Sato. Keats abandoned the moral life he was
               pursuing, so the poem forms a new category that can be called “the art of failure”
               (222). As if in reaction to Saito’s humanistic Keats, Sato holds to, and refines,
               the poet’s traditional image, observing that “Keats will ever remain among us an apostle
               of beauty, a creator of beauty, and a victim of beauty” (236). His later <em>A Study of Keats: Psychology in Composition</em> (1949) is a collection of the critical essays that prove his abiding commitment to
               the poet; the first Japanese edition of Keats’s letters (1952) is also his work.</p>
            <p>Sato’s real strength, however, may be shown in his criticism of Japanese modern poetry,
               and of poetry in general, considering that these spheres of writing could more directly
               interact with his identity as poet. As the years passed, Sato grew impatient with
               his contemporaries in poetic circles because of their soullessness or lack of sincerity;
               he felt similarly about his scholarly colleagues. He found in them a tendency to avoid
               Romanticism, and to be dilettantish and feudalistic in their choice of subject matter,
               as discussed in an essay written a few years after World War II. The Japanese, argues
               Sato, neglect a duty to strengthen the national character and literature by assimilating
               Romanticism, which he calls the “fearful stream of English literature” that seeks
               freedom, flowing from Milton through the Romantics down to Stephen Spender and Cecil
               Day-Lewis, and which is the nobler and more venerable for the absence of an equivalent
               in the Japanese tradition; Romanticism is “calcium to form the bones” (3.251–52).
               In his opinion, the Japanese mind is in need of further modernization; hence the understanding
               of the trends in European political life during the last two centuries (3.250).</p>
            <p>This view of Romanticism explains why Sato favored the political Keats. In <em>The Art</em>, discussing “Isabella,” he introduces George Bernard Shaw’s anti-capitalist reading
               of Stanza XIV–XVI and William Morris’s critique of commercialism, in tones of delighted
               approval (44–45). Importantly, Sato seems to have believed that, for Keats, politics
               was not incompatible with a pursuit of beauty, but rather a part of it. In one of
               his essays, Sato distances himself from the doctrine of “art for art’s sake” which
               critics found in his poetry, and shows sympathies with proletarianism and the masses
               of the world as well as those who in modern Japan were struggling for their political
               rights. “I make it my life principle to transmute all such distresses and struggles
               into art,” says Sato (3.8).</p>
            <p>Sato’s study of Romantics and other English authors was intended to serve the literature
               of his own country. Keats’s celebrated idea of the poetical character offered him
               a hint through which to strive for cultural success. At the conclusion of an article
               on Doi, with whom he formed a lasting friendship based on respect and affection, Sato
               articulates this point as follows: <span class="quote">‘The great poet is someone who identifies oneself with everything. In the case of
                  a critic, brandishing a certain fixed principle and abusing others in various, cruel
                  ways is not something laudable. Great literature does not emerge in a country with
                  such a climate. Since authors vary in individuality, we must accept a type of literature
                  that embraces all individuality. Japanese literary art must henceforth accept diversities.
                  (3.136)’</span> It is interesting in this context to note Sato’s engagement with a different culture
               overseas. Two years after the publication of <em>The Art</em>, at government request, he went across to Seoul to be installed as Professor of English
               at Keijo Imperial University—later a part of Seoul National University—when it was
               founded, allegedly, in an effort to modernize the Peninsula, which had been annexed
               to Japan in 1910. His twenty years’ service produced eighty-five graduates, including
               many Koreans. In a speech given on the occasion of his retirement, Sato mentioned
               his participation in a section of the local literary movement; it was based on his
               belief that “literature consists in practice” (3.258). His activity extended to the
               contribution of his poems and essays to <em>National Literature</em>, a Japanese journal edited by his Korean student, Choi Jae Seo (Choe Jae-seo), who
               believed in the wartime notion of “Greater East Asia” and promoted Japanese as its
               common language. Sato also prepared a collection of poems (unpublished), including
               his long works on the Korean priests who helped the establishment of a Buddhist culture
               called “Asukabunka” in ancient Japan (3.162). There is no doubt that the priests were
               the alter ego of the overseas teacher Sato. His nationalism may show the limitations
               of a government official of Imperial Japan, but it was free from chauvinistic arrogance:
               “I was moved to know how earnestly they [his Korean students] were seeking to discover
               in their study of English literature a way that might lead to the deliverance and
               freedom of their own race” (3.259).</p>
            <p>The third of the scholars who characterize early scholarship on Keats is Hinatsu Konosuke,
               who earned more fame as poet than as a scholar of English, producing only translations
               and a thesis on Keats, but whose contribution is nonetheless unique and suggestive.
               Immediately after the Keats commemorative year, the scholar-poet started lecturing
               at Waseda University, a stronghold of English scholarship rivaling the Imperial University
               in tradition and influence. Hinatsu’s doctoral thesis, published in 1939 under the
               title, <em>The Priest of Beauty: A Study of Psychological Processes in the Composition of John
                  Keats’s Odes</em>, was his only noteworthy work in this field. However, this work was of symbolic relevance
               to his life, “a direct result of fourteen years of my lecturing life and a clue to
               one side of the thirty years of my poetic career,” as he calls it in the preface (3–4).
               As massive as any study on Keats published before or since, at home or abroad, it
               attempts to elucidate intentions and aims in the composition of the poet’s major odes
               through the method of close reading based on the author’s own experience, a thorough
               consideration of preceding scholarship, and the contexts of literary traditions, not
               only English and European but also Chinese and Japanese. His reading is as subtle—if
               not as lucid, due to his meandering discussion—as Earl R. Wasserman’s in <em>The Finer Tone</em> (1953), while the wide, cross-cultural learning it shows throughout its 918 pages
               is unparalleled, which makes it doubly regretful that the Japanese-language thesis
               remains unapproachable for most foreign scholars.</p>
            <p>The inaccessibility of Hinatsu’s language, in fact, is not limited to this respect.
               Whether scholarly or poetic, it forbids any Japanese scholar’s easy access due to
               its archaism. Hinatsu adhered to the classical style of writing; he objected to a
               growing trend to write poetry in colloquial style, an extension of the campaign set
               by novelists of the previous generation. His vocabulary is based on classical Chinese,
               a vital part of traditional education that had fallen from public favor. His symbolic,
               even mystic, style—as he calls it, “Gothic-Roman”—sometimes bars sympathetic understanding
               on account of the pedantic impression it might cause, even if it is intended to pursue
               the refined beauty of the language. Recalling Coleridge’s grudges against the reading
               public or Keats’s occasional bouts of irritability over the unthinking masses, Hinatsu
               is reported to have felt “no need to make himself understood to those who cannot understand”
               (Maihashi 123). When published, his thesis on Keats appeared in a limited edition
               of six hundred copies, which was the extension of his usual publishing custom as poet.
               </p>
            <p>Hinatsu’s uncompromisingly unfashionable attitudes may go some way toward explaining
               his attachment to Keats, perhaps deeply seated in his psyche. As a schoolboy Hinatsu
               was so weak-framed, bookish, and morbid in sensibility, and his lineage so distinguished
               in the locality (Iida, in Nagano), that he was an isolated character, even among his
               family; the only ally he could find was his mother. He chose Waseda, not the Imperial
               University, partly because it was his mother’s preference, and partly because he aspired
               to the liberal climate of the one and hated the bureaucratic atmosphere of the other,
               as recalled by his brother (Maihashi 43–44). This, somewhat ironically, resulted in
               his drifting away from mainstream English studies, as the Imperial University became
               the parent of English Literary Society of Japan in 1929, a society that, from the
               outset, boasted more than a thousand members across the nation. Meanwhile, Waseda
               tended to be a closed society. What follows is a regret expressed by an unidentified
               Tokyo University Professor Emeritus: “it is a loss to the academia to let such an
               erudite, genuine scholar as Hinatsu be retired in the unrewarding Waseda” (Maihashi
               56).</p>
            <p>What Hinatsu saw in Keats echoes the solitariness of his artistic-scholarly self.
               In his thesis’s conclusion, Hinatsu characterizes Keats’s work as part of the retirement
               literature, by which he means more than escapism—that is, “part of the necessary and
               serious action produced by a poet’s unusual passion for human possibilities.” This
               type of literature is “not of a cowardly nature”; it represents “an unlimited attachment
               to the fragrance pertaining only to the literary effect of withdrawal,” he writes
               (555–56). Even if Hinatsu owed more to French symbolists such as Baudelaire and Mallarmé
               than to Keats in poetic practice, the Odes embodied a lyrical state to which he had
               aspired, the state in which “the existence of nature outflowing from images of the
               mind expresses the so-called aspect of thought in a unified whole,” not showing “the
               slightest shadow of the burden of ‘thought’” (560). Hinatsu regarded it as a manifestation
               of “the spirit of symbolist literature which had walked in English poetry since the
               eighteenth century,” a tradition which he says professors of English and critics rarely
               note, but which, as a French critic has pointed out, was passed down to French symbolists
               by Keats and Shelley (561). His prolonged, in-depth analysis of Keats thus provided
               Hinatsu with a symbolist’s conviction, furthering his own seclusion as, say, a priest
               of beauty himself.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the early Keats scholars discussed above accessed the poet with a zeal
               often approximating devotion, and their efforts proved to be extremely ambitious:
               as heir to an enthusiasm that had captured the Keats readers before their generation,
               they all accommodated it to the establishment of their scholarly or creative identity,
               or of both. Such an undertaking suggests the unique potential of Keats’s reception
               at a time when English scholarship was becoming specialized and author-based, but
               still allowed other disciplines or careers, in Japan. Saito, Sato, and Hinatsu were
               among the first to survey the existing criticisms of Keats, to discuss his poetics
               and works, and to be abundantly rewarded in their own ways. In the case of Sato and
               Hinatsu, whose principal aim was to serve the cause of national literature, a deep
               understanding of Keats helped to foster their sensibilities and poetic beliefs, thus
               contributing to their own poetry, on which, especially, Hinatsu’s fame seems to rest
               today. This kind of achievement, a result of English scholarship and Japanese creativity
               going hand-in-hand for mutual benefit, has long passed into history; their achievement
               is of a nature possible only in their time, when young intellectuals were often enthusiastic
               lovers of poetry. But, for this very reason, the two poet-scholars should deserve
               a page in the reception history of Romanticism, or rather, English literature, in
               Japan. Meanwhile, Saito’s achievement belongs to a different order. Although his writing
               covered the old Chinese poet Du Fu and Christian thought, he was more devoted to English
               scholarship than the other two, and became the editor of <em>The Kenkyusha Dictionary of British and American Literature </em>(1937), and the author of the long-selling, authoritative <em>A History of British Literature</em> (1957). With his Calvinistic self-discipline and awe-inspiring character, Saito influenced
               many scholars of the next generations, thus setting the tone for today’s English scholarship
               in Japan. “Scholars need only to contribute to the academia of their subject, not
               keeping in mind their works’ connections with the national culture,” Saito wrote in
               1954; “if you achieve a result on a par with native scholars’, it proves to be a respectable
               work.” He then went on to predict a day when Japanese scholars would publish in English
               and serve other cultures (6.457–58). This disinterested, scholarly ambition presumably
               originated in his thesis on Keats, an isolated example of a published thesis in English
               before World War II, and a noble landmark for the future projects of Japanese scholars.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">However, there seems to have been some studies on Keats in unpublished form: Aizu
               Yaichi, a poet and Oriental art historian, submitted a graduation thesis on Keats
               to Waseda University in 1906, having been inspired by Lafcadio Hearn’s lecture. See
               also Okada, 83.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Matsuura divides the early Keats reception in Japan into three stages: the introduction
               to Japanese readers (1871–1900), imitation and adaption (1901–25), translation and
               criticism (1926–). See Matsuura, 40. The division, not so clear-cut in practice, can
               be used only for convenience’s sake, as criticism was active at least as early as
               the Keats conference, as will be shown below. Also, the first translation of Keats’s
               poetry in book form—a disreputably inaccurate rendition by the novelist Tayama Katai—appeared
               in 1905.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In an annotated catalogue of studies of Keats written for a special number of <em>The Rising Generation</em>, Saito calls Colvin’s new biography “the best and authoritative biography of J. K.
               realized through assiduous research of thirty years and accomplished critical acumen”
               (309).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Shelley’s poems, Keats’s <em>Endymion</em>, Tennyson’s <em>In Memoriam</em>, and others. This series led to biographies of a hundred English authors in Japanese

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">The review, entitled “A Japanese View of Keats,” praises Saito’s rare virtue of detachment
               as something lacking in English criticism; he, “the fortunate inheritor of a [Japanese]
               spiritual tradition,” can “look upon Keats with sympathy, but also with detachment,”
               in a way that is not possible for English critics (<em>TLS</em> 1094).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
