                <p rend="noCount">This paper puts together a trajectory of Keats’s reception in
                    China from appropriation to oblivion and then to restoration in line with three
                    distinctive moments in Chinese modern history. It explores the interaction
                    between the original text and its foreign context, particularly complex in
                    Keats’s case for his often misconceived image as an escapist aesthete who seemed
                    much out of place in 20th China undergoing violent political and ideological
                    changes. While this aestheticism confined Keats’s influence to a smaller circle
                    than that of his more radical contemporaries such as Byron and Shelley, his less
                    discursive and more ambiguous poetry also ensured its survival in a repressive
                    political context and continued to appeal to different generations of Chinese
                    readers with its deep sympathy for fellow human beings and honesty about the
                    human condition. </p>

                <head>Keats’s Afterlife in Twentieth-Century China</head>
                <p>Ever since his Chinese readers introduced Keats to China at the beginning of the
                    twentieth century, Keats’s afterlife in China has gone through drastic changes
                    alongside the violent alterations experienced by the nation. Just as Auden
                    writes of Yeats who, after his death, “became his admirers” and whose words “are
                    modified in the guts of the living” (“In Memory of W. B. Yeats”), so Keats’s
                    reception in twentieth-century China has involved the author and the text as
                    much as his Chinese readers, translators, and critics, the latter of whom
                    admired Keats with their own cultural perspectives on the one hand and embraced
                    him for his foreignness on the other. Since different generations of his Chinese
                    readers shaped Keats’s reception in China, and all of them had to wrestle with
                    their own historical context, the ensuing discussion of Keats’s afterlife in
                    twentieth-century China is divided into three stages, roughly following the
                    periodization of the national history: first, from the beginning of the
                    twentieth century to 1949, the late Qing to the Republican era when Keats was
                    introduced and popularized; second, from 1949 to the late 1970s, the Communist
                    China era leading up to the Cultural Revolution when Keats was slighted and
                    almost silenced; and third, from the late 1970s to the end of the century, the
                    post-Cultural Revolution era in which Keats underwent a revival. </p>
                <p>While a similar fate was shared by all the major English Romantics introduced to
                    China, Keats, who is often misconceived as the pure artist, presented a rather
                    unique case, different from his more radical contemporaries such as Byron and
                    Shelley, whose more explicitly political poetry had greater bearing on or
                    underwent fiercer contention with the local context throughout China’s
                        history.<note place="foot">This paper is part of a larger research project I
                        have been working on on the metamorphosis of British Romanticism in China,
                        which also includes a study of Byron’s reception in twentieth-century China
                        that is forthcoming elsewhere.</note> When Keats’s apparently apolitical
                    poetry was caught in the tumultuous historical changes of twentieth-century
                    China, the interaction between the original text and its foreign context became
                    more complex and had to be teased out more carefully. From the initial
                    introductory stage, Keats was read and admired in a small circle of Chinese
                    readers, mostly poets and scholars, while Byron and Shelley were popular among a
                    big audience that included writers and radical intellectuals alike. Yet with his
                    aesthetic appeal, Keats influenced several leading Chinese poets in their
                    exploration of new forms of Chinese poetry, and in this sense his aestheticism
                    became no less revolutionary than the ideological iconoclasm of Byron and
                    Shelley, only subtler and more profound. On the other hand, during the
                    politically more repressive Communist era, when literature and art were reduced
                    to mere instruments of party propaganda, Keats’s poetry, although suffering no
                    less than other Romantics’, managed to survive less scathed exactly for its
                    comparatively less discursive and inciting nature. If Byron’s rebellious spirit
                    posed a threat to an authoritarian state and thus needed to be severely censured
                    and obliterated, then Keats’s aestheticism simply fell into neglect and
                    dismissal. Ironically, however, when Western poetry and art began regaining
                    their ground in China in the late twentieth century, Keats was read and studied
                    chiefly among specialists rather than common readers. Throughout the twentieth
                    century in China, Keats was very much an odd figure whose seemingly innocuous
                    aestheticism paradoxically posed a strong challenge to a nation reeling with
                    political metamorphoses. This paper, therefore, while putting together a
                    trajectory of Keats’s fate in twentieth-century China, aims to explore the more
                    acute, though veiled, tension between the violent shaping force of China’s
                    historical and cultural context and Keats’s poetry that nevertheless constantly
                    resisted the force with its own steadfastness. </p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>I.</head>
                    <p>Keats entered into China at roughly the same time as other Romantics in the
                        late Qing period when Western and traditional Chinese cultures clashed most
                        intensely, and when the first wave of Western literature rushed into China
                        in sweeping power. Keats is first mentioned by Lu Xun, the leading figure of
                        modern Chinese literature and the New Culture Movement, in his early essay
                        “On the Demoniac Poets,” published in 1907. Lu Xun, however, includes Keats
                        only for dismissal: “John Keats, despite his being labeled as a demoniac
                        poet, does not belong to the same school as Byron, and so will not be
                        discussed here” (1:85).<note place="foot">The quotation here and those
                            hereafter from Chinese sources in this article are my own translations.
                        </note> The editor’s note explains: “Keats’s works exemplify liberalism and
                        were affirmed by Byron and Shelley. But he has an ‘art for art’s sake’,
                        aesthetic inclination, hence not belonging to Byron’s school according to Lu
                        Xun” (1:112.100). This is not the only time Lu Xun mentions Keats. In “A
                        Happy Family” written in 1924, Lu Xun satirically depicts a writer composing
                        a story with such a title. While the writer is busy defining standards for
                        “a happy family,” he decides that the married couple should be reading
                        Byron’s or Keats’s poetry, but then decides against it and settles for
                        Wilde’s <title level="m">An Ideal Husband </title>instead (2:37). In “From
                        Self to Others,” published in 1934, Lu Xun starts the essay with the example
                        of Keats as “one of the geniuses who were killed by the words of
                        philistines” (5:502). </p>
                    <p>These references to Keats are too brief to give one a definite idea as to Lu
                        Xun’s stance towards Keats, but in comparison to Byron, who is the hero in
                        his essay on the demoniac poets, Keats is obviously less attended to by Lu
                        Xun. One does not know whether Lu Xun had read any of Keats’s poetry either.
                        If he had, it would be in translation, for he did not speak English. Lu
                        Xun’s knowledge about Keats and English Romantic poets in general must have
                        come indirectly from Japanese or German sources, two foreign languages in
                        which he was versed. From the distinction he makes between Keats and Byron
                        and his presentation of Keats as a victim of the philistine world, one can
                        detect in Lu Xun traces of the mainstream Victorian view on Keats as the
                        weak aesthete, which must have been passed on to Lu Xun through Keats
                        critics in Japan or Germany. With his tremendous influence during his
                        lifetime and afterwards, particularly after 1949, Lu Xun’s take on Keats as
                        a major poet who stands alone shaped the ensuing reception of Keats in China
                        to considerable degrees. But one should not overestimate his influence,
                        since many Chinese readers of Keats after Lu Xun had direct access to
                        English sources, which gave them a more holistic picture of Keats,
                        especially after the reputation of Keats steadily rose from the 1920s
                        onwards in Britain and America.</p>
                    <p>Lu Xun’s references to Keats correspond to the gradual popularization of
                        Keats in China in the first three decades of the twentieth century, with the
                        1921 commemoration of Keats’s centenary as a milestone. In April 1921, a
                        two-page article, “Centennial Commemoration for the British Poet Keats,”
                        written by Yu Zhi,<note place="foot">The pen name adopted by Hu
                            Yuzhi.</note> scholar and social activist, was published in <title
                            level="j">The Eastern Miscellany</title>. It quotes the epigrammatic
                        ending of “Ode on a Grecian Urn” and the opening of <title level="m"
                            >Endymion</title> (in translation), and includes a portrait of Keats as
                        well as photographs of Keats’s tomb and Keats House at Hampstead.
                        Considering Keats a precursor of Aestheticism, the author claims, “taking
                        Beauty as Truth is both Keats’s strength and weakness” (71). When discussing
                        Keats’s poems, he also exemplifies an attitude similar to the Victorians’
                        toward Keats. Commenting on Keats’s sensuousness, he writes not without
                        condescension, “Keats’s life was nothing but a series of sensations” (71).
                        He also promotes the same myth as did the Victorians: “having always been
                        weak in health, Keats became sick after working too hard on poetry from 1818
                        to 1820” (72). Biased as it sounds, the article made the first proper
                        introduction of Keats to China.</p>
                    <p>The following month saw the publication of another memorializing article,

                        one-page article opens the issue and states that Keats “has long been known
                        by all,” suggesting Keats’s familiarity among the Chinese readership by then
                        (1). The author laments Keats’s fate, for Keats, like many other geniuses,
                        lived a life of obscurity and remained neglected and misunderstood after
                        death. The article concludes by quoting Keats’s famous words in the
                        original, “I think I shall be among the English poets after my death”
                            (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1:394), reminding one of Matthew
                        Arnold’s memorable quotation of the same words and his warmly reassuring
                        affirmation, “he is; he is with Shakespeare” (Arnold 291). The same author
                        reports in the following issue of <title level="j">Fiction Monthly</title>
                        on the London exhibition in commemoration of Keats’s centenary (5).</p>
                    <p>The commemoration, however, was rather moderate in comparison with the
                        celebration of Byron’s centenary three years later conducted by various
                        journals. The most extravagant one was carried out by <title level="j"
                            >Fiction Monthly</title>, which compiled a special issue for Byron
                        composed of eleven articles written by a team of most influential poets and
                        intellectuals of the time. This is hardly surprising, for Byron’s (and
                        Shelley’s) more openly radical poetry resonated among Chinese readers who
                        were anxious for the future of their own country, which was caught in chaos
                        and unrest after it had experienced a Revolution in 1911 and a Restoration
                        in 1915 in quick succession. In comparison, Keats appeared less provocative,
                        since his poetry was considered set in a realm remote from reality. After
                        these passionate but brief celebrations of Keats in 1921, Keats’s popularity
                        was confined to a small group of poets and scholars, almost slight in
                        comparison with the idolatry Byron inspired. Even in his admirers’ eyes,
                        Keats was a pure artist with no concern for the actual world. Keats
                        therefore was popularized together with other Romantics in China in the wake
                        of the New Culture Movement, but with his image as an aesthete, he was
                        overshadowed by his more overtly political contemporaries. </p>
                    <p>Small as the scale of Keats’s influence might be, the common admiration for
                        Keats shown by some leading Chinese poets powerfully suggests the profound
                        impact Keats had upon the formation of the modern Chinese poetic tradition.
                        In the 1920s, a handful of poets, Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, and Zhu Xiang, stood
                        out as Keats’s ardent admirers and earliest translators. All three poets
                        were associated with the Crescent Moon Society, a prominent poetic school in
                        the New Culture Movement co-founded by Xu Zhimo and Wen Yiduo in the 1920s.
                        It was often labeled as promoting aestheticism for its emphasis on
                        formalistic elements of “new poetry,” that is, modern Chinese poetry written
                        in vernacular Chinese as opposed to traditional Chinese poetry written in
                        classical Chinese language and meter. All three poet-admirers of Keats died
                        young. Xu Zhimo (1897–1931), usually regarded as the most important modern
                        Chinese poet, died in a plane crash at the age of thirty-four. Wen Yiduo
                        (1899–1946), a major modern Chinese poet who contributed to a more regulated
                        form of “new poetry,” was assassinated by secret agents of Kuomintang for
                        his political activism at the age of forty-seven; and Zhu Xiang (1904–33),
                        poet and translator, committed suicide at the age of twenty-nine. All three
                        poets, like most of their older and younger contemporaries mentioned above
                        and below, had studied overseas, an experience that not only exposed them to
                        Keats and other Western authors but shaped their own paths as Chinese poets.
                        In fact, among modern Chinese writers, more than half had overseas studying
                        experiences which in a sense became a shaping force for modern Chinese
                        literature (Zheng 12–13), in the same way that students specialized in other
                        fields in their study abroad led China to its path of modernization after
                        their return.<note place="foot">From the beginning of the twentieth century
                            to 1940s, students went overseas either with private support or with
                            government funding. Among them, many were funded by the Boxer Indemnity
                            Scholarship, a partial remission of the indemnity China had to pay the
                            U.S., Britain and several other Western countries for the damages caused
                            during the Boxer Rebellion. Wen Yiduo and Zhu Xiang, for example, were
                            Boxer Indemnity scholars, as were Zha Liangzheng and Wang Zuoliang
                            mentioned below.</note> From 1918 to 1922, Xu first went to Clark
                        University in Massachusetts and then Columbia before he studied at Cambridge
                        University; Wen was at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1922 to 1925; and
                        Zhu transferred from Laurence University at Wisconsin to the University of
                        Chicago and later to the University of Ohio from 1927 to 1929. </p>
                    <p>Xu Zhimo began to admire Keats as well as other Romantics in his Cambridge
                        years, 1921–22. His article “Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale,’” published in
                            <title level="j">Fiction Monthly </title>in 1925, reads like lecture
                        notes on Keats’s famous ode and translates its first five stanzas in prose.
                        It interweaves the prose translation with commentary, which emphasizes
                        Keats’s chameleonic quality, paralleling him with Shakespeare, the wording
                        of the passage a loose translation of Keats’s “camelion poet” letter. He
                        comments in admiration that Keats becomes a weeping cloud when singing to
                        Melancholy and turns into a sweet kernel while celebrating Autumn (2). The
                        article also includes excerpts from “Why did I laugh tonight?” and “After
                        dark vapours have oppressed our plains,” both in English, and concludes with
                        a portrait of Keats and the original “Ode to a Nightingale” in English.</p>
                    <p>Keats appears in Wen Yiduo’s first “new poem,” “The Western Bank,” the
                        epigraph of which is a quotation from Keats’s original lines in “There are
                        four seasons in the mind of man”: “He has a lusty spring, when fancy clear /
                        Takes in all beauty within an easy span” (<title level="m">Red Candle
                        </title>30). The poem is included in Wen’s first poetry collection, <title
                            level="m">Red Candle</title>, published in 1923, which pays tribute to
                        Keats in other poems as well. In a markedly Keatsian poem “Autumn Colors,”
                        the poet addresses the season as Keats did a hundred years ago: “I will sing
                        your color / by borrowing from Yishan<note place="foot">Courtesy name of Li
                            Shangyin, a major Tang poet who has been compared with Keats by some
                            Chinese scholars for the sensuousness and stylistic felicity found in
                            both of their poetry. See, for example, Zhu Ruidang, “A Comparison of
                            the Poetic Art of Li Shangyin and Keats”, in <title level="j">Journal of

                        poem, “The Loyal Minister of Art” (<title level="m">Red Candle</title>
                        86–87), in which Keats is regarded as the only loyal minister of the King of Art:<quote><lg>

                                <l>Attached to the royal dragon robe</l>

                            </lg></quote> The last stanza celebrates Keats as an eternal soul in the
                        kingdom of Art:<quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> The poem, though presenting Keats as the familiar figure
                        of an aesthete, challenges the disparagement of aestheticism by empowering
                        Keats with political metaphors to be the only loyal minister serving the
                        King of Art whose name will be immortalized. By inverting Keats’s original
                        words, “Here lies one whose name was writ in water,” Wen literally inscribes
                        Keats’s name in his poem. In elevating Keats above other poets, Wen pledges
                        his allegiance not only to Keats but to Art as a loyal devotee himself. The
                        importance he attached to the formal beauty of “new poetry,” a significant
                        contribution he made to the modern Chinese poetic tradition, cannot be
                        dissociated from his unreserved devotion to Keats as most fully exemplified
                        in this poem. </p>
                    <p>Keats often appears as Wen’s presider in his prose as well as in his poetry.
                        In his article, “On the New Poems Published in This Year’s <title level="j"
                            >Weekly</title>,” Wen cites the last lines of “When I have fears that I
                        will cease to be” in English as an example of “true poetry” (<title
                            level="m">New Poetry </title>4). In his “Commentary on <title level="m"
                            >Winter Night</title>,” the first collection of “new poems” by Yu
                        Pingbo, he uses Keats again as the exemplar of true poetry on account of
                        Keats’s firm command of words, supporting his view with the quotation of the
                        original lines in <title level="m">Endymion</title>: “Obstinate, silence
                        came heavily again / Feeling about for its old couch of space / And airy
                        cradle” (<title level="m">New Poetry </title>35–36).</p>
                    <p>One of Wen’s poems, “Rain of Tears,” was reviewed in <title level="j"
                            >Supplement to Beijing Daily</title> on 2 April 1925: “the poem does not
                        have the kind of verbal painting as found in Keats, but it is still a poem
                        that could only have been composed by Keats” (Zhu, <title level="m"
                            >Essays</title> 2:346). The same reviewer also criticizes Wen’s
                        wordiness in another article, “On Wen Yiduo’s Poetry,” in which he suggests
                        that one can compare Wen with Keats in the sense that Keats’s earlier works
                        are also extravagant, with images crowded like “summer reeds or unpruned
                        branches” (Zhu, <title level="m">Prose</title> 122)—different than his
                        mature ones in which not a single world can be added or taken off. The
                        commentator is Zhu Xiang, another fervent poet-admirer of Keats in China. In
                        his correspondence with Xiang Peiliang on 23 April 1925, Lu Xun writes: “Zhu
                        Xiang seems to have fallen as well, and nobody mentions him any more—even
                        though he is ‘the Chinese Keats’” (7:283). As the editor speculates, Lu Xun
                        may have misremembered Zhu Xiang’s comment on Wen’s poem quoted above
                        (7:284.8), but the identification with Keats stayed with Zhu Xiang ever
                        since. By “fallen,” Lu Xun seems to refer to Zhu’s increasing association
                        with the Crescent Moon Society (7:284.7); Lu Xun did not share the Society’s
                        aesthetic pursuits. </p>
                    <p>Zhu Xiang himself, however, was not happy with the label of “the Chinese
                        Keats.” In his poem “Returning South,” included in his first collection of
                        poems <title level="m">Summer</title> published in 1925, he expresses
                        nostalgia for his hometown in the south by comparing himself to a lonely
                        young swallow:<quote><lg>
                                <l>Many friends meant well;</l>
                                <l>They suggested that I return to the jade cage;</l>
                                <l>They said they would take me to Keats’s nightingale,</l>
                                <l>To correct my tuneless songs. (<title level="m">Zhu</title>
                                    15)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Apparently self-deprecating, the poet refuses to take his
                        friends’ well-meaning suggestions by insisting on his own cultural identity:
                        “They don’t know that I am only a small bird of the Orient” (<title
                            level="m">Zhu</title> 16). </p>
                    <p>Despite his claim for his own identity instead of being “the Chinese Keats,”
                        Zhu seemed often haunted by Keats. In “Visiting Beihai Park,” an essay
                        describing his excursion to the famous site, the poet cannot help but
                        remember lines of Keats’s “Fancy” when raindrops begin to fall on the lake:<quote><lg>
                                <l>Ever let the Fancy roam</l>

                            with Chinese “new poetry” and had not published English poems.</note>
                        based on Chinese mythology in the article, “The Dialogue between the Sun and
                        the Moon,” he talks about various poetic images of the sun, and does not
                        forget to include Keats’s “barred clouds” that “bloom the soft-dying day”
                        (quoted in English) in “To Autumn” (<title level="m">Zhu </title>200). In
                        another essay on “Ancient Ballads,” he pays tribute to Keats’s “wonderfully
                        sensuous” poetry, citing “I stood tiptoe on a little hill” and <title
                            level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes </title>as having qualities that can be
                        “rarely found in Chinese poetry.” On the other hand, he also gives several
                        examples from ancient Chinese ballads that, he writes, “can only be barely
                        rivaled by Keats even when Keats is at his best” (<title level="m"
                            >Prose</title> 80–81). In his correspondence with his friend Luo
                        Niansheng (“Letter to Luo Niansheng”), he acknowledges Keats’s influence on
                        his own poetry, mentioning that his poem “Wang Jiao” is more lyrical than
                        narrative, belonging to the same category as Keats’s <title level="m">The
                            Eve of St. Agnes</title> (<title level="m">Prose </title>246). Like
                            <title level="m">Eve</title>, “Wang Jiao” is a narrative romance, ending
                        tragically with the titled heroine dead after being abandoned by her lover. </p>
                    <p>From Keats’s prominent presence in his poetry and prose, one can clearly see
                        Keats’s influence on Zhu Xiang, but the influence seems to have also brought
                        him a sense of anxiety. The tension between the awareness of his own
                        cultural roots and his fascination with English poetry seems particularly
                        strong in him, which may have something to do with his continuous endeavor
                        to blend the two cultures in his short life, as seen in his pioneering work
                        in translation, especially of English Romantic poetry. In his translations,
                        Keats is given an eminent position as well. His collection of translated
                        poems, titled <title level="m">Myrtles: Translations of Foreign
                            Poems</title>, published in 1936 posthumously but actually translated in
                        1928 while he was studying in Chicago, includes five poems by Keats, only
                        next in number to the nine selections from Shakespeare. They are “Ode on a
                        Grecian Urn,” “Ode to a Nightingale,” “To Autumn,” “La Belle Dame sans
                        Merci,” and <title level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>. All the
                        translations are rendered in the form of Chinese “new poetry,” that is, in
                        vernacular Chinese and often with a loose sense of meter or rhyme. After Zhu
                        Xiang, other translators of Keats followed him in adopting the free verse
                        form, with some trying to capture the original metrical pattern wherever it
                        was possible. </p>
                    <p>After the 1920s, Keats’s haunting presence in China continued to be felt not
                        only in poetry but in scholarship as well. Fei Jianzhao, professor at Wuhan
                        University, stood out in the 1930s as the most important Keats scholar in
                        China; he admired Keats so much that he would only dress up when teaching
                        Keats, and even blamed Fanny Brawne for killing Keats. He died of
                        tuberculosis as well. His writings on Keats’s life, aesthetics, and
                        philosophy were mainly published in <title level="j">Monthly Journal of
                            Literature and Art</title>. In “Keats and Shakespeare,” from the April
                        1934 issue, Fei extensively quotes, in translation, from Keats’s letters
                        while tracing Shakespeare’s influence on Keats. The article covers almost
                        all key passages on Keats’s poetics, such as Shakespeare as Keats’s presider
                        and as the man with neutral intellect, Shakespeare’s intensity and negative
                        capability, and Keats’s poetic axioms and dramatic ambition. It also
                        includes a passage from <title level="m">King Stephens </title>in the
                        original, possibly the first mention of Keats’s drama in China (147). </p>
                    <p>On 1 December 1940, the fourth issue of <title level="j">Western
                            Literature</title> included a special column on Keats, collecting
                        Keats’s poems translated by Wu Xinghua, poet, translator, and scholar
                        regarded by many as a young genius. The collection includes “On First
                        Looking into Chapman’s Homer,” “Human Seasons,” “Ode to Psyche,” “Ode on
                        Melancholy,” “Bright Star” (retitled as “Last Sonnet”), and “When I have
                        fears.” Translations of Keats’s letters by Song Tifen (Song Qi) are found in
                        the column as well, containing Keats’s self-reflection on <title level="m"
                            >Endymion</title>, his confession of his dramatic ambition, discussion
                        of Milton, as well as a letter to Fanny. </p>
                    <p>By 1949, Keats had already been commonly taught in universities. In Taiwanese

                        she recalls the English Poetry course taught by Zhu Guangqian, the founder
                        of aesthetics in twentieth-century China, at Wuhan University during the
                        Sino-Japanese War years. Zhu started the course with the Romantic Era rather
                        than following the chronological order in <title level="m">The Golden
                            Treasury </title>edited by Francis T. Palgrave, and Qi remembers her

                    <p>The canonical status of Keats at universities can be seen in “On Teaching
                        English Poetry,” the first article that involves Keats published in<title
                            level="j"> Journal of Literature and Art</title> after the founding of
                        New China in 1949. The article was written by Bian Zhilin, an important poet,
                        scholar, and translator of Shakespeare, who recalls his experience of
                        studying and teaching English poetry from 1929 when he entered Peking
                        University as an undergraduate. Like Zhu Guangqian, Bian’s American
                        professor also started the course directly with the fourth chapter of <title
                            level="m">The Golden Treasury</title>, “Romantic Poetry.” When he was in
                        his second year, the course was taught by Xu Zhimo, whose syllabus was
                        entirely confined to the nineteenth century, with particular attention to
                        the Romantics. This preference for Romanticism, Bian reflects, had its
                        historical inevitability, for the tensions between revolutionary fervor and
                        escapism and between idealism and disillusionment, which were most fully
                        exemplified in Romantic poetry, had a particular resonance for Chinese
                        readers, who had been caught in complex fluxes of “colonial, bourgeois, and
                        proletarian revolutions” ever since 1911 (32). Byron, Shelley, and Keats,
                        the best-known Western poets in China then, Bian writes, were “revolutionary
                        poets,” but their revolution was bourgeois, and they gradually became
                        escapists when their ideals failed to be realized (31). After cataloguing
                        the escapism in Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley, Bian acknowledges Keats’s
                        difference determined by his humbler “petty bourgeois” background, but he
                        concludes that the cruel reality Keats faced only turned him away to romance
                        and the sensuous imaginary world with the “wings of poesy” (31). It was
                        Keats’s poetry “that defined the course of ensuing bourgeois poetry, which
                        turned from ‘revolutionary efforts’ to ‘escapism’” (31). Bian also discusses
                        the influence of Romanticism on modern Chinese poetry, especially the
                        Crescent Moon poetry, which became increasingly escapist and bourgeois. This
                        tendency did not change until Mao Zedong’s 1942 “Yan’an Talks on Literature
                        and Art” (32). </p>
                    <p>The politicized reading of Keats and other “bourgeois poets” in Bian’s
                        article published right at the beginning of Communist China suggests the
                        dramatic change of the political climate, when the nation began to be firmly
                        controlled by the official ideology established by Mao’s “Yan’an Talks.”
                        Given in 1942, Mao’s “Yan’an Talks” became the most important guideline for
                        literature and art in Communist China. Their essence was the politicization
                        of literature and art, which were deprived of their autonomy and reduced to
                        the means to serve the end of achieving the Party’s political aims. In the
                        field of foreign literature, the author’s class stance, particularly
                        relevant because of his or her bourgeois background, was the most important
                        standard in determining the value of a literary work. In the field of
                        Chinese literature and art, the Westernized tendency after the May Fourth
                        Movement was criticized; whether or not a writer or an artist would employ
                        Chinese or nationalist artistic forms was no longer a matter of taste, but a
                        vital issue of political stance (Gao 352). In such a context, the apolitical
                        Keats well established before 1949 was naturally disfavored and became an
                        increasingly marginalized figure. Even when touched upon, Keats was viewed
                        with reservation as someone who, starting from a lower class background,
                        could have become, but eventually failed to be, a thorough revolutionary.
                        This politicized Keats took almost a U-turn from the pre-1949
                        overaestheticized Keats. While in both cases Keats was appropriated, the
                        pre-1949 appropriation was essentially literary in nature, whereas the
                        post-1949 one was ideological. As a result, Keats almost sank into oblivion
                        in both translation and scholarship in Communist China, even when
                        translations of Western literary classics were organized by the government
                        in early 1950s.</p>
                    <p>The politicization of Keats as well as other Romantics in China further was
                        exacerbated by the introduction of the Soviet literary theory of progressive
                        and reactionary Romanticism. The 1953 <title level="m">British Literary
                            History </title>edited by Gorky World Literature Research Institute at
                        Moscow, for example, became almost the official guide in reading English
                        literature in China. Its preface first analyzes the increasingly intensified
                        social conflicts in Romantic Britain so as to determine the nature of the
                        class struggle, thus defining British Romanticism as the “product” of the
                        French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution (3). It then divides the
                        British Romantics into two camps: the reactionary, that is, the Lakers; and
                        the progressive, unsurprisingly consisting of Byron and Shelley, who take up
                        most of the space in the entire book as well as in the preface. The Byron
                        chapter is more than a hundred and thirty pages long, the Shelley one a
                        hundred pages, whereas Keats is given less than thirty pages.</p>
                    <p>The Keats chapter in <title level="m">British Literary History </title>opens
                        by calling Keats a “complex and important phenomenon,” occupying a special
                        position in English Romanticism (158). It defines Keats as divided from the
                        Lake poets because of his humanitarianism, materialism, and limited
                        radicalism, and notes his affinity with the revolutionary Romantics, citing
                        Shelley’s and Byron’s championship of Keats as evidence. However, his
                        aestheticism, according to the chapter, also made him different from the
                        two, who regarded poetry as weapon for political protest (158). The chapter
                        then introduces Keats’s life briefly and discusses his poetry, with emphasis
                        on his early “political” poems, such as “On Peace” and several poems
                        dedicated to Hunt, which are considered progressive but still remote from
                        the actual condition of British political struggle (162). The sensuous love
                        celebrated in <title level="m">Endymion</title> is regarded as a protest
                        against the puritan hypocrisy of British bourgeoisie, and Keats’s Hellenism
                        is aligned with the revolutionary Byron and Shelley, suggesting his
                        dissatisfaction with reality (167). The post-<title level="m"
                            >Endymion</title> stage is described as revealing Keats’s awakening
                        social consciousness, exemplified in his keen awareness of hardships endured
                        by the Scottish and Irish people he witnessed on his Northern tour (168–69).
                            <title level="m">Hyperion</title> is interpreted as manifesting great
                        social revolution, namely the replacement of feudal society by the
                        capitalist one, and the historical idea conveyed by the poem that the new
                        will triumph over the old suggests Keats’s deep doubts about the prospect of
                        the capitalist society (173–75). The three narrative poems, <title level="m"
                            >Isabella</title>, <title level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>, and
                            <title level="m">Lamia</title>, reveal Keats’s hostility or even hatred
                        towards private ownership and exploitative society, echoing Shaw’s famous
                        comment on <title level="m">Isabella</title> (176–77).<note place="foot"
                            >Shaw famously writes, “Keats achieved the very curious feat of writing
                            one poem of which it may be said that if Karl Marx can be imagined as
                            writing a poem instead of a treatise on Capital, he would have written
                                <title level="m">Isabella</title>” (175). </note>
                        <title level="m">The Fall of Hyperion</title> is considered Keats’s greatest
                        poem, in which he criticizes his own earlier aestheticism, and replaces it
                        with a new understanding of humanitarianism that develops into a deep
                        sympathy for the people enslaved by the pernicious social system (178–79).
                        The great odes, melancholy as they are, bespeak optimism for future mankind
                        despite present social injustice (180). “To Autumn,” for example, depicts
                        the agricultural labor of a female peasant (182). <title level="m">The Cap
                            and Bells</title> is also mentioned for its satire of aristocracy and
                        royalty (183). The last part of the chapter discusses Keats’s style, and
                        attributes his concrete imagery to his realism and materialism, thus
                        distinguishing Keats from the reactionary Romantics (184–86). The chapter
                        concludes that, although Keats gave up imaginary beauty and came closer to
                        heroic beauty found in reality, he failed to fully develop it (186). This
                        was achieved only by Byron and Shelley, who participated in people’s
                        political struggle for liberation (186). </p>
                    <p>Another key Soviet reference that Chinese scholars often resorted to was
                        Anikst’s <title level="m">Outline of British Literary History</title>,
                        published in Moscow in 1956 and translated in China in 1959 by several
                        renowned Chinese scholars of Western literary studies. The chapter on
                        Romanticism makes the same division of the Romantics into the reactionary or
                        passive and the progressive or revolutionary, but the division is based on
                        the two camps’ differing attitudes toward the French Revolution. The
                        reactionary side was represented by Burke, the progressive by Priestly,
                        Paine, and Wollstonecraft (274–75). Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey are
                        examples of turncoats (282). The publication of <title level="m">Childe
                            Harold’s Pilgrimage</title> in 1812 marked the formation of
                        revolutionary Romanticism, but Anikst points out that Byron failed to
                        transcend bourgeois democratic principles, whereas Shelley was the spokesman
                        for the masses’ socialist struggles (282). Keats is not even mentioned in
                        the introductory section. Again, the space the author gives to each Romantic
                        in the chapter is telling enough: the Lakers, en masse, take up ten pages;
                        Byron alone, thirty two; Shelley, fourteen; and Keats, faring better than
                        the Lakers, eight pages. Scott, for his affinity with realism, is allotted
                        twenty pages. </p>
                    <p>The eight-page section on Keats defines him as the third progressive
                        Romantic; this claim is supported by his association with Leigh Hunt, whose
                        circle was “against the ruling class in Britain” (359), and by the
                        affirmative comments of Byron and Shelley on Keats. According to Anikst,
                        “Keats was disapproved of by the capitalist aristocracy but deemed a comrade
                        by the revolutionary Romantics. This fact alone is sufficient to determine
                        which camp Keats belonged to in his age” (340). Again, Keats’s early
                        political poems are cited, and <title level="m">Isabella</title> is also
                        singled out for its accusation of the capitalist exploitation of the
                        laboring class (341). Keats’s progressive Hellenism is contrasted with the
                        reactionary Romantics’ ideals in medievalism (342), with the medievalism in
                            <title level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title> conveniently disregarded.
                            <title level="m">Hyperion</title> is interpreted as an allegory of the
                        failure of the French Revolution, and affirmed for its overall revolutionary
                        stance (343). Anikst seems on the whole quite sympathetic with Keats,
                        fiercely against the bourgeois aesthetes who claim Keats as their precursor,
                        but her remark that Keats’s death was “probably” caused by reactionary
                        critics’ malicious mockery and attack still betrays the deep-seated
                        influence of the myth surrounding Keats’s death propagated chiefly by these
                        bourgeois aesthetes (339–40).</p>
                    <p>The dominant influence of the Soviet theory is evident in Zha Liangzheng’s
                        (Mu Dan’s) preface to his translation, <title level="m">Selected Poems of
                            Keats</title>, the publication of which in 1958 went much against the
                        current. A leading Chinese modernist poet under the influence of William
                        Empson, with whom he studied at the National Southwestern Associated
                        University before getting his PhD at Chicago, Zha was also the most
                        prestigious and affinitive poet-translator of Keats and other Romantic poets
                        (Byron and Pushkin most famously) in twentieth-century China. Given the
                        harsh political climate, the poet-translator is clearly on guard in the
                        preface, quoting from the authoritative 1953 <title level="m">British
                            Literary History</title> discussed above to define Keats’s class stance
                        “as oppositional to the reactionary Lakers and affinitive to the
                        revolutionary romantics,” as well as emphasizing Keats’s liberalism and
                        social awareness through his association with Leigh Hunt and his early poems
                        such as “To Kosciusko” (365–66). Zha also attempts to legitimize Keats by
                        his high reputation among Soviet readers (368). Dancing with shackles, he
                        can only convey his admiration for Keats in these politically correct terms.
                        Had he not done so, it is questionable whether the publication of the
                        translation of Keats, the less progressive Romantic, would have been
                        permitted in the first place. On the other hand, even in Soviet standard,
                        Keats was a safer choice than “reactionary” Romantics. In this case, it was
                        probably Keats’s middling political position that saved him from the fate of
                        being completely forbidden. The translation, though not likely to have
                        reached a big readership, nevertheless ensured that Keats’s poetry continued
                        to survive, however precariously, even in such a repressive time. As to
                        whether or not Zha picked Keats exactly for his not so overtly political
                        poetry under his own restraining political circumstances, however, one is
                        only left with conjecture. In the preface, however, Zha strives to give
                        Keats a fair aesthetic evaluation as much as he is allowed. He highlights
                        Keats’s unrivalled influence upon subsequent poetry, and vindicates Keats by
                        freeing him from the charges of being an exemplar of art for art’s sake and
                        progenitor of sensuous decadents made by “bourgeois critics” (365). More
                        importantly, he was the first Chinese scholar and translator to point out
                        the sane and healthy nature of Keats’s poetry, the concrete and truthful
                        qualities of Keatsian beauty, and the underlying sense of irony in Keats’s
                        celebration of artistic immortality, despite the fact that Keats “was not a
                        revolutionary Romantic as Byron and Shelley” (366). He concludes that
                        Keats’s poetry is “bright, tough, and genuine,” with neither Byron’s
                        pessimism and despair nor Shelley’s utopianism, but contains “a
                        half-illusory, half-concrete world full of human warmth,” “hence conducive
                        to the fostering of socialist taste of the readership”—the last note
                        betraying the repressive political environment again (367–68).Soon after the
                        publication of the translation, Zha was labeled as a counterrevolutionary
                        for his enlistment in the Chinese Expedition Force for Burma to aid the
                        British forces against the Japanese during WWII, and then worked in a
                        library under surveillance for almost two decades. He translated <title
                            level="m">Don Juan </title>during this period (1962–65). </p>
                    <p> Zha’s Keats translations were quickly drowned in the overall enthusiasm for
                        the headlong Great Leap Forward Campaign launched in 1958. This was Mao’s
                        ambitious scheme to rapidly transform the agrarian China into a socialist
                        nation through industrialization and collectivization, which ended up in
                        famine. In the field of literature and art, the “Great Leap Forward” meant
                        to attack the tendencies to “elevate the classic and debase our contemporary
                        literature” and those that “preferred Western to Chinese literature.” Keats
                        became an increasingly minor poet in Chinese readership and scholarship, as
                        evident in the standard university textbook <title level="m">Western
                            European Literary History</title>, first published in 1964 and used
                        until almost the end of the twentieth century. As the title of the
                        Romanticism section, “British Romanticism, Byron, Shelley,” indicates, Keats
                        is given much lighter weight than the other two poets. His class stance is
                        defined as anti-feudal in <title level="m">Isabella</title> and <title
                            level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>, progressive in <title level="m"
                            >Hyperion</title>, but escapist after all in his “aestheticism”
                        (2:67–68).</p>

                    <p>With the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the ensuing sudden
                        outburst of the long-repressed craving for art and poetry, especially
                        Western ones, among Chinese readers, the last two and a half decades of the
                        twentieth century witnessed a gradual revival of Keats. In 1983, Zhu Weiji’s
                        translation of Keats’s poetry, <title level="m">Selected Poems of
                            Keats</title>, was published, but Zhu, also the translator of <title
                            level="m">Don Juan</title>, <title level="m">The Divine Comedy</title>,
                        and <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, had already died during the
                        Cultural Revolution. By also including <title level="m">Endymion</title>,
                            <title level="m">Hyperion</title>, and <title level="m">Lamia</title>,
                        this selection significantly expands Zha’s translation of sixty-five poems
                        which are mainly short lyrics, the longest being <title level="m"
                            >Isabella</title> and<title level="m"> The Eve of St. Agnes</title>.</p>
                    <p>In 1991, the most authoritative scholarly work on English Romanticism in
                        China, Wang Zuoliang’s <title level="m">History of English Romantic
                            Poetry</title>, was published, giving the most holistic, in-depth, and
                        sympathetic review of Keats up to the day. Wang, who returned to China in
                        1949 after obtaining B. Litt at Oxford, was a leading scholar of British
                        literary studies in the latter half of the twentieth century. He was also an
                        enthusiastic champion of Zha Liangzheng’s poetry and translation, on top of
                        being Zha’s fellow student at the Southwestern Associated University and his
                        dear friend for a lifetime. Wang’s scholarly work became a milestone on the
                        path of Keats’s restoration in China. Unlike the two Soviet literary
                        histories, the Keats chapter in Wang’s <title level="m">History</title> is
                        the longest, longer than all the other five chapters on the rest of the “Big
                        Six,” reaching almost a hundred pages, whereas Byron is given thirty pages,
                        and Shelley, sixty. The chapter is a thoroughgoing introduction with
                        generous quotations from Keats’s poetry (in translation), starting from the
                        very first “Imitation of Spenser” and going through the early poems, <title
                            level="m">Endymion</title>, post-<title level="m">Endymion</title>
                        sonnets, short lyrics, narratives, the plays, the two <title level="m"
                            >Hyperion</title>s, and the great odes. Quotations from Keats’s letters
                        (in translation) are also extensive, including the most important passages
                        on poetics, such as the “authenticity of the Imagination,” “negative
                        capability,” “the camelion poet,” poetry with “a palpable design,” Keats’s
                        “poetic axioms,” “mansion of many apartments,” and the “vale of
                        soul-making.” The last part of the chapter concludes with Keats’s
                        distinctive features, including his poetic status as among the greatest
                        English poets, his amazingly rapid progress made especially in his “Great
                        Year,” his deep insights into life and poetry conveyed in his letters, and
                        his transitional role in taking after Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton and
                        passing his legacy on to Tennyson, the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne, Wallace
                        Stevens, and most relevantly, to Xu Zhimo and Wen Yiduo in China. As Wang
                        concludes, Keats is both a nineteenth-century man and our contemporary,
                        having had to face many problems of modernity. He thus highlights Keats’s
                        post-Romantic qualities (292), which has been a central issue in Western
                        Keats scholarship in the latter half of the twentieth century as well.
                        Throughout the chapter, one can see that Wang had kept up-to-date with Keats
                        scholarship in the English-speaking world for the past four decades from his
                        citation of secondary sources, which include leading Keats scholars from the
                        beginning of the century to the 1980s, such as John Middleton Murry, Douglas
                        Bush, Walter Jackson Bate, Robert Gittings, and the more recent Helen
                        Vendler. The fact that China had been cut off from the West for about four
                        decades made Wang’s work all the more impressive a feat. Wang’s work is
                        therefore historic in the sense that it resumes the dialogue between Chinese
                        and Western scholars and in turn, Keats’s afterlife is regenerated when
                        China itself was experiencing a regeneration. </p>
                    <p>In 1995, a symposium was jointly hosted by Chinese Translators Association
                        and Renmin Wenxue Chubanshe (People’s Literature Press) to commemorate
                        Keats’s bicentennial, two years after which the current standard Keats
                        translation by Tu An was put to press. The translation opens with the great
                        odes, followed by fifty-five sonnets, lyrics and ballads, narratives, and
                        finally romances and epics, which include the entire <title level="m"
                            >Endymion</title> and <title level="m">Hyperion</title>. The
                        translator’s preface encapsulates the sense of transition from the
                        politicized reading of the last four decades that slighted Keats to the
                        recent revival of the poet’s reputation. Keats’s political stance is
                        stressed as before: “In terms of his opposition to tyranny and oppression
                        and longing for democracy and freedom, Keats stands together with Byron and
                        Shelley, even though he has not suggested revolution and reform like they
                        have” (3).Citing even more early poems to demonstrate Keats’s “democratic
                        awareness,” Tu An also quotes Shaw’s association of <title level="m"
                            >Isabella</title> with <title level="m">The Capital</title> as Soviet
                        critics did. On the other hand, he points out the Shakespearean qualities in
                        Keats and discusses Keats’s letters. Most remarkably, the translator
                        introduces the more up-to-date criticism from the English-speaking world,
                        which challenges the earlier evaluation of Keats as a sensuous aesthete with
                        more recent findings on the poet’s close engagement with history and
                        politics (3). Though not directly citing any English secondary source, his
                        remark reveals an awareness of the historicized reading of Keats prevalent
                        from the late 1970s onward in Britain and America. In this sense, Tu An
                        carried on the dialogue between Chinese and Western Keats scholars resumed
                        in Wang Zuoliang’s work. He finally pays tribute to the preceding
                        generations of Keats translators, namely, Zhu Xiang, Zha Liangzheng, and Zhu
                        Weiji, at the close of his preface, thus writing the past into the present
                        of Keats scholarship in China and extending Keats’s afterlife in China to
                        the turn of the century.</p>
                    <p>However, for all the strenuous efforts Wang and Tu made to restore Keats to
                        the eminent status he deserved among English poets, one should not be
                        over-optimistic in estimating the impact of their works, which, after all,
                        were mainly circulated among specialists. Even in the post-Mao era, Keats
                        remained the lesser English Romantic than Byron and Shelley among common
                        readers. Within the academic circle, the number of scholarly publications on
                        Keats, much lower than that of works on Byron, shows no sign that Keats’s
                        reputation in China was growing dramatically. </p>
                    <p>This can be corroborated with a brief look at the state of Keats translation
                        and study in the twenty-first century. <title level="m">Keats’s
                            Letters</title>, translated by Wang Xinruo, was published in 2003, but
                        the preface penned by the translator makes an evident mistake in stating
                        that Keats’s father “was murdered” when he was eight (1). Another important
                        work was Fu Yanxiu’s <title level="m">Keats: A Critical Biography</title>
                        published in 2008. In the preface and the afterword, the author points out
                        rightly that in China, Keats had long been overshadowed by Byron and
                        Shelley, both of whom inspired admiration more easily than Keats in the
                        turbulent context of the early twentieth century (11). One of the purposes
                        of his biography, he claims, is to correct the misleading portrayal of Keats
                        as “a second-rate figure” provided by some textbooks in China and the dated
                        misconception of Keats as an aesthete and a weakling killed off by his
                        reviewers (464). He also draws a parallel between Keats’s England and
                        contemporary China in the rapid process of commercialization and suggests,
                        “some phenomena that took place in Manchester and Glasgow are replaying in
                        many cities in China” (12). One is not sure whether he has the dark Satanic
                        mills or Peterloo Massacre in his mind when writing this. It is for this
                        parallel, he concludes, that Keats is most needed now in China for his
                        humanism and passion for poetry (11–12).</p>
                    <p>By looking at the trajectory of Keats’s reception that underwent
                        appropriation, oblivion, and restoration in twentieth-century China where
                        tempestuous ideological changes had taken place, one can see that the
                        original text had been constantly reshaped by its foreign context. Keats’s
                        poetry, however, with its tranquil resistance, refused to be trodden down by
                        these hungry generations and still survives. In this unfamiliar nation,
                        Keats “[found] his happiness in another kind of wood,” and “[was] punished
                        under a foreign code of conscience” (“In Memory of W. B. Yeats”). Throughout
                        the twentieth century, Keats had been evoked for various causes—as the other
                        to the Satanic poets, as the other to both the reactionary and the
                        revolutionary Romantics, as a poetic hero for modern Chinese poets, and as a
                        humanist against the rampant modernization and industrialization in China.
                        These multiple Keatses (Stillinger 10), partial as they all are, testify to
                        Keats’s multi-faceted richness and indeterminacy achieved by his remarkably
                        sympathetic imagination and honesty about the human condition that lend his
                        poetry a peculiar contemporaneousness for different generations of his
                        Chinese readers. As Keats famously writes about “the poetical Character,”
                        “that sort of which, if I am anything, I am a member,” a poet “has no
                        identity—he is continually in for—and filling some other Body”
                        (1:386–87). In those foreign bodies of others that he continually fills,
                        Keats’s afterlife is carried on vigorously. </p>
