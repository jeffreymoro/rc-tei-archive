                <p rend="noCount">The Chinese poet Hsu Chih-Mo (1897-1931), known as the Chinese
                    Shelley, brought Romantic ideas from Britain to modern China. His conviction of
                    liberty was manifested in his literary works, alongside his pursuit of true love
                    and social change. This essay employs the concept of “Romantic legacies” to
                    revisit Hsu’s Romantic philosophy and Taiwan’s Romantic movements. Firstly, the
                    essay examines Hsu’s Romantic legacies. Influenced by Bertrand Russell, Thomas
                    Hardy and other British intellectuals, Hsu succeeded to Shelley’s Romantic ideas
                    of social justice and love. His journeys to Europe and experience of love helped
                    shape and reshape his Romantic philosophy. Secondly, the essay explores Hsu’s
                    Romantic ideas and Taiwan’s democratization. Hsu’s literary works, regaining
                    significance in the spirit of the Fourth May movement, facilitated Taiwanese
                    youngsters’ understanding of the significance of independent minds. Hsu’s
                    poetics of liberty was introduced to Taiwan and gained popularity, in
                    particular, during the period of campus ballads. In brief, the Shelleyan skylark
                    flew from Britain, via modern China, to Taiwan and continues singing its songs
                    of idealism.</p>

                    Liberty</head>
                <div type="section">
                    <p>Hsu Chih-Mo (1897–1931), originally spelt Hsu Tsemon by Hsu himself and now
                        also spelt Xu Zhimo, is an early twentieth-century poet who was born in the
                        late Ching Dynasty (1616–1912)<note place="foot">It is now spelt “Qing
                            Dynasty” according to the spelling system established by communist
                            China. During Hsu’s times and in previous research of the Dynasty,
                            “Ching” was commonly adopted and the spelling sounds much closer to the
                            original word. This spelling remains widely in use. I therefore adopt
                            the traditional spelling throughout the essay.</note> and whose Romantic
                        ideas derived particularly from British poets and his visiting studies at
                        Cambridge University in the early twentieth century. Hsu claimed that he was
                        greatly influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The imagery of Shelley’s
                        “skylark” particularly impressed him, as stated in a letter that Hsu wrote
                        in English to Ogden, his British publisher, dated 2 November 1924: “I am a
                        sincere worshipper of your ethereal Bard of the skylark” (qtd. in Liu
                            152).<note place="foot">For this English letter, its manuscript and the
                            friendship between Hsu and Odgen, see Liu.</note> Shelley’s name and the
                        “skylark” are frequently mentioned throughout Hsu’s works. In his “Keats’s
                        ‘Ode to a Nightingale,’” Hsu responds to Shelley’s “The Cloud,” “Ode to the
                        West Wind,” and “To a Skylark” and ponders on the symbol of Shelley’s
                        skylark: “as for his ode to the ‘Skylark’ no one knows whether it is the
                        poet that is singing outside the sky or it is the skylark that is singing
                        inside the lines” (285). Hsu’s biographers have recognized his Romantic
                        legacy and named him “the Chinese Shelley.”<note place="foot">In <title
                                level="m">The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature</title>,
                            Kang-I Sun Chang and Stephen Owen examine Chinese literature and
                            reaffirm Shelley as one of the most influential poets to Hsu. Also see
                            Spurling, 173–74.</note> In her memoir, Pearl Buck (1892–1973) singles
                        out Hsu (Xu in her book) and recognises him as “the Chinese Shelley”: “[O]ne
                        handsome and rather distinguished and certainly much beloved young poet was
                        proud to be called ‘the Chinese Shelley’” (qtd. in Spurling 173).<note
                            place="foot">According to Spurling, there were “half a dozen Chinese
                            Shelleys” and Hsu was also called “the Chinese Byron” (174).</note> Hsu
                        enlightened his contemporaries by introducing a Romantic ethos into the
                        early period of the republican China. His concept of liberty was manifested
                        in his pursuit of true love and social justice, together with his literary
                        creations. After the withdrawal of the democratic China to Taiwan in 1949,
                        Taiwan’s “campus ballads” flourished, inheriting the words and spirit of
                        Hsu’s Romantic poetry.</p>
                    <p>Many critics have endeavored to expand Romantic ideas by introducing or
                        connecting such ideas to other periods and regions. “The legacy of
                        Romanticism” has therefore emerged as a key concept in the study of
                        Romanticism. In recent years Michael O’Neill and other critics have explored
                        the legacies of Romanticism in Western literature.<note place="foot">See
                            O’Neill. For updates on critical studies of Romantic legacies, also see
                            Sandy and Davies.</note> As an emerging field in Romantic studies,
                        however, “the legacy of Romanticism” has yet to be sufficiently expanded
                        worldwide. In terms of Romantic connections between Hsu and Shelley, it was
                        Bertrand Russell, together with other twentieth-century English
                        contemporaries, who was greatly influenced by Shelley and instigated Hsu’s
                        interest in English Romanticism. Like a bard, Shelley’s skylark chanted
                        idealism from early nineteenth-century Britain, via modern China, to Taiwan.
                        Such reception of English Romanticism currently echoes those protests for
                        freedom and individualism in some parts of the world under dictatorship.
                        This essay aims to heighten the significance of English Romanticism in East
                        Asia by demonstrating Hsu’s Romantic legacies in modern China and his
                        Shelleyan liberalism revived, in particular, during the period of Taiwan’s
                        campus ballads.</p>

                    <p>Hsu Chih-Mo’s early education in the English language, history, politics and
                        economics, and afterwards his visiting studies in England strengthened his
                        enthusiasm for Western philosophy and literature, particularly those of the
                        Romantic era. As a child, Hsu was fully supported by his wealthy father for
                        a complete Western education. In addition to his studies in traditional
                        Chinese culture, which included the canon and calligraphy, the adolescent
                        Hsu learned the English language in the major academic institution of the
                        Ching Dynasty, Jingshih Tongwen Guan (Beijing Tongwen Institute),<note
                            place="foot"> Regarding the history of the Tongwen Institute, as well as
                            the foreign language training in the Ching Dynasty, see C. Wang 182.
                            According to Wang, the Tongwen Institute was established in 1862 mainly
                            to cultivate translation specialists and assist foreign affairs (182).

                        University. In its late period, the decaying empire, the Ching Dynasty, was
                        invaded by the “Eight-Nation Alliance,” including Russia, Germany, France,
                        the United States, Japan, Austria, Italy, and Britain. This ill-reputed
                        shame forced the imperial court to recognize the significance of
                        understanding the West, including its science, language and culture.
                        Language education was the key point for the royal court in cultivating
                        experts in foreign languages and translations. In such a political context,
                        English training enabled Hsu to go abroad, supported by his father, a
                        successful merchant, first to the United States for a BA degree in history
                        at Clark University, Massachusetts, in 1918 and afterwards for an MA in
                        economics and politics at Columbia University in 1919.<note place="foot">See
                            P. Chang 110.</note> Hsu’s earlier research in history and economics may
                        have been the foundation for his enthusiasm for social reforms in the newly
                        established China. Resonant with Virginia Woolf’s assertion of women’s
                            awakening,<note place="foot">Woolf’s feminist views might have been
                            received by Hsu through his readings of Russell’s works. Russell knew
                            Woolf well through their intellectual circle, namely the Grantchester
                            Group, which also consisted of E. M. Forster (novelist), Ludwig
                            Wittgenstein (German philosopher), John Keynes (economist), Rupert
                            Brooke (poet), and Augustus John (artist). Russell’s writings covered
                            many areas, including the arts, philosophy, literature, women’s rights,
                            and economy, and unwittingly enlightened his young admirer Hsu

                        viewpoint on Chinese women’s social status. Back in China, Hsu further
                        disseminated the Western thought of liberty through his magazine pieces,
                        newspaper articles and public lectures. The liberation of the mind was Hsu’s
                        first concern as a stepping-stone for social reforms. His overseas
                        experience was what majorly instigated the young poet to reassess social

                        Romanticism. Impressed by Russell’s fame, Hsu gave up an admission offer
                        from Columbia University for doctoral research, and instead, without his
                        father’s approval, Hsu sought supervision from Russell in England, as stated
                        in Hsu’s Chinese prose entitled “All the Cambridge I Know”: “As for studies,
                        I came to Britain to follow Russell” (36).<note place="foot">Hereafter all
                            quotations from Hsu’s works and other resources written in Chinese are
                            my translations, unless otherwise stated.</note> Unfortunately, Hsu did
                        not have a chance to work with Russell. Upon his arrival in London in 1920,
                        Hsu was told that Russell was away in China. Russell’s post as professor was
                        suspended by Cambridge University as a result of his anti-war advocacy
                        during the First World War. Nevertheless, Hsu’s understanding of Romantic
                        literature and ideas was increasingly reinforced during his life in Britain,
                        where he was accepted as a special student at London School of Economics in
                        1920 and later at Cambridge in 1921. Hsu might have been familiar with
                        Russell’s philosophy during his studies in the United States, although there
                        is no other written evidence in Hsu’s works. That possibility would explain
                        Hsu’s eagerness to go to Britain to follow Russell.</p>
                    <p>Shelley’s philosophy may also have been passed on, via Russell’s works, to
                        the young Hsu. In fact, Shelley had left a deep impression on Russell, as
                        evidenced in the following quotation: <quote>Shelley was a wonderful
                            discovery.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I couldn’t understand how grown-up
                            people, who admired Shakespeare and Milton could fail to care about
                            Shelley. I got a passionate love of him—more than for any one I knew.
                            (Qtd. in Leithauser 34)</quote> While Shelley’s socialism and atheism
                        were unconventional, these radical ideas spread widely and influenced later
                        European intellectuals, including Russell, Karl Marx and George Bernard
                            Shaw.<note place="foot">See Bevir.</note> Despite his ambivalence
                        towards the Romantic movement, Russell affirmed that Shelley was an
                        unconventional Romantic particularly in the realm of the human mind
                        (Leithauser 32). Influenced by Shelley’s atheism, Russell continued to
                        challenge Christianity and the legitimacy of religion in his early lecture
                        “Why I Am Not a Christian: An Examination of the God-Idea.” Echoing
                        Shelley’s atheistic philosophy, Russell eventually rejects religion and
                        endorses science for a better world, as stated in the lecture: “Religion is
                        based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Science
                        can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so
                        many generations” (596).<note place="foot">The lecture was delivered on 6
                            March 1927 to the National Secular Society and published in pamphlet
                            form in the same year.</note> He thinks that fear comes from “human
                        ignorance.” Russell’s Shelleyan perspectives indeed echo Hsu’s inclination
                        for atheism, science and materialism. Hsu particularly elaborates on these
                        philosophical ideas in his prose essays, including “Words” (“Hua”) and “The
                        Death of My Grandmother.” Hsu clearly expresses his “body-mind” philosophy
                        in “The Death of My Grandmother”: <quote>Scientists say that the
                            consciousness and aspiration merely work with the nervous
                            system.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. [T]he body is for the sake of function, and
                            [the consciousness] becomes void without the body. [The concept of] the
                            soul is a big lie told by religionists. Once the human body dies,
                            everything is gone. (137–38)</quote>

                    <p> Beyond Russell’s influences on Hsu’s philosophy, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson
                            (1862–1932)<note place="foot">The first name of Dickinson was misspelt
                            by Hsu as “Galsworthy.”</note> and Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) are the two
                        British intellectuals and writers who particularly shared their Romantic
                        ideas with Hsu and somewhat strengthened his understanding of Shelley’s
                        philosophy. Hsu met Dickinson in his early days in London and arranged to
                        see Hardy during his second journey from China to England. These two
                        Englishmen enlightened the young poet in the realm of English literature,
                        including Shelley’s poems. In his “All the Cambridge I Know,” Hsu mentions
                        his first encounter with and later befriending of Dickinson, who was then a
                        fellow at King’s College, Cambridge: “I had fooled around at LSE, London,
                        for half a year. Feeling no way out and thinking of another way [for
                        visiting studies], [in 1921] I met Mr Dickinson, .&#160;.&#160;. a noted
                        author whom I earlier admired due to two of his pamphlets—‘Letters from John
                        Chinaman’ and ‘A Modern Symposium’” (36–37). Dickinson’s understanding of
                        Shelley’s philosophy and poetry is revealed in his edition of Shelley’s
                            <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. Shelley’s philosophy of
                        liberty against political oppression in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound
                        </title>strengthened Dickinson’s pacifism, which was an anti-war belief held
                        by the Dickinson circle, inclusive of Russell, during World War I. The
                        circle’s pacifism echoes Hsu’s humanitarianism exhibited particularly during
                        his journey, via Russia, to Europe. In his “Notes on a Journey to Europe,”
                            <note place="foot">This prose was written in Florence, Italy.</note>
                        dated 29 May 1925, Hsu sympathizes with people’s poverty in Siberia after
                        the 1917 October Revolution, or the Red Revolution (177–80).</p>
                    <p>Hardy is another influential man of letters who led Hsu to further explore
                        Romantic ideas. In his essay entitled “An Afternoon of Visiting Hardy,” Hsu
                        describes “the impressive magic of the arts” in Romantic poets, such as
                        Keats, Shelley and Wordsworth, and his perusal of Hardy’s works (155). In
                        1922 the meeting between the young Hsu (aged 25) and the elderly Hardy (aged
                        82), although less than an hour, was arranged by Hsu’s first English friend,
                        Dickinson: “Thanks to Mr Dickinson’s assistance in England last July, I
                        surprisingly met this old hero” (155). Similar to Russell’s and Dickinson’s
                        enthusiasm for Shelley, Hardy’s interest in Shelley was recognised in Hsu’s
                        article: “On the wall were hung Hardy’s portrait .&#160;.&#160;. and
                        Shelley’s portrait on the other side. I seem to remember a thick edition of
                        Shelley laid on the bookshelf.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I was wondering why on
                        earth the old fellow loved Shelley so much. These two are not kindred
                        spirits at all” (157). Hsu admired both Hardy and Shelley, but he found
                        these two English writers expressing their thoughts very differently up
                        until his later reflection on their philosophies. In his “Appendix 2:
                        Hardy’s Pessimism,” Hsu employs the concept of “fixed mindset” to reassess
                        the general public’s claim of “Hardy as a pessimist”: “Hardy never wrote
                        Jude [<title level="m">Jude the Obscure</title>] to prove his pessimism,
                        simply as Shelley [n]ever consciously advocated ‘Romanticism’ or
                        ‘naturalism.’ We may well listen to his own defence” (166). While his lines
                        still suggest that Hardy and Shelley are “not kindred spirits at all,” Hsu
                        worships Shelley and Hardy equally. For Hsu, Shelley and Hardy are heroes
                        without a “fixed mindset,” which Hsu regards as “a foe of the arts, as well
                        as an obstacle to thought” (166). In “Appendix 2: Sketches on Hardy’s
                        Works,” Hsu particularly demonstrates Hardy’s literary revolts against the
                        Victorian culture (163). Hardy wrote a poem entitled “Shelley’s Skylark” to
                        honour Shelley as an influential poet whose idealism inspired him: “For it
                        [the skylark] inspired a bard to win / Ecstatic heights in thought and
                        rhyme” (23–24). Among Hardy critics, Roland A. Dueksen earlier acknowledged
                        same viewpoints in the “social and religious beliefs” of Hardy and Shelley
                        (161). Harold Bloom also finds strong similarities between the two poets:
                        “Hardy’s Shelley is very close to the most central of Shelleys, the
                        visionary skeptic.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. for they both told truths” (22). In
                        his elegy for Hardy, entitled “Hardy,” Hsu writes that Hardy’s critical
                        words towards idealism are like “hot spice to the mouth” (12) but “[h]e
                        loves genuineness [and] mercy” (26).</p>
                    <p>Aside from the British writers’ influences on the young poet, Hsu’s European
                        journeys nourished him in developing a Romantic mind. Hsu travelled from the
                        Continent back to China, from the grave to the bay, and mentally from
                        science to the arts. His love for the world was not formed from a single
                        thread. In his “Chekhov’s Graveyard,” Hsu writes about experiencing a
                        tremendous circle of great men and women and recognizing the lively mind in
                        meditation, “not being enslaved by sentiments” (184). In addition to
                        visiting the graves of Chekhov, Katherine Mansfield,<note place="foot">
                            Mansfield was a famous writer of short stories when Hsu met her in
                            London. Their chat only lasted twenty minutes, but her beauty and
                            elegance impressed the young poet despite her ill condition. He even
                            wrote an elegy in memory of the lovely writer.</note> Voltaire,
                        Rousseau, and other Western intellectuals, Hsu mentions his pleasant
                        two-time visits to Shelley’s and Keats’s graves in Rome (181–82). Hsu paid
                        homage to Shelley and Keats, and Hsu’s admiration is equally evident in his
                        translations of their works, which include Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale”
                        and Shelley’s “The Skylark.” Their pure idealism had already been discussed
                        in Hsu’s 1924 prose essay “John Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale,’” part of
                        which is Hsu’s own translation of Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale.” In this
                        essay, Hsu particularly mentions his accidental connection to Western
                        literature: “As for me, literature was originally not my expertise, and my
                        limited knowledge of literature was ‘mastered by none’” (286). A number of
                        poets and novelists, as well as their works, are also mentioned in this
                        essay. In addition to Keats, they include Wordsworth, Shakespeare, Shelley,
                        Goethe, Stevenson, Plato, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Baudelaire, and Rousseau.
                        Among these great men of letters, major Romantics are all admired by the
                        young poet.</p>
                    <p>Among Romantic ideas, Shelley’s concept of love particularly impressed Hsu.
                        Echoing Shelley’s philosophy, Hsu put emphasis upon the necessity of true
                        love and fought against patriarchal authorities. His personal marriage and
                        philosophy of love received harsh criticism from the public. As in Shelley’s
                        case, Hsu’s unorthodox marriages led him to ponder over the autonomy of the
                        mind towards love. The drama in Hsu’s life resulted from his pursuit of not
                        only political, but philosophical liberty. Hsu reluctantly married his first
                        wife, Chang Yiu-Yu,<note place="foot">Not content with the arranged marriage
                            with Chang, daughter of a wealthy Shanghai-based merchant, in October
                            1915, Hsu soon left for Shanghai and later Tien-Jin for further studies
                            at the university.</note> and later wedded Lu Shiao-Man, an elegant
                        society woman who Hsu met at a club in Beijing after a sorrowful
                        relationship with his alleged beloved Lin Hui-Yin. Hsu’s dynamic partnership
                        may remind the reader of Shelley’s with Harriet Westbrook and later Mary
                        Wollstonecraft Godwin and even Jane Williams. Hsu was not merely a Romantic
                        believer but a practitioner, as notorious a husband as Shelley was.</p>

                    <p>Critical discussions of Taiwan’s Romantic movements may come from distinct

                        later Taiwan’s “campus ballads”—a genre of Taiwanese popular songs—may not
                        have been necessarily connected to Taiwan’s democracy, which emerged in the
                        complicated milieu of Taiwan’s contemporary history.<note place="foot">

                        since the thoughts of Hsu and other social movement leaders arrived in
                        Taiwan. Hsu’s poetics exerted a seminal influence on the development of
                        Romanticism in Taiwan. His poetry relating to liberty had already been
                        recognized in early China (i.e. modern China prior to communist dominance)
                        and introduced to Taiwan as a genre of “modern poetry” by the government of
                        the Republic of China (1912–), ruled by the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang
                            (KMT).<note place="foot">Before the R.O.C. government took over it as a
                            province in 1945, Taiwan had been a Japanese colony yielded by the Ching
                            Dynasty. After their defeat in the Civil Wars with the Chinese
                            communists in 1949, the R.O.C. authorities lost all power in Mainland
                            China and ended up governing Taiwan’s main island and a few neighbouring
                            isles. With the abrupt rise of communist China in the world, alongside
                            the emergence of Taiwanese people’s national identity and Taiwan’s
                            democratization, the name of Taiwan has increasingly replaced the
                            nation’s official name—the Republic of China. Taiwan’s official name has
                            gradually become undermined and the country has been known to the world
                            as Taiwan since 1971. Chiang Kai-Shek, the then President of Taiwan,
                            rejected two Chinese states (the other being the People’s Republic of
                            China) together becoming members of the United Nations. After that,
                            communist China has taken over the legitimate claim as
                        “China.”</note></p>
                    <p>Hsu, whose literary and social activities remained on the Mainland, exerted
                        posthumous power over the consciousness of Taiwanese people, thus becoming
                        an important figure for bridging the histories of early China and Taiwan.
                        The social movement influenced by Hsu and his contemporaries, called the May
                        Fourth Movement, dates back to 1919, when the First World War had just ended
                        and Chinese student-led protesters went on strike against imperial occupants
                        as well as the Chinese ruling authority for its incompetence. To commemorate
                        this incident, Chinese intellectuals widely employed the term “May Fourth”
                        to advocate social, literary, and political reforms. In effect, the concept
                        of this movement, according to Yu Ying-Shih, can be exchangeable in term
                        with the “New Culture Movement” (1915–19),<note place="foot">For the
                            emergence of the New Culture Movement, see H. Chang 33–34.</note> which
                        was used by Chinese elites in 1917 to refer to a movement of “literary
                        revolution” during the May Fourth Movement (17). At that time the Western
                        conceptions of science and democracy were introduced to China, personified
                        as Mr. Sai (science) and Mr. De (democracy), to dispel superstition and
                        feudal thought. While inheriting the legacy of the Enlightenment’s
                        rationalism, “the thought of the May Fourth [Movement] alludes explicitly to
                        Romanticism” (H. Chang 35). The intellectuals have noted the complicated
                        nature of the May Fourth, relating it to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment
                        and Romanticism, which in a sense upheld the legacy of the former two while
                        reassessing them.<note place="foot">In literary studies, the fixed
                            boundaries between the Enlightenment and Romanticism have been recently
                            challenged. See Wallace.</note> Together with his other academic
                        fellows, Hsu endeavoured to reassess the fixedness of Chinese culture and
                        social codes. Enlightened by Western thought, Hsu particularly advocated
                        vernacular literature, as well as women’s education and social status.</p>
                    <p>The influence of Hsu-led Romantic movements on Taiwan’s new wave of democracy
                        did not launch until the KMT authority came into power in Taiwan. Despite
                        Hsu’s early death (at the age of 34), his literary works and philosophy of
                        liberty were distributed by his academic fellows who withdrew to Taiwan with
                        the nationalist troops. Hu Shih (1891–1962) was one of the major fellows in
                        this list, acting as one of the leaders during the New Culture Movement. He
                        integrated his study of Western philosophy into his PhD thesis, under John
                        Dewey’s supervision, and then worked as chancellor of Peking University. In
                        fact, it was Hu who invited Hsu to teach poetry part-time at Peking. As a
                        librarian at Peking University, Mao Tze-Dong—later famous as Chair Mao in
                        communist China—was attracted to Hsu and sat on his lecture at the
                        university. The intellectual connections of Chinese celebrities in the
                        nation’s modern history became an emerging power in cultivating the newborn
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The idealism for social reforms, in the Romantic vein, in fact, transcended
                        ideological boundaries as it was inherited not only by democratic Taiwan but
                        also by communist China. Under the Romantic ethos of liberty and equality,
                        the Chinese communists led passionate youngsters and the economically lower
                        class (mainly farmers) in a bid to establish another republican country—the
                        People’s Republic of China. Very different from Hsu’s non-violent
                        assertions, as seen throughout his work, Communist actions derived from
                        political radicalism and were subject to violence. Romantic thinkers had
                        originally aimed to overturn a malfunctioning society or system, but history
                        has revealed that social upheaval is a necessity after a violent action or
                        revolution. This double-edged sword of Romanticism had been seen earlier in
                        the French Revolution and later in the Mao-led Chinese Cultural Revolution,
                        which caused a great loss of Chinese heritages during its ten years
                        (1966–76). Unlike the non-violent literary movement and pacifism that
                        Shelley, Russell and Hsu supported, the destructive radicalism during the
                        Chinese Culture Revolution repeated the history of France’s socio-political
                        turmoil after the French Revolution and under the Napoleonic regime.<note

                    <p>Hsu’s Romantic spirits, on the other hand, were transmitted from China to
                        Taiwan by his good friend Hu Shih. As a leader of the early Chinese
                        Romanticism, Hu left for Taiwan, together with the KMT troops, and was
                        appointed by the government to “revive” Chinese culture in Taiwan.<note
                            place="foot">In Taiwan, Hu Shih was appointed as head of Academia
                            Sinica, the Republic of China, and established an institute for academic
                            research, which was later named National Science Council and has been
                            recently renamed the Ministry of Science and Technology.</note> Prior to
                        the rule of the Chiang-led government, Taiwan had been detached from
                        Hsu-related Romantic ideas. Revolutionary ideas were however circulated by
                        local political dissidents, among whom was Chiang Wei-Shui (1891–1931).
                        Chiang, who was a physician and poet, is seen as a forerunner of Taiwan’s
                        social movements for democracy and liberty during the Japanese occupation.
                        In regard to the dissemination of English Romanticism in Taiwan, Hsu’s
                        poetical works, along with the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, were
                        spread through the textbooks used in Taiwan’s education system. According to
                        Yeh Shu-Mei, Hsu’s literary works started to be published and disseminated
                        in Taiwan in the mid-1950s but a nearly complete collection of his
                            works<note place="foot">According to Yeh’s investigation, Han
                            Shih-Shan’s edition of Hsu’s complete works is the most complete and up

                        edited his complete works with the assistance of his first wife Chang Yiu-Yu
                        (332).</p>
                    <p>Hsu’s literary works served as a bridge that connected English Romantic ideas
                        to Taiwan’s “campus ballads” and potentially to its democratic movement. The
                        period of ballads roughly fell between the 1970s and the 1990s. In 1977, the
                        Golden Tune Award (Jin Yun Jiang), as a non-profit singing contest,<note
                            place="foot">The first contest was supported by the Sony company, its
                            charity foundation, and the Taiwanese government. Later in 1990 and
                            onwards, another music award named Jin Qu Jiang (Golden Melody Awards)
                            continued to heighten the significance of Taiwan’s music.</note> was
                        first bestowed on talented singers and composers. The Award encouraged a
                        number of amateur composers and singers to present their talent in popular
                        music. Arranged in a separate group for the Award, students were
                        particularly encouraged to attend. The success and popularity of the Award
                        helped the original songs to be widely and frequently circulated on TV,
                        radio and even college campuses. The annual contest came to an end in 1984,
                        but the Award had sparked interest particularly among students to
                        demonstrate their liberal thoughts via songs. Without any contamination by
                        commercial interests, the composers and performers of campus ballads created
                        their own songs to express their feelings and thoughts. Most of them were
                        young intellectuals in higher education who knew well of Hsu’s reputation
                        and works, probably as a result of their involvement in the May Fourth
                        Movement.</p>
                    <p>With regard to this phenomenon, concerns over Taiwan’s cultural subjectivity
                        have emerged over the past decade or so. Some critics have reassessed the
                        positive influence of campus ballads and asserted that the period of ballads
                        in Taiwan’s early history was simply constructed by Chiang Kai-Shek’s KMT
                        government, namely based on a political ideology without regard to Taiwan’s
                        cultural identity.<note place="foot">With the rise of the concept of
                            cultural or national identity, some critics examine how “Chinese”
                            ideology was introduced to Taiwan by means of Chinese literature.
                            Regarding Hsu’s literary works recognised in Taiwan, see Yeh.</note> For
                        a more nuanced understanding of Taiwan’s cultural identity, threats from the
                        Chinese communism should be taken into consideration. Without Chiang’s
                        so-called “dictatorship,” Taiwan might have been invaded by the communists.
                        Due to an essence of hatred, any bigotry of culture and literature could
                        also lead to a certain extremism. As for a positive influence of campus
                        ballads, these songs strengthened Taiwan’s nationalism and patriotism
                        particularly among young intellectuals. According to Tseng Huei-Jia, the
                        youngsters’ patriotism was overwhelmingly ignited by the anti-Japanese
                        movement of Diaoyu islands (i.e., Senkaku in Japanese),<note place="foot"
                            >The disputes over the islands remain unsolved today. For a detailed
                            up-to-date discussion, see Yeh.</note> and later the KMT government’s
                        policies for social and moral purifications facilitated the nationwide
                        popularity of the campus ballads (136–40). Nevertheless, how and who to
                        define the subjectivity of Taiwan’s culture remains debatable from distinct
                        vantage points.</p>
                    <p>The period of campus ballads is a significant time in the history of
                        Taiwanese culture, offering one way for us to assess Taiwan’s cultural
                        subjectivity. Those songs are categorized according to the following topics:
                        history, melancholy, Chinese poetry, cultural experience, local daily lives,
                        wandering, departure, oblivion, childhood, purity, nature, recollection,
                        affections, encouragement, and pacifism. Among the wide-ranging types of
                        songs created and performed during this period, “Hap” (1976), “Second
                        Farewell to Cambridge” (1977),<note place="foot">The title “Second Farewell
                            to Cambridge” is from the translation by Denis Twitchett and John K.
                            Fairbank. See Twitchett and Fairbank 458.</note> and “Struggles for
                        Springtime Between Plum Blossoms and Snow Flakes” (1980) are, in the rank of
                        popularity, the best known songs that derived from Hsu’s representative
                        poems of the same name.<note place="foot">“Hap” was composed and performed
                            by the Hong-Kong singer Chelsia Chan (also known as Chan Chau-Ha or Chen
                            Chiu-Hsia) for a romantic movie entitled <title level="m">Chelsia My
                                Love </title>(<title level="m">Chiu-Hsia</title>, 1976). The other
                            two songs were performed by the student singers Fan Guang-Huei and Bao
                            Mei-Sheng, who separately won the second and third prizes at the first
                            Golden Tune Award in 1977. Still a few other poems written by Hsu were
                            composed into songs, including Luo Da-Yo’s “The Song” (“Ge”) and Wang
                            Hai-Ling’s “Joy of Snowflakes?” (“Xue Hua De Kuaile?”). The question
                            mark in the latter song was originally used to interrogate the
                            possibility of reaching “joy.”</note> Those lyrical ballads convey the
                        poet’s sentimental love for distant memories. Different from his direct call
                        for reforms of social codes, these poetical works highlight the liberation
                        of the mind. When the political tension between Taiwan and China decreased
                        with the re-opening of strait tourism and communication, Taiwan’s earlier
                        popular songs, campus ballads included, were widely introduced to Mainland
                        China. Taiwan’s campus ballads, alongside the singers, became respected by
                        the fans in the Mainland. Also, Chinese people gained a better understanding
                        of Hsu and Cambridge through their readings of selected works by the poet in
                        their textbooks. Compared with the emphasis on Hsu’s works in Taiwan,
                        research on Hsu’s works did not take off in communist China until the late
                        1980s and it was even later that Hsu’s works were selected for school
                            textbooks.<note place="foot">For the dissemination of Hsu’s thoughts in

                        popular with young adults during the ballad period.<note place="foot">In the
                            earlier years the Taiwanese government selected Hsu’s prose “All the
                            Cambridge I Know” for the textbook of junior high schools, but because
                            of the popularity of the song and poem “Second Farewell to Cambridge,”
                            this poem is currently included in the textbook of senior high
                            schools.</note> Hsu’s prose work entitled “All the Cambridge I Know,”
                        written on 15 January 1926, had already been selected for the textbook
                        partly because of the Taiwanese government’s political strategy to
                        disseminate modern Chinese literature. Heightened by the prose and the
                            song,<note place="foot">For the original recording, along with
                            Cambridge-related pictures, see Fan.</note> Cambridge and River Cam left
                        a great impression on the readers. Interestingly, the town of Cambridge and
                        the University up to this day are much more renowned than even London or
                        Oxford to the Taiwanese folks. For them, Hsu, and his adapted song
                        particularly, made Cambridge a place of romantic fame. Hsu’s words
                        describing Cambridge lead his readers to a romantic dreamland where it is
                        picturesque and the lifestyle is carefree. For Hsu himself, Cambridge is
                        also a place that strengthened his connection with Romantic thoughts. A soap
                        opera entitled <title level="m">April Rhapsody</title>, released in Taiwan
                        in 2000, further brought its viewers closer to Hsu and Cambridge. This soap
                        opera tells the stories of Hsu’s romances and his life at Cambridge.
                        Cambridge thus became the equivalent of a romantic town in the popular
                        imagination of Taiwanese and Chinese tourists. The Cambridge authorities
                        concerned learned of the significance of this Chinese poet and therefore
                        delightedly set up a stone plaque in memory of the great poet in 2008,
                        partly to please Chinese visitors. On the stone were engraved Hsu’s famous
                        lines from “Second Farewell to Cambridge.” The stone currently stands at
                        King’s College, where Hsu’s friend Dickinson helped him to be allocated as a
                        special student.</p>
                    <p>In a sentimental tone exhibited in the poem, Hsu recalls all his memories
                        from his residence at Cambridge. River Cam is the main focus of the poem,
                        where the poet employs imagery of misty clouds, willows, river weeds,
                        punting, and summer insects to reflect on his melancholy, and the poem ends
                        in a sentimental tone: “Silently I was gone, / Just as I silently came. / I
                        dusted off my sleeves, / Taking no piece of clouds” (26–29). His
                        sentimentality towards nature, including clouds, plants, and insects,
                        pervades the entire poem, and those images of nature put to music led the
                        young students in the age of campus ballads to romanticize Britain. In “All
                        the Cambridge I Know,” Hsu further illustrates his love of nature and the
                        liberty of the mind. For Hsu, Cambridge is his spiritual homeland: “After
                        the departure of more than three years, Cambridge, who understands my
                        melancholy and homesickness?” (“All the Cambridge I Know” 48). Hsu’s
                        overseas experiences and thoughts particularly fascinated the young students
                        in the 1970s.<note place="foot">The campus ballads are still loved
                            particularly by the listeners of that age, which is evidenced by the
                            concerts that have been held in Taiwan in recent years.</note> More
                        significantly, the spirit of the May Fourth movement was implicitly revived
                        and further disseminated through the enchanting songs igniting the social
                        consciousness of youngsters. With the enlightenment brought by such liberal
                        ethos, more social movements were launched in the 1980s. Exploring Taiwan’s
                        popular songs and social movements, Tseng argues that, “the 1980s, for
                        Taiwan, is an era with the face of being unbound after the society had been
                        long shackled particularly since the outbreak of 1979’s ‘Formosa Incident’”
                        (178). This incident, also known as the Kaohsiung Incident, is a watershed
                        moment in the history of Taiwan’s democratization.<note place="foot">The
                            Formosa Incident broke out in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 10 December 1979.
                            The KMT government originally attempted to close down two major
                            magazines that advocated anti-government ideas and later two local chief
                            politicians, including Yu Deng-Fa, were accused of their inclination to
                            communism. On the International Human Rights Day, dated 10 December,
                            members of the major anti-government magazine entitled <title level="m"
                                >Formosa Magazine</title> therefore launched a series of outspoken
                            speeches on democracy and liberty, which unfortunately led to mayhem and
                            later a massive protest around the island. Most of the “chief” members
                            were eventually jailed and, after the withdrawal of the martial law in
                            1986, they formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), continuing to
                            challenge the authority. The incident is claimed as a crucial event for
                            Taiwan’s democratization, but the contributions of those political
                            dissidents and the DPP to Taiwan remain controversial, owing to their
                            protests full of violence and bloodshed, as well as their failure to
                            transform Taiwan during their being in office (2000–08).</note></p>
                    <p>The two other famous campus ballads that derive from Hsu’s poems, “Hap” and
                        “Struggles for Springtime Between Plum Blossoms and Snow Flakes,” instigate
                        distinct sentiments. The former depicts a mysterious encounter with a
                        stranger at sea, and the latter a winter landscape that conceals the poet’s
                        remorse for a massacre. During the period of campus ballads, undergraduate
                        students composed soft melodies to illuminate Hsu’s poetics of liberty in
                        nature, love and truth. The word “Hap,” my translation of the original title
                        which in Chinese means “coincidence” or “chance,” can be linked to Hardy’s
                        “Hap.” Due to his admiration for Hardy as well as his works, Hsu expresses a
                        sentimental vein in the poem. Hsu had earlier acknowledged that his
                        “snobbishness of hero worship” (155) in wanting to meet Hardy and other
                        celebrities was the main reason for his “sentimental journey” in Europe:
                        “Last year I came to Europe on a completely ‘sentimental journey;’ . . . I
                        was keen to meet [other heroes and] Britain’s Hardy, but I only met Hardy”
                        (“An Afternoon of Visiting Hardy” 156). After the short meeting, Hsu
                        analysed Hardy’s pessimism and later even wrote an epitaph for the poet,
                        entitled “Hardy.” It begins, “Hardy, pessimistic, inactive, / This time no
                        more complaints, / A shadow is folding his eyes? / Gone, he will no longer
                        show his face” (1–4). Echoing Hardy’s “pessimism,” Hsu expresses a similar
                        sentiment at the opening of the poem “Hap”:<quote><lg>
                                <l>I am a piece of cloud in the sky,</l>
                                <l>Occasionally, reflected on your ripples.</l>
                                <l>You need not feel stunned</l>
                                <l>And even cheerful.</l>
                                <l>It will be all gone in a moment. (1–5)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The cloud imagery is reminiscent of not only Wordsworth’s
                        “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” and Shelley’s “The Cloud” but also works of
                        Chinese literature where the cloud refers to a carefree mind without any
                        earthly pursuit. Nevertheless, Hsu’s “Hap” suggests uncertainty. In the
                        poem, the narrator is the “cloud” (1) and occasionally experiences a loving
                        relationship with a stranger—a persona of the water, which is revealed in
                        the “ripples” (2). The imagery of ripples suggests the excitement of the
                        stranger who is attracted to the narrator. The narrator, however, reminds
                        the stranger not to “feel stunned [a]nd even cheerful” (3–4). The difference
                        between the sky and the earth suggests the unblessed relationship between
                        the cloud and the water. This dynamic mind, like floating clouds, is also
                        described at the very beginning of Hsu’s prose essay “Self Anatomy”: “I am a
                        dynamic person. The moment my body moves, my thought seems to jump with it”
                        (80).</p>
                    <p>Hsu’s writing tends to reveal his Romantic mind—that is, the mind ought to
                        remain liberal and independent. In “Hap,” the narrator keeps the mind
                        completely independent of any influence in a tempting relationship. Similar
                        to Shelley’s Romantic thought toward free love, Hsu’s love affairs with
                        women reflect his dynamic philosophy. As told in the last part of the poem,
                        only the very moment matters:<quote><lg>
                                <l>You and I met at sea on a dark night.</l>
                                <l>You had your own; I had my own—direction. </l>
                                <l>Fine if you remember; you had better forget</l>
                                <l>The very moment of mutual ignition. (“Hap” 6–9)</l>
                            </lg></quote> In the sentimental tune of this ballad, the singer Chelsia
                        Chan’s touching voice<note place="foot">For the song recording of her “Hap,”

                        successfully instigates the listener’s desire to be true to oneself. The
                        “ignition” (9) is symbolic of the speaker’s affection for the stranger, but
                        the speaker reminds the stranger not to make the occasional encounter
                        disturb the mind, regardless of positive or negative feelings. The
                        autonomous mind echoes Hsu’s poetics of liberty. In other words, this
                        non-political poem conveys Hsu’s philosophy in a bid to seek an independent
                        self. The essence of the autonomous mind, Hsu suggests, applies to his views
                        against political conformity. While he seems to express pessimism and
                        uncertainty throughout the poem, Hsu follows Hardy’s philosophy to
                        demonstrate every aspect of life and, like Hardy, rejects classification as
                        a pessimist.<note place="foot">See my earlier discussion of Hsu’s
                            interrogation about Hardy’s pessimism.</note> This autonomy of the mind
                        is resonant with the lamp metaphor for Romanticism in M. H. Abrams’s <title
                            level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title>. The speaker in the poem is
                        the lamp reminding the stranger not to be a mere reflection or follower,
                        represented by the imagery of the water or mirror, and instead to cultivate
                        an independent mind or identity to illuminate the world. During the age of
                        the campus ballads, the young listeners of this song “Hap” had been
                        encouraged to think and love independently. The song, along with Hsu’s
                        “notorious” romance, to some extent had led the youth to Romantic
                        individualism and liberalism. The women listeners, in particular, sensed
                        what Hsu significantly conveyed his philosophy of free love and how a woman
                        should educate herself to be independent, financially and emotionally.</p>
                    <p>Echoing this sentimental vein, Hsu’s poem “Struggles for Springtime Between
                        Plum Blossoms and Snow Flakes” contrasts the redness of plum blossoms and
                        the whiteness of snowflakes to etch a poignant moment in the modern history
                        of Taiwan. In the poem Hsu expresses remorse for the dead, particularly an
                        innocent boy of thirteen, sacrificed in a social movement that took place on
                        18 March 1926. The date was to remember the “318 Massacre.” That Hsu’s poem
                        relates to this incident is evidenced in the subtitle of the poem, “In
                        Memory of 318.”<note place="foot">The subtitle is particularly highlighted
                            in Wang Mei-Chih’s MA thesis, but it is rarely included in most editions
                            of Hsu’s works. See M. Wang.</note> Social activists, including students
                        and workers, gathered at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, and demanded that the
                        interim Chinese government abolish all unfair treaties mutually signed by
                        the Ching Dynasty and foreign alliances. For Hsu, the red blossoms buried in
                        the white snow represent the deadly scene in which the protestors died in
                        the coldest winter, during the Chinese New Year. This struggle, revealed in
                        the title, illustrates the hot-blooded protest and cold-blooded oppression.
                        At the opening of the poem, the poet only refers to the narrator’s journey
                        to visit the blossom season on a snowy day without any clue of the incident:
                        “One day in the South over Chinese New Year, it snowed very hard. / I
                        travelled to Mt. Ling to find tidings of spring plum blossoms” (1–2).
                        Adapted from the poem, the campus ballad accurately conveys the imagery in
                        Hsu’s lyrical lines by means of the singer’s crystal voice and the
                        melancholy melody. The singer Bao Mei-Sheng’s voice<note place="foot">For
                            the original recording, see Bao.</note> reminds the listener of the
                        melancholy of the skylark, imagery Shelley employed to disseminate liberty
                        across the land. During her undergraduate studies in history at National
                        Taiwan University, Bao knew well about the massacre and appeared to act as
                        Shelley’s skylark in singing the song of liberty. This song ultimately
                        reflects on the poet’s sympathies with uncertainty in life and the
                        limitation of liberty. The poet’s attempt in the poem does not become
                        tangible until the “boy of thirteen” is revealed at the very end of the
                        poem: “But the plum blossoms are the hot blood of a boy of thirteen”
                        (8).</p>
                    <p>Hsu Chih-Mo is symbolic of Shelley’s skylark singing Romantic songs
                        throughout early China and Taiwan. In modern times, Hsu was a leading
                        Romantic who had introduced the Western concept of liberty to early China
                        through his poetics. Romantic ideas, politically and literally, enchanted
                        Hsu, and this ethos was widely disseminated throughout China particularly
                        during the May Fourth Movement. Hsu and Shelley sought fundamental change in
                        both society and literature. For them such a change begins and ends in the
                        mind. In the history of Taiwan’s Romanticism, Hsu’s literary works were
                        valued as gentle strength against any authorities that oppressed the human
                        mind. Despite his inclination to the left for socio-political reforms, Hsu’s
                        works were still recognized by early Taiwanese authorities, particularly
                        during the Chiang regime or the period of martial laws in Taiwan. The power
                        of words is soft, as Hsu puts it in his prose entitled “Words.” When Hsu’s
                        Romantic ideas were later passed on to Taiwan’s campus ballads. The pursuit
                        of truth, love, hope and beauty in the students’ hearts inevitably resulted
                        in the growth of liberalism. Even in the twenty-first century, this Romantic
                        spirit continues to carry weight against the political oppression that
                        plagues some countries or regions. The “Jasmine Revolution,” namely the
                        Tunisian Revolution, has taken effect globally, including South Asia and
                        other parts of North Africa. Recently such thought has spread to Taiwan and
                        Hong Kong in student-led social movements for political reforms. Many today
                        would still find strength in Hsu’s call for a fundamental reformation of the
                        mind in the spirit of idealistic “love, liberty and beauty” (A-Gan
                            227–28).<note place="foot">The source derives from Volume 27 in a series
