            <p class="noCount">This essay explores the possibilities of literary criticism in a colonial situation
               by tracing the career of Choe Jae-seo (1908-64), who was one of the first scholars
               of English literature to write literary criticism in colonial Korea. Choe began his
               literary studies with a particular focus on English Romanticism at Kyungsung Imperial
               University, and Romantic aesthetics became a major site of struggle for Choe in finding
               his voice as a colonized critic. Throughout this struggle, Romanticism carries the
               burden of Choe’s historical and political consciousness by becoming the point of tension
               between literature and politics, East and West, universal cosmopolitanism and totalitarian
               imperialism. At the end of this road, Choe arrives at the possibility of a Romantic
               cosmopolitan criticism, which continues to call for a critical vigilance against colonial
               oppression and political violence. </p>

               <p>Is literary criticism possible in a colonial situation? Can the colonized critic speak?
                  When Korea gained independence from colonial rule at the end of the Second World War,
                  many of its writers and critics underwent the tormenting process of self-reflection
                  and self-criticism, publishing through various venues “declarations of conscience.”
                  These overly lucid acts of self-avowal testify to a suppressed sense of guilt about
                  the silence that had prevailed under colonial oppression—a silence that implicated
                  even those intellectuals who did not outwardly support or collaborate with the Japanese
                  regime.

                           modern history.</span></div>
                  </div> The incriminating silence and inaction point to a peculiar predicament in which colonized
                  subjects found themselves when brought into the imperial system as the subjected other.
                  Christopher P. Hanscom attributes this predicament to the “paradox of empire,” which
                  “demand[s] that, as an imperial subject, one speak beyond the position of the colonized”
                  and enforces “the simultaneous denial of a universal position of enunciation to the
                  same colonized subject” (35). The question of breaking one’s silence against colonial
                  powers was a particularly knotty one for Korean intellectuals because the colonial
                  period saw a multi-layered, multi-cultural climate of imperial acculturation and hybridization,
                  which already compromised intellectuals’ sense of autonomous self-representation.
                  With the Meiji government beginning to intervene in Korean affairs in 1876 and finally
                  annexing the Peninsula in 1910, Korea was gradually forced to open its doors to the
                  political, economic, and cultural influences of the outside world—that world being
                  predominantly Japan but also the West, whose culture was mainly transmitted via Japan.
                  During this period, foreign literature began to flow in on a massive scale and had
                  a significant impact on the popular imagination and academic scholarship of Korea.
                  Western literature in particular signified world literature for the Koreans, and to
                  be well versed in Western classics was a vital part of being cultured. Imbibing Western
                  literature was in itself a paradoxical act, relying on foreign culture to overcome
                  the crisis of political and cultural disempowerment under colonial rule.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This essay will explore the possibilities of literary criticism under the colonial
               condition through the works of Choe Jae-seo, one of the first Korean scholars of English
               literature. Choe himself embodied the paradox of empire, struggling to create a critical
               space for himself by appropriating Western literary theory, which simultaneously formed
               and unsettled his sense of colonized subjectivity. English Romanticism was one of
               Choe’s main areas of interest, and this essay’s aim is to reflect upon the exigency
               of the Romantic mode of thought in the Asian colonial context through Choe’s literary
               criticism. In a critical sphere where a variety of imported literary modes from the
               West, such as modernism, socialist realism, and symbolism, were contending for cultural
               leverage, Romanticism carried the burden of Choe’s historical and political consciousness
               by becoming the point of tension between literature and politics, East and West, universal
               cosmopolitanism and totalitarian imperialism. If silence is inevitable in the paradoxical
               situation of the colonized critic, Choe opens the possibility of a Romantic aesthetics
               framing the silence and giving it a contour that enables a critical inquiry into colonial
               discourse.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Choe Jae-seo (1908–64) was born in Haeju, a city located in the Hwanghae Province,
                  which today is part of the North Korean territory. Japan’s official annexation of
                  Korea took place in 1910, just two years after his birth, and Choe’s education was
                  largely a product of the modern public education system introduced by the Japanese
                  government. He must have been an outstanding student in his youth since he was able
                  to attended Kyungsung Second Middle School in the capitol city of Kyungsung (or Keijo
                  in Japanese, the name given under colonial rule to what is now Seoul). In 1926, Choe
                  was admitted at the top of his class to Kyungsung Imperial University, one of the
                  two imperial universities founded by Japan in the colonies.

                           Imperial University (or Keijo Imperial University) was admitted in 1926. This was
                           the first imperial university to be established outside of Japan, soon followed by
                           Taipei Imperial University (or Taihoku Imperial University) founded in 1927. Kyungsung
                           Imperial was dissolved and merged with nine other institutions of higher education
                           to form Seoul National University as part of the reconstruction efforts of the United
                           States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK), which took over the southern half

                  </div> Choe majored in English literature at the College of Law and Letters with a special
                  focus on English Romantic poetry. The list of courses he took with the Keats scholar
                  Sato Kiyoshi include such titles as “Byron Studies” and “Poems of Keats,” and the
                  title of his senior thesis, which he wrote under Professor Sato, is “The Development
                  of Shelley’s Poetic Mind” (Kim Yun-sik 216). Choe advanced to graduate school in the
                  same university, and although there is no official record of his having received a
                  degree, he did complete the two-year master’s program after working on a research
                  project entitled “Romantic Types of the Poetic Mind.” Upon his completion of graduate
                  studies in 1933, Choe became the first Korean to be appointed lecturer of English
                  at Kyungsung Imperial University—an event phenomenal enough to be reported in the <em>Chosun Daily</em> (April 30, 1933). After a year at his <em>alma mater</em>, Choe continued to teach English at Kyungsung School of Law and debuted as a literary
                  critic in both Japanese and Korean literary circles by publishing prolifically in
                  Japanese academic journals, Korean newspapers, and a journal called <em>Inmun Pyeong’ron</em> [<em>Criticism in the Humanities</em>], of which he was both publisher and editor.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Romanticism was clearly what held Choe’s interest in school, and although his senior
               thesis on Shelley is evidently lost and unavailable for assessment, we can get a glimpse
               of his early thoughts on Romantic literature through the papers he published as a
               graduate student. In an essay called “The Limits of Poetry,” which Choe wrote in Japanese
               for the English department’s bulletin in 1931, he places Wordsworth and Shelley at
               two opposite limits of Romantic poetry—Wordsworth as a realist poet who grounds his
               ideas on the sensory experience of the outer world, and Shelley as an idealist who
               reaches for the far limits of the human imagination. While this may not be a particularly
               original take on the two poets, Choe’s criticism of where the two poets fail offers
               a reverse glimpse of what he saw as successful poetry. For Choe, Wordsworth lapses
               into unnecessary moral didacticism whenever his poetry loses touch with the natural
               world. Choe reads Wordsworth’s preface to <em>Peter Bell</em> as evidence of the poet’s anxiety about Coleridgean supernaturalism and the dangers
               of imagination’s flight beyond earthly themes. Shelley’s fault, on the other hand,
               is found in such early poems as <em>Queen Mab</em>, whose characters Choe sees as mere personifications of conceptual and revolutionary
               ideas. By contrast, Shelley’s later works such as <em>Epipsychidion</em> are better poems in Choe’s opinion because they “spiritualize” characters from real
               life and sublimate reality into ideals. In his view of Wordsworth and Shelley, Choe
               appears to be consistently wary of moral and political ideas being presented in poetry
               without the mediation of human experience, through which the ideas become an integral
               part of the literary work. Good literature, in other words, is the representation
               of ideas in their most concrete and lived form, and Choe found literature at its best
               and its worst in Romantic poetry.</p>
            <p>Choe’s interest in literature’s engagement with the external world finds another outlet
               in his essay, “Immature Literature,” written in 1931 for a literary journal issued
               by a coterie of Korean graduates from Kyungsung Imperial University. Here Choe notes
               the immaturity of some of Shelley’s long poems, most notably <em>The Revolt of Islam</em>, calling to evidence their formal faults. <em>The Revolt of Islam</em>, according to Choe, may have been one of Shelley’s most ambitious and politically
               radical poems, but the poet there lacks the compositional skills to draw in the readers’
               interest and stimulate their political awareness. Choe criticizes Shelley for inserting
               long political speeches, unnecessary descriptions of natural scenery, and expressions
               of sentiments that have no clear motive in the story—all of which contribute to thwarting
               the narrative’s power of escalation and depriving it of a sense of realness and authenticity.
               On the surface level, Choe’s criticism appears purely formal, especially since he
               attributes these faults to the difficulty of composing long poems and instead argues
               for the greatness of lyric poetry by Romantic authors. However, Choe mentions <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as one of Shelley’s greatest poetic accomplishments, and we come to suspect that
               it is not merely formal weakness that makes a poem “immature.” In fact, what really
               troubles Choe is the kind of poetry that fails to engage readers’ interests and affect
               their minds, as we see in the following statement where formal criticism strangely
               bleeds into affective criticism: “The greatest challenge of a long poem resides in
               attaining unity and tension through inspiration and strong affect” (99). For Choe,
               in the end, Romanticism is less about the expression of the solitary poet’s genius
               and creativity than about the intimate relationship between the poet, the world, and
               the audience brought together by a work of literature that gives form to human experience
               in such a way that it truly inspires and changes its readers.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the discursive sphere of colonial Korea, Choe’s political ambiguity and academicism
                  set him against the strongest anti-colonial literary movement of the period led by
                  KAPF (acronym for <em>Korea Artista Proleta Federacio</em>, which denotes “Korean Federation of Proletarian Art” in Esperanto).

                           especially during the 1920s. Writing in Esperanto became a popular practice when the
                           Japanese government suppressed the use of the Korean language and instilled Japanese-only
                           policies throughout schools and official institutions.</span></div>
                  </div> This group of Marxist writers and critics organized in 1925 with the goal of liberating
                  the Korean people from colonial subjugation through class struggle. Their activities
                  mostly consisted of writing and distributing socialist literature for the purpose
                  of educating and promoting the literacy of the working classes. KAPF’s mission statement
                  called for action against feudalism, capitalism, and colonial autocracy, for which
                  art was explicitly utilized as a political tool. It was against KAPF’s ideological
                  rigidity and politicization of literature that the School of Foreign Literature (<span class="foreign">Haewoe Munhakpa</span>) began its movement in 1927 to depoliticize art and bring focus to literature’s aesthetic
                  qualities. Its members were mostly students of Western literature from various universities
                  in Tokyo,

                           Tennyson, Whitman, and Pushkin. Poet laureates (Robert Bridges, John Masefield) and
                           Nobel Prize winners (Anatole France, Maurice Maeterlinck) were also popular. Poe’s
                           short stories and Bernard Shaw’s and Chekhov’s plays added to the variety of the translations.</span></div>
                  </div> With the aim of refining the literary taste of the masses, contributing to the development
                  of Korean literature, and playing a part in world literature, the School of Foreign
                  Literature worked to provide accurate and high quality translations of original works
                  against secondhand translations of Japanese translations.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As it were, the literary scene of Korea’s colonial period was preoccupied by a dichotomous
               view of art and politics, and today’s assessment of Choe’s critical stance is curiously
               inflected by this very dichotomy. Korean literature scholar Kim Yun-sik, who argues
               that Choe is the mainstay of Romanticism in the early stages of literary modernization
               in Korea, regards him as an independent voice against the political agendas of proletarian
               and nationalist literary movements. Here Choe’s Romanticism becomes a purely academic
               interest inherited from his professors at Kyungsung Imperial University, and Choe
               is exempted from a judgment of his ambiguous politics. Yet, Choe’s career taken as
               a whole makes it problematic to label him simply a Romanticist. Choe’s early interest
               in Romantic poetry soon faded into the background as the focus of his critical works
               shifted to contemporary writers like Aldous Huxley, D. H. Lawrence, and E. M. Forster.
               On a more fundamental level, Choe began to absorb the philosophical and aesthetic
               theories of Modernism, which apparently collided with the organic worldview of Romanticism.
               When Choe, just out of school, debuted as a professional critic in the Japanese literary
               circle, he published a paper on T. E. Hulme, whose distinction of Romanticism and
               Classicism had a great impact on Modernists like T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis. In
               fact, it was this paper that gave Choe the enduring reputation of being an advocate
               of “intellectualism,” a term coined by the Japanese critic Abe Tomoji to characterize
               Hulme’s anti-Romantic aesthetic theory calling for “hard and dry,” anti-sentimental,
               and imagistic works of art (Kim Heung-gyu 279).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What are we to make of this drastic change in Choe’s critical position? Is he merely
                  an opportunist chasing after academic trends? Is he a detached student of different
                  critical standpoints, explicating and analyzing them without personal commitment or
                  conviction? Coming back to the question of art and politics, Choe’s foray into Modernism
                  may simply look like an extension of the kind of academic thought experiment Kim Yun-sik
                  saw in his Romantic criticisms. However, what I think needs to be more clearly understood
                  here is the complicated position of a colonized intellectual whose political stance
                  has less to do with will to power than with bearing witness to the conflicting powers
                  that usher in a complex of clashing ideas from distant places and times. Korea’s process
                  of full-fledged modernization began almost a century later compared to Europe, and
                  under the control of a colonial power. Ideas that took more than a century to develop
                  progressively in step with various political and cultural changes in the West flowed
                  into Korea almost simultaneously when its gates opened under the political pressures
                  of the outside world. There is a shift in the sense of temporality as the accumulated
                  time and history of the modern West become a synchronic presence in their newly transmitted
                  location. This does not mean that Western ideas lose their historical significance,
                  but that they gain a new sense of history as they are transplanted in different processes
                  of modernization. When it comes to Western influences on thought and art, Korean intellectuals
                  were far more than passive recipients of institutional education under the Japanese
                  colonial policy. Rather, they showed a certain agency and a sense of urgency as they
                  actively sought Western ideas for their liberating possibilities. Choe’s advisor Sato,
                  in his retirement speech made after twenty years of teaching at Kyungsung Imperial
                  University, recalls how shocked he was at finding students thirsting after knowledge
                  of foreign literature in their search of a road toward the Korean people’s liberation
                  and freedom (Kim Yun-sik 406). Choe was one of them, finding resonance in the Romantic
                  poets’ own engagement with a burgeoning modern culture and politics; Romanticism was
                  still a highly relevant mode of thought in the historical stage that Korea was in.

                  </div> However, the more skeptical and disillusioned worldview of the Modernists also resonated
                  with Choe as he understood the hopeless state of world affairs in the early twentieth
                  century, when Japan took part in the current of totalitarian militarism sweeping across
                  Europe and Asia. The inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in Choe’s wide-ranging
                  literary criticism are perhaps the most evident signs of a point in colonial history
                  when Romantic and Modernist worldviews collided by ironically being both valid.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Korea continued to go through a series of sea changes: its liberation from Japan in
               1945, divided occupation by Soviet and American troops, establishment of two separate
               Koreas in 1948, and the eruption of the Korean War in 1950. Only after the violent
               storm of historical rupture had passed and settled into an uneasy reconciliation was
               Choe able to write his critical masterpiece <em>Theory of Literature</em> in 1957. In the preface to this work, Choe writes a deeply personal account of what
               literature has meant for him through the turbulent years. There is a certain poignancy
               in his confession that, when he fled south from the advancing North Korean and Chinese
               forces on the Christmas morning of 1950, he took with him just two books—a Concise
               <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> and the collected works of Shakespeare—and that he was able to find value in life
               and hang onto a desire for life by reading Shakespearean tragedies. Life after Korea’s
               liberation has taught him “the sweet taste of freedom,” writes Choe, but it has also
               taught him “the value of order” (1). From this historical lesson Choe develops a theory
               that the function of literature is to give formal order to human life, experience,
               and feeling so that value and truth can be transmitted to the reader. Despite his
               reluctance to designate what this value or truth may be or where it may lie, Choe
               certainly reassesses what literature can and should do against a postcolonial situation
               in which both literary and national histories must undergo reconstruction out of the
               rubbles of calamity. Interestingly, English Romanticism serves as a somewhat ambiguous
               foundation for Choe’s literary theory and cultural critique, causing tension in its
               belatedness and yet not failing to give force to his sense of urgency in questioning
               the possibility of literature in the aftermath of modern catastrophe.</p>
            <p>One of the few places where Choe touches on contemporary Korean culture in <em>Theory of Literature</em> is the section where he quotes Wordsworth’s “Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>” to draw an analogy between the corrupted states of popular taste in nineteenth-century
               England and in twentieth-century Korea (58). Like Wordsworth, Choe has embarked on
               a cultural mission to save readers from the evils of vulgar and sensationalist popular
               literature. Where this undertaking takes him is another question for the postcolonial
               critic, however, since he cannot avoid comparing the vastly different literary terrains
               and traditions of the two nations maintaining different possibilities for a cultural
               renewal:<span class="quote">‘Even in England, where a literary tradition of nearly a thousand years stands under
                  the two great peaks that is Shakespeare and Milton, Wordsworth felt something close
                  to despair. Even without such a tradition, our society embraces foreign literature
                  uncritically and the murky waters of shamefully obscene literature flow gallantly
                  without reserve. I cannot be the only one who cannot resist hopeless thoughts about
                  the future of our nation’s modern literature. (59) ’</span> Much is at stake for the future of Korean literature, in Choe’s opinion, because
               there is no literary tradition to act as a buffer or remedial force against the inflow
               of tasteless literature from abroad. With their tradition no longer relevant or even
               surviving in the throes of violent change, Korean authors cannot afford to rely on
               their own heritage to build a new literary tradition as Wordsworth had done. On this
               note, it is significant that Choe looks to Chaucer, rather than Shakespeare and Milton,
               as the cornerstone of England’s literary tradition. After a pointed reflection on
               a society, presumably Korean, that can neither go forward from a state of cultural
               anarchy for lack of tradition nor break clean from the dogmatic tradition of a fossilized
               culture like that of pre-modern Confucian Korea, Choe turns to Chaucer for answers
               (96). Choe’s emphasis falls on the fact that Chaucer’s “English” literature was the
               product of actively sought literary influences from advanced foreign cultures. Chaucer
               had established the English verse form by creatively adopting the decasyllabic meter
               of French poetry; refined the literary English language by translating <em>Roman de la Rose</em> and cultivating a more sophisticated form of his native language; absorbed the styles
               of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio in his literary creations; and even summoned the
               inspiration of Eastern literature when modeling <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> after <em>The Arabian Nights</em> (97–99). What captures Choe’s imagination in the case of Chaucer is the vitality
               and suppleness of a tradition that comes alive through a creative engagement with
               its other—what was most critically needed in the cultural wasteland of post-war Korea.</p>
            <p>The same openness applies to Choe’s own critical theory, which is based on a broad
               knowledge of Western literary criticism. Working up from Plato and Aristotle to Kantian
               aesthetics and scrutinizing the core ideas of Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist literary
               criticisms, <em>Theory of Literature</em> functions also as an encyclopedic compilation of European aesthetic thought. In that
               context, Choe takes Romanticism with a historically nuanced grain of salt, and Romantic
               literary criticism gains a renewed force against not only late modern but also postcolonial
               history. Choe’s sense that we are now living in an age where it is impossible to write
               poetry departs from his understanding of the Romantic predicament that there is no
               work for poets in the age of industrialization (149) and expands to an awareness of
               the stifled individual genius and personality in the modern age (87). If the principle
               of individual imagination and feeling has returned to the center of Choe’s theory
               of literature, it now entails the burden of knowing its belatedness and anachronism.
               As a way of addressing this problem, Choe is saliently upfront about his scientific
               and positivist methodology, pronouncing in his preface that he will desist from an
               idealistic admiration of such concepts as personality, genius, imagination, intuition,
               inspiration, and creativity only to treat them as demonstrable phenomena or experiences
               (2). He thus resorts to the scientific method of modern psychology, most notably that
               of I. A. Richards’s physiological psychology and John Dewey’s biological psychology,
               to overcome the Kantian method of faculty psychology (158–59). Choe’s assertion that
               literature is the ordering of feeling is inspired by Richards’s idea in <em>Science and Poetry</em> that the experience of reading poetry brings about a psychological equilibrium by
               harmonizing multiple human impulses into emotional responses and attitudes, i.e.,
               “the impulses towards one kind of behaviour or another” (Choe 167; Richards 28). On
               the other hand, when Choe calls for a literature that organizes human experience,
               he is relying on Dewey’s concept of experience in <em>Art as Experience</em>: <span class="quote">‘Instead of signifying being shut up within one’s own private feelings and sensations,
                  it [experience] signifies active and alert commerce with the world; at its height
                  it signifies complete interpenetration of self and the world of objects and events.
                  Instead of signifying surrender to caprice and disorder, it affords our sole demonstration
                  of a stability that is not stagnation but is rhythmic and developing. Because experience
                  is the fulfillment of an organism in its struggles and achievements in a world of
                  things, it is art in germ. Even in its rudimentary forms, it contains the promise
                  of that delightful perception which is esthetic experience. (18–19) ’</span> For Dewey, experience in its organic connection with the world is essentially aesthetic,
               and art in turn is merely an intensified form of experience. Resisting theories that
               separate art from ordinary experience or that put art on a pedestal, Dewey revises
               the Kantian system of compartmentalizing and hierarchizing human faculties for the
               sake of aesthetic autonomy. Choe inherits Dewey’s unifying vision in his interpretation
               of Coleridge’s organic theory, expanding upon the conventional analogy between genius
               and plant to assert the necessity of absorbing and digesting diverse nutrients for
               both genii and plants to produce “beautiful and nutritious fruits” (89).</p>
            <p>Choe’s reinstatement of Romantic organicism to add pressure to the individual’s active
               engagement with the world is in the interest of a critic who is reconsidering the
               function of literature in a world disillusioned with the power of individual genius.
               However, Choe cannot sever himself wholly from the Romantic notion of aesthetic autonomy
               because he is extremely wary of a distorted way of imbuing literature with social
               or political significance—namely, the totalitarian regime’s use of literature for
               propaganda. As Choe notes in <em>Theory of Literature</em>,<span class="quote">‘It was not only in the past that literature’s utility was stressed. Even today, literature
                  under a dictatorship assumes a propagandistic function, and only then is literature
                  allowed a reason for being. However, that literature can never be valid as propaganda
                  rests on the simple reason, once stated by De Quincey, that affect dies [when literature
                  becomes propaganda]. This is in fact beauty’s vengeance against power. (31)’</span> Faced with an Adornian impasse in the aftermath of totalitarian devastation, Choe
               still believes poetry can be written and literature possible. Along with Coleridge’s
               organic theory, Wordsworth’s “worthy purpose” in poetry (59), Shelley’s moral sympathy
               (61), Keats’s negative capability (78) all serve as ways through which Choe can reflect
               upon literature’s disinterested interest in exerting its affective and moral power
               over the given reality. In fact, Choe himself can no longer be a disinterested critic
               when it comes to literature under the shadows of authoritarian power, pondering upon
               art’s vengeful strength over political violence. Reading into the political implications
               of Choe’s literary theory is an important yet tricky task, mainly because he himself
               was writing <em>Theory of Literature</em> after a blatant alignment with Japanese militarist propaganda during the period of
               escalated warfare and cultural indoctrination throughout the Pacific War. To discuss
               the politics of Choe’s aesthetics without politicizing him would be the key challenge
               here—a challenge that is heightened by Choe’s post-war return to Romanticism, a cultural
               phenomenon prone to ideological labeling, reactionary or revolutionary, precisely
               because of its inherently oblique and tension-ridden relationship with politics.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The last five years of colonial occupation, during which Japan concentrated all of
                  its military and spiritual efforts on imperialist expansion in Southeast Asia and
                  China, constituted a state of exception for Korean authors and critics in many ways.
                  Since the mid 1930s, the Japanese government had quickly grown dogmatic and censorious
                  in its nationalist ideology, forcing the disintegration of the insurgent KAPF and
                  establishing Korean literary associations that promoted propagandistic war literature.
                  Under the unifying nationalist motto “Japan and Korea are one body” (<span class="foreign">naeseon ilche</span>), Japan aggressively obliterated the cultural identity of Korea by forcing the colonial
                  subjects to use the Japanese language exclusively, change their surnames to Japanese
                  names, and pledge allegiance to the Japanese emperor. In 1941, the two leading literary
                  magazines of Korea, <em>Munjang</em> [<em>Sentence</em>] and <em>Inmun Pyeong’ron</em> [<em>Criticism in the Humanities</em>], were closed by force and integrated into the solely government-authorized <em>Gukmin Munhak</em> [<em>National Literature</em>], which soon became a Japanese language only publication. Choe was the chief editor
                  of this new magazine, working under an editorial guideline that emphasized representing
                  the “national” spirit and voluntarily cooperating with Japan’s war efforts and cultural
                  programs. In <em>Chosun Literature during the Transitional Period</em>, a 1943 collection of essays Choe published in Japanese to promote the cause of <em>National Literature</em>, we come across what looks like a flagrantly collaborative attitude toward the authoritarian
                  cultural regimen. The watershed moment for such unreserved ideological conversion,
                  Choe confesses, was Japan’s conscription of Korean male adults to the war,

                  </div> which may have been the last straw that ruined all hope for a historical turn after
                  a long period of conscientious resistance and suffering. To reference this moment
                  Choe uses the term “crisis,” which he traces back to the original medical terminology
                  signifying the decisive moment between death and recovery (25–26).</p>

               <p>Choe, who has long been stigmatized as a pro-Japanese collaborator, is enlisted along

                  of enlisted names, screened and extracted from a group of 25,000 people suspected
                  of collaboration, points not only to the fact that the political settlement of the
                  nation’s colonial past is still a delicate issue in Korea but also to the fundamental
                  ambiguity that entails the political categorization of colonized intellectuals and
                  their activities.

                  </div> Critics vary in their assessments of Choe’s stance in colonial politics, but one thing
                  they do agree on is the aberrant state in which intellectuals like Choe found themselves
                  during times of extreme foreign dictatorship. Song Seung-cheol, who notes the political
                  ambivalence of Choe’s literary theory, still finds fault with Choe’s failure to make
                  atonement for his deviant betrayal of his people and collusion with the colonial powers.
                  On the other hand, Ryu Bo-seon, who acknowledges the structural inevitability of collusion
                  for colonized intellectuals caught in the void between traditional and modern histories,
                  still stigmatizes Choe’s submission as symptomatic of an age of unprecedented madness
                  and irrationality. The exceptionality of this age rests, however, on grounds more
                  radical than mere breach of patriotism or loss of sound judgment. Writers and critics
                  had in fact met an epoch where literature itself was no more possible. As Lee Hye-jin
                  astutely points out in her analysis of Choe’s wartime criticism, there is only silence
                  in the fundamental gap between war propaganda and literature proper, and between an
                  individual’s reaction to an ideological structure and the structure itself (172–94).
                  Lee’s main premise gains clout here: it is indeed impossible even to raise the reductive
                  question of whether a certain wartime author or critic is pro-Japanese or pro-Korean.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One of the signs showing that Choe’s wartime criticism was essentially about the ideological
                  politicizing of literature rather than literature itself can be found in Choe’s active
                  condemnation of Romanticism in his theorization of the “national literature.” In the
                  course of instituting a literary program based on the doctrinal idea of a nationalist
                  literature, he negates the contemporary pertinence of a literature devoted to the
                  liberal idea of artistic and critical autonomy—what Choe particularly denounces in
                  the name of Romanticism.

                           in Choe’s stance toward Romanticism is reflected in his choice of Babbitt, who sees
                           Rousseau and his Romanticism as a major corrupting influence on Western culture.</span></div>
                  </div> Understanding what Choe stood against helps us explain that curious passage constituting
                  the first stipulation of the editorial guideline to <em>National Literature</em>: “Not only must all ethnicist and socialist tendencies antithetical to the national
                  constitution be rejected; individualist and liberalist tendencies which obscure the
                  concept of a national constitution must also be absolutely denounced” (qtd. in Choe, <em>Chosun Literature</em> 69). The very spirit of individualism and liberalism, both political and aesthetical,
                  is detrimental to the constitution of a totalitarian regime. It is interesting to
                  note the different registers through which Choe defines the political significance
                  of individualism and liberalism in <em>Chosun Literature during the Transitional Period</em>. Most narrowly, they represent the spurious ideology of British and American imperialism
                  pitted against the new nationalist order established under the alliance of Germany,
                  Italy, and Japan (33). The fall of Paris in 1940 had been the critical turning point
                  for Choe’s historical vision, bearing the sign that such milestone events do not rely
                  on the ambition of just one or two dictators but on a much broader historical turn
                  (22). Choe has clearly read the direction that world history has taken, which allows
                  him to reconsider his colonial position in the global context. Individualist and liberal
                  ideas more largely become symbols of Western thought, whose abstract idealism and
                  alienating divisionism has caused the cultural disintegration and moral corruption
                  of the West. Here Choe sets up the West against the new Asian order that Japan has
                  put forward as the mainstay objective of its “civilizing mission.” Japan was moving
                  to organize its colonies into a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to unify Asia
                  politically and economically against Western powers.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Romanticism serves Choe well in politicizing and moralizing the modern Western culture.
               For Choe, Western literature of the twentieth century is riddled with problems: disintegration
               of personality, impotence of intelligence, prevalence of decadent moods and reactionary
               satire, loss of the critical spirit, to name a few (26). Modern literature shows the
               symptoms of a culture that is anemic and anomic, catering to the delusional egotism
               of so-called geniuses—a “disease” Choe sees originating in the Romantic age (38).
               Percy Shelley is the icon of such narcissism, irresponsibly gratifying his desire
               for freedom (44) and indulging in neurotic and melancholy moods (104). What I find
               truly interesting about Choe’s take on Romanticism as the main culprit of modern dissociation
               is his association of this literary trend with cosmopolitanism—a curious tactic Choe
               uses to politicize Romanticism against the national ideology of the colonial regime.
               Historically, the Romantics entered the literary scene as cultured cosmopolitans,
               whose idea of culture signified the free spirit of finding a home wherever the heart
               goes “just like a bird resting on a tree branch it fancies” (107). Like the Romantic
               spirit, cosmopolitanism is itself decadent and irresponsible since its abstract notions
               of universality and humanity disregard the fact that man is tied to blood and earth
               from the moment of his birth (83). According to Choe’s diagnosis, however, “because
               such abstracted humankind is not an abstract man but a being insisting on acting as
               a cosmopolitan harboring a certain ideology, he cannot but be hostile toward the people
               and the nation, which make up the total body of life, and ends up bringing about their
               disintegration” (83–84). Choe’s politicization of Romanticism through an emphasis
               on its catastrophic cosmopolitan spirit sets the stage for designating national literature
               as the harbinger of a new age and world. For Choe, the epoch of nation has arrived
               to overturn the epoch of culture, and the clash of literary perspectives has become
               nothing less than a clash of worldviews (81). </p>
            <p>By way of fighting ideology with ideology, Choe has reduced the concepts of culture,
               Romanticism, and cosmopolitanism to political tenets. However, the irreducibility
               of such concepts is revealed ironically in the strangely cosmopolitan turn of Choe’s
               own argument in marking a space for Korean literature in the context of colonial nationalism.
               Even in the process of accusing the false consciousness of abstract universalism,
               Choe cannot politicize away a true cosmopolitan call for universal liberty and tolerance,
               which extends to his perspectives on a certain autonomous role Korean literature should
               play in constructing national literature. To clarify the relationship between Japanese
               and Korean literatures in such context, Choe resorts to an analogy with the relationship
               between English and Scottish literatures: “although Scottish literature is one part
               of English literature, the former contributes largely to the latter by adhering to
               its Scottish character” (72). As in the Scottish case, Choe sees an irrepressible
               character unique to Korean literature, whose potential for autonomy and originality
               rests precisely on that character. This is far from a chauvinist stance, since Choe
               attributes the same unique character originating from tradition, customs, and sentiments
               to the literatures of Taiwan and Manchuria (74). The literatures of the colonies will
               not disturb the order of Japanese literature but rather enrich it, saving the imperial
               literature from the dangers of a Nazi-like purism (75). To avoid such self-defeating
               homogenization, the centralization of colonial cultures around Tokyo should be prevented:
               cultural resources and talent should be evenly distributed beyond the metropole and
               the originality of each colonial culture should be cultivated (77). Ultimately, Choe
               redefines national literature as “one that every citizen supports, loves, and perfects,”
               resisting the idea that national literature “exists as one mass” and passes top-to-bottom
               from Tokyo to Kyungsung (78). Choe’s national literature requires “each citizen’s
               critical and creative capability” through which “a national culture can be interpreted
               and constructed from the peripheries” (78). This last point is telling since it brings
               us full circle to Choe’s original faith in the Romantic spirit of creativity and critical
               thinking. And it is in Choe’s tortuous engagement with Romanticism through the barbaric
               stage of our world history that we come across the possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan
               criticism. </p>
            <p>To conclude this essay, I return to two seedling writings in Choe’s career that point
               to the Romantic and cosmopolitan foundation of his literary criticism. In a 1936 newspaper
               piece, Choe reassesses the Romantic revival in the Tokyo literary scene, concluding
               that the Romanticism of Japanese proletarian and aestheticist writers is merely a
               reaction to the vulgar realism of the age. What is wanting in contemporary literature
               is a “Romantic spirit,” which Choe defines as “affective perception” and “creative
               expression.” This spirit is “an essential part of the human mind” and “blows new life
               into atrophic literature.” In another newspaper piece written in 1937, Choe calls
               attention to Oswald Spengler’s distinction between regionalism and megalopolitanism
               by way of arguing that the literary spirit of Korea should be cosmopolitan. In other
               words, the writer’s morality and the work’s vitality depend on the writer’s ability
               to position him- or herself in the context of world history. Even when an author chooses
               to write on the countryside of Korea, he or she should be aware of the historical
               situation of, say, Madrid or Shanghai, and have the open-mindedness to exchange thoughts
               with a stranger in London or Paris. In a way, Choe was a student of his own teaching
               as he grounded his literary theory on a sharp understanding of his nation’s position
               in the global context. Romanticism and cosmopolitanism were the two modes of thought
               that carried the weight of Choe’s historical consciousness throughout the turbulent
               century. It is through history that the two “spirits” enforce each other’s power to
               vitalize a critical consciousness against the false ideology of colonial oppression
               and totalitarian violence. An askance view from the peripheries offers acute insight
               into the critical possibilities of those originary ideas that broached our modern
               history. </p>

               the first imperial university to be established outside of Japan, soon followed by
               Taipei Imperial University (or Taihoku Imperial University) founded in 1927. Kyungsung
               Imperial was dissolved and merged with nine other institutions of higher education
               to form Seoul National University as part of the reconstruction efforts of the United
               States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK), which took over the southern half

               Nobel Prize winners (Anatole France, Maurice Maeterlinck) were also popular. Poe’s

               in Japanese literature, which he strived to correct through his poetic compositions
               and studies of Romantic literature. Sato channeled knowledge of Western literature
               to the students of Kyungsung Imperial University, and as Lee Hye-jin asserts, the
               English department here functioned as a sanctuary where Korean students can directly
