                <p rend="noCount">This essay explores the possibilities of literary criticism in a
                    colonial situation by tracing the career of Choe Jae-seo (1908-64), who was one
                    of the first scholars of English literature to write literary criticism in
                    colonial Korea. Choe began his literary studies with a particular focus on
                    English Romanticism at Kyungsung Imperial University, and Romantic aesthetics
                    became a major site of struggle for Choe in finding his voice as a colonized
                    critic. Throughout this struggle, Romanticism carries the burden of Choe’s
                    historical and political consciousness by becoming the point of tension between
                    literature and politics, East and West, universal cosmopolitanism and
                    totalitarian imperialism. At the end of this road, Choe arrives at the
                    possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan criticism, which continues to call for a
                    critical vigilance against colonial oppression and political violence. </p>

                <head>Romanticism in the Peripheries: Choe Jae-seo’s Literary Criticism in Colonial
                    Korea</head>
                <p>Is literary criticism possible in a colonial situation? Can the colonized critic
                    speak? When Korea gained independence from colonial rule at the end of the
                    Second World War, many of its writers and critics underwent the tormenting
                    process of self-reflection and self-criticism, publishing through various venues
                    “declarations of conscience.” These overly lucid acts of self-avowal testify to
                    a suppressed sense of guilt about the silence that had prevailed under colonial
                    oppression—a silence that implicated even those intellectuals who did not
                    outwardly support or collaborate with the Japanese regime.<note place="foot">See
                        Henry H. Em’s fifth chapter for more details on this tumultuous period in
                        Korea’s modern history.</note> The incriminating silence and inaction point
                    to a peculiar predicament in which colonized subjects found themselves when
                    brought into the imperial system as the subjected other. Christopher P. Hanscom
                    attributes this predicament to the “paradox of empire,” which “demand[s] that,
                    as an imperial subject, one speak beyond the position of the colonized” and
                    enforces “the simultaneous denial of a universal position of enunciation to the
                    same colonized subject” (35). The question of breaking one’s silence against
                    colonial powers was a particularly knotty one for Korean intellectuals because
                    the colonial period saw a multi-layered, multi-cultural climate of imperial
                    acculturation and hybridization, which already compromised intellectuals’ sense
                    of autonomous self-representation. With the Meiji government beginning to
                    intervene in Korean affairs in 1876 and finally annexing the Peninsula in 1910,
                    Korea was gradually forced to open its doors to the political, economic, and
                    cultural influences of the outside world—that world being predominantly Japan
                    but also the West, whose culture was mainly transmitted via Japan. During this
                    period, foreign literature began to flow in on a massive scale and had a
                    significant impact on the popular imagination and academic scholarship of Korea.
                    Western literature in particular signified world literature for the Koreans, and
                    to be well versed in Western classics was a vital part of being cultured.
                    Imbibing Western literature was in itself a paradoxical act, relying on foreign
                    culture to overcome the crisis of political and cultural disempowerment under
                    colonial rule. </p>
                <p>This essay will explore the possibilities of literary criticism under the
                    colonial condition through the works of Choe Jae-seo, one of the first Korean
                    scholars of English literature. Choe himself embodied the paradox of empire,
                    struggling to create a critical space for himself by appropriating Western
                    literary theory, which simultaneously formed and unsettled his sense of
                    colonized subjectivity. English Romanticism was one of Choe’s main areas of
                    interest, and this essay’s aim is to reflect upon the exigency of the Romantic
                    mode of thought in the Asian colonial context through Choe’s literary criticism.
                    In a critical sphere where a variety of imported literary modes from the West,
                    such as modernism, socialist realism, and symbolism, were contending for
                    cultural leverage, Romanticism carried the burden of Choe’s historical and
                    political consciousness by becoming the point of tension between literature and
                    politics, East and West, universal cosmopolitanism and totalitarian imperialism.
                    If silence is inevitable in the paradoxical situation of the colonized critic,
                    Choe opens the possibility of a Romantic aesthetics framing the silence and
                    giving it a contour that enables a critical inquiry into colonial discourse.</p>
                <p>Choe Jae-seo (1908–64) was born in Haeju, a city located in the Hwanghae
                    Province, which today is part of the North Korean territory. Japan’s official
                    annexation of Korea took place in 1910, just two years after his birth, and
                    Choe’s education was largely a product of the modern public education system
                    introduced by the Japanese government. He must have been an outstanding student
                    in his youth since he was able to attended Kyungsung Second Middle School in the
                    capitol city of Kyungsung (or Keijo in Japanese, the name given under colonial
                    rule to what is now Seoul). In 1926, Choe was admitted at the top of his class
                    to Kyungsung Imperial University, one of the two imperial universities founded
                    by Japan in the colonies.<note place="foot">Beginning with a two-year
                        preparatory program in 1924, the first class of Kyungsung Imperial
                        University (or Keijo Imperial University) was admitted in 1926. This was the
                        first imperial university to be established outside of Japan, soon followed
                        by Taipei Imperial University (or Taihoku Imperial University) founded in
                        1927. Kyungsung Imperial was dissolved and merged with nine other
                        institutions of higher education to form Seoul National University as part
                        of the reconstruction efforts of the United States Army Military Government
                        in Korea (USAMGIK), which took over the southern half of the Korean
                        Peninsula after Japan’s retreat (Em 147).</note> Choe majored in English
                    literature at the College of Law and Letters with a special focus on English
                    Romantic poetry. The list of courses he took with the Keats scholar Sato Kiyoshi
                    include such titles as “Byron Studies” and “Poems of Keats,” and the title of
                    his senior thesis, which he wrote under Professor Sato, is “The Development of
                    Shelley’s Poetic Mind” (Kim Yun-sik 216). Choe advanced to graduate school in
                    the same university, and although there is no official record of his having
                    received a degree, he did complete the two-year master’s program after working
                    on a research project entitled “Romantic Types of the Poetic Mind.” Upon his
                    completion of graduate studies in 1933, Choe became the first Korean to be
                    appointed lecturer of English at Kyungsung Imperial University—an event
                    phenomenal enough to be reported in the <title level="j">Chosun Daily</title>
                    (April 30, 1933). After a year at his <emph>alma mater</emph>, Choe continued to
                    teach English at Kyungsung School of Law and debuted as a literary critic in
                    both Japanese and Korean literary circles by publishing prolifically in Japanese
                    academic journals, Korean newspapers, and a journal called <title level="j"
                        >Inmun Pyeong’ron</title> [<title level="j">Criticism in the
                        Humanities</title>], of which he was both publisher and editor.</p>
                <p>Romanticism was clearly what held Choe’s interest in school, and although his
                    senior thesis on Shelley is evidently lost and unavailable for assessment, we
                    can get a glimpse of his early thoughts on Romantic literature through the
                    papers he published as a graduate student. In an essay called “The Limits of
                    Poetry,” which Choe wrote in Japanese for the English department’s bulletin in
                    1931, he places Wordsworth and Shelley at two opposite limits of Romantic
                    poetry—Wordsworth as a realist poet who grounds his ideas on the sensory
                    experience of the outer world, and Shelley as an idealist who reaches for the
                    far limits of the human imagination. While this may not be a particularly
                    original take on the two poets, Choe’s criticism of where the two poets fail
                    offers a reverse glimpse of what he saw as successful poetry. For Choe,
                    Wordsworth lapses into unnecessary moral didacticism whenever his poetry loses
                    touch with the natural world. Choe reads Wordsworth’s preface to <title
                        level="m">Peter Bell</title> as evidence of the poet’s anxiety about
                    Coleridgean supernaturalism and the dangers of imagination’s flight beyond
                    earthly themes. Shelley’s fault, on the other hand, is found in such early poems
                    as <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, whose characters Choe sees as mere
                    personifications of conceptual and revolutionary ideas. By contrast, Shelley’s
                    later works such as <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> are better poems in
                    Choe’s opinion because they “spiritualize” characters from real life and
                    sublimate reality into ideals. In his view of Wordsworth and Shelley, Choe
                    appears to be consistently wary of moral and political ideas being presented in
                    poetry without the mediation of human experience, through which the ideas become
                    an integral part of the literary work. Good literature, in other words, is the
                    representation of ideas in their most concrete and lived form, and Choe found
                    literature at its best and its worst in Romantic poetry. </p>
                <p>Choe’s interest in literature’s engagement with the external world finds another
                    outlet in his essay, “Immature Literature,” written in 1931 for a literary
                    journal issued by a coterie of Korean graduates from Kyungsung Imperial
                    University. Here Choe notes the immaturity of some of Shelley’s long poems, most
                    notably <title level="m">The Revolt of Islam</title>, calling to evidence their
                    formal faults. <title level="m">The Revolt of Islam</title>, according to Choe,
                    may have been one of Shelley’s most ambitious and politically radical poems, but
                    the poet there lacks the compositional skills to draw in the readers’ interest
                    and stimulate their political awareness. Choe criticizes Shelley for inserting
                    long political speeches, unnecessary descriptions of natural scenery, and
                    expressions of sentiments that have no clear motive in the story—all of which
                    contribute to thwarting the narrative’s power of escalation and depriving it of
                    a sense of realness and authenticity. On the surface level, Choe’s criticism
                    appears purely formal, especially since he attributes these faults to the
                    difficulty of composing long poems and instead argues for the greatness of lyric
                    poetry by Romantic authors. However, Choe mentions <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> as one of Shelley’s greatest poetic accomplishments, and we
                    come to suspect that it is not merely formal weakness that makes a poem
                    “immature.” In fact, what really troubles Choe is the kind of poetry that fails
                    to engage readers’ interests and affect their minds, as we see in the following
                    statement where formal criticism strangely bleeds into affective criticism: “The
                    greatest challenge of a long poem resides in attaining unity and tension through
                    inspiration and strong affect” (99). For Choe, in the end, Romanticism is less
                    about the expression of the solitary poet’s genius and creativity than about the
                    intimate relationship between the poet, the world, and the audience brought
                    together by a work of literature that gives form to human experience in such a
                    way that it truly inspires and changes its readers. </p>
                <p>In the discursive sphere of colonial Korea, Choe’s political ambiguity and
                    academicism set him against the strongest anti-colonial literary movement of the
                    period led by KAPF (acronym for <emph>Korea Artista Proleta Federacio</emph>,
                    which denotes “Korean Federation of Proletarian Art” in Esperanto).<note
                        place="foot">Esperanto was widely used by Korean writers during the colonial
                        period, with many newspapers and literary journals regularly publishing
                        critical pieces in the language especially during the 1920s. Writing in
                        Esperanto became a popular practice when the Japanese government suppressed
                        the use of the Korean language and instilled Japanese-only policies
                        throughout schools and official institutions.</note> This group of Marxist
                    writers and critics organized in 1925 with the goal of liberating the Korean
                    people from colonial subjugation through class struggle. Their activities mostly
                    consisted of writing and distributing socialist literature for the purpose of
                    educating and promoting the literacy of the working classes. KAPF’s mission
                    statement called for action against feudalism, capitalism, and colonial
                    autocracy, for which art was explicitly utilized as a political tool. It was
                    against KAPF’s ideological rigidity and politicization of literature that the
                    School of Foreign Literature (<foreign>Haewoe Munhakpa</foreign>) began its
                    movement in 1927 to depoliticize art and bring focus to literature’s aesthetic
                    qualities. Its members were mostly students of Western literature from various
                    universities in Tokyo,<note place="foot"> Prominent members like Lee Ha-yun and

                        Whitman, and Pushkin. Poet laureates (Robert Bridges, John Masefield) and
                        Nobel Prize winners (Anatole France, Maurice Maeterlinck) were also popular.

                    taste of the masses, contributing to the development of Korean literature, and
                    playing a part in world literature, the School of Foreign Literature worked to
                    provide accurate and high quality translations of original works against
                    secondhand translations of Japanese translations. </p>
                <p>As it were, the literary scene of Korea’s colonial period was preoccupied by a
                    dichotomous view of art and politics, and today’s assessment of Choe’s critical
                    stance is curiously inflected by this very dichotomy. Korean literature scholar
                    Kim Yun-sik, who argues that Choe is the mainstay of Romanticism in the early
                    stages of literary modernization in Korea, regards him as an independent voice
                    against the political agendas of proletarian and nationalist literary movements.
                    Here Choe’s Romanticism becomes a purely academic interest inherited from his
                    professors at Kyungsung Imperial University, and Choe is exempted from a
                    judgment of his ambiguous politics. Yet, Choe’s career taken as a whole makes it
                    problematic to label him simply a Romanticist. Choe’s early interest in Romantic
                    poetry soon faded into the background as the focus of his critical works shifted
                    to contemporary writers like Aldous Huxley, D. H. Lawrence, and E. M. Forster.
                    On a more fundamental level, Choe began to absorb the philosophical and
                    aesthetic theories of Modernism, which apparently collided with the organic
                    worldview of Romanticism. When Choe, just out of school, debuted as a
                    professional critic in the Japanese literary circle, he published a paper on T.
                    E. Hulme, whose distinction of Romanticism and Classicism had a great impact on
                    Modernists like T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis. In fact, it was this paper that
                    gave Choe the enduring reputation of being an advocate of “intellectualism,” a
                    term coined by the Japanese critic Abe Tomoji to characterize Hulme’s
                    anti-Romantic aesthetic theory calling for “hard and dry,” anti-sentimental, and
                    imagistic works of art (Kim Heung-gyu 279).</p>
                <p>What are we to make of this drastic change in Choe’s critical position? Is he
                    merely an opportunist chasing after academic trends? Is he a detached student of
                    different critical standpoints, explicating and analyzing them without personal
                    commitment or conviction? Coming back to the question of art and politics,
                    Choe’s foray into Modernism may simply look like an extension of the kind of
                    academic thought experiment Kim Yun-sik saw in his Romantic criticisms. However,
                    what I think needs to be more clearly understood here is the complicated
                    position of a colonized intellectual whose political stance has less to do with
                    will to power than with bearing witness to the conflicting powers that usher in
                    a complex of clashing ideas from distant places and times. Korea’s process of
                    full-fledged modernization began almost a century later compared to Europe, and
                    under the control of a colonial power. Ideas that took more than a century to
                    develop progressively in step with various political and cultural changes in the
                    West flowed into Korea almost simultaneously when its gates opened under the
                    political pressures of the outside world. There is a shift in the sense of
                    temporality as the accumulated time and history of the modern West become a
                    synchronic presence in their newly transmitted location. This does not mean that
                    Western ideas lose their historical significance, but that they gain a new sense
                    of history as they are transplanted in different processes of modernization.
                    When it comes to Western influences on thought and art, Korean intellectuals
                    were far more than passive recipients of institutional education under the
                    Japanese colonial policy. Rather, they showed a certain agency and a sense of
                    urgency as they actively sought Western ideas for their liberating
                    possibilities. Choe’s advisor Sato, in his retirement speech made after twenty
                    years of teaching at Kyungsung Imperial University, recalls how shocked he was
                    at finding students thirsting after knowledge of foreign literature in their
                    search of a road toward the Korean people’s liberation and freedom (Kim Yun-sik
                    406). Choe was one of them, finding resonance in the Romantic poets’ own
                    engagement with a burgeoning modern culture and politics; Romanticism was still
                    a highly relevant mode of thought in the historical stage that Korea was
                        in.<note place="foot">As late as in 1943, Choe writes a commemorative essay
                        celebrating Sato’s teachings and original poetry (<title level="m">Chosun
                            Literature during the Transitional Period</title> 177–91). According to
                        Choe, his professor had always regretted the lack of imagination in Japanese
                        literature, which he strived to correct through his poetic compositions and
                        studies of Romantic literature. Sato channeled knowledge of Western
                        literature to the students of Kyungsung Imperial University, and as Lee
                        Hye-jin asserts, the English department here functioned as a sanctuary where
                        Korean students can directly access and study Western literature and its
                        liberal thoughts without going through Japan (163).</note> However, the more
                    skeptical and disillusioned worldview of the Modernists also resonated with Choe
                    as he understood the hopeless state of world affairs in the early twentieth
                    century, when Japan took part in the current of totalitarian militarism sweeping
                    across Europe and Asia. The inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in
                    Choe’s wide-ranging literary criticism are perhaps the most evident signs of a
                    point in colonial history when Romantic and Modernist worldviews collided by
                    ironically being both valid.</p>
                <p>Korea continued to go through a series of sea changes: its liberation from Japan
                    in 1945, divided occupation by Soviet and American troops, establishment of two
                    separate Koreas in 1948, and the eruption of the Korean War in 1950. Only after
                    the violent storm of historical rupture had passed and settled into an uneasy
                    reconciliation was Choe able to write his critical masterpiece <title level="m"
                        >Theory of Literature</title> in 1957. In the preface to this work, Choe
                    writes a deeply personal account of what literature has meant for him through
                    the turbulent years. There is a certain poignancy in his confession that, when
                    he fled south from the advancing North Korean and Chinese forces on the
                    Christmas morning of 1950, he took with him just two books—a Concise <title
                        level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title> and the collected works of
                    Shakespeare—and that he was able to find value in life and hang onto a desire
                    for life by reading Shakespearean tragedies. Life after Korea’s liberation has
                    taught him “the sweet taste of freedom,” writes Choe, but it has also taught him
                    “the value of order” (1). From this historical lesson Choe develops a theory
                    that the function of literature is to give formal order to human life,
                    experience, and feeling so that value and truth can be transmitted to the
                    reader. Despite his reluctance to designate what this value or truth may be or
                    where it may lie, Choe certainly reassesses what literature can and should do
                    against a postcolonial situation in which both literary and national histories
                    must undergo reconstruction out of the rubbles of calamity. Interestingly,
                    English Romanticism serves as a somewhat ambiguous foundation for Choe’s
                    literary theory and cultural critique, causing tension in its belatedness and
                    yet not failing to give force to his sense of urgency in questioning the
                    possibility of literature in the aftermath of modern catastrophe. </p>
                <p>One of the few places where Choe touches on contemporary Korean culture in <title
                        level="m">Theory of Literature</title> is the section where he quotes
                    Wordsworth’s “Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>” to draw an
                    analogy between the corrupted states of popular taste in nineteenth-century
                    England and in twentieth-century Korea (58). Like Wordsworth, Choe has embarked
                    on a cultural mission to save readers from the evils of vulgar and
                    sensationalist popular literature. Where this undertaking takes him is another
                    question for the postcolonial critic, however, since he cannot avoid comparing
                    the vastly different literary terrains and traditions of the two nations
                    maintaining different possibilities for a cultural renewal:<quote> Even in
                        England, where a literary tradition of nearly a thousand years stands under
                        the two great peaks that is Shakespeare and Milton, Wordsworth felt
                        something close to despair. Even without such a tradition, our society
                        embraces foreign literature uncritically and the murky waters of shamefully
                        obscene literature flow gallantly without reserve. I cannot be the only one
                        who cannot resist hopeless thoughts about the future of our nation’s modern
                        literature. (59) </quote> Much is at stake for the future of Korean
                    literature, in Choe’s opinion, because there is no literary tradition to act as
                    a buffer or remedial force against the inflow of tasteless literature from
                    abroad. With their tradition no longer relevant or even surviving in the throes
                    of violent change, Korean authors cannot afford to rely on their own heritage to
                    build a new literary tradition as Wordsworth had done. On this note, it is
                    significant that Choe looks to Chaucer, rather than Shakespeare and Milton, as
                    the cornerstone of England’s literary tradition. After a pointed reflection on a
                    society, presumably Korean, that can neither go forward from a state of cultural
                    anarchy for lack of tradition nor break clean from the dogmatic tradition of a
                    fossilized culture like that of pre-modern Confucian Korea, Choe turns to
                    Chaucer for answers (96). Choe’s emphasis falls on the fact that Chaucer’s
                    “English” literature was the product of actively sought literary influences from
                    advanced foreign cultures. Chaucer had established the English verse form by
                    creatively adopting the decasyllabic meter of French poetry; refined the
                    literary English language by translating <title level="m">Roman de la
                        Rose</title> and cultivating a more sophisticated form of his native
                    language; absorbed the styles of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio in his literary
                    creations; and even summoned the inspiration of Eastern literature when modeling
                        <title level="m">The Canterbury Tales</title> after <title level="m">The
                        Arabian Nights</title> (97–99). What captures Choe’s imagination in the case
                    of Chaucer is the vitality and suppleness of a tradition that comes alive
                    through a creative engagement with its other—what was most critically needed in
                    the cultural wasteland of post-war Korea.</p>
                <p>The same openness applies to Choe’s own critical theory, which is based on a
                    broad knowledge of Western literary criticism. Working up from Plato and
                    Aristotle to Kantian aesthetics and scrutinizing the core ideas of Romantic,
                    Victorian, and Modernist literary criticisms, <title level="m">Theory of
                        Literature</title> functions also as an encyclopedic compilation of European
                    aesthetic thought. In that context, Choe takes Romanticism with a historically
                    nuanced grain of salt, and Romantic literary criticism gains a renewed force
                    against not only late modern but also postcolonial history. Choe’s sense that we
                    are now living in an age where it is impossible to write poetry departs from his
                    understanding of the Romantic predicament that there is no work for poets in the
                    age of industrialization (149) and expands to an awareness of the stifled
                    individual genius and personality in the modern age (87). If the principle of
                    individual imagination and feeling has returned to the center of Choe’s theory
                    of literature, it now entails the burden of knowing its belatedness and
                    anachronism. As a way of addressing this problem, Choe is saliently upfront
                    about his scientific and positivist methodology, pronouncing in his preface that
                    he will desist from an idealistic admiration of such concepts as personality,
                    genius, imagination, intuition, inspiration, and creativity only to treat them
                    as demonstrable phenomena or experiences (2). He thus resorts to the scientific
                    method of modern psychology, most notably that of I. A. Richards’s physiological
                    psychology and John Dewey’s biological psychology, to overcome the Kantian
                    method of faculty psychology (158–59). Choe’s assertion that literature is the
                    ordering of feeling is inspired by Richards’s idea in <title level="m">Science
                        and Poetry</title> that the experience of reading poetry brings about a
                    psychological equilibrium by harmonizing multiple human impulses into emotional
                    responses and attitudes, i.e., “the impulses towards one kind of behaviour or
                    another” (Choe 167; Richards 28). On the other hand, when Choe calls for a
                    literature that organizes human experience, he is relying on Dewey’s concept of
                    experience in <title level="m">Art as Experience</title>: <quote> Instead of
                        signifying being shut up within one’s own private feelings and sensations,
                        it [experience] signifies active and alert commerce with the world; at its
                        height it signifies complete interpenetration of self and the world of
                        objects and events. Instead of signifying surrender to caprice and disorder,
                        it affords our sole demonstration of a stability that is not stagnation but
                        is rhythmic and developing. Because experience is the fulfillment of an
                        organism in its struggles and achievements in a world of things, it is art
                        in germ. Even in its rudimentary forms, it contains the promise of that
                        delightful perception which is esthetic experience. (18–19) </quote> For
                    Dewey, experience in its organic connection with the world is essentially
                    aesthetic, and art in turn is merely an intensified form of experience.
                    Resisting theories that separate art from ordinary experience or that put art on
                    a pedestal, Dewey revises the Kantian system of compartmentalizing and
                    hierarchizing human faculties for the sake of aesthetic autonomy. Choe inherits
                    Dewey’s unifying vision in his interpretation of Coleridge’s organic theory,
                    expanding upon the conventional analogy between genius and plant to assert the
                    necessity of absorbing and digesting diverse nutrients for both genii and plants
                    to produce “beautiful and nutritious fruits” (89). </p>
                <p>Choe’s reinstatement of Romantic organicism to add pressure to the individual’s
                    active engagement with the world is in the interest of a critic who is
                    reconsidering the function of literature in a world disillusioned with the power
                    of individual genius. However, Choe cannot sever himself wholly from the
                    Romantic notion of aesthetic autonomy because he is extremely wary of a
                    distorted way of imbuing literature with social or political
                    significance—namely, the totalitarian regime’s use of literature for propaganda.
                    As Choe notes in <title level="m">Theory of Literature</title>,<quote> It was
                        not only in the past that literature’s utility was stressed. Even today,
                        literature under a dictatorship assumes a propagandistic function, and only
                        then is literature allowed a reason for being. However, that literature can
                        never be valid as propaganda rests on the simple reason, once stated by De
                        Quincey, that affect dies [when literature becomes propaganda]. This is in
                        fact beauty’s vengeance against power. (31)</quote> Faced with an Adornian
                    impasse in the aftermath of totalitarian devastation, Choe still believes poetry
                    can be written and literature possible. Along with Coleridge’s organic theory,
                    Wordsworth’s “worthy purpose” in poetry (59), Shelley’s moral sympathy (61),
                    Keats’s negative capability (78) all serve as ways through which Choe can
                    reflect upon literature’s disinterested interest in exerting its affective and
                    moral power over the given reality. In fact, Choe himself can no longer be a
                    disinterested critic when it comes to literature under the shadows of
                    authoritarian power, pondering upon art’s vengeful strength over political
                    violence. Reading into the political implications of Choe’s literary theory is
                    an important yet tricky task, mainly because he himself was writing <title
                        level="m">Theory of Literature</title> after a blatant alignment with
                    Japanese militarist propaganda during the period of escalated warfare and
                    cultural indoctrination throughout the Pacific War. To discuss the politics of
                    Choe’s aesthetics without politicizing him would be the key challenge here—a
                    challenge that is heightened by Choe’s post-war return to Romanticism, a
                    cultural phenomenon prone to ideological labeling, reactionary or revolutionary,
                    precisely because of its inherently oblique and tension-ridden relationship with
                    politics. </p>
                <p>The last five years of colonial occupation, during which Japan concentrated all
                    of its military and spiritual efforts on imperialist expansion in Southeast Asia
                    and China, constituted a state of exception for Korean authors and critics in
                    many ways. Since the mid 1930s, the Japanese government had quickly grown
                    dogmatic and censorious in its nationalist ideology, forcing the disintegration
                    of the insurgent KAPF and establishing Korean literary associations that
                    promoted propagandistic war literature. Under the unifying nationalist motto
                    “Japan and Korea are one body” (<foreign>naeseon ilche</foreign>), Japan
                    aggressively obliterated the cultural identity of Korea by forcing the colonial
                    subjects to use the Japanese language exclusively, change their surnames to
                    Japanese names, and pledge allegiance to the Japanese emperor. In 1941, the two
                    leading literary magazines of Korea, <title level="j">Munjang</title> [<title
                        level="j">Sentence</title>] and <title level="j">Inmun Pyeong’ron</title>
                        [<title level="j">Criticism in the Humanities</title>], were closed by force
                    and integrated into the solely government-authorized <title level="j">Gukmin
                        Munhak</title> [<title level="j">National Literature</title>], which soon
                    became a Japanese language only publication. Choe was the chief editor of this
                    new magazine, working under an editorial guideline that emphasized representing
                    the “national” spirit and voluntarily cooperating with Japan’s war efforts and
                    cultural programs. In <title level="m">Chosun Literature during the Transitional
                        Period</title>, a 1943 collection of essays Choe published in Japanese to
                    promote the cause of <title level="j">National Literature</title>, we come
                    across what looks like a flagrantly collaborative attitude toward the
                    authoritarian cultural regimen. The watershed moment for such unreserved
                    ideological conversion, Choe confesses, was Japan’s conscription of Korean male
                    adults to the war,<note place="foot">The conscription occurred quite late in the
                        colonial period, publicly announced on May 8, 1942, and implemented on
                        August 1, 1943.</note> which may have been the last straw that ruined all
                    hope for a historical turn after a long period of conscientious resistance and
                    suffering. To reference this moment Choe uses the term “crisis,” which he traces
                    back to the original medical terminology signifying the decisive moment between
                    death and recovery (25–26). </p>
                <p>Choe, who has long been stigmatized as a pro-Japanese collaborator, is enlisted
                    along with 4,775 other names in <title level="m">The Encyclopedia of
                        Pro-Japanese Figures</title> published by the Research Center for National
                    Issues in 2009. The exorbitant number of enlisted names, screened and extracted
                    from a group of 25,000 people suspected of collaboration, points not only to the
                    fact that the political settlement of the nation’s colonial past is still a
                    delicate issue in Korea but also to the fundamental ambiguity that entails the
                    political categorization of colonized intellectuals and their activities.<note
                        place="foot">
                        <title level="m">The Encyclopedia of Pro-Japanese Figures</title>, while
                        including active political agents who gained power and wealth by
                        collaborating with the Japanese government, significantly comprises figures
                        from such fields as religion, academia, the arts, and the media. The
                        ambiguity involved in identifying and categorizing political loyalty has
                        deepened as debates began to center on questions of volition and
                        intention—whether or not these collaborators colluded with the Japanese of
                        their own accord.</note> Critics vary in their assessments of Choe’s stance
                    in colonial politics, but one thing they do agree on is the aberrant state in
                    which intellectuals like Choe found themselves during times of extreme foreign
                    dictatorship. Song Seung-cheol, who notes the political ambivalence of Choe’s
                    literary theory, still finds fault with Choe’s failure to make atonement for his
                    deviant betrayal of his people and collusion with the colonial powers. On the
                    other hand, Ryu Bo-seon, who acknowledges the structural inevitability of
                    collusion for colonized intellectuals caught in the void between traditional and
                    modern histories, still stigmatizes Choe’s submission as symptomatic of an age
                    of unprecedented madness and irrationality. The exceptionality of this age
                    rests, however, on grounds more radical than mere breach of patriotism or loss
                    of sound judgment. Writers and critics had in fact met an epoch where literature
                    itself was no more possible. As Lee Hye-jin astutely points out in her analysis
                    of Choe’s wartime criticism, there is only silence in the fundamental gap
                    between war propaganda and literature proper, and between an individual’s
                    reaction to an ideological structure and the structure itself (172–94). Lee’s
                    main premise gains clout here: it is indeed impossible even to raise the
                    reductive question of whether a certain wartime author or critic is pro-Japanese
                    or pro-Korean.</p>
                <p>One of the signs showing that Choe’s wartime criticism was essentially about the
                    ideological politicizing of literature rather than literature itself can be
                    found in Choe’s active condemnation of Romanticism in his theorization of the
                    “national literature.” In the course of instituting a literary program based on
                    the doctrinal idea of a nationalist literature, he negates the contemporary
                    pertinence of a literature devoted to the liberal idea of artistic and critical
                    autonomy—what Choe particularly denounces in the name of Romanticism.<note
                        place="foot">It is interesting to note here that Choe translates Irving
                        Babbitt’s <title level="m">Rousseau and Romanticism</title> from the English
                        into Japanese around this period (1939–40). The change in Choe’s stance
                        toward Romanticism is reflected in his choice of Babbitt, who sees Rousseau
                        and his Romanticism as a major corrupting influence on Western
                        culture.</note> Understanding what Choe stood against helps us explain that
                    curious passage constituting the first stipulation of the editorial guideline to
                        <title level="j">National Literature</title>: “Not only must all ethnicist
                    and socialist tendencies antithetical to the national constitution be rejected;
                    individualist and liberalist tendencies which obscure the concept of a national
                    constitution must also be absolutely denounced” (qtd. in Choe, <title level="m"
                        >Chosun Literature</title> 69). The very spirit of individualism and
                    liberalism, both political and aesthetical, is detrimental to the constitution
                    of a totalitarian regime. It is interesting to note the different registers
                    through which Choe defines the political significance of individualism and
                    liberalism in <title level="m">Chosun Literature during the Transitional
                        Period</title>. Most narrowly, they represent the spurious ideology of
                    British and American imperialism pitted against the new nationalist order
                    established under the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan (33). The fall of
                    Paris in 1940 had been the critical turning point for Choe’s historical vision,
                    bearing the sign that such milestone events do not rely on the ambition of just
                    one or two dictators but on a much broader historical turn (22). Choe has
                    clearly read the direction that world history has taken, which allows him to
                    reconsider his colonial position in the global context. Individualist and
                    liberal ideas more largely become symbols of Western thought, whose abstract
                    idealism and alienating divisionism has caused the cultural disintegration and
                    moral corruption of the West. Here Choe sets up the West against the new Asian
                    order that Japan has put forward as the mainstay objective of its “civilizing
                    mission.” Japan was moving to organize its colonies into a Greater East Asia
                    Co-Prosperity Sphere to unify Asia politically and economically against Western
                    powers. </p>
                <p>Romanticism serves Choe well in politicizing and moralizing the modern Western
                    culture. For Choe, Western literature of the twentieth century is riddled with
                    problems: disintegration of personality, impotence of intelligence, prevalence
                    of decadent moods and reactionary satire, loss of the critical spirit, to name a
                    few (26). Modern literature shows the symptoms of a culture that is anemic and
                    anomic, catering to the delusional egotism of so-called geniuses—a “disease”
                    Choe sees originating in the Romantic age (38). Percy Shelley is the icon of
                    such narcissism, irresponsibly gratifying his desire for freedom (44) and
                    indulging in neurotic and melancholy moods (104). What I find truly interesting
                    about Choe’s take on Romanticism as the main culprit of modern dissociation is
                    his association of this literary trend with cosmopolitanism—a curious tactic
                    Choe uses to politicize Romanticism against the national ideology of the
                    colonial regime. Historically, the Romantics entered the literary scene as
                    cultured cosmopolitans, whose idea of culture signified the free spirit of
                    finding a home wherever the heart goes “just like a bird resting on a tree
                    branch it fancies” (107). Like the Romantic spirit, cosmopolitanism is itself
                    decadent and irresponsible since its abstract notions of universality and
                    humanity disregard the fact that man is tied to blood and earth from the moment
                    of his birth (83). According to Choe’s diagnosis, however, “because such
                    abstracted humankind is not an abstract man but a being insisting on acting as a
                    cosmopolitan harboring a certain ideology, he cannot but be hostile toward the
                    people and the nation, which make up the total body of life, and ends up
                    bringing about their disintegration” (83–84). Choe’s politicization of
                    Romanticism through an emphasis on its catastrophic cosmopolitan spirit sets the
                    stage for designating national literature as the harbinger of a new age and
                    world. For Choe, the epoch of nation has arrived to overturn the epoch of
                    culture, and the clash of literary perspectives has become nothing less than a
                    clash of worldviews (81). </p>
                <p>By way of fighting ideology with ideology, Choe has reduced the concepts of
                    culture, Romanticism, and cosmopolitanism to political tenets. However, the
                    irreducibility of such concepts is revealed ironically in the strangely
                    cosmopolitan turn of Choe’s own argument in marking a space for Korean
                    literature in the context of colonial nationalism. Even in the process of
                    accusing the false consciousness of abstract universalism, Choe cannot
                    politicize away a true cosmopolitan call for universal liberty and tolerance,
                    which extends to his perspectives on a certain autonomous role Korean literature
                    should play in constructing national literature. To clarify the relationship
                    between Japanese and Korean literatures in such context, Choe resorts to an
                    analogy with the relationship between English and Scottish literatures:
                    “although Scottish literature is one part of English literature, the former
                    contributes largely to the latter by adhering to its Scottish character” (72).
                    As in the Scottish case, Choe sees an irrepressible character unique to Korean
                    literature, whose potential for autonomy and originality rests precisely on that
                    character. This is far from a chauvinist stance, since Choe attributes the same
                    unique character originating from tradition, customs, and sentiments to the
                    literatures of Taiwan and Manchuria (74). The literatures of the colonies will
                    not disturb the order of Japanese literature but rather enrich it, saving the
                    imperial literature from the dangers of a Nazi-like purism (75). To avoid such
                    self-defeating homogenization, the centralization of colonial cultures around
                    Tokyo should be prevented: cultural resources and talent should be evenly
                    distributed beyond the metropole and the originality of each colonial culture
                    should be cultivated (77). Ultimately, Choe redefines national literature as
                    “one that every citizen supports, loves, and perfects,” resisting the idea that
                    national literature “exists as one mass” and passes top-to-bottom from Tokyo to
                    Kyungsung (78). Choe’s national literature requires “each citizen’s critical and
                    creative capability” through which “a national culture can be interpreted and
                    constructed from the peripheries” (78). This last point is telling since it
                    brings us full circle to Choe’s original faith in the Romantic spirit of
                    creativity and critical thinking. And it is in Choe’s tortuous engagement with
                    Romanticism through the barbaric stage of our world history that we come across
                    the possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan criticism. </p>
                <p>To conclude this essay, I return to two seedling writings in Choe’s career that
                    point to the Romantic and cosmopolitan foundation of his literary criticism. In
                    a 1936 newspaper piece, Choe reassesses the Romantic revival in the Tokyo
                    literary scene, concluding that the Romanticism of Japanese proletarian and
                    aestheticist writers is merely a reaction to the vulgar realism of the age. What
                    is wanting in contemporary literature is a “Romantic spirit,” which Choe defines
                    as “affective perception” and “creative expression.” This spirit is “an
                    essential part of the human mind” and “blows new life into atrophic literature.”
                    In another newspaper piece written in 1937, Choe calls attention to Oswald
                    Spengler’s distinction between regionalism and megalopolitanism by way of
                    arguing that the literary spirit of Korea should be cosmopolitan. In other
                    words, the writer’s morality and the work’s vitality depend on the writer’s
                    ability to position him- or herself in the context of world history. Even when
                    an author chooses to write on the countryside of Korea, he or she should be
                    aware of the historical situation of, say, Madrid or Shanghai, and have the
                    open-mindedness to exchange thoughts with a stranger in London or Paris. In a
                    way, Choe was a student of his own teaching as he grounded his literary theory
                    on a sharp understanding of his nation’s position in the global context.
                    Romanticism and cosmopolitanism were the two modes of thought that carried the
                    weight of Choe’s historical consciousness throughout the turbulent century. It
                    is through history that the two “spirits” enforce each other’s power to vitalize
                    a critical consciousness against the false ideology of colonial oppression and
                    totalitarian violence. An askance view from the peripheries offers acute insight
                    into the critical possibilities of those originary ideas that broached our
                    modern history. </p>
