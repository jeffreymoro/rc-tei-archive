            <p class="noCount">This volume brings together essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea to offer an
               unprecedented view of English Romanticism’s presence in the modern literature and
               literary criticism of East Asia. Going beyond simply tracing the influence of English
               Romantic writing on East Asian writers and critics, each essay reveals an intrinsic
               and often surprising interconnectedness in the Romantic aesthetics and mode of thought
               across the borders of East and West. This collection’s reflection on English Romanticism
               through the historical particularities of East Asian nations at the onset of modernity
               sheds light on Romanticism as a still valid form of cultural critique against the
               shared yet divergent forms, experiences, and questions of modernity.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Three Vignettes: English Romanticism and Asian Modernity</span></h2>
               <p>East Asian countries, traditionally belonging to a common “Chinese character cultural
                  sphere,” have shared the same written sign to refer to the “Romantic”: 浪漫. The origin
                  of this word is the French <span class="foreign">roman</span>, which the Japanese began to transcribe phonetically with these very Chinese characters
                  in the late nineteenth century. Inscribed within the word itself is the history of
                  East Asia’s import of Romanticism from European cultures. To break ground on what
                  may be a bewilderingly large project, I begin this introduction to English Romanticism
                  in East Asia with three figurative junctures in the literary histories of China, Japan,
                  and Korea. These synecdochic sketches, each showing an archetypal Romantic figure
                  taking root in a new host and mutating into an uncanny form of revolution, melancholy,
                  or rebellion, evoke some of the main historical and aesthetic issues that entailed
                  the presence of Romanticism in the modern imagination of East Asia.</p>

                     known for writing novels that embody the trials of a nation undergoing radical transformation.
                     Not many know that he was also one of the most important translators of modern China,
                     committed to translating Marxist literary theories to define himself as a leftist
                     intellectual in the midst of vigorous debates on revolutionary literature. In his
                     essay “‘Hard Translation’ and the ‘Class Character of Literature’” (1930), Lu Xun
                     cuts a unique figure for the translator: <span class="quote">‘To chew and anatomize the enemy now seems inevitable, but if we have a book of anatomy
                        and a book of cuisine to guide our practice, then the structure [for anatomy] and
                        the taste [for chewing] can be clearer and better. People like to compare Prometheus,
                        the legendary figure in the Greek mythology, to revolutionaries, believing that the
                        magnanimity and forbearance, which Prometheus showed when he was punished by Zeus
                        but remained unrepentant for stealing fire for man, are the same [as that of a revolutionary].
                        But I stole fire from foreign countries only with the intention of cooking my own
                        flesh, in the hope that if I find the taste agreeable, it would benefit more to those
                        who chew [my flesh], and the consumption of my body would not prove in vain.
                        <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                                 (2)
                                 </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Wang Pu 330–31, quoted from Lu Xun, “‘Hard Translation’ and the ‘Class Character of

                                 3 (Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1960) 82.</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> Casting the translator into a Promethean figure, Lu Xun not only redefines the role
                     of the Chinese translator in modern China but also reshapes the Promethean figure
                     by dislocating it from the Western context. The Promethean translator steals fire
                     from foreign countries not merely to pass it on to Chinese readers; he uses the fire
                     to cook his own flesh, making it more palatable to both himself and the readers. As
                     Wang Pu astutely notes, “[c]ooking one’s own body with the foreign fire and tasting
                     one’s own cooked flesh is evidently an allegorical scenario of meticulous self-criticism
                     and self-dissemination” (333). Lu Xun’s self-annihilating translator emerges from
                     a rigorous criticism of the revolutionary possibilities of simply transplanting foreign
                     ideas to the Chinese consciousness. The corporeality of the cannibalistic allegory
                     overrides and distorts the enlightened idealism of the rebellious Prometheus, echoing
                     Mary Shelley’s perversion of Percy Shelley’s revolutionary idealism through the monstrous
                     creation of her modern Prometheus. However, the self-sacrifice and martyrdom of Lu
                     Xun’s translator go beyond Romantic self-criticism or self-ironization in the vein
                     of Mary Shelley or even Byron. The near Eucharistic practice of the translator suggests
                     the possibility of benevolence and common good after a painful trial of self-sacrifice.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Lu Xun’s Promethean translator embodies the predicament of a nation for which opening
                  up to the modern culture of the West meant doing away with a four-thousand-year-old
                  tradition. At the turn of the century, China could no longer ignore pressures both
                  internal and external to modernize, compelled to remake itself into a modern nation
                  while defending itself against foreign aggression. The Chinese Revolution of 1911,
                  also known as the Xinhai Revolution, allowed the Chinese people to overthrow of the
                  Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. The Japanese writer Natsume Soseki
                  likened this event to the French Revolution, feeling the terror of witnessing the
                  revolutionary spirit quickly translating to violent upheaval and radical break with
                  the past—a lesson in historical feeling that the British knew well, as noted by Soseki
                  (Hiyama 44). That Lu Xun’s Prometheus steals a “foreign” fire, however, marks a crucial
                  difference between Eastern and Western histories of modernization: modernity for the
                  East was a condition shaped by essentially extraneous and often dissonant forces while
                  modernity for the West was comparatively a condition of internal necessity and voluntary
                  progress. With rapid import of Western ideas and technologies, ever intensified by
                  such cultural reform movements as the May Fourth and New Culture Movements, tradition
                  had become an excessive vestige that needed to be either removed from or incorporated
                  into the process of modernization. Lu Xun’s vehement condemnation of those foreigners
                  who opposed China’s Westernization in order to protect the exotic culture of the natives
                  was already a sign that the natives could no longer view their tradition divorced
                  from the larger historical milieu. The radical self-renovation of the Promethean translator,
                  who “cooks” his own consciousness with foreign thought in order to transform Chinese
                  culture into a much more consumable form, is in line with Lu Xun’s belief that the
                  right way to China’s modernity lies in actively reorganizing and renewing tradition
                  itself. Burning one’s flesh and offering it up for people’s nourishment are the price
                  to pay for China’s modernization.</p>

                  <p>Natsume Soseki (1867–1916) is a writer without whom the discussion of modern Japanese
                     literature would be severely circumscribed. Well-versed in Japanese, Chinese, and
                     English literatures, Soseki

                     </div> was acutely attentive to the state of Japanese literature in the context of international
                     literary milieu. One of his earlier novels, <em>Kusamakura</em> (literally meaning “grass pillow”), is exemplary of the novelist’s modern consciousness.
                     The novel, published in 1906, is a <span class="foreign">Künstlerroman</span> composed of the inner reflections and thought experiments of a young artist who goes
                     on a walking trip through the mountains and stays at a remote hot spring inn where
                     he meets a woman named Nami. The opening scene of the novel presents the artist contemplating
                     on the perfect artistic vision through which life becomes art: “You have only to conjure
                     up the world before you, and there you will find a living poem, a fount of song. No
                     need to commit your thoughts to paper—the heart will already sing with a sweet inner
                     euphony. No need to stand before your easel and limn with brush and paint—the world’s
                     vast array of forms and colors already sparkles within the inner eye” (4). However,
                     this transcendental vision of unity is broken when the artist slips on a loose piece
                     of rock and ends up on his bottom. The artist’s rude awakening to the physicality
                     of the solitary walk and the ensuing reveries bring to light the difficulty of life
                     and art, which also colors his perception of a skylark that “suddenly bursts into
                     song” beneath his feet in a valley (6). As in Shelley’s poem “To a Skylark,” which
                     incidentally “leaps to my [the artist’s] mind” upon hearing the skylark’s song, the
                     unseen bird fills the air with a song that soars along with the creature high up into
                     the clouds (6–7). However, Soseki’s skylark is far less ethereal and otherworldly
                     than Shelley’s in that the artist exerts his imagination to envision a bird tumbling
                     in the valley: “Then I imagine the tumbling skylark crossing paths with another as
                     it rises. My final thought is that, whether falling or rising or crossing midair,
                     the wild, vigorous song of the skylark would never for an instant cease” (6). The
                     arduousness of the artist’s climb and the skylark’s flight deflects the transcendental
                     power of the artist’s imagination and the skylark’s song, and what may have been a
                     seamless flight of mental association between the skylark’s song and Shelley’s poem
                     is skewed by the recitation of a fragment from Shelley’s “To a Skylark,” which the
                     artist struggles to remember: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">We look before and after</div>
                           <div class="l">And pine for what is not:</div>
                           <div class="l">Our sincerest laughter</div>
                           <div class="l">With some pain is fraught;</div>
                           <div class="l">Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought. (Soseki 7)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> This quotation is a strange representation of Shelley, who momentarily dwells here
                     on the pain and sadness of life transcended by the skylark’s song. Soseki’s emphasis
                     falls on the other, darker side of Shelley’s uplifting vision, recalling for the artist
                     a common expression found in Chinese poetry: “a hundredweight of sorrows” (7). Heightened
                     by the hyperbolic expression of sorrow, the poignant conclusion reached by the artist
                     is that “poets are great sufferers; they seem to have more than double the nervous
                     sensitivity of the average person” (7).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Compared to China’s history, Japan’s process of modernization was relatively gradual
                  and voluntary. Japan abandoned its isolationist policy with the advent of the Meiji
                  era in 1868, after which the nation worked actively to Westernize its governmental
                  system and social and cultural practices. Soseki was a beneficiary of Japan’s modernization
                  policy, being granted a government scholarship to study in London for two years. Ironically,
                  what Soseki gleaned from the overseas experience, at the price of a nervous breakdown
                  due to intense loneliness in a foreign city, was a clearer vision of Japan’s national
                  character and historical fate in relation to the West. Soseki criticizes Japan’s idolization
                  of the West as the common evil of a “forgetful” people intent on imitating the West
                  in the name of progress (Hiyama 25–26). Putting the Chinese classics, which he had
                  studied since boyhood, into perspective against English literature, Soseki also realizes
                  that the two literatures are so radically different as to defy common categorization.
                  Ruptures are formed in Soseki’s double consciousness, and it is out of these ruptures
                  that a true understanding of what is Japanese or Eastern is gained. As seen in the
                  scene from <em>Kusamakura</em> above, the aesthetic vision of a Japanese artist emerges in genuine form only after
                  he awakens from his “forgetfulness” in Shelleyan transcendentalism. What little Shelley
                  the artist can quote from memory is not quite so transcendental or sublime, but with
                  this Shelley the expression taken from Chinese poetry rings more authentic. The rest
                  of the novel, written in Haiku style, explores the uniquely Japanese consciousness
                  of “non-sentiment,” a way of considering sentiment as a thing of nature rather than
                  human (Hiyama 83). Soseki’s “unforgetting” is a sign of negative resistance to Western
                  dominance, exposing Japan’s mock modernity under the Western-oriented regime of the
                  Meiji era while bring the East into relief against the West.</p>

                     </blockquote> This poem is a strange amalgam of the Prometheus myth and a popular Korean folktale.
                     Like the Romantic Prometheus, the rabbit in the Korean fable symbolizes resistance
                     against oppressive power. The rabbit is lured by the tortoise with promises of great
                     riches to the dragon king’s underwater palace only to discover that the king is in
                     dire need of a rabbit’s liver to cure his deathly illness. The quick-witted rabbit
                     fibs to the king that rabbits hide their precious livers in secret places and that
                     he will quickly retrieve his if the king would allow him a trip back aboveground.
                     Of course, the rabbit runs away as soon as he reaches land, and his clever trick has
                     traditionally been associated with the powerless peasants’ survival tactic against
                     despotic authority. In Yun’s poetic remake of the traditional folklore, the tortoise
                     stands for Japanese colonial power, to which the speaker stands up defiantly. If the
                     wet liver preserved and guarded by the rabbit alludes to the unwavering spirit of
                     autonomy, the starved eagle is less the Promethean symbol of punitive authority than
                     a historically marked figure for the colonized people’s desire for liberation. The
                     rabbit escaping from the Caucasus Mountains reinforces the cause of liberty by bringing
                     the two stories of rebellion together in hybridized form.</p>
               </div>
               <p>However, the hybridity between traditional and foreign narratives also exposes the
                  double bind in which the colonized speaker finds him- or herself—a situation in which
                  neither Korean tradition nor Western thought can have resistant power against Japanese
                  oppression. As seen in the last stanza of Yun’s poem, Prometheus is found in an alien
                  context, paying for his sin by drowning in the sea with a millstone around his neck.
                  The fall of Prometheus is figured forth in biblical terms, but the allusion to the
                  undersea menace in the Korean folklore is also clear. Prometheus’s foreignness becomes
                  noticeable as he fails to emerge as the universal symbol of resistance and liberation.
                  Prometheus’s despair is that of the wasted speaker’s—the one whose defiant act of
                  feeding the salvaged liver to the eagle does not quite square with his rebellious
                  tone against the tortoise. Both Prometheus and the speaker find their acts of defiance
                  missing the mark in this strange wonderland of mixed-and-matched tales. Such impotence
                  is the plight of the colonized Koreans, whose history of modernization and Westernization
                  significantly overlapped with their colonial history. Prometheus’s theft and the rabbit’s
                  wit, seen out of its original context, can even call the legitimacy of the rebel’s
                  defiance into question, obscuring the fact that the original thief and trickster is
                  the tortoise. For a people whose liberation “came like a thief in the night” at the
                  end of World War II (Kim 499), not much was in its power to change against the throes
                  of imperialist world history. Yun may have read and been inspired by Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as an English major at Yeonhui College in Korea and Doshisha University in Japan
                  (Park 44). He certainly lived a Shelleyan life, finishing his short life of twenty-eight
                  years in prison for anti-Japanese activities. Yet, his Prometheus remains bound and
                  fallen as the unclaimed liver is fed to the eagle starved for liberation.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Opening a Dialogue: Romanticism beyond East and West</span></h2>
               <p>Lu Xun’s reengagement with the past, Soseki’s interiorization of the artistic spirit,
                  Yun’s struggle for freedom and justice—these are responses hauntingly similar to those
                  of English Romantics towards the onset of modernity a century ago during the Enlightenment
                  era. It is no simple coincidence that the three “national” writers of East Asia rigorously
                  employed the literary figures and works of English Romanticism in coming to terms
                  with their experiences of loss and change in the face of radical historical rupture.
                  Yi Zheng, in her study of the modern sublime in Chinese literature, grounds her idea
                  of the “commensurability” between British and Chinese aesthetics of the sublime on
                  a “shared modern history” (3). The three vignettes above suggest that this commensurability
                  may extend to Europe and Asia, West and East. From this broader perspective, we can
                  historically verify that reaction to modernity is an intrinsic part of the literary
                  and cultural phenomenon we know as Romanticism. As Löwy and Sayre argue, “Romanticism
                  is a modern critique of modernity”—that is, “the Romantic view constitutes modernity’s
                  self-criticism” (21). Romanticism is not just <em>against</em> modernity but <em>of</em> modernity, offering a critique of modernity from within modernity itself. As long
                  as modernity retains the capability of self-reflection, Romanticism will continue
                  to be a valid form of cultural critique beyond spatial and temporal boundaries. Thomas
                  Pfau and Robert Mitchell have noted that this element of self-criticism is what makes
                  the conceptualization of Romanticism particularly difficult: “Romanticism’s marked
                  ambivalence and resistance to decisive conceptualization arise from the fact that
                  it simultaneously extends the project of European modernity while offering itself
                  as a sustained critical reflection on that very process” (267). The ambivalence and
                  difficulty of defining Romanticism are certainly exacerbated by exploring its instantiation
                  in multiple forms, circumstances, and articulations of modernity. However, such historically
                  diverse explorations should also offer new possibilities for understanding the complexities
                  and urgencies of Romanticism.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Romantic consciousness of East Asian writers is a product of East Asian modernity.
                     The term “modernization,” along with “Westernization,” is the more customary and perhaps
                     more critically apt way of referring to that historical phase in late nineteenth-
                     and early twentieth-century when Western thought and way of life were quickly saturating
                     and tangibly supplanting the traditional ways of the East. The political and cultural
                     resistance, which we can detect in the three authors above, is symptomatic of an acute
                     sense of asymmetry between West and East in the political agency and cultural influences
                     asserted by the two powers as their histories intertwined ever more closely in the
                     context of global politics and economy. Some critics, like Tani E. Barlow, call Asian
                     modernity “colonial,” which in truth spawns confusion and alarm about the obfuscation
                     between actual and virtual colonialisms, but there is an element of truth in finding
                     the common ground of Asian modernity in the colonial. As suggested by the concept
                     of “semi-colonialism,” used by Lenin and Mao to explain the state of nations, like
                     China, that officially preserved juridical independence but was de facto controlled
                     by Western imperialist powers, the question of coloniality in East Asia is not confined
                     to matters of juridical autonomy.

                              (Barlow 4–5).</span></div>
                     </div> In the case of China and Taiwan, the civil war in mainland China and the eventual
                     separation of the two states were the consequences of severe internal conflicts overdetermined
                     by an ideological war between communism and republicanism—the two mainstays of modern
                     nation-building founded on Western political thought. The more perplexing case would
                     belong to Japan, which had maintained autonomy against European aggression only to
                     be a major contender in the Western imperialist powers’ race toward the acquisition
                     of Asian colonies. Japanese imperialism was heavily grounded on the idea of building
                     “one Asia”—a modern form of Eastern civilization in the likes of modern Europe—thereby
                     marking its difference from and resistance to Western imperialism while ideologically
                     inheriting the expansionist vision. Korea, like other nations colonized by Japan,
                     became a scapegoat of conflicting imperialist interests between East and West and
                     could not separate its process of Westernization from Japan’s colonial projects. Whether
                     Korea’s modernization is indebted to Japanese rule is still under vigorous debate,
                     but it is undeniable that Korean modernity constitutes a prominent part of Asia’s
                     colonial modernity. That the Koreans had to adjust abruptly to the modern nation-state
                     system and resort to the Western notion of national sovereignty for their fight against
                     imperialist aggression is another sign that Asia’s connection to the Western form
                     of modernity is always vexed and double-sided.</p>

                  <p>What becomes clear here is that the Enlightenment project originating in the West
                     had decidedly far-reaching consequences in fulfilling its totalitarian nature across
                     the globe. As Horkheimer and Adorno claim, Enlightenment is inherently totalitarian
                     whereby knowledge is power and “[t]he awakening of the subject is bought with the
                     recognition of power as the principle of all relationships” (5). The form of power
                     relation itself changes as “Enlightenment dissolves away the injustice of the old
                     inequality of unmediated mastery, but at the same time perpetuates it in universal
                     mediation, by relating every existing thing to every other” (8). The notion that unjust
                     power relations are perpetuated by the universal commensurability and conformity of
                     all existing things becomes the philosophical grounds for acknowledging the commensurability
                     between Western and Eastern modernities under the aegis of Enlightenment. What I hope
                     our exploration of English Romanticism in East Asia may suggest is that the Romantic
                     mindset serves as a universally applicable antidote to a totalitarian system of knowledge
                     and power. Romanticism emerges as one form of Enlightenment’s self-criticism, bringing
                     into critical discourse a Kantian insistence on universal hospitality and cosmopolitan
                     right against the aggravation of global wars and colonial violence.

                     exigencies ultimately testifies to the intrinsically historical consciousness of Romanticism.
                     It is the interconnectedness rather than the commonality or homogeneity among diverse
                     forms of modernity and its discontents that should emerge through such a global scope
                     of inquiry. Far from erasing historical differences and local particularities, rethinking
                     East and West and their relationship through the prism of Romanticism will allow us
                     to contemplate the shared <em>and</em> divergent forms, experiences, and questions of modernity.</p>

                  <p>The following collection of essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea is the first
                     attempt to explore English Romanticism in East Asia in a multinational and cross-cultural
                     context. The history of each nation’s reception of English Romanticism has mostly
                     been studied locally in isolated form, and the scope of these studies varies widely
                     for each nation. Japan has the longest history of the literary reception of English
                     Romanticism and the critical investigation of this reception history. The first anthology
                     of English poetry translated into Japanese was published in 1882 under the title <em>Shintai-shisho</em> (<em>New-Style Poetry</em>), which soon after instigated scholarly interest in English Romanticism in Japan.
                     Critical interest in Japan’s reception of English Romantic literature bloomed after
                     World War II, with Matsuura Tohru producing the earliest study on Keats in Japan in
                     1959. Reception studies in Japan have become strikingly popular in the last decade
                     or two, and English publications on the subject have recently been on the rise—Okada
                     on Keats (2006), Clark and Suzuki on Blake (2006), and Vallins et al. on Coleridge
                     (2013). In China, occasional discussions of foreign literature’s impact on Chinese
                     literature began to surface in the 1940s, but a systematic study of reception history
                     did not take off until the late 1990s and has continually been on the rise since the
                     2000s. Leo Lee’s work on the Romantic writers of modern China (1973) has been influential
                     in understanding English Romanticism’s impact on modern China’s political and cultural
                     movements. Taiwan and Korea have come relatively late into the field of reception
                     studies, having yet to produce sustained criticisms on how English Romanticism influenced
                     their respective national literatures.

                  Conference that took place under the theme “Romantic Connections” in June 2014 at
                  the University of Tokyo, Japan. The national and thematic diversity of these papers
                  contributes to a comparative understanding of the different historical and aesthetic

                  arguing that Keats’s poetry provided crucial momentum for the development of “a new
                  phenomenology of landscape through a new mode of seeing.” For the Meiji poets, this
                  meant a turn towards the inner self, which not only inflected their modes of perceiving
                  nature and the outer world but also transformed Japan’s poetic language into a vehicle
                  for a more “real” landscape. According to Gotoh, these epistemological and formal
                  changes reflect the historical transition Japanese poetry underwent in the late nineteenth
                  and early twentieth centuries, when the poets were developing a modern aesthetics
                  by appropriating Western literature as well as recasting the traditional influence
                  of Chinese classics. </p>
               <p>Ou Li’s essay, in contrast, discusses the influence of Keats on the poets of modern
                  China and contextualizes the shifting implication of Keats’s poetics in the tumultuous
                  history of twentieth-century China. The discord between Keats’s so-called escapist
                  aestheticism and China’s violent political and ideological upheavals makes for a particularly
                  complex case of interaction between the original text and its foreign context. Marking
                  the three distinctive stages of Keats’s reception in China, Li demonstrates how Keats
                  continued to affect China’s literary imagination and the making of its modern literature
                  by surviving the oppressive mood of the Mao regime and satisfying the need for a literature
                  that transcends political ideology. Li attributes this tenacious appeal of Keats to
                  the “multi-faceted richness and indeterminacy achieved by his remarkable sympathetic
                  imagination and honesty about the human condition”—something that becomes clear through
                  Keats’s long afterlife on foreign soil. </p>
               <p>In Terence H. W. Shih’s essay, we learn how English Romanticism was transmitted from
                  mainland China to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War between the Communist Party
                  and the Kuomintang and the consequent withdrawal of the latter’s Republic of China
                  to Taiwan in 1949. Following the life and legacy of Hsu Chih-Mo, a.k.a. “the Chinese
                  Shelley,” Shih traces the course in which Percy Shelley’s radical spirit affected
                  Hsu’s poetry and eventually had a wider repercussion through the political and poetic
                  influence that Hsu’s writing exerted on Taiwan’s student movements and campus ballads.
                  The campus ballad is a uniquely Romantic genre of musical songs, which inspired a
                  sense of freedom and national identity in the young people of Taiwan and allowed them
                  an imaginative space of autonomy against a history of colonial rule, the threats of
                  communist China, and the authoritarian regime of the Kuomintang. </p>
               <p>Through the last two essays in this volume, we can compare how modern literary criticism
                  developed under the influence of English Romanticism in Japan and Korea, whose inextricable
                  historical ties prompted interesting connections in their critical histories. Yoshikazu
                  Suzuki’s essay explores early Keats scholarship in Japan through the works of three
                  main scholars: Saito Takeshi, Sato Kiyoshi, and Hinatsu Kohnosuke. Saito set the tone
                  for Keats criticism in Japan with his keen attention to the form and language of Keats’s
                  poetry and a rigorous method of scholarship. While Saito found the significance of
                  Keats’s aesthetics in its humanistic spirit based on Christian ethics, Sato and Hinatsu
                  were more attuned to a critique of national literature through and against Keats.
                  Sato was the more politically conscious of the two, discovering in English Romanticism
                  a love for freedom, which he believed should serve to strengthen the national literature
                  of Japan as the well as the national spirit of the Korean students he was teaching
                  at Keijo Imperial University in occupied Korea. Hinatsu’s national consciousness emerged
                  in a more mediated form through his archaism and a classical style of writing reflecting
                  Keats’s poetic refinement and sensibility. Suzuki notes these three scholars for their
                  significant contributions to building the foundation for Japan’s national consciousness
                  and modern literary studies.</p>
               <p>Suh-Reen Han picks up where Suzuki leaves off, tracing the critical career of Choe
                  Jae-seo, one of the first Korean scholars of English literature who was incidentally
                  a student of Sato Kiyoshi’s at Kyungsung Imperial University (the Korean appellation
                  for Keijo Imperial University). Having inherited his professor’s interest in English
                  Romanticism, Choe worked through the different implications of Romantic aesthetics
                  in the whirlwind of Korea’s modern history. Choe’s perspectives on Romanticism bear
                  the burden of a historical and political consciousness reacting to the turbulent experiences
                  of colonial oppression, totalitarian militarism, and a civil war between North and
                  South. In his struggle to find the voice of a colonized critic, Choe negatively comes
                  across the possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan criticism against the frailty of
                  a creative and critical spirit exposed to political violence. </p>

               the aggressions of the Dutch, Portuguese, and British, and Kant singles out Japan
               for successfully fending off colonial powers by limiting its international relations
