            <p class="noCount">The Chinese poet Hsu Chih-Mo (1897-1931), known as the Chinese Shelley, brought Romantic
               ideas from Britain to modern China. His conviction of liberty was manifested in his
               literary works, alongside his pursuit of true love and social change. This essay employs
               the concept of “Romantic legacies” to revisit Hsu’s Romantic philosophy and Taiwan’s
               Romantic movements. Firstly, the essay examines Hsu’s Romantic legacies. Influenced
               by Bertrand Russell, Thomas Hardy and other British intellectuals, Hsu succeeded to
               Shelley’s Romantic ideas of social justice and love. His journeys to Europe and experience
               of love helped shape and reshape his Romantic philosophy. Secondly, the essay explores
               Hsu’s Romantic ideas and Taiwan’s democratization. Hsu’s literary works, regaining
               significance in the spirit of the Fourth May movement, facilitated Taiwanese youngsters’
               understanding of the significance of independent minds. Hsu’s poetics of liberty was
               introduced to Taiwan and gained popularity, in particular, during the period of campus
               ballads. In brief, the Shelleyan skylark flew from Britain, via modern China, to Taiwan
               and continues singing its songs of idealism.</p>

                     studies at Cambridge University in the early twentieth century. Hsu claimed that he
                     was greatly influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The imagery of Shelley’s “skylark”
                     particularly impressed him, as stated in a letter that Hsu wrote in English to Ogden,
                     his British publisher, dated 2 November 1924: “I am a sincere worshipper of your ethereal
                     Bard of the skylark” (qtd. in Liu 152).

                     In his “Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale,’” Hsu responds to Shelley’s “The Cloud,” “Ode
                     to the West Wind,” and “To a Skylark” and ponders on the symbol of Shelley’s skylark:
                     “as for his ode to the ‘Skylark’ no one knows whether it is the poet that is singing
                     outside the sky or it is the skylark that is singing inside the lines” (285). Hsu’s
                     biographers have recognized his Romantic legacy and named him “the Chinese Shelley.”

                     </div> Hsu enlightened his contemporaries by introducing a Romantic ethos into the early
                     period of the republican China. His concept of liberty was manifested in his pursuit
                     of true love and social justice, together with his literary creations. After the withdrawal
                     of the democratic China to Taiwan in 1949, Taiwan’s “campus ballads” flourished, inheriting
                     the words and spirit of Hsu’s Romantic poetry.</p>

                  <p>Many critics have endeavored to expand Romantic ideas by introducing or connecting
                     such ideas to other periods and regions. “The legacy of Romanticism” has therefore
                     emerged as a key concept in the study of Romanticism. In recent years Michael O’Neill
                     and other critics have explored the legacies of Romanticism in Western literature.

                     </div> As an emerging field in Romantic studies, however, “the legacy of Romanticism” has
                     yet to be sufficiently expanded worldwide. In terms of Romantic connections between
                     Hsu and Shelley, it was Bertrand Russell, together with other twentieth-century English
                     contemporaries, who was greatly influenced by Shelley and instigated Hsu’s interest
                     in English Romanticism. Like a bard, Shelley’s skylark chanted idealism from early
                     nineteenth-century Britain, via modern China, to Taiwan. Such reception of English
                     Romanticism currently echoes those protests for freedom and individualism in some
                     parts of the world under dictatorship. This essay aims to heighten the significance
                     of English Romanticism in East Asia by demonstrating Hsu’s Romantic legacies in modern
                     China and his Shelleyan liberalism revived, in particular, during the period of Taiwan’s
                     campus ballads.</p>

                     late period, the decaying empire, the Ching Dynasty, was invaded by the “Eight-Nation
                     Alliance,” including Russia, Germany, France, the United States, Japan, Austria, Italy,
                     and Britain. This ill-reputed shame forced the imperial court to recognize the significance
                     of understanding the West, including its science, language and culture. Language education
                     was the key point for the royal court in cultivating experts in foreign languages
                     and translations. In such a political context, English training enabled Hsu to go
                     abroad, supported by his father, a successful merchant, first to the United States
                     for a BA degree in history at Clark University, Massachusetts, in 1918 and afterwards
                     for an MA in economics and politics at Columbia University in 1919.

                              Group, which also consisted of E. M. Forster (novelist), Ludwig Wittgenstein (German
                              philosopher), John Keynes (economist), Rupert Brooke (poet), and Augustus John (artist).

                     newspaper articles and public lectures. The liberation of the mind was Hsu’s first
                     concern as a stepping-stone for social reforms. His overseas experience was what majorly

                  <p>Russell’s philosophy was what mainly facilitated Hsu’s enthusiasm for English Romanticism.
                     Impressed by Russell’s fame, Hsu gave up an admission offer from Columbia University
                     for doctoral research, and instead, without his father’s approval, Hsu sought supervision
                     from Russell in England, as stated in Hsu’s Chinese prose entitled “All the Cambridge
                     I Know”: “As for studies, I came to Britain to follow Russell” (36).

                     London in 1920, Hsu was told that Russell was away in China. Russell’s post as professor
                     was suspended by Cambridge University as a result of his anti-war advocacy during
                     the First World War. Nevertheless, Hsu’s understanding of Romantic literature and
                     ideas was increasingly reinforced during his life in Britain, where he was accepted
                     as a special student at London School of Economics in 1920 and later at Cambridge
                     in 1921. Hsu might have been familiar with Russell’s philosophy during his studies
                     in the United States, although there is no other written evidence in Hsu’s works.
                     That possibility would explain Hsu’s eagerness to go to Britain to follow Russell.</p>

                  <p>Shelley’s philosophy may also have been passed on, via Russell’s works, to the young
                     Hsu. In fact, Shelley had left a deep impression on Russell, as evidenced in the following
                     quotation: <span class="quote">‘Shelley was a wonderful discovery. . . . I couldn’t understand how grown-up people,
                        who admired Shakespeare and Milton could fail to care about Shelley. I got a passionate
                        love of him—more than for any one I knew. (Qtd. in Leithauser 34)’</span> While Shelley’s socialism and atheism were unconventional, these radical ideas spread
                     widely and influenced later European intellectuals, including Russell, Karl Marx and
                     George Bernard Shaw.

                     </div> Despite his ambivalence towards the Romantic movement, Russell affirmed that Shelley
                     was an unconventional Romantic particularly in the realm of the human mind (Leithauser
                     32). Influenced by Shelley’s atheism, Russell continued to challenge Christianity
                     and the legitimacy of religion in his early lecture “Why I Am Not a Christian: An
                     Examination of the God-Idea.” Echoing Shelley’s atheistic philosophy, Russell eventually
                     rejects religion and endorses science for a better world, as stated in the lecture:
                     “Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. . . . Science can help
                     us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations”
                     (596).

                     and “The Death of My Grandmother.” Hsu clearly expresses his “body-mind” philosophy
                     in “The Death of My Grandmother”: <span class="quote">‘Scientists say that the consciousness and aspiration merely work with the nervous
                        system. . . . [T]he body is for the sake of function, and [the consciousness] becomes
                        void without the body. [The concept of] the soul is a big lie told by religionists.

                     </div> and Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) are the two British intellectuals and writers who particularly
                     shared their Romantic ideas with Hsu and somewhat strengthened his understanding of
                     Shelley’s philosophy. Hsu met Dickinson in his early days in London and arranged to
                     see Hardy during his second journey from China to England. These two Englishmen enlightened
                     the young poet in the realm of English literature, including Shelley’s poems. In his
                     “All the Cambridge I Know,” Hsu mentions his first encounter with and later befriending
                     of Dickinson, who was then a fellow at King’s College, Cambridge: “I had fooled around
                     at LSE, London, for half a year. Feeling no way out and thinking of another way [for
                     visiting studies], [in 1921] I met Mr Dickinson, . . . a noted author whom I earlier
                     admired due to two of his pamphlets—‘Letters from John Chinaman’ and ‘A Modern Symposium’”
                     (36–37). Dickinson’s understanding of Shelley’s philosophy and poetry is revealed
                     in his edition of Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. Shelley’s philosophy of liberty against political oppression in <em>Prometheus Unbound </em>strengthened Dickinson’s pacifism, which was an anti-war belief held by the Dickinson
                     circle, inclusive of Russell, during World War I. The circle’s pacifism echoes Hsu’s
                     humanitarianism exhibited particularly during his journey, via Russia, to Europe.

               </div>
               <p>Hardy is another influential man of letters who led Hsu to further explore Romantic
                  ideas. In his essay entitled “An Afternoon of Visiting Hardy,” Hsu describes “the
                  impressive magic of the arts” in Romantic poets, such as Keats, Shelley and Wordsworth,
                  and his perusal of Hardy’s works (155). In 1922 the meeting between the young Hsu
                  (aged 25) and the elderly Hardy (aged 82), although less than an hour, was arranged
                  by Hsu’s first English friend, Dickinson: “Thanks to Mr Dickinson’s assistance in
                  England last July, I surprisingly met this old hero” (155). Similar to Russell’s and
                  Dickinson’s enthusiasm for Shelley, Hardy’s interest in Shelley was recognised in
                  Hsu’s article: “On the wall were hung Hardy’s portrait . . . and Shelley’s portrait
                  on the other side. I seem to remember a thick edition of Shelley laid on the bookshelf. . . .
                  I was wondering why on earth the old fellow loved Shelley so much. These two are not
                  kindred spirits at all” (157). Hsu admired both Hardy and Shelley, but he found these
                  two English writers expressing their thoughts very differently up until his later
                  reflection on their philosophies. In his “Appendix 2: Hardy’s Pessimism,” Hsu employs
                  the concept of “fixed mindset” to reassess the general public’s claim of “Hardy as
                  a pessimist”: “Hardy never wrote Jude [<em>Jude the Obscure</em>] to prove his pessimism, simply as Shelley [n]ever consciously advocated ‘Romanticism’
                  or ‘naturalism.’ We may well listen to his own defence” (166). While his lines still
                  suggest that Hardy and Shelley are “not kindred spirits at all,” Hsu worships Shelley
                  and Hardy equally. For Hsu, Shelley and Hardy are heroes without a “fixed mindset,”
                  which Hsu regards as “a foe of the arts, as well as an obstacle to thought” (166).
                  In “Appendix 2: Sketches on Hardy’s Works,” Hsu particularly demonstrates Hardy’s
                  literary revolts against the Victorian culture (163). Hardy wrote a poem entitled
                  “Shelley’s Skylark” to honour Shelley as an influential poet whose idealism inspired
                  him: “For it [the skylark] inspired a bard to win / Ecstatic heights in thought and
                  rhyme” (23–24). Among Hardy critics, Roland A. Dueksen earlier acknowledged same viewpoints
                  in the “social and religious beliefs” of Hardy and Shelley (161). Harold Bloom also
                  finds strong similarities between the two poets: “Hardy’s Shelley is very close to
                  the most central of Shelleys, the visionary skeptic. . . . for they both told truths”
                  (22). In his elegy for Hardy, entitled “Hardy,” Hsu writes that Hardy’s critical words
                  towards idealism are like “hot spice to the mouth” (12) but “[h]e loves genuineness
                  [and] mercy” (26).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Aside from the British writers’ influences on the young poet, Hsu’s European journeys
                     nourished him in developing a Romantic mind. Hsu travelled from the Continent back
                     to China, from the grave to the bay, and mentally from science to the arts. His love
                     for the world was not formed from a single thread. In his “Chekhov’s Graveyard,” Hsu
                     writes about experiencing a tremendous circle of great men and women and recognizing
                     the lively mind in meditation, “not being enslaved by sentiments” (184). In addition

                              her ill condition. He even wrote an elegy in memory of the lovely writer.</span></div>

                     visits to Shelley’s and Keats’s graves in Rome (181–82). Hsu paid homage to Shelley
                     and Keats, and Hsu’s admiration is equally evident in his translations of their works,
                     which include Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale” and Shelley’s “The Skylark.” Their pure
                     idealism had already been discussed in Hsu’s 1924 prose essay “John Keats’s ‘Ode to
                     a Nightingale,’” part of which is Hsu’s own translation of Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale.”
                     In this essay, Hsu particularly mentions his accidental connection to Western literature:
                     “As for me, literature was originally not my expertise, and my limited knowledge of
                     literature was ‘mastered by none’” (286). A number of poets and novelists, as well
                     as their works, are also mentioned in this essay. In addition to Keats, they include
                     Wordsworth, Shakespeare, Shelley, Goethe, Stevenson, Plato, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy,
                     Baudelaire, and Rousseau. Among these great men of letters, major Romantics are all
                     admired by the young poet.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Among Romantic ideas, Shelley’s concept of love particularly impressed Hsu. Echoing
                     Shelley’s philosophy, Hsu put emphasis upon the necessity of true love and fought
                     against patriarchal authorities. His personal marriage and philosophy of love received
                     harsh criticism from the public. As in Shelley’s case, Hsu’s unorthodox marriages
                     led him to ponder over the autonomy of the mind towards love. The drama in Hsu’s life
                     resulted from his pursuit of not only political, but philosophical liberty. Hsu reluctantly
                     married his first wife, Chang Yiu-Yu,

                     influence on the development of Romanticism in Taiwan. His poetry relating to liberty
                     had already been recognized in early China (i.e. modern China prior to communist dominance)
                     and introduced to Taiwan as a genre of “modern poetry” by the government of the Republic
                     of China (1912–), ruled by the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang (KMT).

                     by Hsu and his contemporaries, called the May Fourth Movement, dates back to 1919,
                     when the First World War had just ended and Chinese student-led protesters went on

                     of the Enlightenment’s rationalism, “the thought of the May Fourth [Movement] alludes
                     explicitly to Romanticism” (H. Chang 35). The intellectuals have noted the complicated
                     nature of the May Fourth, relating it to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and Romanticism,
                     which in a sense upheld the legacy of the former two while reassessing them.

               <p>The influence of Hsu-led Romantic movements on Taiwan’s new wave of democracy did
                  not launch until the KMT authority came into power in Taiwan. Despite Hsu’s early
                  death (at the age of 34), his literary works and philosophy of liberty were distributed
                  by his academic fellows who withdrew to Taiwan with the nationalist troops. Hu Shih
                  (1891–1962) was one of the major fellows in this list, acting as one of the leaders
                  during the New Culture Movement. He integrated his study of Western philosophy into
                  his PhD thesis, under John Dewey’s supervision, and then worked as chancellor of Peking
                  University. In fact, it was Hu who invited Hsu to teach poetry part-time at Peking.
                  As a librarian at Peking University, Mao Tze-Dong—later famous as Chair Mao in communist
                  China—was attracted to Hsu and sat on his lecture at the university. The intellectual
                  connections of Chinese celebrities in the nation’s modern history became an emerging
                  power in cultivating the newborn China.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The idealism for social reforms, in the Romantic vein, in fact, transcended ideological
                     boundaries as it was inherited not only by democratic Taiwan but also by communist
                     China. Under the Romantic ethos of liberty and equality, the Chinese communists led
                     passionate youngsters and the economically lower class (mainly farmers) in a bid to
                     establish another republican country—the People’s Republic of China. Very different
                     from Hsu’s non-violent assertions, as seen throughout his work, Communist actions
                     derived from political radicalism and were subject to violence. Romantic thinkers
                     had originally aimed to overturn a malfunctioning society or system, but history has
                     revealed that social upheaval is a necessity after a violent action or revolution.
                     This double-edged sword of Romanticism had been seen earlier in the French Revolution
                     and later in the Mao-led Chinese Cultural Revolution, which caused a great loss of
                     Chinese heritages during its ten years (1966–76). Unlike the non-violent literary
                     movement and pacifism that Shelley, Russell and Hsu supported, the destructive radicalism
                     during the Chinese Culture Revolution repeated the history of France’s socio-political
                     turmoil after the French Revolution and under the Napoleonic regime.

                     to demonstrate their liberal thoughts via songs. Without any contamination by commercial
                     interests, the composers and performers of campus ballads created their own songs

                     of campus ballads and asserted that the period of ballads in Taiwan’s early history
                     was simply constructed by Chiang Kai-Shek’s KMT government, namely based on a political

                     readers to a romantic dreamland where it is picturesque and the lifestyle is carefree.
                     For Hsu himself, Cambridge is also a place that strengthened his connection with Romantic
                     thoughts. A soap opera entitled <em>April Rhapsody</em>, released in Taiwan in 2000, further brought its viewers closer to Hsu and Cambridge.

                     on his melancholy, and the poem ends in a sentimental tone: “Silently I was gone,

                     Hsu further illustrates his love of nature and the liberty of the mind. For Hsu, Cambridge
                     is his spiritual homeland: “After the departure of more than three years, Cambridge,
                     who understands my melancholy and homesickness?” (“All the Cambridge I Know” 48).

               <p>The two other famous campus ballads that derive from Hsu’s poems, “Hap” and “Struggles
                  for Springtime Between Plum Blossoms and Snow Flakes,” instigate distinct sentiments.
                  The former depicts a mysterious encounter with a stranger at sea, and the latter a
                  winter landscape that conceals the poet’s remorse for a massacre. During the period
                  of campus ballads, undergraduate students composed soft melodies to illuminate Hsu’s
                  poetics of liberty in nature, love and truth. The word “Hap,” my translation of the
                  original title which in Chinese means “coincidence” or “chance,” can be linked to
                  Hardy’s “Hap.” Due to his admiration for Hardy as well as his works, Hsu expresses
                  a sentimental vein in the poem. Hsu had earlier acknowledged that his “snobbishness
                  of hero worship” (155) in wanting to meet Hardy and other celebrities was the main
                  reason for his “sentimental journey” in Europe: “Last year I came to Europe on a completely
                  ‘sentimental journey;’ . . . I was keen to meet [other heroes and] Britain’s Hardy,
                  but I only met Hardy” (“An Afternoon of Visiting Hardy” 156). After the short meeting,
                  Hsu analysed Hardy’s pessimism and later even wrote an epitaph for the poet, entitled
                  “Hardy.” It begins, “Hardy, pessimistic, inactive, / This time no more complaints,
                  / A shadow is folding his eyes? / Gone, he will no longer show his face” (1–4). Echoing
                  Hardy’s “pessimism,” Hsu expresses a similar sentiment at the opening of the poem
                  “Hap”:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">I am a piece of cloud in the sky,</div>
                     <div class="l">Occasionally, reflected on your ripples.</div>
                     <div class="l">You need not feel stunned</div>
                     <div class="l">And even cheerful.</div>
                     <div class="l">It will be all gone in a moment. (1–5)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The cloud imagery is reminiscent of not only Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a
                  Cloud” and Shelley’s “The Cloud” but also works of Chinese literature where the cloud
                  refers to a carefree mind without any earthly pursuit. Nevertheless, Hsu’s “Hap” suggests
                  uncertainty. In the poem, the narrator is the “cloud” (1) and occasionally experiences
                  a loving relationship with a stranger—a persona of the water, which is revealed in
                  the “ripples” (2). The imagery of ripples suggests the excitement of the stranger
                  who is attracted to the narrator. The narrator, however, reminds the stranger not
                  to “feel stunned [a]nd even cheerful” (3–4). The difference between the sky and the
                  earth suggests the unblessed relationship between the cloud and the water. This dynamic
                  mind, like floating clouds, is also described at the very beginning of Hsu’s prose
                  essay “Self Anatomy”: “I am a dynamic person. The moment my body moves, my thought
                  seems to jump with it” (80).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hsu’s writing tends to reveal his Romantic mind—that is, the mind ought to remain
                     liberal and independent. In “Hap,” the narrator keeps the mind completely independent
                     of any influence in a tempting relationship. Similar to Shelley’s Romantic thought
                     toward free love, Hsu’s love affairs with women reflect his dynamic philosophy. As
                     told in the last part of the poem, only the very moment matters:
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">You and I met at sea on a dark night.</div>
                           <div class="l">You had your own; I had my own—direction. </div>
                           <div class="l">Fine if you remember; you had better forget</div>
                           <div class="l">The very moment of mutual ignition. (“Hap” 6–9)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> In the sentimental tune of this ballad, the singer Chelsia Chan’s touching voice
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note34" id="Note34_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> successfully instigates the listener’s desire to be true to oneself. The “ignition”
                     (9) is symbolic of the speaker’s affection for the stranger, but the speaker reminds
                     the stranger not to make the occasional encounter disturb the mind, regardless of
                     positive or negative feelings. The autonomous mind echoes Hsu’s poetics of liberty.
                     In other words, this non-political poem conveys Hsu’s philosophy in a bid to seek
                     an independent self. The essence of the autonomous mind, Hsu suggests, applies to
                     his views against political conformity. While he seems to express pessimism and uncertainty
                     throughout the poem, Hsu follows Hardy’s philosophy to demonstrate every aspect of
                     life and, like Hardy, rejects classification as a pessimist.

                     </div> This autonomy of the mind is resonant with the lamp metaphor for Romanticism in M.
                     H. Abrams’s <em>The Mirror and the Lamp</em>. The speaker in the poem is the lamp reminding the stranger not to be a mere reflection
                     or follower, represented by the imagery of the water or mirror, and instead to cultivate
                     an independent mind or identity to illuminate the world. During the age of the campus
                     ballads, the young listeners of this song “Hap” had been encouraged to think and love
                     independently. The song, along with Hsu’s “notorious” romance, to some extent had
                     led the youth to Romantic individualism and liberalism. The women listeners, in particular,
                     sensed what Hsu significantly conveyed his philosophy of free love and how a woman
                     should educate herself to be independent, financially and emotionally.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Echoing this sentimental vein, Hsu’s poem “Struggles for Springtime Between Plum Blossoms
                     and Snow Flakes” contrasts the redness of plum blossoms and the whiteness of snowflakes
                     to etch a poignant moment in the modern history of Taiwan. In the poem Hsu expresses
                     remorse for the dead, particularly an innocent boy of thirteen, sacrificed in a social
                     movement that took place on 18 March 1926. The date was to remember the “318 Massacre.”
                     That Hsu’s poem relates to this incident is evidenced in the subtitle of the poem,
                     “In Memory of 318.”

                     </div> Social activists, including students and workers, gathered at Tiananmen Square, Beijing,
                     and demanded that the interim Chinese government abolish all unfair treaties mutually
                     signed by the Ching Dynasty and foreign alliances. For Hsu, the red blossoms buried
                     in the white snow represent the deadly scene in which the protestors died in the coldest
                     winter, during the Chinese New Year. This struggle, revealed in the title, illustrates
                     the hot-blooded protest and cold-blooded oppression. At the opening of the poem, the
                     poet only refers to the narrator’s journey to visit the blossom season on a snowy
                     day without any clue of the incident: “One day in the South over Chinese New Year,
                     it snowed very hard. / I travelled to Mt. Ling to find tidings of spring plum blossoms”
                     (1–2). Adapted from the poem, the campus ballad accurately conveys the imagery in
                     Hsu’s lyrical lines by means of the singer’s crystal voice and the melancholy melody.
                     The singer Bao Mei-Sheng’s voice

                     </div> reminds the listener of the melancholy of the skylark, imagery Shelley employed to
                     disseminate liberty across the land. During her undergraduate studies in history at
                     National Taiwan University, Bao knew well about the massacre and appeared to act as
                     Shelley’s skylark in singing the song of liberty. This song ultimately reflects on
                     the poet’s sympathies with uncertainty in life and the limitation of liberty. The
                     poet’s attempt in the poem does not become tangible until the “boy of thirteen” is
                     revealed at the very end of the poem: “But the plum blossoms are the hot blood of
                     a boy of thirteen” (8).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hsu Chih-Mo is symbolic of Shelley’s skylark singing Romantic songs throughout early
                     China and Taiwan. In modern times, Hsu was a leading Romantic who had introduced the
                     Western concept of liberty to early China through his poetics. Romantic ideas, politically
                     and literally, enchanted Hsu, and this ethos was widely disseminated throughout China
                     particularly during the May Fourth Movement. Hsu and Shelley sought fundamental change
                     in both society and literature. For them such a change begins and ends in the mind.
                     In the history of Taiwan’s Romanticism, Hsu’s literary works were valued as gentle
                     strength against any authorities that oppressed the human mind. Despite his inclination
                     to the left for socio-political reforms, Hsu’s works were still recognized by early
                     Taiwanese authorities, particularly during the Chiang regime or the period of martial
                     laws in Taiwan. The power of words is soft, as Hsu puts it in his prose entitled “Words.”
                     When Hsu’s Romantic ideas were later passed on to Taiwan’s campus ballads. The pursuit
                     of truth, love, hope and beauty in the students’ hearts inevitably resulted in the
                     growth of liberalism. Even in the twenty-first century, this Romantic spirit continues
                     to carry weight against the political oppression that plagues some countries or regions.
                     The “Jasmine Revolution,” namely the Tunisian Revolution, has taken effect globally,
                     including South Asia and other parts of North Africa. Recently such thought has spread
                     to Taiwan and Hong Kong in student-led social movements for political reforms. Many
                     today would still find strength in Hsu’s call for a fundamental reformation of the
                     mind in the spirit of idealistic “love, liberty and beauty” (A-Gan 227–28).

               Japanese colony yielded by the Ching Dynasty. After their defeat in the Civil Wars
               with the Chinese communists in 1949, the R.O.C. authorities lost all power in Mainland
               China and ended up governing Taiwan’s main island and a few neighbouring isles. With
               the abrupt rise of communist China in the world, alongside the emergence of Taiwanese
               people’s national identity and Taiwan’s democratization, the name of Taiwan has increasingly
               replaced the nation’s official name—the Republic of China. Taiwan’s official name
               has gradually become undermined and the country has been known to the world as Taiwan
               since 1971. Chiang Kai-Shek, the then President of Taiwan, rejected two Chinese states
               (the other being the People’s Republic of China) together becoming members of the
               United Nations. After that, communist China has taken over the legitimate claim as
               “China.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               government originally attempted to close down two major magazines that advocated anti-government
               ideas and later two local chief politicians, including Yu Deng-Fa, were accused of
               their inclination to communism. On the International Human Rights Day, dated 10 December,
               members of the major anti-government magazine entitled <em>Formosa Magazine</em> therefore launched a series of outspoken speeches on democracy and liberty, which
               unfortunately led to mayhem and later a massive protest around the island. Most of
               the “chief” members were eventually jailed and, after the withdrawal of the martial
               law in 1986, they formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), continuing to challenge
               the authority. The incident is claimed as a crucial event for Taiwan’s democratization,
               but the contributions of those political dissidents and the DPP to Taiwan remain controversial,
               owing to their protests full of violence and bloodshed, as well as their failure to
