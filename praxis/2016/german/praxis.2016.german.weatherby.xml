        <p rend="noCount">This article links E.T.A Hoffmann's prose to the neglected Enlightenment university discipline <emph>Technologie</emph> as invented by the polymath Johann Beckmann. The connection between narrative and technology occurs not at the level of symbols or in diegesis but in the manipulation of form, which had consequences for the construal of life outside the constraints of emergent disciplines like medicine, forensic psychology, and the changing institution of the police. Narrative prose came to occupy the position of that police, producing the object of its own analysis—society—with intent to alter it. </p>

        <p>When one Daniel Schmolling, following a notion that he could not rid himself of, murdered his erstwhile consort Henriette Lehne outside the
          Hasenheide in Berlin in 1818, the Berlin court system’s forensic efforts failed to find a motive. Schmolling admitted the deed, describing
          the first occurrence of the idea of the murder three weeks before its execution. It was not a passionate act, seemed to benefit him neither
          financially nor emotionally. The doctor called on to examine the criminal, Merzdorff, pronounced Schmolling incapable of standing trial on
          the basis of a diagnosis then much in vogue: <emph>amentia occulta</emph>, or “hidden insanity,” articulated by the famous anthropologist
          Ernst Platner. The case was placed on the docket of E.T.A. Hoffmann, criminal judge for the superior court [<emph>Kammergericht</emph>].
          Hoffmann’s interest in strange and occult psychological phenomena is well known, the fact that he also played a significant role in the
          legal order of the Prussian state in a time of upheaval perhaps less so.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Mangold.
          </note> Schmolling’s case brought Hoffmann’s two professional personae into uncomfortable proximity<note place="foot" resp="editors"> His
            letter to his publisher Kunz of 24 May 1815, written from the courtroom, attests to his usual sanguinity on this issue (<emph>Sämtliche
              Werke</emph> 6:70–72). Translations from Hoffmann are mine unless otherwise noted.</note>, and he produced a lengthy rejection of
          Merzdorff’s diagnosis, leading his longtime friend and fellow criminal judge Julius Eduard Hitzig to state that he had overstepped his
          bounds. Hoffmann maintained that while there could theoretically be invisible insanity, it could not play a role in the law, writing:
        <quote>In the first place it should be noted that the actual field in which the doctor’s science moves, namely the knowledge
            [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] of the physical human organism, certainly does not in and of itself also cover the psychic organism, but instead
          knowledge [<emph>Erkenntnis</emph>] of this principle of spirit, insofar as it is possible, would have to be based on completely different
          premises. For this reason, Kant assigned the investigation of the state of the mind [<emph>Gemütszustand</emph>] entirely to the
          philosophical faculty . . . [w]hereas Metzger, Reil and Hoffbauer object primarily because a doctor who has a general philosophical
          education, such as is only appropriate for a court doctor, can more easily obtain the knowledge [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] necessary for him to
          judge derangements of the spirit [<emph>Geisteszerrüttungen</emph>], than the philosopher can assimilate the knowledge
            [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] of medical doctrines and necessary for the same purpose, as well as the needed skill in investigation, which
          latter the doctor gains through therapeutic practice. (<emph>Sämtliche Werke</emph> 6.699)</quote>
        What Schmolling’s case presents is a conflict between the philosophical and medical faculties in the form of a judicial problem. Hoffmann
          is already flaunting his knowledge of contemporary psychological literature<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hoffmann’s extraordinary
            knowledge of this field was first gained during his years in Bamberg (1808–13), which are also the years immediately preceding the
            beginning of his literary output, starting in 1814. See Segebrecht.</note>—Johann Christian Reil was a favorite, although Hoffmann here
          takes issue with his Germanification of <emph>amentia occulta</emph> as “<emph>Wut ohne Verkehrtheit</emph>” [<emph>rage without
            dementia</emph>]. Reil was both dean of the medical faculty at the new Humboldt University and slowly gaining administrative oversight of
          medical institutions throughout Prussia. His duties moved in the realm of what was then still called “<emph>medizinische Polizei</emph>,”
          the branch of administration of the state that applied health policies (in Reil’s case, especially military hospitals). Hoffmann displayed
          no hesitancy in rejecting the medical opinion of the man who had coined the term “psychiatry,” and whose clinical work was at the cutting
            edge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On Reil, see Richards 252–89.</note> Hoffmann had cited precisely the impediment to the
          development of a scientific psychiatry: Immanuel Kant. Kant’s insistence that the sciences be based on mathematical demonstration stalled
          and shifted the emergence of psychology and biology in particular (Kant 4:468).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the rehabilitation of
            psychology and the new wave of altered Kantianism following the works of Herbart, see Lenoir, “Operationalizing Kant.” See also Lenoir’s
              <emph>The Strategy of Life </emph>and Richards on Kant’s disputed role in the founding of biology. </note> His epochal <emph>Conflict of
            the Faculties </emph>(1798), which defends the philosophical faculty as the intellectual and institutional heart of the university,
          confronts the “pure reason” of that faculty with its less rational sister faculties. The legal and religious faculties, tied as they are to
          the functioning of the state, cannot guide reason—rather <emph>vice versa</emph>. But when it comes to the medical faculty, Kant pulls his
          punch, describing the collegial problematics arising from Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland’s <emph>The Art of Extending Human Life </emph>(1797),
          and recommending a series of dietetic measures to maintain “life-force” in the aging body. Hufeland, like Reil involved in the policing of
          medicine at the beginning of the nineteenth century in Prussia, posited a life-force that could be maintained and strengthened through
          vigilance. The problem that had driven so much of Kant’s monumental output—the body-soul problem—did not even appear. Precisely this
          difficult relationship would need to be judged—for Hoffmann, was being judged incorrectly—in criminal investigations. In appealing to Kant,
          Hoffmann is referring to the framework of the <emph>Conflict</emph> as expressed in the <emph>Anthropology</emph>: 
        <quote>Thus if someone deliberately perpetrates some harm and now the question is, whether and how he is guilty, and thus first it must be
          decided, whether he was crazy at the time or not, then the court cannot send him to the medical faculty, but instead (because of the
          incompetence of the court) to the philosophical faculty. For the question: whether the accused, at the time of his deed, in possession of
          his natural faculties of understanding and judging, is completely psychological, and even if the bodily derangement of the organs of its
          soul [<emph>körperliche Verschrobenheit der Seelenorganen</emph>] could perhaps sometimes be the cause of an unnatural infringement of the
          law of duty (which resides in each human), still the doctors and physiologists are not at all yet so far as to be able to grasp the machine
          in the human [<emph>Maschinenwesen im Menschen</emph>] deeply enough to explain the impulse [<emph>Anwandlung</emph>] to such a gruesome
          deed, or (without bodily anatomy) to predict it; and a <emph>legal medical doctrine </emph>(<emph>medicina forensis</emph>)—if it comes to
          the question, whether the mind of the criminal [<emph>Täter</emph>] in a crazed state, or has taken a decision with a healthy
          understanding—would be meddling in the business of others, of which the judge understands nothing, and can at most refer it to another
          faculty, since it does not belong to his forum. (Kant 7: 213-14)</quote>
        Hoffmann cites Kant as an authority to ward off Merzdorff and the other doctors. His decision, however, flies in the face of Kant’s
          rejection of legal expertise on the mind-body problem. For Hoffmann, the judge must do what psychiatry cannot yet do, and what the
          philosophical faculty in any case cannot be trusted to do: psychiatric forensics. The assumptions of the court were as simple as the
          verdict: without evidence, no insanity plea; lacking which, Schmolling was guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he
          murdered another inmate. He was beheaded on 30 May 1825 (Haack 87).</p>
        <p> The case provided one of the models for Georg Büchner’s <emph>Woyzek</emph>, and one might be forgiven for not recognizing Hoffmann in the
          writing of the decision. His literary works have become a cipher for the fantastic, the unconscious, the pre-Freudian and Romantic
          engagement with demonic, magical themes, and the new technologies associated with them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> E.g. magic
            lanterns (Schmitz-Emans), automatic orchestras (Dolan); and human-simulating automata (Barkhoff 204). This angle has been explored by
            Kittler and also Andriopoulos (105–39). Cf. Gaderer 83. </note> The Schmolling case throws into relief a problem that runs throughout the
          literature on Hoffmann: namely, the question of disciplinary knowledge in his fictional output. Given his insistence on a liberal model of
          legal subjectivity—maintained, as we shall see, at the expense of his political position after 1819—it would be less than satisfying to cast
          fictional autonomy as a screen onto which Hoffmann’s massive learning is merely projected without consequence. In what follows, I argue that
          the problem of social administration and construction dovetails in Hoffmann’s work with that of what was a university discipline around
          1800, with the name <emph>Technologie</emph>. A branch of economics devoted to knowledge and administration of production, this discipline
          related to so-called “police science”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On literature and the police, seen through Schiller’s fragment for a

          Hoffmann’s fiction engages. I argue that narrative itself takes on the theoretical tasks of this “technological” administrative science, a
          shift that both adumbrates the difficulties of avant-garde aesthetics and calls for a reading of Hoffmann that reflects the ambition to
          diagnose the historical condition of society and provide a narrative space for the possibility of alternate syntheses of its apparent
          forward march. Underlying the epistemological effects of the fantastic and medial complications of technical artefacts is a disciplinary
          affinity that Hoffmann’s fiction intervenes in,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Excellent readings of media as representational strategy,
            rather than as content, can be found in Lehleiter and Liebrand. Liebrand speaks of a turn from a “negative aesthetic” in which life and
            poetry can only annihilate one another to a “positive” aesthetic of mediations. I would only specify that this later aesthetic has the
            disciplinary ambition of a historical “technology,” meaning that Hoffmann is closer to Novalis’s “logarithmization” of the world than
            Liebrand will allow (10).</note> reflecting the transformation of state and society that provided the context of the end of his life. The
          argument here extends a line of thinking begun by Friedrich Kittler and Dorothea von Mücke. Hoffmann’s narration, as I show on the example
          of <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>, deploys its trademark doppelgängers, automata, and uncanny effects as lures, to focus the
          imagination on the historical situation, and to free the faculties of the mind from the apparent necessities of the same.<note place="foot"

        <p>Kant’s description of the impossibility of forensic medicine depends on the incompleteness—impossibility of completeness—of anatomical
          knowledge of the “machine” that is the human body. The problem is that the connection between acts of will and the derangement
            [<emph>Verschrobenheit</emph>] of the “organs of the soul” cannot be clarified by the court. Only a philosopher should be assigned this
          task. The outer edge of psychology—the embodied mind—must be policed, albeit by the Humanities. Hoffmann agreed, although he assigned
          himself as judge—and as author—of this task. If there was a police for medicine, then there would have to be some way to regulate
          psychological judgments as well. Even if he overstepped in the Schmolling case, Hoffmann accepted the charge Kant had left open, in the name
          not of a university discipline but of cultural production. Fiction would need to do what, ultimately, even the philosophical faculty could
          not. </p>
        <p>Hoffmann’s <emph>Serapion-Brethren</emph> (1819–21) is a four-volume collection of stories of all kinds. The novellas, fairy tales, horror
          stories, and even a proto-detective novel are held together by a fictional salon, modeled on Hoffmann’s real-life group, the
            <emph>Seraphinenorden</emph>, which had included such figures as Hitzig, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, and Adalbert Chamisso. The
          salon-frame, in which the friends discuss the merits of the stories they tell each other, operates as irony in the sense Friedrich Schlegel
          had given to that term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Brown 51.</note> Following an opening frame discussion of the failures of most
          salons, the group of friends listens to Cyprian (likely modeled on Chamisso) narrate the life of a bureaucrat from an unnamed contemporary
          German town. Cyprian claims to have discovered this well-bred and educated man, who had disappeared some years before, living as a hermit
          with the conviction that he is the ancient Christian martyr Serapion, granted eternal life following his virtuous death. Cyprian makes
          inquiries, discovers the history of the bureaucrat, and, wanting to cure the “cheerful insanity” [<emph>heiterer Wahnsinn</emph>] of the
          anachorete, reads up on contemporary psychology—especially in the works of Phillippe Pinel and Reil. In order to disabuse Serapion of his
            <emph>idée fixe</emph> (which functions, if less violently, like that of Schmolling), Cyprian learns how to approach the patient
          delicately. His attempt fails. Serapion not only rejects the notion that he is the bureaucrat from the nearby town, but also engages Cyprian
          in a disquisition about the nature of perception, the reality of time and space, and the “duplicity of all being.” Cyprian’s friends are
          horrified, especially Lothar, who rejects the tale as irrational and terrifying. But after Theodor recounts the story of <emph>Counsel
            Krespel</emph>,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Hamilton 185–95.</note> Lothar recants, describing Serapion as the principle of
          poetry. The source of the story does not matter, he says, rather only that one should have “really seen” what one recounts:
        <quote>More! I honor Serapion’s insanity because only the spirit most excellent or rather the true poet can be seized by it . .
          . Whence comes it then, that some poetic work, which we would not at all call bad, if we are talking about form and execution
            [<emph>Ausarbeitung</emph>], remains nevertheless still as without effect as a faded image, that we are not transported by it, that the
          splendor of the words only serves to multiply the inner chill that runs through us. What other explanation, than that the poet has not
          really seen [<emph>nicht . . . wirklich schaute</emph>] what he speaks of, that the deed, the event [<emph>Begebenheit</emph>], depicting
          itself before his eyes, with pleasure, with all the horror, with all the exultation, with all the shudders, did not enthuse him, set him on
          fire, so that the inner flames might simply flow out in fiery words: in vain the labor of the poet, to bring us to believe in what he
          himself does not, because he has not himself truly viewed it [<emph>weil er es nicht erschaute</emph>]. What could the figures
            [<emph>Gestalten</emph>] of such a poet, who, according to the old saying, is not also a true seer, be, other than false dolls,
          laboriously glued together from heterogeneous materials!—Your hermit, my Cyprian, was a true poet, had really saw that [<emph>er hatte das
            wirklich geschaut</emph>] which he pronounced, and that is why his speech gripped both heart and mind [<emph>Gemüt</emph>].—Poor Serapion,
          what was your insanity other than that some hostile star had robbed you of the knowledge of that duplicity, by which in fact our earthly
          being is alone conditioned. [<emph>Duplizität . . . von der eigentlich allein unser irdisches Sein bedingt ist.</emph>] (4.67–68). </quote>

          had been adopted as a narrative principle some half a century before by Christian Friedrich von Blankenburg, whose insistence on the
          adjective <emph>anschauend</emph> for the genre of the novel sometimes takes on comical proportions (such as in the construction
            <emph>anschauendst</emph>).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> E.g. “Rezension über “Die Leiden des jungen Werthers,” in Mandelkow 65–86,
            here 84. </note> Indeed, the remainder of Lothar’s speech seems to follow the Blankenburg model, too, which insists on maintaining a
          complex notion of causality of events as filtered through the subject/object divide (the “duplicity of all earthly being”):
        <quote>There is an inner world and the spiritual force, to view it in full clarity, in the most complete brilliance of the most
          lively life, but it is our earthly lot, that just this outer world, in which we are inserted,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Or
            “encapsulated”—on the lack of manuscript clarity between “eingeschachtet” and “eingeschachelt,” see Brown 49–50. </note> functions as the
          lever that sets that force moving [<emph>als der Hebel wirkt, der jene Kraft in Bewegung setzt</emph>]. The inner appearances are absorbed
            [<emph>gehen auf</emph>] in the circle which the outer ones form around us, the circle the spirit can only pass by in dark secretive
          presentiments which never form themselves into a distinct image [<emph>die sich nie zum deutlichen Bilde gestalten</emph>]. But you, o my
          hermit, established no outer world [<emph>statuiertest keine Außenwelt</emph>], you did not see the hidden lever, the force influencing your
          inner world; and if you claimed, with ghastly acuity, that it is only the spirit that sees, hears, feels, that grasps deeds and events, and
          that thus everything that it recognizes has also thus happened, you forgot that the external world forces the spirit banished into the body
          to those functions of perception arbitrarily. Your life, dear anachorete, was a constant dream, from which you in your beyond certainly did
          not painfully awake.—(4:68–69). </quote>
          Outer impressions, Lothar tells his friends, form a circle that engulfs the inner impressions in everyday life; but if, like Serapion, we do not “establish an outer world,” we may reach an extension of internal images that are not merely “internal” but instead do not suffer from the duplicity of our intellect. It is the unfolding of such images that makes up the Serapiontic principle, the discovery of a phenomenological form that underlies the causality of realist prose, and in this sense is supradisciplinary. Literature does what law cannot. Lothar is here recombining the elements of Cyprian’s narrative, doing precisely what the principle rejects: summarizing as a discursive construct that which has been set before our eyes as narrative content. Thus Blankenburg’s notion of penetrating the relationship between the images and events of lived life could not be further from the Romantic
          principle, which collapses that external causality and thereby suspends the theory of the novel in favor of a different philosophy of
          history. Lothar’s theory of fiction also demands the extension of eidetic content in the interest of narrative framing, but rejects tying
          this framing to any mimicking of “earthly being,” or the finitude of the human intellect. Crucially, Lothar thinks that this means that
          Serapion dreams life, or takes the events of the spirit, which alone hears, sees, and feels, for “actual events.” This is in keeping with
          the usual sense of Hoffmann’s work: the “fantastic” is a suspension of reason, the opening of a playful space of dark and technological
          fantasies, the creation of those unnoticed, perhaps even unnoticeable, relations in the psyche that would later come to be demystified by
          Freud. But this reading comes up short.</p>
        <p>In fact, Lothar misreads Cyprian and therefore Serapion, because he retains for narrative the difference between “external events” and the
          “dream” or “insanity” that allows them to be recombined in narrative. For Serapion—and, I would suggest, for Hoffmann—the notion of
          “external event” or <emph>Begebenheit</emph> cannot recur, because this would be the <emph>reinscription of an external world</emph>, and
          therefore a violation of the principle itself. Narrative simply does not respect the “inner/outer” distinction, and aims instead at an
          arrangement of elements that “never form themselves into a distinct image.” What can never be imagined is the interface between the inner
          and the outer, and this applies to text and knowledge equally. If the narrative does not respect this difference, but never allows for a
          fully distinct image of the interface, then it is precisely where the image fails that the epistemic effects of the narrative begin to work.
          Causality cannot form narrative because causes are half-conceptual, but images provide something other than themselves, some excess that is
          neither “inner” nor “outer” but instead a <emph>sui generis </emph>“knowledge.” This narrative becomes a singular engagement with an object,
          because that object is produced <emph>in this singular way for the first time</emph> in narrative, and the narrative stands to redound on
          the object itself, changing it. This production obscures the abstraction “object” and allows the poetic production to have an
          unrepresentable interface with whatever noumenon stands behind the abstraction. In other words, the Serapiontic principle creates a poetic
          site of production. Lothar’s statement, which is a compromise of aesthetic principles in the ongoing conversation of the brethren, is a step
          back from Cyprian’s more radical—and, I want to argue, more fundamental—sense of the search for an arrangement of narrated elements that, as
          Lothar himself puts it, “never form themselves into a distinct image.” Formation is not restricted to the visualization-techniques of the
          narrative, opening a separate and mixed-mode epistemic layer in the telling. We can see this in two exemplary stories from the cycle:
            <emph>The Automata</emph>, and <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>.</p>
        <p>The protagonists of E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <emph>The Automata</emph> (published in 1814, later included in the <emph>Serapion Brethren</emph>)
          find themselves at a crucial point in the narrative discussing the uncanny presentation of automatic music they have just heard at the
          laboratory of one Professor X. The story, which recounts Ferdinand’s subjection to a form of demonic power—we never learn whether it is machinic,
          psychopathological, or both—follows an encounter with a fictional alternate of Wolfgang von Kempelen’s famous “chess-playing Turk.” For
          Ferdinand, his compatriot Ludwig, and the intradiegetic polite society, the automaton is an oracle. It predicts that Ferdinand will, like
          Orpheus, lose the love he is obsessed with upon one last sighting of her. The prediction, of course, turns out to be true, although it
          appears to fulfill itself, using Ferdinand’s unhealthy fascination as the motor of its simultaneously fantastical and social causality. The
          episode with Professor X, however, presents the reader with a discussion of the principle of the narrative by those caught in the same
          narrative, which in turn is a mirroring of the generic ploy of the <emph>Serapion Brethren</emph>, in that the tales illustrate the
          principles of their discussion even as those principles are interrogated on the continuing presentation of new areas of exploration
          (genres). The sequence of scenes involving Professor X, then, reads as a <emph>mise-en-abîme</emph>. The “Serapiontic principle” is both the
          content and the genre of the larger collection and <emph>The Automata</emph>. </p>
        <p>The arc of the episode with Professor X is as follows: the inquirers Ferdinand and Ludwig visit the professor and listen to his various
          musical automata; a discussion of what human music is follows; the protagonists then hear what they take to be a pure example of this—a
          small girl singing in the grass—only to see Professor X smiling terrifyingly behind her, walking through the garden and apparently
          enlivening the plant-life around him as he goes. In this last moment, the narrator is silent. It is not suggested that the girl is an
          automaton: the professor’s presence suggests instead the inability to determine the difference between human and machine music. </p>
        <p>The difference at issue in the discussion falls in the middle of the episode. Ferdinand, who is the object of the oracular and tragic
          narrative, listens to his skeptical friend Ludwig detail what he confirms are their common objections to the professor’s presentation. The
          problem is that the music is too good. It sounds like it possesses the spirit that only a human touch should produce. Ludwig grasps at the
          opposite end of the contradiction: when music played by humans is not imbued with passion, we call it “mechanical”; what should we do when
          actually mechanical music sounds human? 
        <quote>To want to have musical effects through valves, springs, levers, cylinders and whatever else belongs to the mechanical apparatus, is
            <emph>the nonsensical attempt</emph> to achieve <emph>through means alone</emph> that which [the organs of the body] can carry out, only
          enlivened through the inner force of the mind [<emph>Gemüt</emph>] and regulated in their smallest movements by that very force. (4:419; my
          emphasis) </quote>
        It is literally “senseless” to allow “means alone” to complete tasks that only the truly human soul should be capable of. It is not their
          material characteristics but their connection to the “inner force” of the spirit that separate bodily organs from mere instruments. Ludwig
          sharpens his polemic, grasping for a difference between organs and machines, and opens Hoffmann’s story onto a vast conceptual problematic
          that ties the narrative back to the overall project:
        <quote>The striving of the machinists, increasingly <emph>to imitate </emph>[<emph>nachahmen</emph>] <emph>or through mechanical means to replace
            human organs</emph> that produce musical tones, is for me a declaration of war against the spiritual principle, the power of which only
          more brilliantly triumphs, the more apparent forces are opposed to it. (4:420–21) </quote>
        Mechanical mimesis of the capacities of human organs is war against the “spirit,” and human organs are the expression of a cosmological
          harmony that our petty inventions and instruments merely mimic. Thus:
        <quote>In that ur-period of the human race, when it—to use the words of an ingenious author (Schubert in the “Views from the Night-Side of Natural
          Science”), lived in its first holy harmony with nature, filled with the divine instinct of prophecy and poetry [<emph>Dichtkunst</emph>],
          when the human spirit did not capture nature, but instead nature the spirit, and the mother still nourished from the depth of her being the
          delightful creature she had borne, there she surrounded the human like in the wafting of an eternal ecstasy with holy music, and wonderful
          tones [<emph>Laute</emph>] announced the secrets of her eternal pulsing [<emph>Treiben</emph>] (4:421)</quote>
        The music of the spheres describes the original undifferentiated state of humans and nature, in a passage cited and transcribed from
          Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert’s <emph>Views from the Night-Side of Natural Science </emph>(1808).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
            Schmitz-Emans, “Naturspekulation” and Barkhoff 213 ff. and 209. </note>
        </p>
        <p> Schubert’s <emph>Views</emph>, originally a series of lectures delivered in 1808, starts with the premise that only a full history of the
          human relation to nature can complete the scientific picture. The necessary elements of that history are the primordial unity of man and
          nature, an account of the split and the collateral epistemic effects of that split, and the principled possibility of a re-unification. The
          “night-side” of that history comprises strange moments of possible reconciliation, especially those associated with Mesmer and animal
          magnetism. Schubert’s conviction is cast in terms of the organs that Hoffmann draws on for his <emph>Automata</emph>:
        <quote>Usually that which happens according to a necessary law of nature unites in it that particular perfection, autonomy and purposiveness that
          is particular to nature in all its workings. We seldom find that the natural drive is subject to illusions or mistakes
            [<emph>Misgriff</emph>], but in a certain way the will is. We must regard the things that exercise such an artificial drive
            [<emph>Kunsttrieb</emph>] or instinct as immediate organs of nature, which individuals subordinate the more to themselves the less perfect
          they are (28).</quote>
        Organs are immediate expressions of harmony. But <emph>we</emph> are not organs, because the will—and rational activity—are somehow severed
          from this connection: “If at that time the human was an organ of nature, then he was this in his way,—human” (29). The separation from
          animals—who, for Schelling, Schubert’s teacher, possess the “artificial drive” [<emph>Kunsttrieb</emph>]—goes by way of fault. The notion of
          the human as “the being of lack” [<emph>Mängelwesen</emph>] has its <emph>locus classicus</emph> in Schubert’s other guiding light, Johann
          Gottfried Herder. Here, however, the lack suggests eventual reconciliation with the higher order: humans are organs of nature, just like
          animals, but the disconnect between their literal organs and their will (subject to judicial discipline for Kant as for Hoffmann) makes them
          open to the development of more organs. But Hoffmann derives more than the notion of “nature-music” or a fundamental harmony from Schubert.
          It is clear that Ludwig’s insistence on the difference between organs and instruments cannot be maintained; <emph>Geist</emph> seems turned,
          in the <emph>mise-en-abîme</emph> conversation, against both external mechanical devices and the harmonious organs of the body, in
          cooperation with which the spirit produces illusions, tricks—misfires. The mesmeric doctrine will suggest the development of alternate
          organs among these, but the problem will persist. The specificity of sense-perception and the generality of both reason and the will bind
          the human to the earthly being Hoffmann calls “duplicitous.” </p>
        <p> The citation of Schubert in the context of the discussion of instruments is a moment of high narrative irony, for it refers us back to the
          principle that supposedly drives the narrative. When Cyprian had approached Serapion to disabuse him of his illusions, he had offered to
          show the anachorete the town he hailed from, in which he had been a member of the administration. Cyprian thought to convince the hermit
          merely by mentioning the presence of the town, a mere two hours away. Serapion’s response reveals the radicality of the principle: if
          Cyprian’s reason dictates that that past be taken as real event, why cannot Serapion’s version of things be equally valid? At the limit, why
          should either the duration of time (some fifteen centuries) or distance from the town prove anything to Serapion? 
        <quote>Indeed, what hears, what sees, what feels in us?—perhaps the dead machines, which we call eye—ear—hand etc., and not the spirit?—Does the
          spirit perhaps form its world, conditioned by space and time, internally, on its own account, and then leave those functions to another
          principle that dwells within us?—How absurd! If it is thus the spirit alone, that grasps the events before us, then that which it recognizes
          also really happened. (4:34)</quote>
        Organs, in other words, are in conflict with the form-giving principle of spirit, which cannot be divided between inner and outer. Like the
          specific eidetic content of the story <emph>The Automata</emph>—Ferdinand’s love, the prophecy, its uncertain but all-too-real
          fulfillment—the reports of the external organs are in conflict with the overarching constructive principle of the spirit, or by analogy the
          construction of narrative. This conflict is what creates the irony of <emph>The Automata</emph> as part of the <emph>Serapion</emph>-cycle.
          Hoffmann’s narrative does not resolve its issue; the Serapiontic principle is not meant to do that. The report from the letter to Ludwig
          cannot be trusted, especially as Professor X has never left town—Ferdinand cannot have seen him elsewhere. The uncanny effect is that the
          prophecy is fulfilled, though whether through Ferdinand’s obsession, the magnetic powers of Professor X, or some combination, we do not
          know. The conflict between content and narrative logic can only be solved by causal suggestions, turns of story or of understanding—whether
          intradiegetically or in the frame-discussions—that provide clues to the <emph>Gestalt</emph> of the narrative space. Hoffmann frustrates
          this expectation, and inscribes this frustration as the very principle of the cycle. In other words, he has deranged our organs, made
          visible (<emph>anschauend</emph>) the very conflict between empirical experience and the rational container that grasps it. The <emph>idée
            fixe</emph>—that one could be a centuries-dead martyr, that one must murder one’s love—is, for Hoffmann, a matter of attention and thrall.
          One falls into a kind of hypnosis to an idea of no apparent origin, but the will is bound to it.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> cf.
            Hoffmann 6:421. </note> This derangement cuts both ways: it is a failure of our disciplined minds and a reminder of the ultimate falsity
          of disciplinary knowledge. But the bracketing of space and time, the flirtation with the obsession of fixed ideas, simply underscore
          Serapion’s ability to present excellent novellas to Cyprian. It is not merely this ironic bracketing of duality that Hoffmann’s narration
          aims at. In fact, this is merely the Serapiontic principle in its radical version, the version Lothar misrecognizes but cannot suppress. The
          space of this narrative is then itself trained on different objects, in order to study the historical situation and perform variations of
          it, in order to let some light into the rush to social control that Hoffmann was observing and participating in during his collection and
          composition of the cycle. </p>

        <head>3. From the Police to Technology: Semantics and Social History</head>
        <p>The last market vignette in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <emph>My Cousin’s Corner Window</emph> consists of a fight that breaks out in the observed
          crowd. The ailing cousin and the “I” in the dialogue look on as this threat of violence gets the attention of the police, who cannot push
          through the crowd in time to stop the fight, like an ambulance in rush hour. A kind of ekphrasis follows: the aggressor stands, his hand
          raised and ready to strike. The gaze of the narrative’s observers lingers on this image. But the man does not strike, the crowd intervenes,
          and by the time the police arrive, the incident is already over. The “I” remarks:
        <quote>The fight is over—without the help of the police . . . so there in fact reigns in the people a sense for the conservation of order
            [<emph>ein Sinn für die zu erhaltende Ordnung</emph>]. (6:493)</quote>
        To which the invalid replies:
        <quote><emph>The cousin</emph>: My dear cousin, my observations of the market have above all strengthened me in the opinion that a strange change
          has occurred with the people of Berlin since that unfortunate period when a bold, boisterous enemy flooded over the country and in vain
          attempted to suppress its spirit, which soon sprung up again with renewed force like a violently coiled spring. In a word: the people has
          gained in external propriety [<emph>Sittlichkeit</emph>] . . . (6:494)</quote>
        Order was once preserved by the police, and is now conferred as a task on citizens. The transfer of <emph>Ordnungssinn</emph> has a
          historical event as its proximate cause, namely the German and French skirmishes that began with the First Revolutionary War, and ended with
          Napoleon’s defeat—but not before he had ended the Holy Roman Empire and introduced widely differing and semi-autonomous overhauls of its of
          civil and administrative legal core. Maybe the cousin’s story here is too simple: the late Enlightenment states were already in the process
          of modernizing their law books when Goethe observed the siege of Mainz in 1793. But the cousin pinpoints an issue that is central to the
          shift that was still dramatically in process when E.T.A. Hoffmann took up his position as judge in the high criminal court in Berlin in
          1814/15. As the sole locale of the holistic representation of large-scale historical and population-level processes and as a site of
          intervention into them, Hoffmann’s narrative inherits the task of adminstrating the social. Or in other words, narrative does what the
          police were expected to do at the close of the <emph>Corner Window</emph>. It engages just in the moment of that ekphrasis, and is the
          potential site of the material production of value. Narrative replaces the police.</p>
        <p>It was the police who frustrated any possible happiness at the end of Hoffmann’s life. The liberal radicalism that led to Karl Ludwig
          Sand’s assassination of Kotzebue on 23 March 1819 included the celebratory burning of conservative books at the so-called
            <emph>Wartburg-Fest</emph> in 1817. Among these books was the <emph>General Codex for the Gendarmerie</emph> of Karl Albert von Kamptz,
          Director of the Ministry of Police.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Safranski 457. </note> It was Kamptz who would later bring
          Hoffmann to grief after he was viciously parodied in Hoffmann’s <emph>Master Flea</emph>, Kamptz who would surreptitiously receive
          correspondence about that work that indicated Hoffmann understood he had cited from court records, Kamptz who would attempt to have Hoffmann
          removed from the bench, a fate he likely escaped only by dying in 1822, while the accusations were still being evaluated. Kamptz’s work,
          however, has an informative title: he is writing about the behavior of policemen, or what we today call the “police.” Hoffmann follows this
          usage, too. This term was, as the repressive tactics of Metternich’s <emph>Vormärz</emph> settled on the German-speaking lands in the 1820s,
          in flux. It had once named a grander administrative effort that, as we have seen above, included medicine, care for the poor, and nutrition.
            <emph>Polizei</emph> was in fact simply the administration of the welfare of the subjects of the king, and it was only as state and
          society became analytically separated after 1800<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stolleis puts the beginning of this separation process at
            around 1750, which indicates that the scientific literature on police was already a part of this transformation (379).</note> that the
          term slowly reduced itself to the personnel, the policeman, the embodied potential violence at the base of every possible state apparatus.
          These shifts in conception and practice of state administration were front and center when Hoffmann was appointed, on 16 September 1819, to
          the <emph>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</emph>, a body established to handle the political cases against the new radicals
            (<emph>Demagogen</emph>)<emph>.</emph> Hoffmann agreed to this appointment, but was skeptical, and held a line between deeds and attitudes
          that fits nicely into our contemporary notions of democratic liberalism, whether German or American. He insisted, crucially, on the
          innocence of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, founder of the athletics movement called the <emph>Turnbewegung</emph>, and finally won, against Kamptz,
          Jahn’s freedom. Jahn then sued Kamptz for libel, and Hoffmann accepted the trial. An auction of authority began, with those attempting to
          quash the trial extending upward to chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg, the influential liberal reformer. Hoffmann stood his ground: his
          brief was subject only to the will of the king, and no one else could be excepted from standing before the law. This explains Kamptz’s zeal
          in pursuing the censorship case, but it also provides us with a window onto Hoffmann’s lived experience of the shifting ground of state
          politics in the German-speaking lands at the crucial moment after Napoleon’s defeat. Jahn in particular and the “demogogues” in general have
          been taken to be a model of Serapion, whose cheerful insanity thus takes on a political overtone, a matter for the psychological
            police.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Safranski, Hoffmann assigns fiction the unrestrained inner world, thus formulating an
            apolitical but otherwise free <emph>citoyen</emph>-as-hermit, and a policeable world of external deeds (469–71). I think the two are
            re-integrated in fiction, which thus bears on social construction in a way individual disciplines cannot.</note>
        </p>
        <p> We need to know what the “police” means, how its practice as an institution and university discipline in the Enlightened monarchy bears on
          the dissolution of that monarchy itself, to see that Hoffmann’s judicial practice in no way debars Serapiontic realities, that in fact the
          fiction is meant to think through, or rather put <emph>ante oculos</emph>, the potential encapsulated in the very social transformation of
          the early nineteenth century. And this was simultaneously a matter of those organs of perception and machine function that figured the
          Seraptionic principle in <emph>The Automata</emph> and those organs of administration called <emph>Polizei</emph> and
            <emph>Technologie</emph>. In other words, what drives Hoffmann’s narrative technique is the simultaneous collapse of Enlightened monarchy
          and its social-administrative efforts, and the rise of the factory system through means those administrative efforts had originally
          developed. </p>
        <p> One central branch of that administration, so long as it was not conceived of as separate from society, was called <emph>Polizei</emph>.
          The term <emph>police</emph>, as we use it today to mean the institution, activity, and especially the persons carrying out the function, is
          a narrow precipitate from a much larger discipline that existed throughout Europe from roughly the fifteenth century to the end of the
          eighteenth. The Grimm dictionary traces its evolving meaning chronologically. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries,
            <emph>polizey</emph> meant “government, administration and order, especially a kind of oversight of moral in state and community
            [<emph>staat und gemeinde</emph>].” Derived from <emph>policy</emph> and usually combined in the compound <emph>gute policey</emph>, the
          administrative efforts of the police were not separated from the state itself—they were, in fact, merely the morally controlled organization
          of that state and community. The phrase <emph>staat und gemeinde</emph> is telling: “<emph>und</emph>” collapses what the modern reader
          instinctively takes as two separate notions into a single area for police operation. Until deep into the eighteenth century one could speak
          of a “police state,” replaced only slowly in the early nineteenth century with the so-called <emph>Rechtsstaat</emph>, often traced
          intellectually to Wilhelm von Humboldt’s <emph>Ideas for an Attempt to Determine the Limits of the Efficacy of the State</emph> (1792).<note
            place="foot" resp="editors"> See Stolleis 385, where Wilhelm von Humboldt’s famous writing on the limits of state power of 1792 is
            characterized as the heart of the new liberalism, although early and “removed from reality.” </note>
          <emph>Polizeistaat</emph> shares with our current notion of a “police state” the totalizing continuity of state and society, the
          intervention of the government to make the single object state/society “better.” But that is where the similarity ends. Images of repressive
          police violence, state rhetorics of control and order, bear little resemblance to the “<emph>ordnung</emph>” in the Grimms’ definition. That
          order was in fact of a different kind, an attempt to produce happiness [<emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>] in the state/society through the
          administration of land, production, roads, the poor and the sick. Thus the baroque second definition of the Grimms:</p>
        <quote>
          <hi rend="bold">a)</hi> <emph>in the most general sense </emph>polizei <emph>is the care of the state or of a community organization (under direction of the
              state) for the general welfare by means of authoritative force; it divides according to extent and area of operation into</emph> a state
            or national police, community or local police (city, village, rural police), administrative, welfare, security, health police, street,
            construction <emph>etc</emph>.: the police has as its goal the comfortable life of the members of the state. 
        </quote>
        <p>Only after this list do we learn of any material definition of the police: “<hi rend="bold">b) </hi>the organs of the police service, the
          police agency, and the local office of the same.” For all these areas of life to be administered, to be brought into order, often even to be
          produced in the first place, more than a bureaucracy is needed. One needs information, which in turn requires a whole discipline, in and out
          of the university, relying, as Michel Foucault has emphasized, on statistics. The Grimms describe what was known as
            <emph>Polizeiwissenschaft</emph> as a term that was still being contested (“<emph>noch heute ein vielumstrittener begriff</emph>”). The
          concept was perhaps contested, but its reality cannot be. After the establishment of two university chairs for the discipline in Prussia in
          1727, professors of “police science” began to pop up all over the German map, including in the imperial capital in Vienna in 1752, where
          Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi was appointed in that year. His <emph>Fundamentals of Police Science </emph>(1756) became the standard
          reference in the field. The contested territory, even as it was established, was a matter of producing knowledge for the king’s
          administration (thus fitting within the proto-economic discipline called “cameralism”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An extensive
            literature on this phenomenon exists. See especially Tribe, Foucault, and Wakefield, who argues that the reality of the cameralist society
            was “disordered” compared to its propaganda—my argument here, however, is precisely about the norms of that propaganda. </note>). Justi
          wrote: 
        <quote>Police science consists . . . in recognition of how from the contemporary state of the common weal clever measures are to be taken, in
          order to obtain and increase the general ability of the state in its internal constitution, and to make this ability ever more serviceable
          and useful, as much in the whole as in all its parts [<emph>sowohl nach seinem Zusammenhange, als in allen seinen Theilen</emph>], for the
          promotion of the community’s well-being [<emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>]. </quote>
        Police science is nothing more or less than the internal affairs of the state. Justi does not separate the object about which the science
          knows and the knowledge the science produces. As Foucault has argued, the main instrument of the science is statistics, or “the state’s
          knowledge of the state” (<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 315). The production of new personnel for administration is a major
          goal, and Justi writes of “useful citizens [<emph>nützliche Bürger</emph>]”(15 ff.) The vocational training that police was to arrange
          reveals the complex of power and knowledge that Foucault articulates. Per Justi: 
        <quote><emph>One must take care that the subjects possess such capacities and qualities and are kept in this discipline
            </emph>[<emph>Zucht</emph>]<emph> and order, </emph>as is required <emph>by the goal of the community’s happiness
            </emph>[<emph>gemeinschaftliche Glückseligkeit</emph>] . . . (14)</quote>
       Knowledge and production, even of humans, are one and the same. As Keith Tribe and Pasquale Pasquino have emphasized, Enlightenment state
          theory is based on this utter formability of its objects.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Tribe 8–32; and Pasquino 42–73.</note> The
          production of vocation-oriented humans is what Foucault calls “discipline,” one part of the emergent regime he will dub “biopower,” or the
          population-level care to make live where once the sovereign had the power to make die (<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 321
            ff.).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Foucault, <emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph>, p. 321 ff.</note> Adminstrative techniques
          that treat the general at the level of its generality are epitomized by the other side of the police (<emph>Society</emph> 246), as in
          Reil’s administration of military hospitals, the care for the poor, and population-level nutritional policy. The object of the police,
          Foucault writes, is “everything from being to well-being [<emph>bien-être</emph>].”(<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 328). The
          police are meant to produce <emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>, the well-faring of the people. </p>
        <p> As Michael Stolleis has pointed out, Justi’s <emph>Grundsätze</emph> were written in Theresian Vienna, and he would shortly thereafter
          move to Prussia, where his subsequent writings accorded much more freedom to the <emph>Gewerbe</emph> of his definition above (380–81). This
          is only the beginning of a much larger shift, for even as state and society were slowly isolated as polar terms, the administrative
          “catch-all” of police science<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Stolleis, <emph>Policeywissenschaft</emph> is “<emph>ein breites
              Auffangbecken für alle Wissenschaften und Techniken zu dienen, die sich als ‚Verwaltungslehren’ verstanden</emph>” (378).</note> was
          split between these new entities. The “police” (now a civil service and its servants) remained a state concern<note place="foot"
            resp="editors"> As Frison points out, the police lost centrality just as Smithian concerns gained prominence (146). </note> along with
          finance and statecraft, while “<emph>Privatökonomie</emph>” slowly migrated to a social concern. Among the administrative or police sciences
          that became associated, fatefully, with society rather than state was something called “<emph>Technologie</emph>” (379).<note place="foot"
            resp="editors"> “<emph>Technologie</emph>” is here defined as “<emph>die Wissenschaft von der Entfaltung gesellschaftlicher

              <emph>Polizei</emph>.</note></p>
        <p> Johann Beckmann was appointed to a professorship of economy in Göttingen in 1766, and it was his writings that would become most
          associated with the new discipline <emph>Technologie</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The coinage belongs to Christian Wolff,
            although Beckmann was the first to teach and thereby expand the sense of the term. For an account of Beckmann’s tumultuous arrival in
            Göttingen, see Wakefield 75–79. The full background is given by Troitzsch.</note> His commentary in the third edition of Justi’s
            <emph>Grundsätze</emph> (1782) already shows the shift in interest: “I call police the science of governing the various enterprises
          according to the intent of the state” (6).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Johann Beckmann, <emph>Anleitung zur Technologie, oder zur
              Kenntnis der Handwerke, Fabriken und Manufakturen, vornehmlich derer, die mit der Landwirthschaft, Polizey und Cameralwissenschaft in

          extensively on industry, and included <emph>Manufakturen und Fabriken</emph> as a rubric of police science. But as the police dwindled and
          the new state emerged, so too a new discipline, bearing a remarkable resemblance in its instruments (statistics) and goals (production of
          knowledge for administration) arose. Technology—for this, as Seibicke notes, was the only meaning of the word current at the time—spread
          quickly through the university system. As it became separated from the state, it slowly emerged as a branch of the new political economy
          focused on the instruments of production and their use, and thus eventually on machines.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Frison,
            “Foundation of Technology,” and Günther Bayerl, “<emph>Die Anfänge der Technikgeschichte bei Johann Beckmann und Johann Heinrich Moritz

              zur Gegenwart</emph>, Kassel, 2007, pp. 13–35.</note> The works of Andrew Ure and Charles Babbage in the 1820s and 30s would soon set a
          standard for gathering of statistics and non-judicial, enterprise-oriented oversight of factory production. Anyone who has read Marx’s
            <emph>Capital</emph> can see that this genre of observation adumbrated the rationalization of the Second Industrial Revolution. Marx still
          uses “technology” in this sense: the knowledge of production for the purpose of regulating that production.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            > See Leo Marx, “Technology.”</note>
        </p>
        <p> For Beckmann, and to a large extent for Hoffmann, the body of knowledge for the regulation of production was not yet firmly associated
          with “society” in isolation from the state: 
        <quote>Technology is the science that teaches the working-up of naturalia, or the knowledge [<emph>Kenntniß</emph>] of handiwork. Instead of what
          happens in the workshops, where they direct one to follow the precepts and habits of the master in order to produce commodities, technology
          gives the fundamental guidance [<emph>Anleitung</emph>], in systematic order, how one, for just this purpose, should explain and use the
          phenomena appearing in work through true fundamental propositions and trustworthy experiences. (17) </quote>
        Technology acts where persons cannot; it is the systematic and comprehensive treatment of human material making (excluding the fine arts),
          replacing the “historical” discipline of <emph>Kunstgeschichte</emph> (not art history, but the history of crafts) (18). The Enlightenment
          derivation of the theory is strong, as Beckmann relies on Diderot and Christian Wolff, and especially on Linnaeus, with whom he had studied
          in Uppsala: 
        <quote><emph>Linnaeus</emph> said: I classify the animals according to the composition of their bodies, and thus I give the human a place among
          the mammals. Now do those who derisively throw before him the excellence of the human soul-forces above the so-called instincts of the other
          animals refute him, he, who knows those forces of soul so much better than many of his opponents? (21)</quote>
        Beckmann defends the Linnaean roughness and artificiality of his breakdown of the arts (in order of the “more respected to the less”).
          Other disciplines could classify humans as non-animals, and perhaps the arts could be seen from another perspective than that of the police.
          But the production of this disciplinary knowledge is meant for use, just as Diderot’s <emph>Encyclopedia </emph>was. Thus disciplinary
          knowledge is well-suited to guide practice, since it is general enough to account for larger unities of that practice, while specific enough
          to change it. The “forces of the soul” are also the limitations that necessitate the taxonomic approach in the first place. What makes us
          human makes us technological, able to create material things intentionally (<emph>techne</emph>) while limited to our invention of
          instruments for that making. The administration and potential rationalization of that making is the object of a police-adjacent university
          discipline: technology. </p>
        <p>Technology is both a science and an enterprise, but it is not handiwork:
        <quote>But the sciences, at least in these times, belong to the enterprises [<emph>Gewerben</emph>]. Their objects are like the noble metals,
          often worked over; sometimes counterfeited [<emph>verfälscht</emph>], sometimes re-purified [<emph>wieder geläutert</emph>], and thus put a
          whole mass of humans to work and profit. And the former lose nothing hereby of their dignity, just as little as gold stops being gold, let
          it be worked over or alloyed [<emph>legire es</emph>] by anyone. The sciences do not, however, therefore becomes handiwork, even if they,
          like handiwork, are enterprises . . . (5)</quote>
        This passage reinforces Frison’s conclusion that “[<emph>t</emph>]<emph>echnologie</emph> would treat its own problems from a utilitarian
          point of view and could therefore be defined as a scientific study of the use-values related to production” (145).<note place="foot"
            resp="editors"> Frison compares Linnaeus’s and Beckmann’s notions of oeconomia, focusing on use-values in both biology and technology,
            without, however, taking account of Beckmann’s university context in biology in Göttingen (148–54).</note> But Beckmann also produces a
          fascinating conception of disciplinarity in relation to <emph>techne</emph>. Making is the process of forming raw materials into finished
          products (3–4). Doing this work with a view to livelihood [<emph>Unterhalt</emph>] is an enterprise [<emph>Gewerbe</emph>]. The skill-based,
          rational making of artefacts for use is called “handiwork” [<emph>Handwerk</emph>], which is separated from “art” [<emph>Kunst</emph>].
          Handiwork is of many kinds, and consists of a series of different kinds of twists, like tropes, turns of a sometimes literal screw that do
          away with the natural body, just as rhetorical tropes do away with the naturalness of the concept (Beckmann 1806 465-66).
            <emph>Techne</emph> is still divorced from its product, semantically, and refers to the making, even could be applied to the enterprise of
          science (this is true of <emph>Technologie</emph> itself, which requires technique but is not an “art”). But the “polish” that
            <emph>Technologie</emph> puts on its object is put on no object at all: it is “polishing” a social process, and thus <emph>intervening in
            the production of use-values</emph> with a battery of “twists” that one can put on raw material. Linnaeus’s artificial system is here
          applied to <emph>artificialia</emph>, producing a kind of logical abyss that adumbrates the problem of a morphology of technology, as Ernst
          Kapp and Gilbert Simondon would develop only much later. Here is not the place to elaborate a full rhetoric of Beckmannian technology. But
          this intervention by way of scientific and statistical aggregation in the process of production surely went the way of social and not state
          intervention. But the project of constructing the very society that became the field of play for that very “free enterprise” fell, as the
          police became a merely repressive apparatus, to poetry. In other words, fiction inherited a social-administrative task that, when Hoffmann
          died, was just beginning to be enduringly associated with machines. A great deal of writing on Hoffmann thinks through the problem of
          technology in terms of a static object (technological artefacts) gaining increasing independence from their human creators. To be sure,
          Hoffmann thematizes this problem, one that dogged philosophers and poets throughout the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            > I have been unable to find a significant use of any term with the root <emph>techn-</emph> in Hoffmann’s works. </note> The automaton
          Olympia in <emph>The Sandman</emph> has been canonized as the principle allegory of this problematic. And yet more than this is going on,
          for Hoffmann died in 1822, and did not see the wild outgrowth of factories that used humans as tools rather than the other way around. Nor
          is Hoffmann focused on abstract questions of human rights, good forms of government, and so forth, rather instead on the space between those
          things, the very social arena which would eventually welcome the terms <emph>Technik</emph>, technology, or the French
            <emph>technologie</emph>. And it is this determination of the fictional space that suggests a deeper affinity between his fiction
            and <emph>Technologie</emph>, the exploration of the failure of sovereignty to control the market through control of
            production. <emph>Technologie</emph> disappears as a term even as the instance of monarchy fades. It is replaced with <emph>Technik</emph>
          and the sovereign-less space of “market” capitalism increases. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Schatzberg. </note> This privatization
          of “technological” social regulation is precisely what Hoffmann produces in his fiction. That fiction cannot replace sovereignty, nor can it
          directly slow or alter the course of that dialectical shift in instrumentality, from our use of tools to our becoming-tool. But it can
          present that space as the rule of <emph>Anschaulichkeit</emph>, as the basis for and the substance of the “polishing” of the work of
          production. Here, imagination is no longer reflection on alternate orders of things, but the direct viewing of <emph>this</emph> order in
          its contingency, in its possibility as another order. And by divulging this rule as intuition, Hoffmann produces the Serapiontic principle
          as the technology of literature, neither spinning in a void of the imaginary nor bogged down in a tribunal of precision in an attempt to
          imitate nature, but instead exploiting its distance from that very nature (here, the social) to construct the nature of the social itself.
          We thus see that literature and technology are not merely in competition, but share a vocation that we can only “see”
            (<emph>anschauen</emph>) through engagement with fiction. That engagement, however, confers the infinite responsibility of social
          production on us. This is what the smash hit proto-detective novel <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>, dubbed quintessentially Serapiontic
          by the brethren, demonstrates.</p>

          4. The Construction of the Historical as the Social—<emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>
        </head>
        <p> It seems either nonsensical or tautological to say that literature might study and produce its own object, as the police does, and as
          technology does. After all, the object of narration is, by the definition of imagination in the eighteenth century, not present. Thus it
          seems trivial to say that the object of fictional narrative is produced in the telling; meanwhile, since fiction after Lessing seeks not to
          educate, pursuing instead some more autonomous goal, as Paul Fleming as argued, it might seem wrong-headed to say that it “studies” its
          object. But what if its object is the historical reality that disciplinary production must fracture in order to know? What if literature,
          like Kant’s philosophical faculty, offers an <emph>Anschauung</emph> of a more complex object than those disciplines allow? In other words,
          what if fiction inherited the task of social administration? This might give intuitive meaning to Shelley’s famous statement about poets as
          “legislators.” To be sure, Hoffmann did not advocate, or practice, a confusion of fiction and law. But fiction allows a visible space the
          law does not, one without direct consequences, one of Serapiontic suspension. That suspension is instrumentalized: the phenomenon it fixes
          allows the fictional space to be broader than any single discipline, and more concrete than the philosophical faculty. That literature is
          neither law nor philosophy does not, however, prevent its pretension from rising to the task of social construction. For as little as it can
          intervene directly, this freedom precisely allows it to study and produce objects as contingencies, possibilities, different orders with
          different systems of valuation, precisely in order to interact with and reveal the valuations and their rules within the present order. That
          is what I want to claim for <emph>Scuderi</emph>.</p>
        <p>
          <emph>Scuderi</emph> is breathtaking: it opens on the eponymous septuagenarian poet’s maid fending off a possible robber from the estate in
          the middle of the night. The narrator digresses at length to explain the maid’s fear, expounding the historical case (with some
          embellishments) of Brinvillier, a woman who developed an untraceable poison, killing her father and a number of others in Paris, leading to
          the atmosphere that had opened the novella. A second rash of murders, this time brutal thefts of jewelry, have led the king, Louis XIV, to
          establish the so-called <emph>chambre ardente</emph>, a special investigative committee the narrator compares to the inquisition. (The
          extraordinary fact is that Hoffmann wrote the story before he was called to serve in the <emph>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</emph>.)
          Scuderi learns slowly that it is the work of the master jeweler Cardillac that is being stolen; the would-be robber makes another attempt to
          contact her about the case. Cardillac is murdered, apparently by his soon-to-be son-in-law Olivier Brusson. The police detective Desgrais
          comes into a kind of competition with Scuderi, who learns rapidly that Brusson is a boy she had taken care of as a youth, one she considers
          her son (his mother has since died). Convinced of his innocence—especially because of the wide-eyed frank grief of Madelon, Cardillac’s
          daughter—Scuderi attempts to intervene, consulting a lawyer and entreating the police and eventually the king. Brusson reveals what he
          knows, which is that Cardillac was obsessively killing those who bought his works, and retrieving his products. The plot does not resolve
          through the efforts of Scuderi as detective,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Alewyn’s much-disputed thesis that
              <emph>Scuderi</emph> was the first detective story has received a twist from Kittler in <emph>Dichter Mutter Kind</emph> 197–219 (esp.
            pp. 213–15), to the effect that the pure material codes of detection were constrained by the family as the basis of semiotics around 1800.
          </note> but because Cardillac’s killer, Miossens, steps forward with the truth. But the <emph>chambre ardente</emph> will not back down (the
          predictive power of the story for Hoffmann’s biography is singular), and even as the population shifts to Brusson’s side, the king, annoyed
          by the public fallout, drags out his decision. Scuderi brings Madelon to the court, and convinces the king to release Brusson. Madelon and
          Brusson leave Paris for Geneva, and the original owners of the stolen jewelry (those who are not dead, presumably) have their property
          restored. Cardillac’s murders are traced to an incident between his mother and a soldier during her pregnancy. </p>
        <p> When the story finishes, the salon is impressed. We learn that Sylvester, who had already announced his story’s reliance on Voltaire, has
          also drawn from an unlikelier source, Wagenseil’s <emph>Chronicle of Nuremberg</emph>. The aesthetic judgment comes:
        <quote>One called [the story] truly serapiontic, because, built on historical foundations, it still climbs into the fantastic [<emph>auf
            geschichtlichen Grund gebaut, doch hinaufsteige ins Fantastische</emph>]. (4:853) </quote>
        The line seems to indicate the intertwining of the chronicle and the “night-side” cause of Cardillac’s obsessive murders. And indeed, the
          first string of murders is historical fact, the atmosphere of intensive urban policing that results in a clear message to the present from the
          Paris of the Sun King. The hidden causes of crimes cannot spare their doers, but also cannot be fully clarified by the courts. The story
          then “climbs” into the “fantastical” through the figure of Cardillac. But as the long tradition of understanding the story of the crimes as
          a <emph>Krimi</emph> or detective story shows, the effect of this fantastical element does not undermine the social atmosphere established
          and maintained. It is clearly a story about power.</p>
        <p> It is this power that is “really seen,” and this thematization allows us to grasp how the Serapiontic principle becomes narrative.
          Building on the suspension announced in the first tale of the cycle, we here see that the historical ground of the story is integrated with
          the fantastic; thus the “duplicity of all earthly being” is transferred from the individual (Serapion) to society, and it is the history of
          that society that occupies the narrative space. Argenson’s Paris, ruled in the fiction by his successor La Regnie, is a police state in our
          contemporary sense, a repressive atmosphere in which danger and fear dominate for all but the nobles and the king. The drama the narrative
          expertly maximizes is based on this newer type of police, and the king’s ultimate authority would come to haunt Hoffmann within a few years
          of his completion of the story. Thus the police are not Justi’s but the clumsy Desgrais, who does in fact read as an anticipation of
          Inspector Lestrade, only with the emphasis on the irrational inquisitorial force behind him. He lets Cardillac slip through his hands, and
          in a completely unexplained moment, witnesses him apparently pass through a solid wall. Scuderi engages the administrative apparatus,
          gathering information and consulting a lawyer, preparing for her attempt to convince the king to release Brusson. </p>
        <p> Dorothea von Mücke has characterized this rhetorical act as the recruitment of the king “into the regime of biopower” (124, 127), relying
          on Friedrich Kittler’s demonstration that Scuderi both produces the “positive knowledge of the human” (203–04) and the regime of
          signification associated with the discursive and institutional shifts Foucault identified around 1800: “Hoffmann’s story, as the first
          example of its genre, is thus simultaneously the effect and the instrument of a discourse-mutation” (216). But what discourse is being
          mutated? As I have proposed, it is the shift in administration as sociotechnology, and the discipline known as technology itself, that
          provides the discursive background. The narrative shows us that the king’s decision is at least partly subject to the social shift towards emphasis on
          biopower itself. In the Enlightened monarchy, administration slowly gains the upper hand, and as the monarchy is forced to retreat into the
          complex Europe of the mid-nineteenth century, bureaucracy and industry form a historical alliance that was still called
            <emph>Technologie</emph>. Hoffmann’s novella can only be the “instrument” of that mutation, however, if we re-read the judgment of the
          brethren. It builds a “historical ground” not in the sense that it is drawn from a chronicle. Hoffmann is tongue-in-cheek here; the history
          is the mutation itself. And its “climb into the fantastic” should then also be revised: not Cardillac’s “night side,” not his disappearance
          through the wall, not the alchemy of the Brinvillier subplot. The “fantastic” <emph>also</emph> functions as the alternate to the
          historical, the factor that allows the fictional space to mimick the changing role of administration. This allows a “technological” ambition
          to emerge within the narrative, which focuses its reader on a more complete historical image than any discipline can produce, and then
          proposes the possibility that this image could be altered. This fiction supplies active organs where only passive ones had been. It produces
          the space for studying its object, otherwise not available, and it retains the possibility of altering that space. The upshot of
            <emph>Scuderi</emph> is that we must “really see” a historical ground shot through with the possibility of differentiation. The
          desperation of Brusson and his “mother” Scuderi reflects the trap of the powers that crystallize from this order, but the novella visualizes
          the order itself, produces it as an imaginary object. The imagination cannot directly intervene or impose its freedom on the bureaucratic
          and discursive grid it alone can produce. But it is itself a factor—a lack or a luxury—in that grid, and one that has the ability to
          navigate between the concrete and the general. When we see its generalized function, and its ambition to address that generality through its
          singular narrative formation, we can see what the literature of biopower might be. And this is what late Romanticism in Hoffmann’s version
          offers: a realism that, by re-presenting the totality of the real <emph>as possible</emph>, offers a kind of technology that parallels that
          discipline. That is, a kind of possibility that presents a dwindling yet crucial space for an alternate real, because it is the vehicle of
          representation that increasingly alone allows for this progressive picture. Thus what seems a merely given “story”—as in the Chronicle of
          Nuremberg—must be imaginatively constructed into its <emph>own order</emph>. This is the production of the historical object, which, for the
            Serapion-circle, <emph>must go through the fantastic</emph>—“climb” into it—in order to count as a study of the object. In other words,
          the oblique bearing that the Voltairean tale has on the totality of social relations in the present is based precisely in the detour of
          fictionality that first constitutes the historical object, that first allows us the imaginative space to conceive of it as part of a set of
          relations, a social whole. A fiction that offers this space to its reader is technological, because it retains the formal characteristics of
          that discipline: it is both production and study of an object, namely production itself. The object of this fiction is, however, not
          “technological” in the modern sense, but instead something approximating what we call sociotechnology, which can only take form as the
          production of culture. The technology<emph> </emph>of culture is therefore literature as Hoffmann writes it. <emph>Serapion</emph> is a
          generic template for the international nineteenth century, its influence extending to the U.S.A. and to Russia, among others. Perhaps that
          is in part because underlying its literally fantastic fireworks is the murky urgency of modernity as the fateful synthesis of administration
          and machines. </p>
        <p>As the story ends, there is not much to support the brothers’ assertion that it has “climbed into the fantastic”—while the explanation of
          the crime is occult, the withdrawal of the lovers to Rousseau’s hometown and the restitution of the jewels to their owners’ families are
          perfectly banal. But the combination of the salon and the story within it shows us Hoffmann’s technique, which is to take given eidetic
          story-content and re-imagine it as the transition of power, the shifting of instance from a monarchical state/society complex to something
          more nebulous. The narration contains a layer of knowledge that it does not exactly visualize: the knowledge of the passage to an order in
          which power is diffuse, the end of unilateral sovereignty. But in doing this, it presents a new task of fiction, one that we can call
          “technological.”</p>
        <p>Here fiction itself becomes technological in a historical sense, and inherits the task of social administration that was the only meaning
          of <emph>Technologie</emph> at the time. After the Enlightenment, social administration was privatized, and in a sense, so was literature,
          amounting to a channel of public information about massive spheres of unregulatable activity. It became, and perhaps is still, a privileged
          area for gaining an imaginary grasp on the <emph>longue durée</emph> and its crystallization in the social form of the present. In Hoffmann,
          this “grasp” meant the possibility of reconceiving the social as such, of altering its very constitution through producing it in narrative
          form. The police is no longer needed to intervene at every level of society, guiding the process of history; technological fiction would
          replace it by producing new historical conditions of possibility.</p>
