               discipline <em>Technologie</em> as invented by the polymath Johann Beckmann. The connection between narrative and
               technology occurs not at the level of symbols or in diegesis but in the manipulation
               of form, which had consequences for the construal of life outside the constraints
               of emergent disciplines like medicine, forensic psychology, and the changing institution
               of the police. Narrative prose came to occupy the position of that police, producing
               the object of its own analysis—society—with intent to alter it.</p>

                  <p>When one Daniel Schmolling, following a notion that he could not rid himself of, murdered
                     his erstwhile consort Henriette Lehne outside the Hasenheide in Berlin in 1818, the
                     Berlin court system’s forensic efforts failed to find a motive. Schmolling admitted
                     the deed, describing the first occurrence of the idea of the murder three weeks before
                     its execution. It was not a passionate act, seemed to benefit him neither financially
                     nor emotionally. The doctor called on to examine the criminal, Merzdorff, pronounced
                     Schmolling incapable of standing trial on the basis of a diagnosis then much in vogue: <em>amentia occulta</em>, or “hidden insanity,” articulated by the famous anthropologist Ernst Platner. The
                     case was placed on the docket of E.T.A. Hoffmann, criminal judge for the superior
                     court [<em>Kammergericht</em>]. Hoffmann’s interest in strange and occult psychological phenomena is well known,
                     the fact that he also played a significant role in the legal order of the Prussian
                     state in a time of upheaval perhaps less so.

                     </div>, and he produced a lengthy rejection of Merzdorff’s diagnosis, leading his longtime
                     friend and fellow criminal judge Julius Eduard Hitzig to state that he had overstepped
                     his bounds. Hoffmann maintained that while there could theoretically be invisible
                     insanity, it could not play a role in the law, writing: <span class="quote">‘In the first place it should be noted that the actual field in which the doctor’s
                        science moves, namely the knowledge [<em>Kenntnis</em>] of the physical human organism, certainly does not in and of itself also cover the
                        psychic organism, but instead knowledge [<em>Erkenntnis</em>] of this principle of spirit, insofar as it is possible, would have to be based on
                        completely different premises. For this reason, Kant assigned the investigation of
                        the state of the mind [<em>Gemütszustand</em>] entirely to the philosophical faculty . . . [w]hereas Metzger, Reil and Hoffbauer
                        object primarily because a doctor who has a general philosophical education, such
                        as is only appropriate for a court doctor, can more easily obtain the knowledge [<em>Kenntnis</em>] necessary for him to judge derangements of the spirit [<em>Geisteszerrüttungen</em>], than the philosopher can assimilate the knowledge [<em>Kenntnis</em>] of medical doctrines and necessary for the same purpose, as well as the needed skill
                        in investigation, which latter the doctor gains through therapeutic practice. (<em>Sämtliche Werke</em> 6.699)’</span> What Schmolling’s case presents is a conflict between the philosophical and medical
                     faculties in the form of a judicial problem. Hoffmann is already flaunting his knowledge
                     of contemporary psychological literature

                              in Bamberg (1808–13), which are also the years immediately preceding the beginning
                              of his literary output, starting in 1814. See Segebrecht.</span></div>
                     </div>—Johann Christian Reil was a favorite, although Hoffmann here takes issue with his
                     Germanification of <em>amentia occulta</em> as “<em>Wut ohne Verkehrtheit</em>” [<em>rage without dementia</em>]. Reil was both dean of the medical faculty at the new Humboldt University and slowly
                     gaining administrative oversight of medical institutions throughout Prussia. His duties
                     moved in the realm of what was then still called “<em>medizinische Polizei</em>,” the branch of administration of the state that applied health policies (in Reil’s
                     case, especially military hospitals). Hoffmann displayed no hesitancy in rejecting
                     the medical opinion of the man who had coined the term “psychiatry,” and whose clinical
                     work was at the cutting edge.

                     </div> Hoffmann had cited precisely the impediment to the development of a scientific psychiatry:
                     Immanuel Kant. Kant’s insistence that the sciences be based on mathematical demonstration
                     stalled and shifted the emergence of psychology and biology in particular (Kant 4:468).

                              of Life and Richards on Kant’s disputed role in the founding of biology.</span></div>
                     </div> His epochal <em>Conflict of the Faculties </em>(1798), which defends the philosophical faculty as the intellectual and institutional
                     heart of the university, confronts the “pure reason” of that faculty with its less
                     rational sister faculties. The legal and religious faculties, tied as they are to
                     the functioning of the state, cannot guide reason—rather <em>vice versa</em>. But when it comes to the medical faculty, Kant pulls his punch, describing the collegial
                     problematics arising from Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland’s <em>The Art of Extending Human Life </em>(1797), and recommending a series of dietetic measures to maintain “life-force” in
                     the aging body. Hufeland, like Reil involved in the policing of medicine at the beginning
                     of the nineteenth century in Prussia, posited a life-force that could be maintained
                     and strengthened through vigilance. The problem that had driven so much of Kant’s
                     monumental output—the body-soul problem—did not even appear. Precisely this difficult
                     relationship would need to be judged—for Hoffmann, was being judged incorrectly—in
                     criminal investigations. In appealing to Kant, Hoffmann is referring to the framework
                     of the <em>Conflict</em> as expressed in the <em>Anthropology</em>: <span class="quote">‘Thus if someone deliberately perpetrates some harm and now the question is, whether
                        and how he is guilty, and thus first it must be decided, whether he was crazy at the
                        time or not, then the court cannot send him to the medical faculty, but instead (because
                        of the incompetence of the court) to the philosophical faculty. For the question:
                        whether the accused, at the time of his deed, in possession of his natural faculties
                        of understanding and judging, is completely psychological, and even if the bodily
                        derangement of the organs of its soul [<em>körperliche Verschrobenheit der Seelenorganen</em>] could perhaps sometimes be the cause of an unnatural infringement of the law of
                        duty (which resides in each human), still the doctors and physiologists are not at
                        all yet so far as to be able to grasp the machine in the human [<em>Maschinenwesen im Menschen</em>] deeply enough to explain the impulse [<em>Anwandlung</em>] to such a gruesome deed, or (without bodily anatomy) to predict it; and a <em>legal medical doctrine </em>(<em>medicina forensis</em>)—if it comes to the question, whether the mind of the criminal [<em>Täter</em>] in a crazed state, or has taken a decision with a healthy understanding—would be
                        meddling in the business of others, of which the judge understands nothing, and can
                        at most refer it to another faculty, since it does not belong to his forum. (Kant
                        7: 213-14)’</span> Hoffmann cites Kant as an authority to ward off Merzdorff and the other doctors. His
                     decision, however, flies in the face of Kant’s rejection of legal expertise on the
                     mind-body problem. For Hoffmann, the judge must do what psychiatry cannot yet do,
                     and what the philosophical faculty in any case cannot be trusted to do: psychiatric
                     forensics. The assumptions of the court were as simple as the verdict: without evidence,
                     no insanity plea; lacking which, Schmolling was guilty of murder. He was sentenced
                     to life in prison, where he murdered another inmate. He was beheaded on 30 May 1825
                     (Haack 87).</p>

                  <p>The case provided one of the models for Georg Büchner’s <em>Woyzek</em>, and one might be forgiven for not recognizing Hoffmann in the writing of the decision.

                     and Romantic engagement with demonic, magical themes, and the new technologies associated
                     with them.

                              (105–39). Cf. Gaderer 83. </span></div>
                     </div> The Schmolling case throws into relief a problem that runs throughout the literature
                     on Hoffmann: namely, the question of disciplinary knowledge in his fictional output.
                     Given his insistence on a liberal model of legal subjectivity—maintained, as we shall
                     see, at the expense of his political position after 1819—it would be less than satisfying
                     to cast fictional autonomy as a screen onto which Hoffmann’s massive learning is merely
                     projected without consequence. In what follows, I argue that the problem of social
                     administration and construction dovetails in Hoffmann’s work with that of what was
                     a university discipline around 1800, with the name <em>Technologie</em>. A branch of economics devoted to knowledge and administration of production, this
                     discipline related to so-called “police science”

                     the discursive background with which Hoffmann’s fiction engages. I argue that narrative
                     itself takes on the theoretical tasks of this “technological” administrative science,
                     a shift that both adumbrates the difficulties of avant-garde aesthetics and calls
                     for a reading of Hoffmann that reflects the ambition to diagnose the historical condition
                     of society and provide a narrative space for the possibility of alternate syntheses
                     of its apparent forward march. Underlying the epistemological effects of the fantastic
                     and medial complications of technical artefacts is a disciplinary affinity that Hoffmann’s
                     fiction intervenes in,

                              aesthetic of mediations. I would only specify that this later aesthetic has the disciplinary
                              ambition of a historical “technology,” meaning that Hoffmann is closer to Novalis’s

                     and Dorothea von Mücke. Hoffmann’s narration, as I show on the example of <em>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</em>, deploys its trademark doppelgängers, automata, and uncanny effects as lures, to
                     focus the imagination on the historical situation, and to free the faculties of the

                  of completeness—of anatomical knowledge of the “machine” that is the human body. The
                  problem is that the connection between acts of will and the derangement [<em>Verschrobenheit</em>] of the “organs of the soul” cannot be clarified by the court. Only a philosopher
                  should be assigned this task. The outer edge of psychology—the embodied mind—must
                  be policed, albeit by the Humanities. Hoffmann agreed, although he assigned himself
                  as judge—and as author—of this task. If there was a police for medicine, then there
                  would have to be some way to regulate psychological judgments as well. Even if he
                  overstepped in the Schmolling case, Hoffmann accepted the charge Kant had left open,
                  in the name not of a university discipline but of cultural production. Fiction would
                  need to do what, ultimately, even the philosophical faculty could not.</p>

                  <p>Hoffmann’s <em>Serapion-Brethren</em> (1819–21) is a four-volume collection of stories of all kinds. The novellas, fairy
                     tales, horror stories, and even a proto-detective novel are held together by a fictional
                     salon, modeled on Hoffmann’s real-life group, the <em>Seraphinenorden</em>, which had included such figures as Hitzig, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, and Adalbert
                     Chamisso. The salon-frame, in which the friends discuss the merits of the stories
                     they tell each other, operates as irony in the sense Friedrich Schlegel had given
                     to that term.

                     </div> Following an opening frame discussion of the failures of most salons, the group of
                     friends listens to Cyprian (likely modeled on Chamisso) narrate the life of a bureaucrat
                     from an unnamed contemporary German town. Cyprian claims to have discovered this well-bred
                     and educated man, who had disappeared some years before, living as a hermit with the
                     conviction that he is the ancient Christian martyr Serapion, granted eternal life
                     following his virtuous death. Cyprian makes inquiries, discovers the history of the
                     bureaucrat, and, wanting to cure the “cheerful insanity” [<em>heiterer Wahnsinn</em>] of the anachorete, reads up on contemporary psychology—especially in the works of
                     Phillippe Pinel and Reil. In order to disabuse Serapion of his <em>idée fixe</em> (which functions, if less violently, like that of Schmolling), Cyprian learns how
                     to approach the patient delicately. His attempt fails. Serapion not only rejects the
                     notion that he is the bureaucrat from the nearby town, but also engages Cyprian in
                     a disquisition about the nature of perception, the reality of time and space, and
                     the “duplicity of all being.” Cyprian’s friends are horrified, especially Lothar,
                     who rejects the tale as irrational and terrifying. But after Theodor recounts the
                     story of <em>Counsel Krespel</em>,

                     story does not matter, he says, rather only that one should have “really seen” what
                     one recounts: <span class="quote">‘More! I honor Serapion’s insanity because only the spirit most excellent or rather
                        the true poet can be seized by it . . . Whence comes it then, that some poetic work,
                        which we would not at all call bad, if we are talking about form and execution [<em>Ausarbeitung</em>], remains nevertheless still as without effect as a faded image, that we are not
                        transported by it, that the splendor of the words only serves to multiply the inner
                        chill that runs through us. What other explanation, than that the poet has not really
                        seen [<em>nicht . . . wirklich schaute</em>] what he speaks of, that the deed, the event [<em>Begebenheit</em>], depicting itself before his eyes, with pleasure, with all the horror, with all
                        the exultation, with all the shudders, did not enthuse him, set him on fire, so that
                        the inner flames might simply flow out in fiery words: in vain the labor of the poet,
                        to bring us to believe in what he himself does not, because he has not himself truly
                        viewed it [<em>weil er es nicht erschaute</em>]. What could the figures [<em>Gestalten</em>] of such a poet, who, according to the old saying, is not also a true seer, be, other

                        my Cyprian, was a true poet, had really saw that [<em>er hatte das wirklich geschaut</em>] which he pronounced, and that is why his speech gripped both heart and mind [<em>Gemüt</em>].—Poor Serapion, what was your insanity other than that some hostile star had robbed
                        you of the knowledge of that duplicity, by which in fact our earthly being is alone

                        pass by in dark secretive presentiments which never form themselves into a distinct
                        image [<em>die sich nie zum deutlichen Bilde gestalten</em>]. But you, o my hermit, established no outer world [<em>statuiertest keine Außenwelt</em>], you did not see the hidden lever, the force influencing your inner world; and if
                        you claimed, with ghastly acuity, that it is only the spirit that sees, hears, feels,
                        that grasps deeds and events, and that thus everything that it recognizes has also
                        thus happened, you forgot that the external world forces the spirit banished into
                        the body to those functions of perception arbitrarily. Your life, dear anachorete,
                        was a constant dream, from which you in your beyond certainly did not painfully awake.—(4:68–69).’</span> Outer impressions, Lothar tells his friends, form a circle that engulfs the inner
                     impressions in everyday life; but if, like Serapion, we do not “establish an outer
                     world,” we may reach an extension of internal images that are not merely “internal”
                     but instead do not suffer from the duplicity of our intellect. It is the unfolding
                     of such images that makes up the Serapiontic principle, the discovery of a phenomenological
                     form that underlies the causality of realist prose, and in this sense is supradisciplinary.
                     Literature does what law cannot. Lothar is here recombining the elements of Cyprian’s
                     narrative, doing precisely what the principle rejects: summarizing as a discursive
                     construct that which has been set before our eyes as narrative content. Thus Blankenburg’s
                     notion of penetrating the relationship between the images and events of lived life
                     could not be further from the Romantic principle, which collapses that external causality
                     and thereby suspends the theory of the novel in favor of a different philosophy of
                     history. Lothar’s theory of fiction also demands the extension of eidetic content
                     in the interest of narrative framing, but rejects tying this framing to any mimicking
                     of “earthly being,” or the finitude of the human intellect. Crucially, Lothar thinks
                     that this means that Serapion dreams life, or takes the events of the spirit, which
                     alone hears, sees, and feels, for “actual events.” This is in keeping with the usual
                     sense of Hoffmann’s work: the “fantastic” is a suspension of reason, the opening of
                     a playful space of dark and technological fantasies, the creation of those unnoticed,
                     perhaps even unnoticeable, relations in the psyche that would later come to be demystified
                     by Freud. But this reading comes up short.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In fact, Lothar misreads Cyprian and therefore Serapion, because he retains for narrative
                  the difference between “external events” and the “dream” or “insanity” that allows
                  them to be recombined in narrative. For Serapion—and, I would suggest, for Hoffmann—the
                  notion of “external event” or <em>Begebenheit</em> cannot recur, because this would be the <em>reinscription of an external world</em>, and therefore a violation of the principle itself. Narrative simply does not respect
                  the “inner/outer” distinction, and aims instead at an arrangement of elements that
                  “never form themselves into a distinct image.” What can never be imagined is the interface
                  between the inner and the outer, and this applies to text and knowledge equally. If
                  the narrative does not respect this difference, but never allows for a fully distinct
                  image of the interface, then it is precisely where the image fails that the epistemic
                  effects of the narrative begin to work. Causality cannot form narrative because causes
                  are half-conceptual, but images provide something other than themselves, some excess
                  that is neither “inner” nor “outer” but instead a <em>sui generis </em>“knowledge.” This narrative becomes a singular engagement with an object, because
                  that object is produced <em>in this singular way for the first time</em> in narrative, and the narrative stands to redound on the object itself, changing
                  it. This production obscures the abstraction “object” and allows the poetic production
                  to have an unrepresentable interface with whatever noumenon stands behind the abstraction.
                  In other words, the Serapiontic principle creates a poetic site of production. Lothar’s
                  statement, which is a compromise of aesthetic principles in the ongoing conversation
                  of the brethren, is a step back from Cyprian’s more radical—and, I want to argue,
                  more fundamental—sense of the search for an arrangement of narrated elements that,
                  as Lothar himself puts it, “never form themselves into a distinct image.” Formation
                  is not restricted to the visualization-techniques of the narrative, opening a separate
                  and mixed-mode epistemic layer in the telling. We can see this in two exemplary stories
                  from the cycle: <em>The Automata</em>, and <em>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</em>.</p>
               <p>The protagonists of E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <em>The Automata</em> (published in 1814, later included in the <em>Serapion Brethren</em>) find themselves at a crucial point in the narrative discussing the uncanny presentation
                  of automatic music they have just heard at the laboratory of one Professor X. The
                  story, which recounts Ferdinand’s subjection to a form of demonic power—we never learn
                  whether it is machinic, psychopathological, or both—follows an encounter with a fictional
                  alternate of Wolfgang von Kempelen’s famous “chess-playing Turk.” For Ferdinand, his
                  compatriot Ludwig, and the intradiegetic polite society, the automaton is an oracle.
                  It predicts that Ferdinand will, like Orpheus, lose the love he is obsessed with upon
                  one last sighting of her. The prediction, of course, turns out to be true, although
                  it appears to fulfill itself, using Ferdinand’s unhealthy fascination as the motor
                  of its simultaneously fantastical and social causality. The episode with Professor
                  X, however, presents the reader with a discussion of the principle of the narrative
                  by those caught in the same narrative, which in turn is a mirroring of the generic
                  ploy of the <em>Serapion Brethren</em>, in that the tales illustrate the principles of their discussion even as those principles
                  are interrogated on the continuing presentation of new areas of exploration (genres).
                  The sequence of scenes involving Professor X, then, reads as a <em>mise-en-abîme</em>. The “Serapiontic principle” is both the content and the genre of the larger collection
                  and <em>The Automata</em>.</p>
               <p>The arc of the episode with Professor X is as follows: the inquirers Ferdinand and
                  Ludwig visit the professor and listen to his various musical automata; a discussion
                  of what human music is follows; the protagonists then hear what they take to be a
                  pure example of this—a small girl singing in the grass—only to see Professor X smiling
                  terrifyingly behind her, walking through the garden and apparently enlivening the
                  plant-life around him as he goes. In this last moment, the narrator is silent. It
                  is not suggested that the girl is an automaton: the professor’s presence suggests
                  instead the inability to determine the difference between human and machine music.
                  </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The difference at issue in the discussion falls in the middle of the episode. Ferdinand,
                     who is the object of the oracular and tragic narrative, listens to his skeptical friend
                     Ludwig detail what he confirms are their common objections to the professor’s presentation.
                     The problem is that the music is too good. It sounds like it possesses the spirit
                     that only a human touch should produce. Ludwig grasps at the opposite end of the contradiction:
                     when music played by humans is not imbued with passion, we call it “mechanical”; what
                     should we do when actually mechanical music sounds human? <span class="quote">‘To want to have musical effects through valves, springs, levers, cylinders and whatever
                        else belongs to the mechanical apparatus, is <em>the nonsensical attempt</em> to achieve <em>through means alone</em> that which [the organs of the body] can carry out, only enlivened through the inner
                        force of the mind [<em>Gemüt</em>] and regulated in their smallest movements by that very force. (4:419; my emphasis)’</span> It is literally “senseless” to allow “means alone” to complete tasks that only the
                     truly human soul should be capable of. It is not their material characteristics but
                     their connection to the “inner force” of the spirit that separate bodily organs from
                     mere instruments. Ludwig sharpens his polemic, grasping for a difference between organs
                     and machines, and opens Hoffmann’s story onto a vast conceptual problematic that ties
                     the narrative back to the overall project: <span class="quote">‘The striving of the machinists, increasingly <em>to imitate </em>[<em>nachahmen</em>] <em>or through mechanical means to replace human organs</em> that produce musical tones, is for me a declaration of war against the spiritual principle,

                        to it. (4:420–21)’</span> Mechanical mimesis of the capacities of human organs is war against the “spirit,”
                     and human organs are the expression of a cosmological harmony that our petty inventions
                     and instruments merely mimic. Thus: <span class="quote">‘In that ur-period of the human race, when it—to use the words of an ingenious author

                  only a full history of the human relation to nature can complete the scientific picture.
                  The necessary elements of that history are the primordial unity of man and nature,
                  an account of the split and the collateral epistemic effects of that split, and the
                  principled possibility of a re-unification. The “night-side” of that history comprises
                  strange moments of possible reconciliation, especially those associated with Mesmer
                  and animal magnetism. Schubert’s conviction is cast in terms of the organs that Hoffmann
                  draws on for his <em>Automata</em>: <span class="quote">‘Usually that which happens according to a necessary law of nature unites in it that
                     particular perfection, autonomy and purposiveness that is particular to nature in
                     all its workings. We seldom find that the natural drive is subject to illusions or
                     mistakes [<em>Misgriff</em>], but in a certain way the will is. We must regard the things that exercise such
                     an artificial drive [<em>Kunsttrieb</em>] or instinct as immediate organs of nature, which individuals subordinate the more
                     to themselves the less perfect they are (28).’</span> Organs are immediate expressions of harmony. But <em>we</em> are not organs, because the will—and rational activity—are somehow severed from this
                  connection: “If at that time the human was an organ of nature, then he was this in
                  his way,—human” (29). The separation from animals—who, for Schelling, Schubert’s teacher,
                  possess the “artificial drive” [<em>Kunsttrieb</em>]—goes by way of fault. The notion of the human as “the being of lack” [<em>Mängelwesen</em>] has its <em>locus classicus</em> in Schubert’s other guiding light, Johann Gottfried Herder. Here, however, the lack
                  suggests eventual reconciliation with the higher order: humans are organs of nature,
                  just like animals, but the disconnect between their literal organs and their will
                  (subject to judicial discipline for Kant as for Hoffmann) makes them open to the development
                  of more organs. But Hoffmann derives more than the notion of “nature-music” or a fundamental
                  harmony from Schubert. It is clear that Ludwig’s insistence on the difference between
                  organs and instruments cannot be maintained; <em>Geist</em> seems turned, in the <em>mise-en-abîme</em> conversation, against both external mechanical devices and the harmonious organs
                  of the body, in cooperation with which the spirit produces illusions, tricks—misfires.
                  The mesmeric doctrine will suggest the development of alternate organs among these,
                  but the problem will persist. The specificity of sense-perception and the generality
                  of both reason and the will bind the human to the earthly being Hoffmann calls “duplicitous.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The citation of Schubert in the context of the discussion of instruments is a moment
                     of high narrative irony, for it refers us back to the principle that supposedly drives
                     the narrative. When Cyprian had approached Serapion to disabuse him of his illusions,
                     he had offered to show the anachorete the town he hailed from, in which he had been
                     a member of the administration. Cyprian thought to convince the hermit merely by mentioning
                     the presence of the town, a mere two hours away. Serapion’s response reveals the radicality
                     of the principle: if Cyprian’s reason dictates that that past be taken as real event,
                     why cannot Serapion’s version of things be equally valid? At the limit, why should
                     either the duration of time (some fifteen centuries) or distance from the town prove
                     anything to Serapion? <span class="quote">‘Indeed, what hears, what sees, what feels in us?—perhaps the dead machines, which
                        we call eye—ear—hand etc., and not the spirit?—Does the spirit perhaps form its world,
                        conditioned by space and time, internally, on its own account, and then leave those
                        functions to another principle that dwells within us?—How absurd! If it is thus the
                        spirit alone, that grasps the events before us, then that which it recognizes also
                        really happened. (4:34)’</span> Organs, in other words, are in conflict with the form-giving principle of spirit,
                     which cannot be divided between inner and outer. Like the specific eidetic content
                     of the story <em>The Automata</em>—Ferdinand’s love, the prophecy, its uncertain but all-too-real fulfillment—the reports
                     of the external organs are in conflict with the overarching constructive principle
                     of the spirit, or by analogy the construction of narrative. This conflict is what
                     creates the irony of <em>The Automata</em> as part of the <em>Serapion</em>-cycle. Hoffmann’s narrative does not resolve its issue; the Serapiontic principle
                     is not meant to do that. The report from the letter to Ludwig cannot be trusted, especially
                     as Professor X has never left town—Ferdinand cannot have seen him elsewhere. The uncanny
                     effect is that the prophecy is fulfilled, though whether through Ferdinand’s obsession,
                     the magnetic powers of Professor X, or some combination, we do not know. The conflict
                     between content and narrative logic can only be solved by causal suggestions, turns
                     of story or of understanding—whether intradiegetically or in the frame-discussions—that
                     provide clues to the <em>Gestalt</em> of the narrative space. Hoffmann frustrates this expectation, and inscribes this frustration
                     as the very principle of the cycle. In other words, he has deranged our organs, made
                     visible (<em>anschauend</em>) the very conflict between empirical experience and the rational container that grasps
                     it. The <em>idée fixe</em>—that one could be a centuries-dead martyr, that one must murder one’s love—is, for
                     Hoffmann, a matter of attention and thrall. One falls into a kind of hypnosis to an
                     idea of no apparent origin, but the will is bound to it.

                     of the ultimate falsity of disciplinary knowledge. But the bracketing of space and
                     time, the flirtation with the obsession of fixed ideas, simply underscore Serapion’s
                     ability to present excellent novellas to Cyprian. It is not merely this ironic bracketing
                     of duality that Hoffmann’s narration aims at. In fact, this is merely the Serapiontic
                     principle in its radical version, the version Lothar misrecognizes but cannot suppress.
                     The space of this narrative is then itself trained on different objects, in order
                     to study the historical situation and perform variations of it, in order to let some
                     light into the rush to social control that Hoffmann was observing and participating
                     in during his collection and composition of the cycle.</p>

               <p>The last market vignette in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <em>My Cousin’s Corner Window</em> consists of a fight that breaks out in the observed crowd. The ailing cousin and
                  the “I” in the dialogue look on as this threat of violence gets the attention of the
                  police, who cannot push through the crowd in time to stop the fight, like an ambulance
                  in rush hour. A kind of ekphrasis follows: the aggressor stands, his hand raised and
                  ready to strike. The gaze of the narrative’s observers lingers on this image. But
                  the man does not strike, the crowd intervenes, and by the time the police arrive,
                  the incident is already over. The “I” remarks: <span class="quote">‘The fight is over—without the help of the police . . . so there in fact reigns in
                     the people a sense for the conservation of order [<em>ein Sinn für die zu erhaltende Ordnung</em>]. (6:493)’</span> To which the invalid replies: <span class="quote">‘<em>The cousin</em>: My dear cousin, my observations of the market have above all strengthened me in
                     the opinion that a strange change has occurred with the people of Berlin since that
                     unfortunate period when a bold, boisterous enemy flooded over the country and in vain
                     attempted to suppress its spirit, which soon sprung up again with renewed force like
                     a violently coiled spring. In a word: the people has gained in external propriety
                     [<em>Sittlichkeit</em>] . . . (6:494)’</span> Order was once preserved by the police, and is now conferred as a task on citizens.
                  The transfer of <em>Ordnungssinn</em> has a historical event as its proximate cause, namely the German and French skirmishes
                  that began with the First Revolutionary War, and ended with Napoleon’s defeat—but
                  not before he had ended the Holy Roman Empire and introduced widely differing and
                  semi-autonomous overhauls of its of civil and administrative legal core. Maybe the
                  cousin’s story here is too simple: the late Enlightenment states were already in the
                  process of modernizing their law books when Goethe observed the siege of Mainz in
                  1793. But the cousin pinpoints an issue that is central to the shift that was still
                  dramatically in process when E.T.A. Hoffmann took up his position as judge in the
                  high criminal court in Berlin in 1814/15. As the sole locale of the holistic representation
                  of large-scale historical and population-level processes and as a site of intervention
                  into them, Hoffmann’s narrative inherits the task of adminstrating the social. Or
                  in other words, narrative does what the police were expected to do at the close of
                  the <em>Corner Window</em>. It engages just in the moment of that ekphrasis, and is the potential site of the
                  material production of value. Narrative replaces the police.</p>

                  <p>It was the police who frustrated any possible happiness at the end of Hoffmann’s life.

                     23 March 1819 included the celebratory burning of conservative books at the so-called <em>Wartburg-Fest</em> in 1817. Among these books was the <em>General Codex for the Gendarmerie</em> of Karl Albert von Kamptz, Director of the Ministry of Police.

                     </div> It was Kamptz who would later bring Hoffmann to grief after he was viciously parodied
                     in Hoffmann’s <em>Master Flea</em>, Kamptz who would surreptitiously receive correspondence about that work that indicated
                     Hoffmann understood he had cited from court records, Kamptz who would attempt to have
                     Hoffmann removed from the bench, a fate he likely escaped only by dying in 1822, while
                     the accusations were still being evaluated. Kamptz’s work, however, has an informative
                     title: he is writing about the behavior of policemen, or what we today call the “police.”
                     Hoffmann follows this usage, too. This term was, as the repressive tactics of Metternich’s <em>Vormärz</em> settled on the German-speaking lands in the 1820s, in flux. It had once named a grander
                     administrative effort that, as we have seen above, included medicine, care for the
                     poor, and nutrition. <em>Polizei</em> was in fact simply the administration of the welfare of the subjects of the king,
                     and it was only as state and society became analytically separated after 1800

                     potential violence at the base of every possible state apparatus. These shifts in
                     conception and practice of state administration were front and center when Hoffmann
                     was appointed, on 16 September 1819, to the <em>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</em>, a body established to handle the political cases against the new radicals (<em>Demagogen</em>)<em>.</em> Hoffmann agreed to this appointment, but was skeptical, and held a line between deeds
                     and attitudes that fits nicely into our contemporary notions of democratic liberalism,
                     whether German or American. He insisted, crucially, on the innocence of Friedrich
                     Ludwig Jahn, founder of the athletics movement called the <em>Turnbewegung</em>, and finally won, against Kamptz, Jahn’s freedom. Jahn then sued Kamptz for libel,
                     and Hoffmann accepted the trial. An auction of authority began, with those attempting
                     to quash the trial extending upward to chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg, the
                     influential liberal reformer. Hoffmann stood his ground: his brief was subject only
                     to the will of the king, and no one else could be excepted from standing before the
                     law. This explains Kamptz’s zeal in pursuing the censorship case, but it also provides
                     us with a window onto Hoffmann’s lived experience of the shifting ground of state
                     politics in the German-speaking lands at the crucial moment after Napoleon’s defeat.
                     Jahn in particular and the “demogogues” in general have been taken to be a model of
                     Serapion, whose cheerful insanity thus takes on a political overtone, a matter for
                     the psychological police.

                     from society, was called <em>Polizei</em>. The term <em>police</em>, as we use it today to mean the institution, activity, and especially the persons
                     carrying out the function, is a narrow precipitate from a much larger discipline that
                     existed throughout Europe from roughly the fifteenth century to the end of the eighteenth.
                     The Grimm dictionary traces its evolving meaning chronologically. From the fifteenth
                     to the seventeenth centuries, <em>polizey</em> meant “government, administration and order, especially a kind of oversight of moral
                     in state and community [<em>staat und gemeinde</em>].” Derived from <em>policy</em> and usually combined in the compound <em>gute policey</em>, the administrative efforts of the police were not separated from the state itself—they
                     were, in fact, merely the morally controlled organization of that state and community.
                     The phrase <em>staat und gemeinde</em> is telling: “<em>und</em>” collapses what the modern reader instinctively takes as two separate notions into
                     a single area for police operation. Until deep into the eighteenth century one could
                     speak of a “police state,” replaced only slowly in the early nineteenth century with
                     the so-called <em>Rechtsstaat</em>, often traced intellectually to Wilhelm von Humboldt’s <em>Ideas for an Attempt to Determine the Limits of the Efficacy of the State</em> (1792).

                     which in turn requires a whole discipline, in and out of the university, relying,
                     as Michel Foucault has emphasized, on statistics. The Grimms describe what was known
                     as <em>Polizeiwissenschaft</em> as a term that was still being contested (“<em>noch heute ein vielumstrittener begriff</em>”). The concept was perhaps contested, but its reality cannot be. After the establishment
                     of two university chairs for the discipline in Prussia in 1727, professors of “police
                     science” began to pop up all over the German map, including in the imperial capital
                     in Vienna in 1752, where Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi was appointed in that year.
                     His <em>Fundamentals of Police Science </em>(1756) became the standard reference in the field. The contested territory, even as
                     it was established, was a matter of producing knowledge for the king’s administration
                     (thus fitting within the proto-economic discipline called “cameralism”

                        ever more serviceable and useful, as much in the whole as in all its parts [<em>sowohl nach seinem Zusammenhange, als in allen seinen Theilen</em>], for the promotion of the community’s well-being [<em>Glückseligkeit</em>].’</span> Police science is nothing more or less than the internal affairs of the state. Justi
                     does not separate the object about which the science knows and the knowledge the science
                     produces. As Foucault has argued, the main instrument of the science is statistics,
                     or “the state’s knowledge of the state” (<em>Security, Territory, Population</em> 315). The production of new personnel for administration is a major goal, and Justi
                     writes of “useful citizens [<em>nützliche Bürger</em>]”(15 ff.) The vocational training that police was to arrange reveals the complex
                     of power and knowledge that Foucault articulates. Per Justi: <span class="quote">‘<em>One must take care that the subjects possess such capacities and qualities and are
                           kept in this discipline </em>[<em>Zucht</em>]<em>and order, </em>as is required <em>by the goal of the community’s happiness </em>[<em>gemeinschaftliche Glückseligkeit</em>] . . .

                     Pasquale Pasquino have emphasized, Enlightenment state theory is based on this utter
                     formability of its objects.

                     [<em>Kenntniß</em>] of handiwork. Instead of what happens in the workshops, where they direct one to
                     follow the precepts and habits of the master in order to produce commodities, technology
                     gives the fundamental guidance [<em>Anleitung</em>], in systematic order, how one, for just this purpose, should explain and use the
                     phenomena appearing in work through true fundamental propositions and trustworthy
                     experiences. (17)’</span> Technology acts where persons cannot; it is the systematic and comprehensive treatment
                  of human material making (excluding the fine arts), replacing the “historical” discipline
                  of <em>Kunstgeschichte</em> (not art history, but the history of crafts) (18). The Enlightenment derivation of
                  the theory is strong, as Beckmann relies on Diderot and Christian Wolff, and especially
                  on Linnaeus, with whom he had studied in Uppsala: <span class="quote">‘<em>Linnaeus</em> said: I classify the animals according to the composition of their bodies, and thus
                     I give the human a place among the mammals. Now do those who derisively throw before
                     him the excellence of the human soul-forces above the so-called instincts of the other
                     animals refute him, he, who knows those forces of soul so much better than many of
                     his opponents? (21)’</span> Beckmann defends the Linnaean roughness and artificiality of his breakdown of the
                  arts (in order of the “more respected to the less”). Other disciplines could classify
                  humans as non-animals, and perhaps the arts could be seen from another perspective
                  than that of the police. But the production of this disciplinary knowledge is meant
                  for use, just as Diderot’s <em>Encyclopedia </em>was. Thus disciplinary knowledge is well-suited to guide practice, since it is general
                  enough to account for larger unities of that practice, while specific enough to change
                  it. The “forces of the soul” are also the limitations that necessitate the taxonomic
                  approach in the first place. What makes us human makes us technological, able to create
                  material things intentionally (<em>techne</em>) while limited to our invention of instruments for that making. The administration
                  and potential rationalization of that making is the object of a police-adjacent university
                  discipline: technology.</p>

                     </div> But Beckmann also produces a fascinating conception of disciplinarity in relation
                     to <em>techne</em>. Making is the process of forming raw materials into finished products (3–4). Doing
                     this work with a view to livelihood [<em>Unterhalt</em>] is an enterprise [<em>Gewerbe</em>]. The skill-based, rational making of artefacts for use is called “handiwork” [<em>Handwerk</em>], which is separated from “art” [<em>Kunst</em>]. Handiwork is of many kinds, and consists of a series of different kinds of twists,
                     like tropes, turns of a sometimes literal screw that do away with the natural body,
                     just as rhetorical tropes do away with the naturalness of the concept (Beckmann 1806
                     465-66). <em>Techne</em> is still divorced from its product, semantically, and refers to the making, even could
                     be applied to the enterprise of science (this is true of <em>Technologie</em> itself, which requires technique but is not an “art”). But the “polish” that <em>Technologie</em> puts on its object is put on no object at all: it is “polishing” a social process,
                     and thus <em>intervening in the production of use-values</em> with a battery of “twists” that one can put on raw material. Linnaeus’s artificial
                     system is here applied to <em>artificialia</em>, producing a kind of logical abyss that adumbrates the problem of a morphology of
                     technology, as Ernst Kapp and Gilbert Simondon would develop only much later. Here
                     is not the place to elaborate a full rhetoric of Beckmannian technology. But this
                     intervention by way of scientific and statistical aggregation in the process of production
                     surely went the way of social and not state intervention. But the project of constructing
                     the very society that became the field of play for that very “free enterprise” fell,
                     as the police became a merely repressive apparatus, to poetry. In other words, fiction
                     inherited a social-administrative task that, when Hoffmann died, was just beginning
                     to be enduringly associated with machines. A great deal of writing on Hoffmann thinks
                     through the problem of technology in terms of a static object (technological artefacts)
                     gaining increasing independence from their human creators. To be sure, Hoffmann thematizes
                     this problem, one that dogged philosophers and poets throughout the nineteenth century.

                     factories that used humans as tools rather than the other way around. Nor is Hoffmann
                     focused on abstract questions of human rights, good forms of government, and so forth,
                     rather instead on the space between those things, the very social arena which would
                     eventually welcome the terms <em>Technik</em>, technology, or the French <em>technologie</em>. And it is this determination of the fictional space that suggests a deeper affinity
                     between his fiction and <em>Technologie</em>, the exploration of the failure of sovereignty to control the market through control
                     of production. <em>Technologie</em> disappears as a term even as the instance of monarchy fades. It is replaced with <em>Technik</em> and the sovereign-less space of “market” capitalism increases.

                     </div> This privatization of “technological” social regulation is precisely what Hoffmann
                     produces in his fiction. That fiction cannot replace sovereignty, nor can it directly
                     slow or alter the course of that dialectical shift in instrumentality, from our use
                     of tools to our becoming-tool. But it can present that space as the rule of <em>Anschaulichkeit</em>, as the basis for and the substance of the “polishing” of the work of production.
                     Here, imagination is no longer reflection on alternate orders of things, but the direct
                     viewing of <em>this</em> order in its contingency, in its possibility as another order. And by divulging this
                     rule as intuition, Hoffmann produces the Serapiontic principle as the technology of
                     literature, neither spinning in a void of the imaginary nor bogged down in a tribunal
                     of precision in an attempt to imitate nature, but instead exploiting its distance
                     from that very nature (here, the social) to construct the nature of the social itself.
                     We thus see that literature and technology are not merely in competition, but share
                     a vocation that we can only “see” (<em>anschauen</em>) through engagement with fiction. That engagement, however, confers the infinite
                     responsibility of social production on us. This is what the smash hit proto-detective
                     novel <em>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</em>, dubbed quintessentially Serapiontic by the brethren, demonstrates.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">4. The Construction of the Historical as the Social—<em>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</em></span></h2>
               <p>It seems either nonsensical or tautological to say that literature might study and
                  produce its own object, as the police does, and as technology does. After all, the
                  object of narration is, by the definition of imagination in the eighteenth century,
                  not present. Thus it seems trivial to say that the object of fictional narrative is
                  produced in the telling; meanwhile, since fiction after Lessing seeks not to educate,
                  pursuing instead some more autonomous goal, as Paul Fleming as argued, it might seem
                  wrong-headed to say that it “studies” its object. But what if its object is the historical
                  reality that disciplinary production must fracture in order to know? What if literature,
                  like Kant’s philosophical faculty, offers an <em>Anschauung</em> of a more complex object than those disciplines allow? In other words, what if fiction
                  inherited the task of social administration? This might give intuitive meaning to
                  Shelley’s famous statement about poets as “legislators.” To be sure, Hoffmann did
                  not advocate, or practice, a confusion of fiction and law. But fiction allows a visible
                  space the law does not, one without direct consequences, one of Serapiontic suspension.
                  That suspension is instrumentalized: the phenomenon it fixes allows the fictional
                  space to be broader than any single discipline, and more concrete than the philosophical
                  faculty. That literature is neither law nor philosophy does not, however, prevent
                  its pretension from rising to the task of social construction. For as little as it
                  can intervene directly, this freedom precisely allows it to study and produce objects
                  as contingencies, possibilities, different orders with different systems of valuation,
                  precisely in order to interact with and reveal the valuations and their rules within
                  the present order. That is what I want to claim for <em>Scuderi</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>Scuderi</em> is breathtaking: it opens on the eponymous septuagenarian poet’s maid fending off
                     a possible robber from the estate in the middle of the night. The narrator digresses
                     at length to explain the maid’s fear, expounding the historical case (with some embellishments)
                     of Brinvillier, a woman who developed an untraceable poison, killing her father and
                     a number of others in Paris, leading to the atmosphere that had opened the novella.
                     A second rash of murders, this time brutal thefts of jewelry, have led the king, Louis
                     XIV, to establish the so-called <em>chambre ardente</em>, a special investigative committee the narrator compares to the inquisition. (The
                     extraordinary fact is that Hoffmann wrote the story before he was called to serve
                     in the <em>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</em>.) Scuderi learns slowly that it is the work of the master jeweler Cardillac that
                     is being stolen; the would-be robber makes another attempt to contact her about the
                     case. Cardillac is murdered, apparently by his soon-to-be son-in-law Olivier Brusson.
                     The police detective Desgrais comes into a kind of competition with Scuderi, who learns
                     rapidly that Brusson is a boy she had taken care of as a youth, one she considers
                     her son (his mother has since died). Convinced of his innocence—especially because
                     of the wide-eyed frank grief of Madelon, Cardillac’s daughter—Scuderi attempts to
                     intervene, consulting a lawyer and entreating the police and eventually the king.
                     Brusson reveals what he knows, which is that Cardillac was obsessively killing those
                     who bought his works, and retrieving his products. The plot does not resolve through
                     the efforts of Scuderi as detective,

                              received a twist from Kittler in Dichter Mutter Kind 197–219 (esp. pp. 213–15), to
                              the effect that the pure material codes of detection were constrained by the family
                              as the basis of semiotics around 1800.</span></div>
                     </div> but because Cardillac’s killer, Miossens, steps forward with the truth. But the <em>chambre ardente</em> will not back down (the predictive power of the story for Hoffmann’s biography is
                     singular), and even as the population shifts to Brusson’s side, the king, annoyed
                     by the public fallout, drags out his decision. Scuderi brings Madelon to the court,
                     and convinces the king to release Brusson. Madelon and Brusson leave Paris for Geneva,
                     and the original owners of the stolen jewelry (those who are not dead, presumably)
                     have their property restored. Cardillac’s murders are traced to an incident between
                     his mother and a soldier during her pregnancy.</p>
               </div>
               <p>When the story finishes, the salon is impressed. We learn that Sylvester, who had
                  already announced his story’s reliance on Voltaire, has also drawn from an unlikelier
                  source, Wagenseil’s <em>Chronicle of Nuremberg</em>. The aesthetic judgment comes: <span class="quote">‘One called [the story] truly serapiontic, because, built on historical foundations,
                     it still climbs into the fantastic [<em>auf geschichtlichen Grund gebaut, doch hinaufsteige ins Fantastische</em>]. (4:853)’</span> The line seems to indicate the intertwining of the chronicle and the “night-side”
                  cause of Cardillac’s obsessive murders. And indeed, the first string of murders is
                  historical fact, the atmosphere of intensive urban policing that results in a clear
                  message to the present from the Paris of the Sun King. The hidden causes of crimes
                  cannot spare their doers, but also cannot be fully clarified by the courts. The story
                  then “climbs” into the “fantastical” through the figure of Cardillac. But as the long
                  tradition of understanding the story of the crimes as a <em>Krimi</em> or detective story shows, the effect of this fantastical element does not undermine
                  the social atmosphere established and maintained. It is clearly a story about power.</p>
               <p>It is this power that is “really seen,” and this thematization allows us to grasp
                  how the Serapiontic principle becomes narrative. Building on the suspension announced
                  in the first tale of the cycle, we here see that the historical ground of the story
                  is integrated with the fantastic; thus the “duplicity of all earthly being” is transferred
                  from the individual (Serapion) to society, and it is the history of that society that
                  occupies the narrative space. Argenson’s Paris, ruled in the fiction by his successor
                  La Regnie, is a police state in our contemporary sense, a repressive atmosphere in
                  which danger and fear dominate for all but the nobles and the king. The drama the
                  narrative expertly maximizes is based on this newer type of police, and the king’s
                  ultimate authority would come to haunt Hoffmann within a few years of his completion
                  of the story. Thus the police are not Justi’s but the clumsy Desgrais, who does in
                  fact read as an anticipation of Inspector Lestrade, only with the emphasis on the
                  irrational inquisitorial force behind him. He lets Cardillac slip through his hands,
                  and in a completely unexplained moment, witnesses him apparently pass through a solid
                  wall. Scuderi engages the administrative apparatus, gathering information and consulting
                  a lawyer, preparing for her attempt to convince the king to release Brusson. </p>
               <p>Dorothea von Mücke has characterized this rhetorical act as the recruitment of the
                  king “into the regime of biopower” (124, 127), relying on Friedrich Kittler’s demonstration
                  that Scuderi both produces the “positive knowledge of the human” (203–04) and the
                  regime of signification associated with the discursive and institutional shifts Foucault
                  identified around 1800: “Hoffmann’s story, as the first example of its genre, is thus
                  simultaneously the effect and the instrument of a discourse-mutation” (216). But what
                  discourse is being mutated? As I have proposed, it is the shift in administration
                  as sociotechnology, and the discipline known as technology itself, that provides the
                  discursive background. The narrative shows us that the king’s decision is at least
                  partly subject to the social shift towards emphasis on biopower itself. In the Enlightened
                  monarchy, administration slowly gains the upper hand, and as the monarchy is forced
                  to retreat into the complex Europe of the mid-nineteenth century, bureaucracy and
                  industry form a historical alliance that was still called <em>Technologie</em>. Hoffmann’s novella can only be the “instrument” of that mutation, however, if we
                  re-read the judgment of the brethren. It builds a “historical ground” not in the sense
                  that it is drawn from a chronicle. Hoffmann is tongue-in-cheek here; the history is
                  the mutation itself. And its “climb into the fantastic” should then also be revised:
                  not Cardillac’s “night side,” not his disappearance through the wall, not the alchemy
                  of the Brinvillier subplot. The “fantastic” <em>also</em> functions as the alternate to the historical, the factor that allows the fictional
                  space to mimick the changing role of administration. This allows a “technological”
                  ambition to emerge within the narrative, which focuses its reader on a more complete
                  historical image than any discipline can produce, and then proposes the possibility
                  that this image could be altered. This fiction supplies active organs where only passive
                  ones had been. It produces the space for studying its object, otherwise not available,
                  and it retains the possibility of altering that space. The upshot of <em>Scuderi</em> is that we must “really see” a historical ground shot through with the possibility
                  of differentiation. The desperation of Brusson and his “mother” Scuderi reflects the
                  trap of the powers that crystallize from this order, but the novella visualizes the
                  order itself, produces it as an imaginary object. The imagination cannot directly
                  intervene or impose its freedom on the bureaucratic and discursive grid it alone can
                  produce. But it is itself a factor—a lack or a luxury—in that grid, and one that has
                  the ability to navigate between the concrete and the general. When we see its generalized
                  function, and its ambition to address that generality through its singular narrative
                  formation, we can see what the literature of biopower might be. And this is what late
                  Romanticism in Hoffmann’s version offers: a realism that, by re-presenting the totality
                  of the real <em>as possible</em>, offers a kind of technology that parallels that discipline. That is, a kind of possibility
                  that presents a dwindling yet crucial space for an alternate real, because it is the
                  vehicle of representation that increasingly alone allows for this progressive picture. Thus
                  what seems a merely given “story”—as in the Chronicle of Nuremberg—must be imaginatively
                  constructed into its <em>own order</em>. This is the production of the historical object, which, for the Serapion-circle, <em>must go through the fantastic</em>—“climb” into it—in order to count as a study of the object. In other words, the oblique
                  bearing that the Voltairean tale has on the totality of social relations in the present
                  is based precisely in the detour of fictionality that first constitutes the historical
                  object, that first allows us the imaginative space to conceive of it as part of a
                  set of relations, a social whole. A fiction that offers this space to its reader is technological,
                  because it retains the formal characteristics of that discipline: it is both production
                  and study of an object, namely production itself. The object of this fiction is, however,
                  not “technological” in the modern sense, but instead something approximating what
                  we call sociotechnology, which can only take form as the production of culture. The technology<em> </em>of culture is therefore literature as Hoffmann writes it. <em>Serapion</em> is a generic template for the international nineteenth century, its influence extending
                  to the U.S.A. and to Russia, among others. Perhaps that is in part because underlying
                  its literally fantastic fireworks is the murky urgency of modernity as the fateful
                  synthesis of administration and machines.</p>
               <p>As the story ends, there is not much to support the brothers’ assertion that it has
                  “climbed into the fantastic”—while the explanation of the crime is occult, the withdrawal
                  of the lovers to Rousseau’s hometown and the restitution of the jewels to their owners’
                  families are perfectly banal. But the combination of the salon and the story within
                  it shows us Hoffmann’s technique, which is to take given eidetic story-content and
                  re-imagine it as the transition of power, the shifting of instance from a monarchical
                  state/society complex to something more nebulous. The narration contains a layer of
                  knowledge that it does not exactly visualize: the knowledge of the passage to an order
                  in which power is diffuse, the end of unilateral sovereignty. But in doing this, it
                  presents a new task of fiction, one that we can call “technological.”</p>
               <p>Here fiction itself becomes technological in a historical sense, and inherits the
                  task of social administration that was the only meaning of <em>Technologie</em> at the time. After the Enlightenment, social administration was privatized, and in
                  a sense, so was literature, amounting to a channel of public information about massive
                  spheres of unregulatable activity. It became, and perhaps is still, a privileged area
                  for gaining an imaginary grasp on the <em>longue durée</em> and its crystallization in the social form of the present. In Hoffmann, this “grasp”
                  meant the possibility of reconceiving the social as such, of altering its very constitution
                  through producing it in narrative form. The police is no longer needed to intervene
                  at every level of society, guiding the process of history; technological fiction would
                  replace it by producing new historical conditions of possibility.</p>

               can be found in Lehleiter and Liebrand. Liebrand speaks of a turn from a “negative
               aesthetic” in which life and poetry can only annihilate one another to a “positive”
               aesthetic of mediations. I would only specify that this later aesthetic has the disciplinary
               ambition of a historical “technology,” meaning that Hoffmann is closer to Novalis’s
               “logarithmization” of the world than Liebrand will allow (10).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of the philosophy of history and the theory of the novel. This is the space where
               “story” and “history” substitute for each other in turn and where cognitive tropology
               and performance coincide” (<em>The Game of Probability </em>376).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               an apolitical but otherwise free <em>citoyen</em>-as-hermit, and a policeable world of external deeds (469–71). I think the two are
               re-integrated in fiction, which thus bears on social construction in a way individual
