            Maryland by David Rettenmaier, Technical Editor at <title level="m">Romantic
              Circles</title>, with assistance from Site Manager Jeffrey Moro. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was
            made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref>
            tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI
            renders text in archival quality for better preservation and future access.
            Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the
            XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

            is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
            investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of
            Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these
            interrelated domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes
            as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand,
            dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the
            other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and
            theoretical discussions of today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed
            to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing
            of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article links E.T.A Hoffmann's prose to the neglected Enlightenment university discipline <emph>Technologie</emph> as invented by the polymath Johann Beckmann. The connection between narrative and technology occurs not at the level of symbols or in diegesis but in the manipulation of form, which had consequences for the construal of life outside the constraints of emergent disciplines like medicine, forensic psychology, and the changing institution of the police. Narrative prose came to occupy the position of that police, producing the object of its own analysis—society—with intent to alter it. </p>

                  <p>When one Daniel Schmolling, following a notion that he could not rid himself of, murdered his erstwhile consort Henriette Lehne outside the
          Hasenheide in Berlin in 1818, the Berlin court system’s forensic efforts failed to find a motive. Schmolling admitted the deed, describing
          the first occurrence of the idea of the murder three weeks before its execution. It was not a passionate act, seemed to benefit him neither
          financially nor emotionally. The doctor called on to examine the criminal, Merzdorff, pronounced Schmolling incapable of standing trial on
          the basis of a diagnosis then much in vogue: <emph>amentia occulta</emph>, or “hidden insanity,” articulated by the famous anthropologist
          Ernst Platner. The case was placed on the docket of E.T.A. Hoffmann, criminal judge for the superior court [<emph>Kammergericht</emph>].
          Hoffmann’s interest in strange and occult psychological phenomena is well known, the fact that he also played a significant role in the
          legal order of the Prussian state in a time of upheaval perhaps less so.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Mangold.
          </note> Schmolling’s case brought Hoffmann’s two professional personae into uncomfortable proximity<note place="foot" resp="editors"> His
            letter to his publisher Kunz of 24 May 1815, written from the courtroom, attests to his usual sanguinity on this issue (<emph>Sämtliche
              Werke</emph> 6:70–72). Translations from Hoffmann are mine unless otherwise noted.</note>, and he produced a lengthy rejection of
          Merzdorff’s diagnosis, leading his longtime friend and fellow criminal judge Julius Eduard Hitzig to state that he had overstepped his
          bounds. Hoffmann maintained that while there could theoretically be invisible insanity, it could not play a role in the law, writing:
        <quote>In the first place it should be noted that the actual field in which the doctor’s science moves, namely the knowledge
            [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] of the physical human organism, certainly does not in and of itself also cover the psychic organism, but instead
          knowledge [<emph>Erkenntnis</emph>] of this principle of spirit, insofar as it is possible, would have to be based on completely different
          premises. For this reason, Kant assigned the investigation of the state of the mind [<emph>Gemütszustand</emph>] entirely to the
          philosophical faculty . . . [w]hereas Metzger, Reil and Hoffbauer object primarily because a doctor who has a general philosophical
          education, such as is only appropriate for a court doctor, can more easily obtain the knowledge [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] necessary for him to
          judge derangements of the spirit [<emph>Geisteszerrüttungen</emph>], than the philosopher can assimilate the knowledge
            [<emph>Kenntnis</emph>] of medical doctrines and necessary for the same purpose, as well as the needed skill in investigation, which
          latter the doctor gains through therapeutic practice. (<emph>Sämtliche Werke</emph> 6.699)</quote>
        What Schmolling’s case presents is a conflict between the philosophical and medical faculties in the form of a judicial problem. Hoffmann
          is already flaunting his knowledge of contemporary psychological literature<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hoffmann’s extraordinary
            knowledge of this field was first gained during his years in Bamberg (1808–13), which are also the years immediately preceding the
            beginning of his literary output, starting in 1814. See Segebrecht.</note>—Johann Christian Reil was a favorite, although Hoffmann here
          takes issue with his Germanification of <emph>amentia occulta</emph> as “<emph>Wut ohne Verkehrtheit</emph>” [<emph>rage without
            dementia</emph>]. Reil was both dean of the medical faculty at the new Humboldt University and slowly gaining administrative oversight of
          medical institutions throughout Prussia. His duties moved in the realm of what was then still called “<emph>medizinische Polizei</emph>,”
          the branch of administration of the state that applied health policies (in Reil’s case, especially military hospitals). Hoffmann displayed
          no hesitancy in rejecting the medical opinion of the man who had coined the term “psychiatry,” and whose clinical work was at the cutting
            edge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On Reil, see Richards 252–89.</note> Hoffmann had cited precisely the impediment to the
          development of a scientific psychiatry: Immanuel Kant. Kant’s insistence that the sciences be based on mathematical demonstration stalled
          and shifted the emergence of psychology and biology in particular (Kant 4:468).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the rehabilitation of
            psychology and the new wave of altered Kantianism following the works of Herbart, see Lenoir, “Operationalizing Kant.” See also Lenoir’s
              <emph>The Strategy of Life </emph>and Richards on Kant’s disputed role in the founding of biology. </note> His epochal <emph>Conflict of
            the Faculties </emph>(1798), which defends the philosophical faculty as the intellectual and institutional heart of the university,
          confronts the “pure reason” of that faculty with its less rational sister faculties. The legal and religious faculties, tied as they are to
          the functioning of the state, cannot guide reason—rather <emph>vice versa</emph>. But when it comes to the medical faculty, Kant pulls his
          punch, describing the collegial problematics arising from Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland’s <emph>The Art of Extending Human Life </emph>(1797),
          and recommending a series of dietetic measures to maintain “life-force” in the aging body. Hufeland, like Reil involved in the policing of
          medicine at the beginning of the nineteenth century in Prussia, posited a life-force that could be maintained and strengthened through
          vigilance. The problem that had driven so much of Kant’s monumental output—the body-soul problem—did not even appear. Precisely this
          difficult relationship would need to be judged—for Hoffmann, was being judged incorrectly—in criminal investigations. In appealing to Kant,
          Hoffmann is referring to the framework of the <emph>Conflict</emph> as expressed in the <emph>Anthropology</emph>: 
        <quote>Thus if someone deliberately perpetrates some harm and now the question is, whether and how he is guilty, and thus first it must be
          decided, whether he was crazy at the time or not, then the court cannot send him to the medical faculty, but instead (because of the
          incompetence of the court) to the philosophical faculty. For the question: whether the accused, at the time of his deed, in possession of
          his natural faculties of understanding and judging, is completely psychological, and even if the bodily derangement of the organs of its
          soul [<emph>körperliche Verschrobenheit der Seelenorganen</emph>] could perhaps sometimes be the cause of an unnatural infringement of the
          law of duty (which resides in each human), still the doctors and physiologists are not at all yet so far as to be able to grasp the machine
          in the human [<emph>Maschinenwesen im Menschen</emph>] deeply enough to explain the impulse [<emph>Anwandlung</emph>] to such a gruesome
          deed, or (without bodily anatomy) to predict it; and a <emph>legal medical doctrine </emph>(<emph>medicina forensis</emph>)—if it comes to
          the question, whether the mind of the criminal [<emph>Täter</emph>] in a crazed state, or has taken a decision with a healthy
          understanding—would be meddling in the business of others, of which the judge understands nothing, and can at most refer it to another
          faculty, since it does not belong to his forum. (Kant 7: 213-14)</quote>
        Hoffmann cites Kant as an authority to ward off Merzdorff and the other doctors. His decision, however, flies in the face of Kant’s
          rejection of legal expertise on the mind-body problem. For Hoffmann, the judge must do what psychiatry cannot yet do, and what the
          philosophical faculty in any case cannot be trusted to do: psychiatric forensics. The assumptions of the court were as simple as the
          verdict: without evidence, no insanity plea; lacking which, Schmolling was guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he
          murdered another inmate. He was beheaded on 30 May 1825 (Haack 87).</p>
                  <p> The case provided one of the models for Georg Büchner’s <emph>Woyzek</emph>, and one might be forgiven for not recognizing Hoffmann in the
          writing of the decision. His literary works have become a cipher for the fantastic, the unconscious, the pre-Freudian and Romantic
          engagement with demonic, magical themes, and the new technologies associated with them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> E.g. magic
            lanterns (Schmitz-Emans), automatic orchestras (Dolan); and human-simulating automata (Barkhoff 204). This angle has been explored by
            Kittler and also Andriopoulos (105–39). Cf. Gaderer 83. </note> The Schmolling case throws into relief a problem that runs throughout the
          literature on Hoffmann: namely, the question of disciplinary knowledge in his fictional output. Given his insistence on a liberal model of
          legal subjectivity—maintained, as we shall see, at the expense of his political position after 1819—it would be less than satisfying to cast
          fictional autonomy as a screen onto which Hoffmann’s massive learning is merely projected without consequence. In what follows, I argue that
          the problem of social administration and construction dovetails in Hoffmann’s work with that of what was a university discipline around

          Hoffmann’s fiction engages. I argue that narrative itself takes on the theoretical tasks of this “technological” administrative science, a
          shift that both adumbrates the difficulties of avant-garde aesthetics and calls for a reading of Hoffmann that reflects the ambition to
          diagnose the historical condition of society and provide a narrative space for the possibility of alternate syntheses of its apparent
          forward march. Underlying the epistemological effects of the fantastic and medial complications of technical artefacts is a disciplinary
          affinity that Hoffmann’s fiction intervenes in,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Excellent readings of media as representational strategy,
            rather than as content, can be found in Lehleiter and Liebrand. Liebrand speaks of a turn from a “negative aesthetic” in which life and
            poetry can only annihilate one another to a “positive” aesthetic of mediations. I would only specify that this later aesthetic has the
            disciplinary ambition of a historical “technology,” meaning that Hoffmann is closer to Novalis’s “logarithmization” of the world than
            Liebrand will allow (10).</note> reflecting the transformation of state and society that provided the context of the end of his life. The
          argument here extends a line of thinking begun by Friedrich Kittler and Dorothea von Mücke. Hoffmann’s narration, as I show on the example
          of <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>, deploys its trademark doppelgängers, automata, and uncanny effects as lures, to focus the
          imagination on the historical situation, and to free the faculties of the mind from the apparent necessities of the same.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I here slightly modify Rüdiger Campe’s insight into Romantic narration: “we may recognize the space that is simultaneously
            historical and constructs history—the space of “Romanticism,” of the philosophy of history and the theory of the novel. This is the space
            where “story” and “history” substitute for each other in turn and where cognitive tropology and performance coincide” (<emph>The Game of

          task. The outer edge of psychology—the embodied mind—must be policed, albeit by the Humanities. Hoffmann agreed, although he assigned
          himself as judge—and as author—of this task. If there was a police for medicine, then there would have to be some way to regulate
          psychological judgments as well. Even if he overstepped in the Schmolling case, Hoffmann accepted the charge Kant had left open, in the name

                  <p>Hoffmann’s <emph>Serapion-Brethren</emph> (1819–21) is a four-volume collection of stories of all kinds. The novellas, fairy tales, horror
          stories, and even a proto-detective novel are held together by a fictional salon, modeled on Hoffmann’s real-life group, the
            <emph>Seraphinenorden</emph>, which had included such figures as Hitzig, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, and Adalbert Chamisso. The
          salon-frame, in which the friends discuss the merits of the stories they tell each other, operates as irony in the sense Friedrich Schlegel
          had given to that term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Brown 51.</note> Following an opening frame discussion of the failures of most
          salons, the group of friends listens to Cyprian (likely modeled on Chamisso) narrate the life of a bureaucrat from an unnamed contemporary
          German town. Cyprian claims to have discovered this well-bred and educated man, who had disappeared some years before, living as a hermit
          with the conviction that he is the ancient Christian martyr Serapion, granted eternal life following his virtuous death. Cyprian makes
          inquiries, discovers the history of the bureaucrat, and, wanting to cure the “cheerful insanity” [<emph>heiterer Wahnsinn</emph>] of the
          anachorete, reads up on contemporary psychology—especially in the works of Phillippe Pinel and Reil. In order to disabuse Serapion of his
            <emph>idée fixe</emph> (which functions, if less violently, like that of Schmolling), Cyprian learns how to approach the patient
          delicately. His attempt fails. Serapion not only rejects the notion that he is the bureaucrat from the nearby town, but also engages Cyprian
          in a disquisition about the nature of perception, the reality of time and space, and the “duplicity of all being.” Cyprian’s friends are
          horrified, especially Lothar, who rejects the tale as irrational and terrifying. But after Theodor recounts the story of <emph>Counsel
            Krespel</emph>,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Hamilton 185–95.</note> Lothar recants, describing Serapion as the principle of
          poetry. The source of the story does not matter, he says, rather only that one should have “really seen” what one recounts:
        <quote>More! I honor Serapion’s insanity because only the spirit most excellent or rather the true poet can be seized by it . .
          . Whence comes it then, that some poetic work, which we would not at all call bad, if we are talking about form and execution
            [<emph>Ausarbeitung</emph>], remains nevertheless still as without effect as a faded image, that we are not transported by it, that the
          splendor of the words only serves to multiply the inner chill that runs through us. What other explanation, than that the poet has not
          really seen [<emph>nicht . . . wirklich schaute</emph>] what he speaks of, that the deed, the event [<emph>Begebenheit</emph>], depicting
          itself before his eyes, with pleasure, with all the horror, with all the exultation, with all the shudders, did not enthuse him, set him on
          fire, so that the inner flames might simply flow out in fiery words: in vain the labor of the poet, to bring us to believe in what he
          himself does not, because he has not himself truly viewed it [<emph>weil er es nicht erschaute</emph>]. What could the figures
            [<emph>Gestalten</emph>] of such a poet, who, according to the old saying, is not also a true seer, be, other than false dolls,
          laboriously glued together from heterogeneous materials!—Your hermit, my Cyprian, was a true poet, had really saw that [<emph>er hatte das
            wirklich geschaut</emph>] which he pronounced, and that is why his speech gripped both heart and mind [<emph>Gemüt</emph>].—Poor Serapion,
          what was your insanity other than that some hostile star had robbed you of the knowledge of that duplicity, by which in fact our earthly

          had been adopted as a narrative principle some half a century before by Christian Friedrich von Blankenburg, whose insistence on the
          adjective <emph>anschauend</emph> for the genre of the novel sometimes takes on comical proportions (such as in the construction
            <emph>anschauendst</emph>).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> E.g. “Rezension über “Die Leiden des jungen Werthers,” in Mandelkow 65–86,
            here 84. </note> Indeed, the remainder of Lothar’s speech seems to follow the Blankenburg model, too, which insists on maintaining a
          complex notion of causality of events as filtered through the subject/object divide (the “duplicity of all earthly being”):
        <quote>There is an inner world and the spiritual force, to view it in full clarity, in the most complete brilliance of the most
          lively life, but it is our earthly lot, that just this outer world, in which we are inserted,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Or
            “encapsulated”—on the lack of manuscript clarity between “eingeschachtet” and “eingeschachelt,” see Brown 49–50. </note> functions as the
          lever that sets that force moving [<emph>als der Hebel wirkt, der jene Kraft in Bewegung setzt</emph>]. The inner appearances are absorbed
            [<emph>gehen auf</emph>] in the circle which the outer ones form around us, the circle the spirit can only pass by in dark secretive
          presentiments which never form themselves into a distinct image [<emph>die sich nie zum deutlichen Bilde gestalten</emph>]. But you, o my
          hermit, established no outer world [<emph>statuiertest keine Außenwelt</emph>], you did not see the hidden lever, the force influencing your
          inner world; and if you claimed, with ghastly acuity, that it is only the spirit that sees, hears, feels, that grasps deeds and events, and
          that thus everything that it recognizes has also thus happened, you forgot that the external world forces the spirit banished into the body
          to those functions of perception arbitrarily. Your life, dear anachorete, was a constant dream, from which you in your beyond certainly did
          not painfully awake.—(4:68–69). </quote>
          Outer impressions, Lothar tells his friends, form a circle that engulfs the inner impressions in everyday life; but if, like Serapion, we do not “establish an outer world,” we may reach an extension of internal images that are not merely “internal” but instead do not suffer from the duplicity of our intellect. It is the unfolding of such images that makes up the Serapiontic principle, the discovery of a phenomenological form that underlies the causality of realist prose, and in this sense is supradisciplinary. Literature does what law cannot. Lothar is here recombining the elements of Cyprian’s narrative, doing precisely what the principle rejects: summarizing as a discursive construct that which has been set before our eyes as narrative content. Thus Blankenburg’s notion of penetrating the relationship between the images and events of lived life could not be further from the Romantic
          principle, which collapses that external causality and thereby suspends the theory of the novel in favor of a different philosophy of
          history. Lothar’s theory of fiction also demands the extension of eidetic content in the interest of narrative framing, but rejects tying
          this framing to any mimicking of “earthly being,” or the finitude of the human intellect. Crucially, Lothar thinks that this means that
          Serapion dreams life, or takes the events of the spirit, which alone hears, sees, and feels, for “actual events.” This is in keeping with
          the usual sense of Hoffmann’s work: the “fantastic” is a suspension of reason, the opening of a playful space of dark and technological
          fantasies, the creation of those unnoticed, perhaps even unnoticeable, relations in the psyche that would later come to be demystified by
          Freud. But this reading comes up short.</p>
                  <p>In fact, Lothar misreads Cyprian and therefore Serapion, because he retains for narrative the difference between “external events” and the
          “dream” or “insanity” that allows them to be recombined in narrative. For Serapion—and, I would suggest, for Hoffmann—the notion of
          “external event” or <emph>Begebenheit</emph> cannot recur, because this would be the <emph>reinscription of an external world</emph>, and
          therefore a violation of the principle itself. Narrative simply does not respect the “inner/outer” distinction, and aims instead at an
          arrangement of elements that “never form themselves into a distinct image.” What can never be imagined is the interface between the inner
          and the outer, and this applies to text and knowledge equally. If the narrative does not respect this difference, but never allows for a
          fully distinct image of the interface, then it is precisely where the image fails that the epistemic effects of the narrative begin to work.
          Causality cannot form narrative because causes are half-conceptual, but images provide something other than themselves, some excess that is
          neither “inner” nor “outer” but instead a <emph>sui generis </emph>“knowledge.” This narrative becomes a singular engagement with an object,
          because that object is produced <emph>in this singular way for the first time</emph> in narrative, and the narrative stands to redound on
          the object itself, changing it. This production obscures the abstraction “object” and allows the poetic production to have an
          unrepresentable interface with whatever noumenon stands behind the abstraction. In other words, the Serapiontic principle creates a poetic
          site of production. Lothar’s statement, which is a compromise of aesthetic principles in the ongoing conversation of the brethren, is a step
          back from Cyprian’s more radical—and, I want to argue, more fundamental—sense of the search for an arrangement of narrated elements that, as
          Lothar himself puts it, “never form themselves into a distinct image.” Formation is not restricted to the visualization-techniques of the
          narrative, opening a separate and mixed-mode epistemic layer in the telling. We can see this in two exemplary stories from the cycle:
            <emph>The Automata</emph>, and <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>.</p>
                  <p>The protagonists of E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <emph>The Automata</emph> (published in 1814, later included in the <emph>Serapion Brethren</emph>)
          find themselves at a crucial point in the narrative discussing the uncanny presentation of automatic music they have just heard at the
          laboratory of one Professor X. The story, which recounts Ferdinand’s subjection to a form of demonic power—we never learn whether it is machinic,
          psychopathological, or both—follows an encounter with a fictional alternate of Wolfgang von Kempelen’s famous “chess-playing Turk.” For
          Ferdinand, his compatriot Ludwig, and the intradiegetic polite society, the automaton is an oracle. It predicts that Ferdinand will, like
          Orpheus, lose the love he is obsessed with upon one last sighting of her. The prediction, of course, turns out to be true, although it
          appears to fulfill itself, using Ferdinand’s unhealthy fascination as the motor of its simultaneously fantastical and social causality. The
          episode with Professor X, however, presents the reader with a discussion of the principle of the narrative by those caught in the same
          narrative, which in turn is a mirroring of the generic ploy of the <emph>Serapion Brethren</emph>, in that the tales illustrate the
          principles of their discussion even as those principles are interrogated on the continuing presentation of new areas of exploration
          (genres). The sequence of scenes involving Professor X, then, reads as a <emph>mise-en-abîme</emph>. The “Serapiontic principle” is both the
          content and the genre of the larger collection and <emph>The Automata</emph>. </p>
                  <p>The arc of the episode with Professor X is as follows: the inquirers Ferdinand and Ludwig visit the professor and listen to his various
          musical automata; a discussion of what human music is follows; the protagonists then hear what they take to be a pure example of this—a
          small girl singing in the grass—only to see Professor X smiling terrifyingly behind her, walking through the garden and apparently
          enlivening the plant-life around him as he goes. In this last moment, the narrator is silent. It is not suggested that the girl is an
          automaton: the professor’s presence suggests instead the inability to determine the difference between human and machine music. </p>
                  <p>The difference at issue in the discussion falls in the middle of the episode. Ferdinand, who is the object of the oracular and tragic
          narrative, listens to his skeptical friend Ludwig detail what he confirms are their common objections to the professor’s presentation. The
          problem is that the music is too good. It sounds like it possesses the spirit that only a human touch should produce. Ludwig grasps at the
          opposite end of the contradiction: when music played by humans is not imbued with passion, we call it “mechanical”; what should we do when
          actually mechanical music sounds human? 
        <quote>To want to have musical effects through valves, springs, levers, cylinders and whatever else belongs to the mechanical apparatus, is
            <emph>the nonsensical attempt</emph> to achieve <emph>through means alone</emph> that which [the organs of the body] can carry out, only
          enlivened through the inner force of the mind [<emph>Gemüt</emph>] and regulated in their smallest movements by that very force. (4:419; my
          emphasis) </quote>
        It is literally “senseless” to allow “means alone” to complete tasks that only the truly human soul should be capable of. It is not their
          material characteristics but their connection to the “inner force” of the spirit that separate bodily organs from mere instruments. Ludwig
          sharpens his polemic, grasping for a difference between organs and machines, and opens Hoffmann’s story onto a vast conceptual problematic
          that ties the narrative back to the overall project:
        <quote>The striving of the machinists, increasingly <emph>to imitate </emph>[<emph>nachahmen</emph>] <emph>or through mechanical means to replace
            human organs</emph> that produce musical tones, is for me a declaration of war against the spiritual principle, the power of which only
          more brilliantly triumphs, the more apparent forces are opposed to it. (4:420–21) </quote>
        Mechanical mimesis of the capacities of human organs is war against the “spirit,” and human organs are the expression of a cosmological
          harmony that our petty inventions and instruments merely mimic. Thus:
        <quote>In that ur-period of the human race, when it—to use the words of an ingenious author (Schubert in the “Views from the Night-Side of Natural
          Science”), lived in its first holy harmony with nature, filled with the divine instinct of prophecy and poetry [<emph>Dichtkunst</emph>],
          when the human spirit did not capture nature, but instead nature the spirit, and the mother still nourished from the depth of her being the
          delightful creature she had borne, there she surrounded the human like in the wafting of an eternal ecstasy with holy music, and wonderful
          tones [<emph>Laute</emph>] announced the secrets of her eternal pulsing [<emph>Treiben</emph>] (4:421)</quote>
        The music of the spheres describes the original undifferentiated state of humans and nature, in a passage cited and transcribed from
          Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert’s <emph>Views from the Night-Side of Natural Science </emph>(1808).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
            Schmitz-Emans, “Naturspekulation” and Barkhoff 213 ff. and 209. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Schubert’s <emph>Views</emph>, originally a series of lectures delivered in 1808, starts with the premise that only a full history of the
          human relation to nature can complete the scientific picture. The necessary elements of that history are the primordial unity of man and
          nature, an account of the split and the collateral epistemic effects of that split, and the principled possibility of a re-unification. The
          “night-side” of that history comprises strange moments of possible reconciliation, especially those associated with Mesmer and animal
          magnetism. Schubert’s conviction is cast in terms of the organs that Hoffmann draws on for his <emph>Automata</emph>:
        <quote>Usually that which happens according to a necessary law of nature unites in it that particular perfection, autonomy and purposiveness that
          is particular to nature in all its workings. We seldom find that the natural drive is subject to illusions or mistakes
            [<emph>Misgriff</emph>], but in a certain way the will is. We must regard the things that exercise such an artificial drive
            [<emph>Kunsttrieb</emph>] or instinct as immediate organs of nature, which individuals subordinate the more to themselves the less perfect
          they are (28).</quote>
        Organs are immediate expressions of harmony. But <emph>we</emph> are not organs, because the will—and rational activity—are somehow severed
          from this connection: “If at that time the human was an organ of nature, then he was this in his way,—human” (29). The separation from
          animals—who, for Schelling, Schubert’s teacher, possess the “artificial drive” [<emph>Kunsttrieb</emph>]—goes by way of fault. The notion of
          the human as “the being of lack” [<emph>Mängelwesen</emph>] has its <emph>locus classicus</emph> in Schubert’s other guiding light, Johann
          Gottfried Herder. Here, however, the lack suggests eventual reconciliation with the higher order: humans are organs of nature, just like
          animals, but the disconnect between their literal organs and their will (subject to judicial discipline for Kant as for Hoffmann) makes them
          open to the development of more organs. But Hoffmann derives more than the notion of “nature-music” or a fundamental harmony from Schubert.
          It is clear that Ludwig’s insistence on the difference between organs and instruments cannot be maintained; <emph>Geist</emph> seems turned,
          in the <emph>mise-en-abîme</emph> conversation, against both external mechanical devices and the harmonious organs of the body, in
          cooperation with which the spirit produces illusions, tricks—misfires. The mesmeric doctrine will suggest the development of alternate
          organs among these, but the problem will persist. The specificity of sense-perception and the generality of both reason and the will bind
          the human to the earthly being Hoffmann calls “duplicitous.” </p>
                  <p> The citation of Schubert in the context of the discussion of instruments is a moment of high narrative irony, for it refers us back to the
          principle that supposedly drives the narrative. When Cyprian had approached Serapion to disabuse him of his illusions, he had offered to
          show the anachorete the town he hailed from, in which he had been a member of the administration. Cyprian thought to convince the hermit
          merely by mentioning the presence of the town, a mere two hours away. Serapion’s response reveals the radicality of the principle: if
          Cyprian’s reason dictates that that past be taken as real event, why cannot Serapion’s version of things be equally valid? At the limit, why
          should either the duration of time (some fifteen centuries) or distance from the town prove anything to Serapion? 
        <quote>Indeed, what hears, what sees, what feels in us?—perhaps the dead machines, which we call eye—ear—hand etc., and not the spirit?—Does the
          spirit perhaps form its world, conditioned by space and time, internally, on its own account, and then leave those functions to another
          principle that dwells within us?—How absurd! If it is thus the spirit alone, that grasps the events before us, then that which it recognizes
          also really happened. (4:34)</quote>
        Organs, in other words, are in conflict with the form-giving principle of spirit, which cannot be divided between inner and outer. Like the
          specific eidetic content of the story <emph>The Automata</emph>—Ferdinand’s love, the prophecy, its uncertain but all-too-real
          fulfillment—the reports of the external organs are in conflict with the overarching constructive principle of the spirit, or by analogy the
          construction of narrative. This conflict is what creates the irony of <emph>The Automata</emph> as part of the <emph>Serapion</emph>-cycle.
          Hoffmann’s narrative does not resolve its issue; the Serapiontic principle is not meant to do that. The report from the letter to Ludwig
          cannot be trusted, especially as Professor X has never left town—Ferdinand cannot have seen him elsewhere. The uncanny effect is that the
          prophecy is fulfilled, though whether through Ferdinand’s obsession, the magnetic powers of Professor X, or some combination, we do not
          know. The conflict between content and narrative logic can only be solved by causal suggestions, turns of story or of understanding—whether
          intradiegetically or in the frame-discussions—that provide clues to the <emph>Gestalt</emph> of the narrative space. Hoffmann frustrates
          this expectation, and inscribes this frustration as the very principle of the cycle. In other words, he has deranged our organs, made
          visible (<emph>anschauend</emph>) the very conflict between empirical experience and the rational container that grasps it. The <emph>idée
            fixe</emph>—that one could be a centuries-dead martyr, that one must murder one’s love—is, for Hoffmann, a matter of attention and thrall.
          One falls into a kind of hypnosis to an idea of no apparent origin, but the will is bound to it.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> cf.
            Hoffmann 6:421. </note> This derangement cuts both ways: it is a failure of our disciplined minds and a reminder of the ultimate falsity
          of disciplinary knowledge. But the bracketing of space and time, the flirtation with the obsession of fixed ideas, simply underscore
          Serapion’s ability to present excellent novellas to Cyprian. It is not merely this ironic bracketing of duality that Hoffmann’s narration
          aims at. In fact, this is merely the Serapiontic principle in its radical version, the version Lothar misrecognizes but cannot suppress. The
          space of this narrative is then itself trained on different objects, in order to study the historical situation and perform variations of
          it, in order to let some light into the rush to social control that Hoffmann was observing and participating in during his collection and
          composition of the cycle. </p>

                  <head>3. From the Police to Technology: Semantics and Social History</head>
                  <p>The last market vignette in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s <emph>My Cousin’s Corner Window</emph> consists of a fight that breaks out in the observed
          crowd. The ailing cousin and the “I” in the dialogue look on as this threat of violence gets the attention of the police, who cannot push
          through the crowd in time to stop the fight, like an ambulance in rush hour. A kind of ekphrasis follows: the aggressor stands, his hand
          raised and ready to strike. The gaze of the narrative’s observers lingers on this image. But the man does not strike, the crowd intervenes,
          and by the time the police arrive, the incident is already over. The “I” remarks:
        <quote>The fight is over—without the help of the police . . . so there in fact reigns in the people a sense for the conservation of order
            [<emph>ein Sinn für die zu erhaltende Ordnung</emph>]. (6:493)</quote>
        To which the invalid replies:
        <quote>
                        <emph>The cousin</emph>: My dear cousin, my observations of the market have above all strengthened me in the opinion that a strange change
          has occurred with the people of Berlin since that unfortunate period when a bold, boisterous enemy flooded over the country and in vain
          attempted to suppress its spirit, which soon sprung up again with renewed force like a violently coiled spring. In a word: the people has
          gained in external propriety [<emph>Sittlichkeit</emph>] . . . (6:494)</quote>
        Order was once preserved by the police, and is now conferred as a task on citizens. The transfer of <emph>Ordnungssinn</emph> has a
          historical event as its proximate cause, namely the German and French skirmishes that began with the First Revolutionary War, and ended with
          Napoleon’s defeat—but not before he had ended the Holy Roman Empire and introduced widely differing and semi-autonomous overhauls of its of
          civil and administrative legal core. Maybe the cousin’s story here is too simple: the late Enlightenment states were already in the process
          of modernizing their law books when Goethe observed the siege of Mainz in 1793. But the cousin pinpoints an issue that is central to the
          shift that was still dramatically in process when E.T.A. Hoffmann took up his position as judge in the high criminal court in Berlin in
          1814/15. As the sole locale of the holistic representation of large-scale historical and population-level processes and as a site of
          intervention into them, Hoffmann’s narrative inherits the task of adminstrating the social. Or in other words, narrative does what the
          police were expected to do at the close of the <emph>Corner Window</emph>. It engages just in the moment of that ekphrasis, and is the
          potential site of the material production of value. Narrative replaces the police.</p>
                  <p>It was the police who frustrated any possible happiness at the end of Hoffmann’s life. The liberal radicalism that led to Karl Ludwig
          Sand’s assassination of Kotzebue on 23 March 1819 included the celebratory burning of conservative books at the so-called
            <emph>Wartburg-Fest</emph> in 1817. Among these books was the <emph>General Codex for the Gendarmerie</emph> of Karl Albert von Kamptz,
          Director of the Ministry of Police.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Safranski 457. </note> It was Kamptz who would later bring
          Hoffmann to grief after he was viciously parodied in Hoffmann’s <emph>Master Flea</emph>, Kamptz who would surreptitiously receive
          correspondence about that work that indicated Hoffmann understood he had cited from court records, Kamptz who would attempt to have Hoffmann
          removed from the bench, a fate he likely escaped only by dying in 1822, while the accusations were still being evaluated. Kamptz’s work,
          however, has an informative title: he is writing about the behavior of policemen, or what we today call the “police.” Hoffmann follows this
          usage, too. This term was, as the repressive tactics of Metternich’s <emph>Vormärz</emph> settled on the German-speaking lands in the 1820s,
          in flux. It had once named a grander administrative effort that, as we have seen above, included medicine, care for the poor, and nutrition.
            <emph>Polizei</emph> was in fact simply the administration of the welfare of the subjects of the king, and it was only as state and
          society became analytically separated after 1800<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stolleis puts the beginning of this separation process at
            around 1750, which indicates that the scientific literature on police was already a part of this transformation (379).</note> that the
          term slowly reduced itself to the personnel, the policeman, the embodied potential violence at the base of every possible state apparatus.
          These shifts in conception and practice of state administration were front and center when Hoffmann was appointed, on 16 September 1819, to
          the <emph>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</emph>, a body established to handle the political cases against the new radicals
            (<emph>Demagogen</emph>)<emph>.</emph> Hoffmann agreed to this appointment, but was skeptical, and held a line between deeds and attitudes
          that fits nicely into our contemporary notions of democratic liberalism, whether German or American. He insisted, crucially, on the
          innocence of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, founder of the athletics movement called the <emph>Turnbewegung</emph>, and finally won, against Kamptz,
          Jahn’s freedom. Jahn then sued Kamptz for libel, and Hoffmann accepted the trial. An auction of authority began, with those attempting to
          quash the trial extending upward to chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg, the influential liberal reformer. Hoffmann stood his ground: his
          brief was subject only to the will of the king, and no one else could be excepted from standing before the law. This explains Kamptz’s zeal
          in pursuing the censorship case, but it also provides us with a window onto Hoffmann’s lived experience of the shifting ground of state
          politics in the German-speaking lands at the crucial moment after Napoleon’s defeat. Jahn in particular and the “demogogues” in general have
          been taken to be a model of Serapion, whose cheerful insanity thus takes on a political overtone, a matter for the psychological
            police.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Safranski, Hoffmann assigns fiction the unrestrained inner world, thus formulating an
            apolitical but otherwise free <emph>citoyen</emph>-as-hermit, and a policeable world of external deeds (469–71). I think the two are
            re-integrated in fiction, which thus bears on social construction in a way individual disciplines cannot.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> We need to know what the “police” means, how its practice as an institution and university discipline in the Enlightened monarchy bears on
          the dissolution of that monarchy itself, to see that Hoffmann’s judicial practice in no way debars Serapiontic realities, that in fact the
          fiction is meant to think through, or rather put <emph>ante oculos</emph>, the potential encapsulated in the very social transformation of
          the early nineteenth century. And this was simultaneously a matter of those organs of perception and machine function that figured the
          Seraptionic principle in <emph>The Automata</emph> and those organs of administration called <emph>Polizei</emph> and
            <emph>Technologie</emph>. In other words, what drives Hoffmann’s narrative technique is the simultaneous collapse of Enlightened monarchy
          and its social-administrative efforts, and the rise of the factory system through means those administrative efforts had originally
          developed. </p>
                  <p> One central branch of that administration, so long as it was not conceived of as separate from society, was called <emph>Polizei</emph>.
          The term <emph>police</emph>, as we use it today to mean the institution, activity, and especially the persons carrying out the function, is
          a narrow precipitate from a much larger discipline that existed throughout Europe from roughly the fifteenth century to the end of the
          eighteenth. The Grimm dictionary traces its evolving meaning chronologically. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries,
            <emph>polizey</emph> meant “government, administration and order, especially a kind of oversight of moral in state and community
            [<emph>staat und gemeinde</emph>].” Derived from <emph>policy</emph> and usually combined in the compound <emph>gute policey</emph>, the
          administrative efforts of the police were not separated from the state itself—they were, in fact, merely the morally controlled organization
          of that state and community. The phrase <emph>staat und gemeinde</emph> is telling: “<emph>und</emph>” collapses what the modern reader
          instinctively takes as two separate notions into a single area for police operation. Until deep into the eighteenth century one could speak
          of a “police state,” replaced only slowly in the early nineteenth century with the so-called <emph>Rechtsstaat</emph>, often traced
          intellectually to Wilhelm von Humboldt’s <emph>Ideas for an Attempt to Determine the Limits of the Efficacy of the State</emph> (1792).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Stolleis 385, where Wilhelm von Humboldt’s famous writing on the limits of state power of 1792 is
            characterized as the heart of the new liberalism, although early and “removed from reality.” </note>
                     <emph>Polizeistaat</emph> shares with our current notion of a “police state” the totalizing continuity of state and society, the
          intervention of the government to make the single object state/society “better.” But that is where the similarity ends. Images of repressive
          police violence, state rhetorics of control and order, bear little resemblance to the “<emph>ordnung</emph>” in the Grimms’ definition. That
          order was in fact of a different kind, an attempt to produce happiness [<emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>] in the state/society through the
          administration of land, production, roads, the poor and the sick. Thus the baroque second definition of the Grimms:</p>
                  <quote>
                     <hi rend="bold">a)</hi>
                     <emph>in the most general sense </emph>polizei <emph>is the care of the state or of a community organization (under direction of the
              state) for the general welfare by means of authoritative force; it divides according to extent and area of operation into</emph> a state
            or national police, community or local police (city, village, rural police), administrative, welfare, security, health police, street,
            construction <emph>etc</emph>.: the police has as its goal the comfortable life of the members of the state. 
        </quote>
                  <p>Only after this list do we learn of any material definition of the police: “<hi rend="bold">b) </hi>the organs of the police service, the
          police agency, and the local office of the same.” For all these areas of life to be administered, to be brought into order, often even to be
          produced in the first place, more than a bureaucracy is needed. One needs information, which in turn requires a whole discipline, in and out
          of the university, relying, as Michel Foucault has emphasized, on statistics. The Grimms describe what was known as
            <emph>Polizeiwissenschaft</emph> as a term that was still being contested (“<emph>noch heute ein vielumstrittener begriff</emph>”). The
          concept was perhaps contested, but its reality cannot be. After the establishment of two university chairs for the discipline in Prussia in
          1727, professors of “police science” began to pop up all over the German map, including in the imperial capital in Vienna in 1752, where
          Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi was appointed in that year. His <emph>Fundamentals of Police Science </emph>(1756) became the standard
          reference in the field. The contested territory, even as it was established, was a matter of producing knowledge for the king’s
          administration (thus fitting within the proto-economic discipline called “cameralism”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An extensive
            literature on this phenomenon exists. See especially Tribe, Foucault, and Wakefield, who argues that the reality of the cameralist society
            was “disordered” compared to its propaganda—my argument here, however, is precisely about the norms of that propaganda. </note>). Justi
          wrote: 
        <quote>Police science consists . . . in recognition of how from the contemporary state of the common weal clever measures are to be taken, in
          order to obtain and increase the general ability of the state in its internal constitution, and to make this ability ever more serviceable
          and useful, as much in the whole as in all its parts [<emph>sowohl nach seinem Zusammenhange, als in allen seinen Theilen</emph>], for the
          promotion of the community’s well-being [<emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>]. </quote>
        Police science is nothing more or less than the internal affairs of the state. Justi does not separate the object about which the science
          knows and the knowledge the science produces. As Foucault has argued, the main instrument of the science is statistics, or “the state’s
          knowledge of the state” (<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 315). The production of new personnel for administration is a major
          goal, and Justi writes of “useful citizens [<emph>nützliche Bürger</emph>]”(15 ff.) The vocational training that police was to arrange
          reveals the complex of power and knowledge that Foucault articulates. Per Justi: 
        <quote>
                        <emph>One must take care that the subjects possess such capacities and qualities and are kept in this discipline
            </emph>[<emph>Zucht</emph>]<emph> and order, </emph>as is required <emph>by the goal of the community’s happiness
            </emph>[<emph>gemeinschaftliche Glückseligkeit</emph>] . . . (14)</quote>
       Knowledge and production, even of humans, are one and the same. As Keith Tribe and Pasquale Pasquino have emphasized, Enlightenment state
          theory is based on this utter formability of its objects.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Tribe 8–32; and Pasquino 42–73.</note> The
          production of vocation-oriented humans is what Foucault calls “discipline,” one part of the emergent regime he will dub “biopower,” or the
          population-level care to make live where once the sovereign had the power to make die (<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 321
            ff.).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Foucault, <emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph>, p. 321 ff.</note> Adminstrative techniques
          that treat the general at the level of its generality are epitomized by the other side of the police (<emph>Society</emph> 246), as in
          Reil’s administration of military hospitals, the care for the poor, and population-level nutritional policy. The object of the police,
          Foucault writes, is “everything from being to well-being [<emph>bien-être</emph>].”(<emph>Security, Territory, Population</emph> 328). The
          police are meant to produce <emph>Glückseligkeit</emph>, the well-faring of the people. </p>
                  <p> As Michael Stolleis has pointed out, Justi’s <emph>Grundsätze</emph> were written in Theresian Vienna, and he would shortly thereafter
          move to Prussia, where his subsequent writings accorded much more freedom to the <emph>Gewerbe</emph> of his definition above (380–81). This
          is only the beginning of a much larger shift, for even as state and society were slowly isolated as polar terms, the administrative
          “catch-all” of police science<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Stolleis, <emph>Policeywissenschaft</emph> is “<emph>ein breites
              Auffangbecken für alle Wissenschaften und Techniken zu dienen, die sich als ‚Verwaltungslehren’ verstanden</emph>” (378).</note> was
          split between these new entities. The “police” (now a civil service and its servants) remained a state concern<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As Frison points out, the police lost centrality just as Smithian concerns gained prominence (146). </note> along with
          finance and statecraft, while “<emph>Privatökonomie</emph>” slowly migrated to a social concern. Among the administrative or police sciences
          that became associated, fatefully, with society rather than state was something called “<emph>Technologie</emph>” (379).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “<emph>Technologie</emph>” is here defined as “<emph>die Wissenschaft von der Entfaltung gesellschaftlicher
              Produktion.</emph>” Cf. Frison 147: <emph>Technologie</emph> is a sub-branch of <emph>Oekonomie</emph>, which is part of

                  </p>
                  <p> Johann Beckmann was appointed to a professorship of economy in Göttingen in 1766, and it was his writings that would become most
          associated with the new discipline <emph>Technologie</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The coinage belongs to Christian Wolff,
            although Beckmann was the first to teach and thereby expand the sense of the term. For an account of Beckmann’s tumultuous arrival in
            Göttingen, see Wakefield 75–79. The full background is given by Troitzsch.</note> His commentary in the third edition of Justi’s
            <emph>Grundsätze</emph> (1782) already shows the shift in interest: “I call police the science of governing the various enterprises
          according to the intent of the state” (6).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Johann Beckmann, <emph>Anleitung zur Technologie, oder zur
              Kenntnis der Handwerke, Fabriken und Manufakturen, vornehmlich derer, die mit der Landwirthschaft, Polizey und Cameralwissenschaft in
              nächster Verbindung stehen. Nebst Beyträgen zur Kunstgeschichte.</emph> Göttingen, Vandenhoek, 1777, pp. 6+.</note> Justi had written
          extensively on industry, and included <emph>Manufakturen und Fabriken</emph> as a rubric of police science. But as the police dwindled and
          the new state emerged, so too a new discipline, bearing a remarkable resemblance in its instruments (statistics) and goals (production of
          knowledge for administration) arose. Technology—for this, as Seibicke notes, was the only meaning of the word current at the time—spread
          quickly through the university system. As it became separated from the state, it slowly emerged as a branch of the new political economy
          focused on the instruments of production and their use, and thus eventually on machines.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Frison,
            “Foundation of Technology,” and Günther Bayerl, “<emph>Die Anfänge der Technikgeschichte bei Johann Beckmann und Johann Heinrich Moritz
              von Poppe</emph>,” in Wolfgang König and Helmuth Schneider, editors, <emph>Die technikhistorische Forschung in Deutschland von 1800 bis
              zur Gegenwart</emph>, Kassel, 2007, pp. 13–35.</note> The works of Andrew Ure and Charles Babbage in the 1820s and 30s would soon set a
          standard for gathering of statistics and non-judicial, enterprise-oriented oversight of factory production. Anyone who has read Marx’s
            <emph>Capital</emph> can see that this genre of observation adumbrated the rationalization of the Second Industrial Revolution. Marx still
          uses “technology” in this sense: the knowledge of production for the purpose of regulating that production.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Leo Marx, “Technology.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> For Beckmann, and to a large extent for Hoffmann, the body of knowledge for the regulation of production was not yet firmly associated
          with “society” in isolation from the state: 
        <quote>Technology is the science that teaches the working-up of naturalia, or the knowledge [<emph>Kenntniß</emph>] of handiwork. Instead of what
          happens in the workshops, where they direct one to follow the precepts and habits of the master in order to produce commodities, technology
          gives the fundamental guidance [<emph>Anleitung</emph>], in systematic order, how one, for just this purpose, should explain and use the
          phenomena appearing in work through true fundamental propositions and trustworthy experiences. (17) </quote>
        Technology acts where persons cannot; it is the systematic and comprehensive treatment of human material making (excluding the fine arts),
          replacing the “historical” discipline of <emph>Kunstgeschichte</emph> (not art history, but the history of crafts) (18). The Enlightenment
          derivation of the theory is strong, as Beckmann relies on Diderot and Christian Wolff, and especially on Linnaeus, with whom he had studied
          in Uppsala: 
        <quote>
                        <emph>Linnaeus</emph> said: I classify the animals according to the composition of their bodies, and thus I give the human a place among
          the mammals. Now do those who derisively throw before him the excellence of the human soul-forces above the so-called instincts of the other
          animals refute him, he, who knows those forces of soul so much better than many of his opponents? (21)</quote>
        Beckmann defends the Linnaean roughness and artificiality of his breakdown of the arts (in order of the “more respected to the less”).
          Other disciplines could classify humans as non-animals, and perhaps the arts could be seen from another perspective than that of the police.
          But the production of this disciplinary knowledge is meant for use, just as Diderot’s <emph>Encyclopedia </emph>was. Thus disciplinary
          knowledge is well-suited to guide practice, since it is general enough to account for larger unities of that practice, while specific enough
          to change it. The “forces of the soul” are also the limitations that necessitate the taxonomic approach in the first place. What makes us
          human makes us technological, able to create material things intentionally (<emph>techne</emph>) while limited to our invention of
          instruments for that making. The administration and potential rationalization of that making is the object of a police-adjacent university
          discipline: technology. </p>
                  <p>Technology is both a science and an enterprise, but it is not handiwork:
        <quote>But the sciences, at least in these times, belong to the enterprises [<emph>Gewerben</emph>]. Their objects are like the noble metals,
          often worked over; sometimes counterfeited [<emph>verfälscht</emph>], sometimes re-purified [<emph>wieder geläutert</emph>], and thus put a
          whole mass of humans to work and profit. And the former lose nothing hereby of their dignity, just as little as gold stops being gold, let
          it be worked over or alloyed [<emph>legire es</emph>] by anyone. The sciences do not, however, therefore becomes handiwork, even if they,
          like handiwork, are enterprises . . . (5)</quote>
        This passage reinforces Frison’s conclusion that “[<emph>t</emph>]<emph>echnologie</emph> would treat its own problems from a utilitarian
          point of view and could therefore be defined as a scientific study of the use-values related to production” (145).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Frison compares Linnaeus’s and Beckmann’s notions of oeconomia, focusing on use-values in both biology and technology,
            without, however, taking account of Beckmann’s university context in biology in Göttingen (148–54).</note> But Beckmann also produces a
          fascinating conception of disciplinarity in relation to <emph>techne</emph>. Making is the process of forming raw materials into finished
          products (3–4). Doing this work with a view to livelihood [<emph>Unterhalt</emph>] is an enterprise [<emph>Gewerbe</emph>]. The skill-based,
          rational making of artefacts for use is called “handiwork” [<emph>Handwerk</emph>], which is separated from “art” [<emph>Kunst</emph>].
          Handiwork is of many kinds, and consists of a series of different kinds of twists, like tropes, turns of a sometimes literal screw that do
          away with the natural body, just as rhetorical tropes do away with the naturalness of the concept (Beckmann 1806 465-66).
            <emph>Techne</emph> is still divorced from its product, semantically, and refers to the making, even could be applied to the enterprise of
          science (this is true of <emph>Technologie</emph> itself, which requires technique but is not an “art”). But the “polish” that
            <emph>Technologie</emph> puts on its object is put on no object at all: it is “polishing” a social process, and thus <emph>intervening in
            the production of use-values</emph> with a battery of “twists” that one can put on raw material. Linnaeus’s artificial system is here
          applied to <emph>artificialia</emph>, producing a kind of logical abyss that adumbrates the problem of a morphology of technology, as Ernst
          Kapp and Gilbert Simondon would develop only much later. Here is not the place to elaborate a full rhetoric of Beckmannian technology. But
          this intervention by way of scientific and statistical aggregation in the process of production surely went the way of social and not state
          intervention. But the project of constructing the very society that became the field of play for that very “free enterprise” fell, as the
          police became a merely repressive apparatus, to poetry. In other words, fiction inherited a social-administrative task that, when Hoffmann
          died, was just beginning to be enduringly associated with machines. A great deal of writing on Hoffmann thinks through the problem of
          technology in terms of a static object (technological artefacts) gaining increasing independence from their human creators. To be sure,
          Hoffmann thematizes this problem, one that dogged philosophers and poets throughout the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I have been unable to find a significant use of any term with the root <emph>techn-</emph> in Hoffmann’s works. </note> The automaton
          Olympia in <emph>The Sandman</emph> has been canonized as the principle allegory of this problematic. And yet more than this is going on,
          for Hoffmann died in 1822, and did not see the wild outgrowth of factories that used humans as tools rather than the other way around. Nor
          is Hoffmann focused on abstract questions of human rights, good forms of government, and so forth, rather instead on the space between those
          things, the very social arena which would eventually welcome the terms <emph>Technik</emph>, technology, or the French
            <emph>technologie</emph>. And it is this determination of the fictional space that suggests a deeper affinity between his fiction
            and <emph>Technologie</emph>, the exploration of the failure of sovereignty to control the market through control of
            production. <emph>Technologie</emph> disappears as a term even as the instance of monarchy fades. It is replaced with <emph>Technik</emph>
          and the sovereign-less space of “market” capitalism increases. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Schatzberg. </note> This privatization
          of “technological” social regulation is precisely what Hoffmann produces in his fiction. That fiction cannot replace sovereignty, nor can it
          directly slow or alter the course of that dialectical shift in instrumentality, from our use of tools to our becoming-tool. But it can
          present that space as the rule of <emph>Anschaulichkeit</emph>, as the basis for and the substance of the “polishing” of the work of
          production. Here, imagination is no longer reflection on alternate orders of things, but the direct viewing of <emph>this</emph> order in
          its contingency, in its possibility as another order. And by divulging this rule as intuition, Hoffmann produces the Serapiontic principle
          as the technology of literature, neither spinning in a void of the imaginary nor bogged down in a tribunal of precision in an attempt to
          imitate nature, but instead exploiting its distance from that very nature (here, the social) to construct the nature of the social itself.
          We thus see that literature and technology are not merely in competition, but share a vocation that we can only “see”
            (<emph>anschauen</emph>) through engagement with fiction. That engagement, however, confers the infinite responsibility of social
          production on us. This is what the smash hit proto-detective novel <emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>, dubbed quintessentially Serapiontic
          by the brethren, demonstrates.</p>

          4. The Construction of the Historical as the Social—<emph>Mademoiselle de Scuderi</emph>
                  </head>
                  <p> It seems either nonsensical or tautological to say that literature might study and produce its own object, as the police does, and as
          technology does. After all, the object of narration is, by the definition of imagination in the eighteenth century, not present. Thus it
          seems trivial to say that the object of fictional narrative is produced in the telling; meanwhile, since fiction after Lessing seeks not to
          educate, pursuing instead some more autonomous goal, as Paul Fleming as argued, it might seem wrong-headed to say that it “studies” its
          object. But what if its object is the historical reality that disciplinary production must fracture in order to know? What if literature,
          like Kant’s philosophical faculty, offers an <emph>Anschauung</emph> of a more complex object than those disciplines allow? In other words,
          what if fiction inherited the task of social administration? This might give intuitive meaning to Shelley’s famous statement about poets as
          “legislators.” To be sure, Hoffmann did not advocate, or practice, a confusion of fiction and law. But fiction allows a visible space the
          law does not, one without direct consequences, one of Serapiontic suspension. That suspension is instrumentalized: the phenomenon it fixes
          allows the fictional space to be broader than any single discipline, and more concrete than the philosophical faculty. That literature is
          neither law nor philosophy does not, however, prevent its pretension from rising to the task of social construction. For as little as it can
          intervene directly, this freedom precisely allows it to study and produce objects as contingencies, possibilities, different orders with
          different systems of valuation, precisely in order to interact with and reveal the valuations and their rules within the present order. That
          is what I want to claim for <emph>Scuderi</emph>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Scuderi</emph> is breathtaking: it opens on the eponymous septuagenarian poet’s maid fending off a possible robber from the estate in
          the middle of the night. The narrator digresses at length to explain the maid’s fear, expounding the historical case (with some
          embellishments) of Brinvillier, a woman who developed an untraceable poison, killing her father and a number of others in Paris, leading to
          the atmosphere that had opened the novella. A second rash of murders, this time brutal thefts of jewelry, have led the king, Louis XIV, to
          establish the so-called <emph>chambre ardente</emph>, a special investigative committee the narrator compares to the inquisition. (The
          extraordinary fact is that Hoffmann wrote the story before he was called to serve in the <emph>Immediat-Untersuchungs-Kommission</emph>.)
          Scuderi learns slowly that it is the work of the master jeweler Cardillac that is being stolen; the would-be robber makes another attempt to
          contact her about the case. Cardillac is murdered, apparently by his soon-to-be son-in-law Olivier Brusson. The police detective Desgrais
          comes into a kind of competition with Scuderi, who learns rapidly that Brusson is a boy she had taken care of as a youth, one she considers
          her son (his mother has since died). Convinced of his innocence—especially because of the wide-eyed frank grief of Madelon, Cardillac’s
          daughter—Scuderi attempts to intervene, consulting a lawyer and entreating the police and eventually the king. Brusson reveals what he
          knows, which is that Cardillac was obsessively killing those who bought his works, and retrieving his products. The plot does not resolve
          through the efforts of Scuderi as detective,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Alewyn’s much-disputed thesis that
              <emph>Scuderi</emph> was the first detective story has received a twist from Kittler in <emph>Dichter Mutter Kind</emph> 197–219 (esp.
            pp. 213–15), to the effect that the pure material codes of detection were constrained by the family as the basis of semiotics around 1800.
          </note> but because Cardillac’s killer, Miossens, steps forward with the truth. But the <emph>chambre ardente</emph> will not back down (the
          predictive power of the story for Hoffmann’s biography is singular), and even as the population shifts to Brusson’s side, the king, annoyed
          by the public fallout, drags out his decision. Scuderi brings Madelon to the court, and convinces the king to release Brusson. Madelon and
          Brusson leave Paris for Geneva, and the original owners of the stolen jewelry (those who are not dead, presumably) have their property
          restored. Cardillac’s murders are traced to an incident between his mother and a soldier during her pregnancy. </p>
                  <p> When the story finishes, the salon is impressed. We learn that Sylvester, who had already announced his story’s reliance on Voltaire, has
          also drawn from an unlikelier source, Wagenseil’s <emph>Chronicle of Nuremberg</emph>. The aesthetic judgment comes:
        <quote>One called [the story] truly serapiontic, because, built on historical foundations, it still climbs into the fantastic [<emph>auf
            geschichtlichen Grund gebaut, doch hinaufsteige ins Fantastische</emph>]. (4:853) </quote>
        The line seems to indicate the intertwining of the chronicle and the “night-side” cause of Cardillac’s obsessive murders. And indeed, the
          first string of murders is historical fact, the atmosphere of intensive urban policing that results in a clear message to the present from the
          Paris of the Sun King. The hidden causes of crimes cannot spare their doers, but also cannot be fully clarified by the courts. The story
          then “climbs” into the “fantastical” through the figure of Cardillac. But as the long tradition of understanding the story of the crimes as
          a <emph>Krimi</emph> or detective story shows, the effect of this fantastical element does not undermine the social atmosphere established
          and maintained. It is clearly a story about power.</p>
                  <p> It is this power that is “really seen,” and this thematization allows us to grasp how the Serapiontic principle becomes narrative.
          Building on the suspension announced in the first tale of the cycle, we here see that the historical ground of the story is integrated with
          the fantastic; thus the “duplicity of all earthly being” is transferred from the individual (Serapion) to society, and it is the history of
          that society that occupies the narrative space. Argenson’s Paris, ruled in the fiction by his successor La Regnie, is a police state in our
          contemporary sense, a repressive atmosphere in which danger and fear dominate for all but the nobles and the king. The drama the narrative
          expertly maximizes is based on this newer type of police, and the king’s ultimate authority would come to haunt Hoffmann within a few years
          of his completion of the story. Thus the police are not Justi’s but the clumsy Desgrais, who does in fact read as an anticipation of
          Inspector Lestrade, only with the emphasis on the irrational inquisitorial force behind him. He lets Cardillac slip through his hands, and
          in a completely unexplained moment, witnesses him apparently pass through a solid wall. Scuderi engages the administrative apparatus,
          gathering information and consulting a lawyer, preparing for her attempt to convince the king to release Brusson. </p>
                  <p> Dorothea von Mücke has characterized this rhetorical act as the recruitment of the king “into the regime of biopower” (124, 127), relying
          on Friedrich Kittler’s demonstration that Scuderi both produces the “positive knowledge of the human” (203–04) and the regime of
          signification associated with the discursive and institutional shifts Foucault identified around 1800: “Hoffmann’s story, as the first
          example of its genre, is thus simultaneously the effect and the instrument of a discourse-mutation” (216). But what discourse is being
          mutated? As I have proposed, it is the shift in administration as sociotechnology, and the discipline known as technology itself, that
          provides the discursive background. The narrative shows us that the king’s decision is at least partly subject to the social shift towards emphasis on
          biopower itself. In the Enlightened monarchy, administration slowly gains the upper hand, and as the monarchy is forced to retreat into the
          complex Europe of the mid-nineteenth century, bureaucracy and industry form a historical alliance that was still called
            <emph>Technologie</emph>. Hoffmann’s novella can only be the “instrument” of that mutation, however, if we re-read the judgment of the
          brethren. It builds a “historical ground” not in the sense that it is drawn from a chronicle. Hoffmann is tongue-in-cheek here; the history
          is the mutation itself. And its “climb into the fantastic” should then also be revised: not Cardillac’s “night side,” not his disappearance
          through the wall, not the alchemy of the Brinvillier subplot. The “fantastic” <emph>also</emph> functions as the alternate to the
          historical, the factor that allows the fictional space to mimick the changing role of administration. This allows a “technological” ambition
          to emerge within the narrative, which focuses its reader on a more complete historical image than any discipline can produce, and then
          proposes the possibility that this image could be altered. This fiction supplies active organs where only passive ones had been. It produces
          the space for studying its object, otherwise not available, and it retains the possibility of altering that space. The upshot of
            <emph>Scuderi</emph> is that we must “really see” a historical ground shot through with the possibility of differentiation. The
          desperation of Brusson and his “mother” Scuderi reflects the trap of the powers that crystallize from this order, but the novella visualizes
          the order itself, produces it as an imaginary object. The imagination cannot directly intervene or impose its freedom on the bureaucratic
          and discursive grid it alone can produce. But it is itself a factor—a lack or a luxury—in that grid, and one that has the ability to
          navigate between the concrete and the general. When we see its generalized function, and its ambition to address that generality through its
          singular narrative formation, we can see what the literature of biopower might be. And this is what late Romanticism in Hoffmann’s version
          offers: a realism that, by re-presenting the totality of the real <emph>as possible</emph>, offers a kind of technology that parallels that
          discipline. That is, a kind of possibility that presents a dwindling yet crucial space for an alternate real, because it is the vehicle of
          representation that increasingly alone allows for this progressive picture. Thus what seems a merely given “story”—as in the Chronicle of
          Nuremberg—must be imaginatively constructed into its <emph>own order</emph>. This is the production of the historical object, which, for the
            Serapion-circle, <emph>must go through the fantastic</emph>—“climb” into it—in order to count as a study of the object. In other words,
          the oblique bearing that the Voltairean tale has on the totality of social relations in the present is based precisely in the detour of
          fictionality that first constitutes the historical object, that first allows us the imaginative space to conceive of it as part of a set of
          relations, a social whole. A fiction that offers this space to its reader is technological, because it retains the formal characteristics of
          that discipline: it is both production and study of an object, namely production itself. The object of this fiction is, however, not
          “technological” in the modern sense, but instead something approximating what we call sociotechnology, which can only take form as the
          production of culture. The technology<emph> </emph>of culture is therefore literature as Hoffmann writes it. <emph>Serapion</emph> is a
          generic template for the international nineteenth century, its influence extending to the U.S.A. and to Russia, among others. Perhaps that
          is in part because underlying its literally fantastic fireworks is the murky urgency of modernity as the fateful synthesis of administration
          and machines. </p>
                  <p>As the story ends, there is not much to support the brothers’ assertion that it has “climbed into the fantastic”—while the explanation of
          the crime is occult, the withdrawal of the lovers to Rousseau’s hometown and the restitution of the jewels to their owners’ families are
          perfectly banal. But the combination of the salon and the story within it shows us Hoffmann’s technique, which is to take given eidetic
          story-content and re-imagine it as the transition of power, the shifting of instance from a monarchical state/society complex to something
          more nebulous. The narration contains a layer of knowledge that it does not exactly visualize: the knowledge of the passage to an order in
          which power is diffuse, the end of unilateral sovereignty. But in doing this, it presents a new task of fiction, one that we can call
          “technological.”</p>
                  <p>Here fiction itself becomes technological in a historical sense, and inherits the task of social administration that was the only meaning
          of <emph>Technologie</emph> at the time. After the Enlightenment, social administration was privatized, and in a sense, so was literature,
          amounting to a channel of public information about massive spheres of unregulatable activity. It became, and perhaps is still, a privileged
          area for gaining an imaginary grasp on the <emph>longue durée</emph> and its crystallization in the social form of the present. In Hoffmann,
          this “grasp” meant the possibility of reconceiving the social as such, of altering its very constitution through producing it in narrative
          form. The police is no longer needed to intervene at every level of society, guiding the process of history; technological fiction would
          replace it by producing new historical conditions of possibility.</p>

               <head>Balancing Acts: Modes of Equilibrium in Romanticism and Nature Philosophy around 1800</head>
               <byline>
                  <docAuthor>Jocelyn Holland</docAuthor>

               <p> As is the case with its English counterpart, <emph>equilibrium</emph>, the German word <emph>Gleichgewicht</emph> is a
        concept whose origins are rooted in the world of materiality and practice. Both can be traced to the simple act of balancing objects on a
        scale (<emph>libra</emph> in Latin and <emph>Wiege</emph> in German, which is the root of <emph>Gewicht</emph>):
        this familiar practice and the equally simple instrument associated with it form the material basis for quantitative measures of equilibrium.
        For every case where equilibrium can be determined through calculations, however, there are others where it is deployed as metaphor to reflect
        intuitive impressions of balance or imbalance. Equilibrium’s conceptual mobility derives from the fact that it requires only a single act of
        differentiation to become applicable—at heart, it is a figure that describes a relation between a minimum of any two given things—and it can
        therefore be said to occupy a fundamental position within almost any conceivable discourse. Statics, medicine, and physiological theory have
        various models to account for things in and out of equilibrium, but so do theology, political science, and aesthetics. These “things” need not
        even belong to the same class: physical bodies can be in equilibrium, as can ideas, but it is also possible and even unremarkable to describe
        relations of equilibrium between material and non-material concepts. For example, any handbook of mechanics will contain descriptions of
        equilibrium between weights and forces, which underscores that equilibrium relies upon an equivalence of effect, not a relationship of
        identity. This truism is worthy of more attention in the contexts of Romanticism and nature philosophy around 1800, where ideas from the
        natural sciences are often repackaged in innovative ways, and where equilibrium has a fundamental role to play that hinges upon its ability to
        negotiate even the most radical differences. To paraphrase a thought by Schelling that will be taken up in more detail below, one could go so
        far as to say that once the first distinction of object and representation has been made—once their original identity has been replaced by a
        relationship of equivalence—equilibrium as metaphor is already in play. With this idea, Schelling links the concept of equilibrium
        inextricably to the physical or material origin of abstract thought.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
              an in-depth discussion of equilibrium in the context of other key terms in Schelling’s nature philosophy, see Bernhard Rang’s <title level="m">Identität und Indifferenz</title>, Vittorio Klostermann, 2000). </note> In anticipation of Nietzsche, he reminds
        us of the metaphorical structure of language itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
              See Nietzsche’s essay, “On Truth and Lying in the Extra-moral Sense” [<emph>Über Wahrheit und Lüge im aussermoralischen Sinne</emph>].” </note>
               </p>
               <p> Schelling’s willingness to grant equilibrium a central position in philosophical thinking by situating it at the beginning of reflection can
        be considered as one moment in a conceptual narrative that develops and takes different turns in nature philosophy and Romanticism before
        receiving its most dramatic formulation in the psychology of Carl Eschenmayer a decade later. We see traces of this same narrative, for
        example, when the mechanical balance and the mathematical laws associated with it are used as a figure of thought even in contexts removed
        from the sciences. To be sure, there is a pre-history for integrating quantitative thinking in qualitative contexts, also where equilibrium is
        concerned: already in Kant’s 1763 essay, “Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Quantities into Philosophy” (<emph>Versuch,
          den Begriff der negativen Grössen in die Weltweisheit einzuführen</emph>), we find the concept of equilibrium used in an audacious application
        of mechanical and mathematical thinking to quantify human feelings. In subject philosophy, German Romanticism, and early nineteenth-century
        psychology—i.e., wherever theories of the self are set into juxtaposition with the laws of nature—one finds the physics of equilibrium invoked
        to make arguments in more speculative contexts. In other words, one can say that the defining characteristic of equilibrium as concept for
        Schelling, its ability to move between the material and non-material, becomes a topic for reflection and a tool of philosophical thinking in
        its own right. The use of the mechanical balance as figure of thought is simply a variation of the same theme. </p>
               <p> This paper will take a closer look at the concept of equilibrium around 1800, to understand its use, and to trace the different ways in
        which Schelling’s positioning of equilibrium at the beginning of reflection transforms a commonplace scientific concept into a philosophically
        powerful one. It will first focus on the early nature philosophy of Schelling and Eschenmayer and the aphorisms of Novalis around 1800 before
        turning to Eschenmayer’s later work on psychology from 1814, simply because for each, their work on equilibrium combines familiarity with
        physical theories with philosophical experiments in speculative contexts. To be sure, the encyclopedic thinking of Novalis, as well as the
        willingness of Schelling and Eschenmayer to allow a number of scientific ideas and theories to permeate their writing, challenge any univocal
        understanding of how quantitative descriptions of equilibrium are applied to systems of thought not native for them. This is particularly true
        since equilibrium itself is well-suited to serve the familiar Romantic strategy of bringing oppositions into productive tension with one
        another. Against the backdrop of this intellectual landscape, the following readings will concentrate on two related tendencies in the
        discussion on equilibrium: the first relating to its ability to move between the immaterial and the material, the second relating to questions
        of visibility that such movement entails. </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>1. Schelling and Eschenmayer</head>
                  <p> When Schelling depicts the beginning of philosophical reflection as a division of the self from the world, he describes this event as a
        disruption of an equilibrium state. In the <emph>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature </emph>(1797), he suggests
        that we, as thinkers, emerge from an original condition in which there is “an absolute equilibrium of forces and of consciousness,” a
        condition which can be both removed and reinstated (in a qualified way) through the free act of the will (<emph>Ideas</emph> 71).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Unless otherwise noted all translations are mine.</note>
        Schelling then allows this hypothesis about the origin of reflection to be embodied in the narrative of the first person to exercise his will
        in such a way: “Who first found that he could distinguish [<emph>unterscheiden</emph>] himself from external things, and that he
        could thereby distinguish his ideas from objects, and conversely, [objects from ideas], was the first philosopher. He was the first to
        interrupt the mechanism of his thinking, to displace the equilibrium of the consciousness, in which subject and object are united” (<title level="m">Ideas</title> 72). With the distinction of ideas from objects, the world becomes observable and our thinking about it does as
        well. Schelling thereby establishes a vital connection between equilibrium and the problem of visibility in the broadest sense, one to which
        he will return throughout his work.</p>
                  <p> For Schelling, there is no complete return to absolute equilibrium in the course of life from the subject’s point of view—such a state of
        absolute rest would be an absurdity or <emph>Unding</emph> (<emph>World Soul</emph> 79). Equally undesirable is a
        situation of living in complete isolation from the reality of the world, caught up in the chimera (<emph>Hirngespinst</emph>) of
        one’s imagination. Instead man finds himself in dynamic relation to a world “which has influence upon him, lets him feel its power, and upon
        which he can react, to exercise all his forces: between him and the world therefore there must be no fast divide, contact and exchange must be
        possible between both; for only then will man become man” (<emph>Ideas</emph> 71).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “ . . . <emph>die auf ihn Einfluß hat, ihre Macht ihn empfinden läßt, und auf die er zurückwirken kann,
                alle seine Kräfte zu üben: zwischen ihm und der Welt also muß keine Kluft befestigt, zwischen beyden muß Berührung und Wechselwirkung
                möglich seyn; denn so nur wird der Mensch zum Menschen.”</emph>
                     </note> This model of equilibrium defined by “contact and
        exchange” must necessarily, by Schelling’s own definition, be considered relative, not absolute, and it allows the relationship between object
        and thought to be maintained without risk of either total identity with the world or total detachment from it. The correlating state from the
        physical world that Schelling references here is one of opposing pairs of forces that influence and limit each other and which are able to
        enter states of relative equilibrium (see <emph>Ideas </emph>102). The departure from absolute equilibrium is
        therefore a rejection of the initial identity between self and world that nonetheless allows relations of thought to object and the
        distinctions between them to be maintained. </p>
                  <p> Eschenmayer’s <emph>Propositions from Nature-Metaphysics Applied to Chemical and Medicinal Objects</emph>
        (1797), published the same year as Schelling’s <emph>Ideas</emph>, approaches the discussion of equilibrium from a different
        direction, first focusing on states of nature rather than situating absolute and relative equilibrium in a philosophical narrative of
        intellectual emergence, as Schelling does. For Eschenmayer, relative equilibrium emerges when “two opposed degrees of reality work in
        opposition” (<emph>Propositions </emph>22). Like Schelling, he makes a critical distinction between forces
        which are completely sublated (<emph>aufgehoben</emph>), so as to be considered identical, and those whose effects are considered
        equivalent. For Eschenmayer, however, absolute equilibrium is a special case in the physical world: it is “there where two forces completely
        sublate their effects, so that they are no longer an object, neither for mathematical construction nor for the analysis of experience”
        (ibid.). Eschenmayer thereby introduces the relation of equilibrium to consciousness indirectly, not as the beginning of philosophical
        reflection, but in terms of a particular experience that would constitute the end of cognitive “visibility.” He then uses the example of the
        mechanical lever (which is essentially the same object as a balance) in order to reinforce the idea that equilibrium, whether relative or
        absolute, is something to be expressed in terms of visualization. He first takes the case of relative equilibrium: when the forces applied to
        a lever or balance are divided upon the arms around a fulcrum point, Eschenmayer writes, then one calculates whether their mechanical moments
        are equal in order to ascertain whether or not the object is in a state of relative equilibrium. He then adjusts the imaginary lever for the
        case of absolute equilibrium: if the forces acting upon the lever are simply joined in the fulcrum point—the visual correlate being a lever
        with no arms—then the lever’s magnitude of motion becomes zero: “this is the absolute mechanical equilibrium which is no longer an object for
        the mathematician” (ibid.). Though the context is different, Eschenmayer’s strategy is analogous to Schelling’s: just as Schelling positions
        the concept of equilibrium at the division of thought and object, Eschenmayer manipulates the lever so that it allows us to visualize both
        relative equilibrium, which is defined as the presence of forces in tension, and absolute equilibrium, in which these forces are completely
        sublated. To paraphrase Eschenmayer, it allows us to visualize even that which is no longer there, to model invisibility as a special case of
        the visible. He also emphasizes that this same idea has currency in other scenarios, such as the relationship between positive and negative
        electrical charges, or the forces of expansion and repulsion in matter. These are scenarios where it would be difficult to visualize the lever
        or incorporate it into an experimental setting, but where the spatial image of distances from the lever’s fulcrum collapsing to zero can still
        be retained as metaphor—where the trace image of the lever’s materiality continues to play a role.</p>
                  <p> The examples from Schelling and Eschenmayer referred to above, as revealing as they may be of a philosophical
        interest in equilibrium, are also indicative of the difficulties involved in pinning the concept down. After all, “absolute equilibrium”
        cannot itself be considered a firm reference point, given that, for all their overlap, Schelling’s and Eschenmayer’s “absolutes” emerge in two
        very different contexts—Schelling’s within a description of the subject, and Eschenmayer’s in the context of mechanics. The examples they give
        of relative equilibrium are also drawn from different physical and philosophical contexts. In each case, however, equilibrium or a related
        concept such as the mechanical lever connects in some way to the boundary between the material and the immaterial, conditions that are turn
        expressed in terms of visibility and invisibility. This state of affairs argues for an aesthetics of equilibrium—i.e., that there are aspects
        to how the concept of equilibrium is utilized around 1800 that can be codified in general terms of techniques of visualization that begin with
        Schelling’s original association between reflection and the loss of equilibrium and then return in surprising ways. At the very least, the
        basic distinction between absolute and relative equilibrium lends itself to being understood as the presence or absence of an aesthetically
        neutral state prior to or deprived of representations, whether in a global sense (Schelling) or a local one (Eschenmayer). </p>
                  <p> First, however, the question of what kinds of equilibrium states deserve to be called “visible” in the nature philosophical context, and
        what an aesthetics of equilibrium might entail, deserves to be considered in more detail. This requires a further look at Eschenmayer’s
        definition of absolute equilibrium and his comment that something in this state is no longer an object. He implies that such a construction of
        absolute equilibrium is not of interest because it has been effectively rendered neutral: it has ceased to call attention to itself as
        something in need of contemplation and analysis, and is no longer a catalyst of change for the particular mechanics of the system under
        observation. For those of us who are neither mathematicians nor nature philosophers, however, and who are considering precisely those cases
        where the mechanical laws of equilibrium are being imported into different contexts, the question of analytical visibility versus transparence
        is perhaps more interesting than Eschenmayer would have us believe. This holds true for both Schelling and Eschenmayer’s own nature
        philosophy, because it suggests that there is an aesthetic code with its own logic that corresponds to natural law. For Eschenmayer, the
        absence of absolute equilibrium becomes a precondition for the visibility of the phenomenal world, just as it is the precondition for
        philosophical observation in Schelling. </p>
                  <p> Their use of spatial descriptions also argues for an aesthetics of equilibrium: just as Eschenmayer understands the difference between the
        absolute and the relative in terms of the distance from the fulcrum point, Schelling’s distinction between these two states is also dependent
        on concepts of spatiality. This is an idea which could also be explored further in Schelling’s writing about art, and in particular, his
        1802–03 lectures. There, he draws upon the concept of equilibrium as a problem for artistic composition, such as the balancing of colors and
        grouping of objects in painting, and as a problem for the observer of the work of art, whose spirit Schelling describes as maintained in a
        state of “the highest desire, between disturbed and restored equilibrium, at once in motion and in peace” (<emph>Lectures</emph>
        188). The observation of the work of art generates a particular cognitive experience defined in terms of a relative equilibrium where the
        “forces” in question have not been sublated.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I will elaborate on
              Schelling’s “aesethetics” of equilibrium in more detail in a forthcoming essay.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In the context of Schelling’s nature philosophy, however, the notion of an “aesthetics” of equilibrium can be understood even more broadly
        because it has the ability to connote various registers of visibility (and invisibility), whether in the context of a subject philosophy, as
        an instrument of thought, or in terms of equilibrium states in nature. With regard to the latter, Schelling and Eschenmayer understand the
        transition from absolute to relative equilibrium to be accompanied by phenomena that emerge through the process of attaining and maintaining
        relative equilibrium, a process that endlessly echoes the original disruption from the state of absolute equilibrium. In the <title level="m">World Soul</title>, for example, Schelling observes a general striving for equilibrium in all of nature. Every principle, once aroused,
        awakens an opposed principle with which it comes to be in equilibrium (125): “The tension of posited and opposed forces is itself productive,
        as in the case of chemical processes:<emph> Because</emph> in every chemical process there <emph>emerge</emph> qualities which were not there before, and which owe their origin simply to the striving of opposed forces to place themselves
        in equilibrium” (<emph>World Soul</emph>, 126, emphasis in the original). Schelling rephrases this idea from a more general
        perspective of physical objects when he comments that the only reason we can perceive matter in space is because of its tendency toward
        equilibrium states: “One has to claim that both attractions stand under the same original law, namely the one according to which matter
        reveals its existence in space through a continuous striving for equilibrium, without which all substances would be submitted to dispersal
        into the infinite” (ibid.). Here, the perspectives of physics and philosophy coincide: from the point of view of a subject philosophy, our
        departure from absolute equilibrium guarantees our ability to observe forms in nature, and from the point of view of physics, perception of
        form is always to some degree the perception of an equilibrium state. These examples also make the processual nature of equilibrium
        clear—i.e., that it has temporal duration—and highlight the fact that it persists even after having been (relatively) attained. Eschenmayer’s
          <emph>Propositions</emph> also describe the process through which equilibrium itself is achieved—i.e., as something that emerges
        by degrees (“<emph>nach und nach</emph>,” 23)—and indicate that our perception of phenomena such as an electrical charge depends
        upon such systems not being in a state of absolute (mechanical) equilibrium. The idea of equilibrium emerging by degrees is important because
        it takes a process that might be beyond the empirical experience of the observer and artificially slows it down and makes it quantifiable,
        thereby stretching time and revealing the duration of phenomena that might appear to occur instantaneously. </p>
                  <p> Taken together, these passages from Schelling and Eschenmayer show how different scenarios emerge—i.e., the departure from absolute
        equilibrium, the striving for and maintenance of relative equilibrium, along with the inevitable disruptions and restorations—within which the
        concept of equilibrium connects and articulates the differences between the material and the non-material, between objects and their
        representations, and between the effects of natural processes and the forces that produce them. Yet rather than vanishing within the dynamics
        of its own philosophical function, equilibrium both acts in the service of visibility and acquires this quality for itself, becoming both the
        subject and object of its own aesthetic interests.</p>

                  <head>2. Romantic equilibrium</head>
                  <p>With reference to nature philosophy, to Idealism and the subject philosophy of the 1790s, and not least of all to its own poetic concerns,
        early German Romanticism also incorporates equilibrium into its conceptual vocabulary. Novalis’s notes and fragments on equilibrium draw from
        multiple sources, but they are joined by a concern for applying the language of mechanical equilibrium to philosophical and poetic contexts.
        It comes as little surprise that Novalis collects examples from the work of other philosophers, including Fichte and Eschenmayer, who share
        the same interest in importing mechanical models for their own use. In his notes on Fichte, Novalis transcribes the philosopher’s description
        of a “pure ego” (<emph>reinen Ich</emph>) that brooks neither change nor opposition, permitting only rest and identity. Only with
        regard to a subject does it allow for division: “The ego is absolutely unity—the subject absolutely divided—reciprocity of the ego in
        itself—it wants unity, it wants to be divided. In the pure ego . . . no change—no opposition—no <emph>continuity</emph>—standstill—rest—identity—With relation to the subject its character—activity conditioned by rest—must be a manifold”
        (2.133.44). The relationship between the pure ego and the subject is well-trodden ground, thanks to the work of Dieter Henrich and Manfred
        Frank, among others.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See especially Dieter Henrich, “<emph>Fichtes ursprungliches Einsicht</emph>,” Klosterman, 1967. Translated by D. R. Lachterman as “Fichte’s Original Insight,” in <title level="j">Contemporary German Philosophy</title> vol. 1, no. 9, 1982; and Manfred Frank, <emph>The Philosophical Origins
                of Early German Romanticism</emph>, translated by Elizabeth Millan-Zaibert, SUNY P, 2008).</note> What such accounts of
        Fichte’s subject philosophy (and Novalis’s reception of it) tend to overlook, however, is that, as is the case with Schelling and Eschenmayer,
        the language Fichte uses to describe the original unity and division of the ego is the same that is used to describe mechanical states of
        absolute and relative equilibrium, which comes as a surprise regarding a generation of philosophers generally thought to have eschewed
        mechanical metaphors for organic ones.</p>
                  <p> Novalis engages extensively with Eschenmayer’s early nature philosophy, and in particular the 1797 <emph>Propositions</emph>. He
        transcribes passages from the section on mechanical propositions which references the definition of mechanical equilibrium discussed above, as
        well as the passage on what constitutes an analytical “object” from a mathematical perspective (i.e., when forces act at a distance as opposed
        to being collapsed and completely sublated at the fulcrum). He also notes Eschenmayer’s analogy between mechanical equilibrium and electricity
        and was therefore familiar with the idea that simple systems of equilibrium could be used to describe various kinds of phenomena. Although
        there are numerous references to equilibrium in Novalis’s work, two aphorisms move more clearly than the others to conceptualize it in terms
        of a speculative aesthetics that still pays homage to its nature-philosophical basis. Though different in their emphases, each aphorism
        connects equilibrium to cognitive processes that include (without being limited to) visual metaphors and play with the distinction between the
        material and the immaterial. In the first, from his notes for the encyclopedia project, Novalis writes,
      <quote>The temper [<emph>Stimmung</emph>] of the consciousness—of representation of all kinds is the tenor of crystallization, of
        formation—and multiplication—thus <emph>maintained rest—static force—</emph>rationalizing (equilibrating) force—proportional force
        of evolution—a <emph>constant quantity</emph> in the variable change (point of rest on the lever). (3.432.836)</quote>
      The tone of the aphorism is much closer to a nature philosophical model of the consciousness than it is to Fichte’s discussion of the ego.
        Even though it indexes various modes of growth (mineral, organic, and mathematical), these differences collapse in light of the aphorism’s
        essential analogy between representation and relative equilibrium. We are far from a scenario (such as Schelling’s absolute equilibrium or
        Fichte’s pure ego) where forces (or differences) are indistinct, and very much in a vibrant, living state of equilibrium where they are
        allowed to emerge, to change, and to persist, all the while held in check. Like Eschenmayer, then, Novalis also invokes the image of the
        mechanical lever as a technique of visualization, both through visual metaphors and through the quantification of immaterial things. These
        rhetorical shifts mirror the mechanics they describe, allowing different aspects of equilibrium to emerge that move the mind’s eye without
        creating an imbalance. 
      <quote> The second aphorism returns to the same idea, approaching it from a different direction: The theory of relations belongs to algebra—or the natural history of quantities. (The <emph>verbs </emph>[<emph>Verba</emph>] are the actual word forces [<emph>Wortkräfte</emph>]—the so-called <emph>nouns</emph> [<emph>Substantiva</emph>] have emerged from <emph>verbs</emph>—and the verbs have emerged from nouns. Motion and rest [<emph>Ruhe</emph>]—Variable—constant x. All rest [<emph>Ruhe</emph>] is <emph>figure</emph>.) (3.400.691)</quote>
      There are various points of reference that could be invoked in order to orient oneself with regard to this aphorism. One could, for example,
        refer back to an idea discussed above that Schelling first articulates in the <emph>Ideas</emph> and then repeats in the <title level="m">World Soul</title> (a text also read and noted by Novalis), where he claims that forces of attraction and repulsion are
        necessarily in equilibrium in individual bodies, which is why they keep their form, and that this necessity is felt only in opposition to the
        possibility of equilibrium being destroyed. Or one could turn to the passage in the <emph>World Soul</emph>, cited above, where he
        adds that the only reason we perceive matter in space is because of its striving for equilibrium: physical bodies are visible to us because
        they achieve a relative equilibrium. These ideas help substantiate Novalis’s understanding of active rest—i.e., relative equilibrium—as
        figure. The second tradition this aphorism recalls, if less overtly, is connected to Kant’s use of algebraic notation to quantify emotions
        referred to at the beginning of this essay. Both Kant and Novalis use algebraic ideas and notation to quantify and create relations (in Kant’s
        case, between feelings of pleasure and displeasure, and in Novalis’s case, between words that are not physical objects but are effectively
        treated as such). Novalis taps into these traditions from the perspective of the formation of language. In his vision, words stabilize into
        figures—and not just rhetorical figures, but actual forms. We can also observe a certain interplay between the function of nouns and verbs and
        their integration into this mode of equilibrium. As suggested by the German, nouns (<emph>Substantive</emph>), however abstract they
        may be, are rooted in the notion of substance. Verbs, in German (as was the case in Novalis’s day), are also known as <emph>Zeitworte</emph> because they express change and temporality; this aspect is deemphasized by Novalis’s use of the Latin <emph>Verba</emph>. Novalis plays with such superficial distinctions, noting that both verbs and nouns have the ability to transmute, each into the
        other, and it is this linguistic phenomenon that underscores the analogy with mechanical equilibrium as a figure that can join the material
        and immaterial. The Romantic contribution to the aesthetics of equilibrium therefore lies in considering questions of perception not only from
        the point of view of consciousness, in the tradition of Fichte, Schelling, or Eschenmayer, but also from the point of view of a most
        fundamental poetics, the emergence and balance of words themselves. In addition to the two cases discussed above, there are other aphorisms by
        Novalis that take up the concept of equilibrium from the point of view of poetic production: in one case, wit (<emph>Witz</emph>) is
        defined as both a consequence of equilibrium’s disruption and as the instrument of its reestablishment (2.424.30), and in another case,
        Novalis refers to a perfect genius (a loose translation for “<emph>eine vollendete, genialische Constitution</emph>”) where the
        inner and outer senses are in equilibrium (2.454.93). In Novalis’s notes, one can even find a glimmer of an analogy to Schelling’s “first
        philosopher.” Given that, for Novalis, the interplay of change [<emph>Veränderung</emph>] and persistence [<emph>Beharrung</emph>] are the defining characteristics statics and mechanics (3.780),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> 780. Statistische und mechanische <emph>Veränderungen</emph>.<lb/> Statistische und Mechanische [sic] <emph>Beharrungen</emph>. </note> then with regard to his statement that “The philosopher changes in the eternally
        persistent” [“<emph>Der Philosoph verändert sich im ewig Beharrlichen</emph>”] (3.693.705), one see that the activity of Novalis’s
        philosopher, like Schelling’s, is also defined in comparable terms. If Schelling’s philosopher equates the origin of philosophical thinking
        with the disruption of absolute equilibrium, then Novalis’s philosopher is his logical disciple, someone who exists in an actively restful
        state of relative equilibrium. </p>

                  <head>3. Applied equilibrium: Eschenmayer’s psychology</head>
                  <p>Eschenmayer’s 1817 treatise, <emph>Psychology in Three Parts as Empirical, Pure, and Applied</emph>, exhibits the most advanced
        theoretical thinking about equilibrium’s function to connect the material and non-material and as a concept that becomes an object of
        visualization in its own right. Eschenmayer’s text invokes the lever’s law of equilibrium in each section, shaping it according to the
        context, such that it emerges each time as the physical counterpoint to a subjective understanding of equilibrium. In this treatise,
        psychology usurps the place of philosophy. It has become the master discourse that is, for Eschenmayer, nothing less than the “<emph>elementary science</emph> or the root of all philosophy” (<emph>Psychology </emph>2). It is the
        psychologist who embodies one of the central arguments Eschenmayer develops—arguably the most important one, and certainly the one that bears
        most directly on the concept of equilibrium—because it is the psychologist, not the philosopher or scientist, who is aware that that all laws
        of nature are corollaries of subjective intuitions, and that this structure is replicated in psychological theories on the structure of the
        brain itself.</p>
                  <p>Even though Eschenmayer’s thinking about equilibrium is most extensive and innovative in the section on applied psychology, it is helpful to
        see how it enters the discussion in the first two sections of his treatise because the function of equilibrium in the final section enacts a
        synthesis of what comes before. In the first section, on empirical psychology, the faculty of feeling is the one most worthy of attention
        according to Eschenmayer because it is situated both “in the middle row of the faculties” and “in the middle point of the entire human,” a
        position analogous to the fulcrum (<emph>Psychology</emph> 85).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> With direct reference to Kant, he identifies this faculty with that of “pleasure and displeasure” we have already had occasion to
              consider in the context of the essay on negative quantities.</note> The centrality of this faculty functions for Eschenmayer
        within a logic of equilibrium, because it is here that one finds “the absolute unity or the absolute equilibrium of the entire mental [<emph>geistigen</emph>] organism in man” (ibid.). Absolute equilibrium should not be understood here as “original” as described by
        Fichte and Schelling but rather in the sense of an absolute mechanical equilibrium advocated in Eschenmayer’s earlier texts, as a constant
        point of departure and return among a stream of external impulses. The metaphor Eschenmayer uses—a purely aesthetic one—is the plucking of a
        string: “Thus what enters into the faculty of feeling plucks as it were all of man’s strings at once, and its harmonious or disharmonious
        tone, that is, pleasure or displeasure, is felt in the entire human” (ibid.). Eschenmayer mobilizes his description of the faculty of feeling
        as a point of departure for a series of ever farther-reaching comparisons, whereby man is always in the middle point, between the traditional
        dichotomies such as spirit and nature, mind and body. The mechanical model of equilibrium is prefigured here without yet receiving the full
        exposition it will in the following sections, but the example Eschenmayer gives of the figure of navigation between the material and the
        immaterial fits well with the dichotomies listed above: “All mental oppositions in man are mediated through the <emph>ego</emph> . .
        . thus in mechanics, for example, the <emph>hypomochlion</emph> on the <emph>lever</emph> [is] that which mediates between
        force and weight” (<emph>Psychology </emph>188, emphasis in the original).</p>
                  <p> In the second section, on pure psychology, we learn the degree to which Eschenmayer is willing to pursue his comparison between equilibrium
        among the components of his model of the self and the law of equilibrium as it applies to the mechanical balance or lever. The self, for
        Eschenmayer, is at the fulcrum or hypomochlion of being and knowing: “<emph>self-consciousness</emph> is a <emph>knowledge of the self about being</emph>” whereby the self serves as “copula” between the two
        (<emph>Psychology </emph>287). Though being and knowing have a relation to each other through their mutual
        relation to the self, Eschenmayer is careful to point out that this common relation does not make them identical: “what matters here is that
        we do not confuse a <emph>relational </emph>[<emph>beziehungsweises</emph>] <emph>equivalence</emph> with a <emph>complete identity</emph>” (ibid.).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This with reference to Fichte.</note> In other words, we are dealing with a model of relative equilibrium,
        of effects that have not been completely sublated. Once again, Eschenmayer turns to the lever’s law of equilibrium, this time as an example
        that includes a diagram that could be found in any textbook on classical mechanics that symbolizes the act of balancing between something
        material (a weight) and something abstract (force):

                        <p rend="noCount">Nature philosophy distinguishes between a <emph>relative and an absolute equilibrium</emph>. Relative is the equilibrium on the
        lever, when weight and force lie beyond the hypomochlion, and for that reason are also object of intuition and calculation. If one brings,
        however, weight and force closer and closer together, and finally too close, so that they collapse with the hypomochlion, then equilibrium
        becomes absolute and thus has nothing more to offer the intuition. </p>
                        <p rend="noCount">In a similar relation, the three factors that lie in the proposition [<emph>Satz</emph>] of the self-consciousness can be

                     </quote>
      For the first time in the treatise, Eschenmayer introduces diagrams as a technique of graphic visualization. In the first, the model of the
        mechanical lever is visualized, and it is presumably in relative equilibrium because “force” and “weight” have not collapsed in the
        hypomochlion. This diagram resembles a physical lever and functions accordingly, and it also instates its own artificiality as diagram and
        visualizes the theoretical construct that the physical lever embodies. It is a projection of the “object of intuition” in print. The second
          diagram—<emph>Knowledge . Self . Being</emph>.—only deserves such a designation because of the italics and white space that set it
        off from the rest of the text and because it is meant to recall the first diagram in its linear arrangement of three terms, whereby the
        outside two compete in their relations with the central term. The diagrams each function doubly: first, they show how the material assemblage
        of the lever (as it is faithfully represented as diagram) has the ability to make connections between abstract terms and things that are
        material or accessible to the senses. They also show, through the repetition of the second diagram, that equilibrium itself can serve as a
        hermeneutic tool, and that it is possible to make comparisons between equilibrium states to advance our understanding of how the mind works
        through a provocative analogy between the immateriality of knowledge and the materiality of being. </p>
                  <p>Eschenmayer develops this model in his section on applied (or “practical”) psychology, which he describes as a “new attempt” (10) in the
        field. Although the phrase “applied psychology” appears as early as the 1790s in Karl Philipp Moritz’s
          <emph>Magazine for Empirical Psychology </emph>[<emph>Magazin für Erfahrungsseelenkunde</emph>],
        Eschenmayer’s text represents the first attempt to think systematically about an applied psychology in any depth.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The only person who seems to have thought systematically about an applied psychology before
              Eschenmayer is Johann Karl Wezel. In Wezel’s text, there is no clear distinction made between empirical and applied
            psychology.</note> As he states in the introductory paragraph, the word “applied” is to be understood in the same sense as a
        mathematician—or indeed, any theorist—would take theoretical propositions and apply them to cases drawn from experience. We do not have to
        look far to encounter the concept of equilibrium once more: “Thus the general formulas and equations of mathematics, for example the
        proposition of the equilibrium of mass with speed, find their application in mechanics, statics, astronomy. Entirely in this sense I position
        a <emph>pure</emph> and <emph>applied</emph> psychology in opposition to each other”
        (<emph>Psychology </emph>423). It is possible to see that equilibrium, a concept deployed in mechanics,
        statics, and astronomy, has come to embody the figure of application itself. It thereby becomes an example for how quantitative models can be
        seen to influence methodological approaches: metaphors of equilibrium have become metaphors of method.</p>
                  <p> The purpose of an applied psychology is much more than a unidirectional application of theory to experience. It is an argument that “laws of
        thought” (<emph>Geseze</emph> [sic] <emph>des Denkens</emph>) become objective in “physical nature”—that there is complete
        congruence between the intellectual “realm of freedom” and the physical “realm of necessity”
        (<emph>Psychology </emph>428). The discovery of this congruence may well begin with experience. The
        counterpoint to Fichte and Schelling’s narrative of “the philosopher” is Eschenmayer’s natural scientist (<emph>Naturforscher</emph>) who gathers elements of experience and observations of the world, orders them, and tries to find the laws governing them
        even as, unbeknownst to him, he is being led from the general law that exists within himself. Once again, the special case that illustrates
        this general point is the lever: 
      <quote>The physicist believes, for example, that he invented the law of the lever. The psychologist, however, shows him the prototype of it already
        in the law of self-consciousness and can demonstrate to the physicist that such an expression of equilibrium in nature must necessarily take
        place. (<emph>Psychology </emph>435)</quote>
      The law of the lever also illustrates how knowledge-building works in two directions, that physical laws can be “applied” to the
        self-consciousness to reveal something new even if these laws are images [<emph>Abbilder</emph>] of the mind. Eschenmayer reminds us
        that the opposition of force and weight mirrors that of knowledge and being, that the mediating function of being is expressed in the lever’s
        hypomochlion, and that “the equation of knowledge and being is expressed through the relative equilibrium of weight and force”
        (<emph>Psychology </emph>448). There is another aspect to the law of the lever relevant here, however: that the
        lever or balance is in equilibrium when the ratio weight and force is the inverse of their distance from the hypomochlion. According to
        Eschenmayer, this is also applicable to the self-consciousness: 
      <quote>Knowledge namely becomes an even greater force, and stands in equilibrium with an even greater weight, the more it is removed from the
        standpoint of the self, and thereby approaches the standpoint of ideas. Thus the law of self-consciousness expresses in its objective form
        precisely that which the law of mechanics does in its objective form, and this correspondence is not a contingent, but rather a necessary one.
        Nature cannot appear to us otherwise than in such forms that are innate [<emph>eingebildet</emph>] to our spirit.
        (<emph>Psychology </emph>435)</quote>
      This passage reinforces the fact that at the heart of Eschenmayer’s “applied psychology” one finds an “applied equilibrium.” After its
        appropriation from the physical world in the service of philosophical theory, at one time it might have been sufficient to say that
        equilibrium’s instrumental value simply lies in the connection of material and non-material concepts, but Eschenmayer’s psychology proves that
        this is no longer the case. Equilibrium has been promoted to an instrument of reasoning in its own right. As the above examples have shown,
        however, this does not mean that the mechanical balances and levers have been left behind. Rather, they have remained, as diagrams and figures
        of thought, and as reminders that the concept of equilibrium itself has become necessary for continued negotiations between the physical world
        on the one hand and the world of abstract forces, knowledge, and consciousness on the other. Any “aesthetics of equilibrium” in the
        nature-philosophical context must therefore also refer to the negotiations that take place between the two. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">When, in his commentary on G.E. Lessing’s writings, Friedrich Schlegel describes his aim “to characterize the spirit of
          Lessing as a whole," he evokes the traditional distinction between spirit and letter that had come to form the point of departure for the
          hermeneutic enterprise, in and beyond biblical exegesis. Yet the meaning that this distinction assumes in Schlegel’s writings, from his
          earliest studies of Greek and Roman poetry, to his <title level="m">Conversation on Poetry</title>, is not one that would promise interpretive closure of any kind.
          Instead, the distinction itself and the infinite demands for interpretation that arise from it can be traced to a dynamic particular to
          writing, which Schlegel outlines in his philological approaches to biblical scripture, Lessing, and poetry. In my contribution, I seek to
          draw out the implications of Schlegel's scriptural philology, looking back to its biblical precedents and forward to the kind of reading his
          intervention solicits. </p>

          or regressive: the decision is suspended, as the two directions of Schlegel-philology—historical and forward-looking, and often both at
          once—proceed at a relatively even pace (Wohlleben ch. 6, Gray, Thouard, Benne). The motive for this general interest may be a certain
          skepticism towards philosophy and philology alike,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a reading of the ancient tradition of skepticism
            and its relation to Schlegel’s usage of “Skepsis” in his philological and philosophical notebooks, see Benne, “Philologie und
            Skepsis.”</note> or towards the critical intersection between the two, for which Schlegel’s title “philosophy of philology” has become the

              Beiträge</emph>.</note>—perhaps not without a certain dose of irony, even on the part of those philologists who seem to comprehend and
          affirm this spokesman of early Romanticism most wholeheartedly. Any attempt, however, to characterize Schlegel’s philology “as a whole”
          cannot strive towards a positivistic account, over and above a corpus of material to be examined, interpreted, and explained; it cannot be
          cited as evidence for a new thesis on the golden mean, golden age—or “<emph>golden mediocrity </emph>[<emph>goldene
            Mittelmäßigkeit</emph>]<emph>”</emph> (2: 103)<emph>—</emph>of clear and distinct results in the discipline of literary studies; and it
          cannot be opposed to the incomprehensibility of language, irony, and rhetoric in his fragmentary corpus (and their consequences for
            philology)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One of the most exceptional readings of Schlegel’s fragments on philology—and philological
            texts in their own right—is Werner Hamacher’s <emph>Für—Die Philologie</emph>. </note>—without ignoring the spirit of the letter. </p>
               <p>It is evident from Schlegel’s attempts “to characterize the spirit of Lessing as a whole [<emph>Lessings Geist im ganzen zu
            charakterisieren</emph>]<emph>”</emph> (2: 100, <emph>Lessings Geist </emph>2: 4)] that no interested (or even interesting) reading would
          be adequate, should it seek merely to discern therein the “rules [<emph>Regeln</emph>] of dramatic poetry” or to find the “bare, blank, and
          rock-steady [<emph>bare und blanke und felsenfeste</emph>] science about the first and last causes [<emph>Gründe</emph>] of the plastic arts
          and their relationship to poetry” (2: 111). Reading to extract rules, petrified knowledge, or sufficient and final causes, is not true
          reading, at least not in Schlegel’s sense. Like the modus of aesthetic reflection in Kantian philosophy, which Schlegel seems to paraphrase
          in earnest, the only comportment worthy to be called “<emph>Studium,</emph>” or “exponentiated [<emph>potenziertes</emph>]” reading (16:
          139) would be an uninterested and free one, limited by no definite “need [<emph>Bedürfnis</emph>]” or “goal [<emph>Zweck</emph>].” And only
          such a reading would be able to “grasp the spirit of an author and make a judgment about him” (2: 111). This makes, apparently, all the
          difference—though one must hesitate here, too, to draw any positive consequences on what difference it makes. For Schlegel will go on to
          parody the serious initiate from Lessing’s <emph>Ernst und Falk: Gespräche für Freimaurer</emph>, writing of his disinterested reading, “and
          a light went off [. . .] for me [<emph>und mir [ist] ein Licht</emph> [. . .] <emph>aufgegangen</emph>],” which, as for <emph>Ernst</emph>,
          is “too much at once [<emph>Zuviel auf einmal</emph>]” (Lessing 8: 589):<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The sequence in Lessing’s
            dialogue that Schlegel parodies begins, as Falk interrupts himself to ask “Ernst! How are you?<emph>”</emph> to which Ernst answers “Like
            a blinded man.” Falk then asks, “Does some light go off for you now? [<emph>Geht dir nun einiges Licht auf</emph>?]” to which he replies,
            “Some? Too much at once [<emph>Einiges? Zuviel auf einmal</emph>]” (8: 589).</note> Schlegel finds himself suddenly unable to extricate
          himself from the labyrinth of Lessing’s collected works in order to write—or so he writes. Or so he wrote. But Schlegel’s glaring parody of
          this Enlightenment author and the author of “What is Enlightenment?” does not diminish the seriousness of his objection to the first
          approach to texts. It indicates only that Kantian aesthetic reflection, too, cannot be taken as the unquestioned premise of
          philology—especially not when this disinterested modus will soon be reformulated as an “interest of study [<emph>Studium</emph>]” in its own
          right (2: 111). </p>
               <p>Should, however, Schlegel’s essay, as well as his three-volume edition and commentary on Lessing’s writings, entitled <emph>Lessing’s
            Spirit from out of His Writings </emph>[<emph>Lessings Geist aus seinen Schriften</emph>], be taken seriously as philology? One might
          speculate: because the object of philology and reading cannot be bare, blank, or rock-solid—it is, after all, inscribed—any imparting of
          textual understanding cannot but participate in the writing of the text, in its spirit. To return to the example of Lessing, whose “spirit
          as a whole” Schlegel attempts to characterize more than twice,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a recent discussion of Schlegel’s
            Lessing studies and a copious bibliography on his Lessing reception—which, however, follows a very different trajectory than my own—see
            Lagny/Thouard. Although these writers stress the importance of the distinction between spirit and letter to Schlegel’s philology and argue
            that a combination of disinterested reflection and a sudden illumination are what guarantee the validity of Schlegel’s critical
            intervention, they do not address the way Schlegel’s prose suggests that Kantian reflection is not sufficient, and that the breakthrough
            he claims to have experienced is itself a parody of Lessing’s dialogue, <emph>Ernst und Falk</emph>. </note> it is the citation of and
          interpolations in the text; the re-presentation of selected passages, parodic or serious; and commentaries in a prose inflected by Lessing’s
          own, that appear in print. And at another extreme, at the end of the second edition of his Lessing essay, to which he adds a new conclusion,
          Schlegel reprints, in a different arrangement, many of the fragments that had appeared in <emph>Lyceum</emph> and <emph>Athenäum</emph>
          several years earlier to express in his own words what he calls the character of Lessing’s “mixture of literature, polemic, wit, and
            philosophy,<emph>”</emph> and above all, his “<emph>Neigung dazu</emph>” (2: 398)—which could be translated as his “proper inclination to
          that mixture” or his “proper inclination in addition to all of that”—which would absolve Schlegel’s critique from Lessing’s writings
          utterly. Whether Schlegel’s inclination or <emph>philia</emph> is for the writing of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing or for Friedrich Schlegel is
          undecidable; however, both tendencies coincide in Schlegel’s curation of his texts under the auspices of Lessing. Here, appropriately, the
          word for philology, for the love of the word—the title that Schlegel gives this new collection of his former fragments, which he attributes
          to an affinity toward his predecessor and now gives back in tribute to him, as an “Offering for the Immortal Dead [<emph>Todtenopfer für den
            Unsterblichen</emph>]”—is “<emph>Eisenfeile,</emph>” or ‘iron-filings,’ which also nearly reads “<emph>Eisenpfeile,</emph>” or
          ‘iron-arrows,’ to denote magnet shavings which “from within and without, aim thereaway [<emph>dahin zielen</emph>]<emph>”</emph> (2:
            398).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Schlegel translates the <emph>philia</emph> of philology with the German word
              “<emph>Neigung</emph>” in his first notebook, “<emph>Zur Philologie”</emph> (16: 42).</note> Schlegel’s feilology or pfeilology not only
          condenses attraction and dispersion in such a way that no determinate aim can be definitively met, but he also rends to pieces—to a
          plurality of filings—the magnetic chain of transmission that Socrates evokes in his description of the epic muses, poets, rhapsodes and
          audiences in Plato’s <emph>Ion</emph>; he breaks through while perpetuating the mixture that drew him early to Lessing and that still chains
          him (“<emph>und mich noch an ihn fesselt</emph>”); and he thoroughly departs from any assumption that a philology adequate to at least
          Lessing’s writings could be reached any other way but by parsing his writings differently and writing differently from him. And if this does
          not necessarily mean that one can only write of poetry in poetry, it does imply that one cannot read Schlegel unaffected by his own
          characterizations of philology, or the variants thereof.—</p>
               <p>Central to the articulation of not only Schlegel’s Lessing-philology, but also his <emph>Studium</emph> essay on Greek poetry and his notes
          towards a study of the “Concept of Philology” for Niethammer’s <emph>Philosophisches Journal</emph>, is the distinction between spirit and
          letter. This binary pair is crucial, not only because it should allow readers to distinguish something in Lessing’s letters that differs
          from mere objects of knowledge that one might reduce, reuse, recycle, but also in that it defines, arguably, the point of distinction that
          Schlegel reiterates between classical and progressive literature throughout his writing. First of all, however, no reading of
            “<emph>writing</emph>” as such, let alone any particular writer’s spirit, or his time, could be understood apart from this religious
            schism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For two very different approaches to this problem, see Kittler and Chaouli. </note> For modern,
          progressive philology—which, according to Schlegel, has yet to reach its end—begins with the Lutheran apotheosis of scripture (18: 545, 2:
          203), or, more generally, with the interpretation of Holy Scripture, from the Talmud through Protestant hermeneutics and beyond (16: 42).
          More literally, it begins simply with the written work, the “<emph>Bibel”</emph> or “<emph>Book”</emph> (18: 226, 227)—and “every book must,
          to a certain degree, be a Bible” (18: 344)<emph>—</emph>as opposed to the “saga [<emph>Sage</emph>]<emph>”</emph> or “<emph>mythos”</emph>
          of classical poetry. The <emph>“</emph>saga<emph>”</emph> can only, as such, be said, and thus can never be distinguished from the “saying
            [<emph>Sagen</emph>]<emph>”</emph> itself.—Its transmission may proceed by pure inspiration or by purely memorized and mechanical
          means—and Plato’s Ion, to whom Schlegel refers in his discussion of the Homeric rhapsodes in his <emph>History of the Poetry of the Greeks
            and Romans</emph>, is exemplary of this ambivalence. But whether one takes him for a prophet or a parrot, “he knew nothing to say of the
          other poets besides Homer<emph>”</emph> (1: 459),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an excellent reading of this Platonic dialogue and
            its implications for hermeneutics, see Nancy <emph>Le partage des voix</emph>.</note> and for this reason, his saying says, strictly
          speaking, nothing of anything else. Insofar as there would be, so to speak, no way to tell the difference between inspiration and mechanism,
          freedom and compulsion, one can only affirm Schlegel’s dictum: <emph>“</emph>without the letter, no spirit [<emph>ohne Buchstabe, kein
            Geist</emph>]<emph>”</emph> (18: 327). What defines the book, on the other hand, is the inscription of the letter beside myth: “A book is
          a grammatical and mythological system—therefore a religious concept<emph>”</emph> (18: 78)<emph>, </emph>and it is this (dis)junction of
          saying and writing, spirit and letter that also marks phrases such as “Holy Scripture.” But one can describe this concept more precisely:
          the letter halts any saying decisively by inscribing it; finished, it may thenceforth only be endlessly approximated by those readers,
          interpreters, or magicians who would release the spirit that is bound (18: 297)—but that, as spirit, is boundless. The scission of writing
          thus founds a relation between the finite and the infinite—<emph>the </emph>privileged relation that will characterize Romantic reflection,
          philosophy, and religion. And at the same time, it produces the infinite incompletion or excess of writing and reading that any hermeneutic
          enterprise cannot but augment. Ernesti, and later, Schleiermacher, will insist precisely that for every word in every text there is only one
          sense at any one place and time, though every word can very well have a different, particular determination in each passage of each text
          (Ernesti 17; Schleiermacher 32, 36, 40). At the same time, to determine one word definitively in the ways they prescribe, one would need the
          totality of historical and archival knowledge that Schlegel asserts at the start of his <emph>Studium</emph> essay on the Greeks and
          Romans—only to abandon it immediately—as the precondition for working through even the smallest part of a literary whole (cf. 1: 206). This,
          one can only endlessly approximate: “How immense the difficulties of singular, perhaps very small parts!” (1: 205–06). But even before that,
          one would have to decide upon what the one place and time of one word in one text might be, which leads, in its own right, to immeasurable
          difficulties. Each word in each text would be infinite, like Holy Scripture, and also, for this reason, beyond any economy of knowledge,
          usage, or definition.—</p>
               <p>One could thus designate the philology of the book, with the Lutheran scholar Salomon Glass (and after him, Schlegel), <emph>Philologia
            sacra</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a useful introduction to this work, see Bultmann / Danneberg. In none of the notes on
            philology that have been published in the <emph>Kritische Ausgabe</emph>, however, does Schlegel name Glass among the many philologists he
            mentions. Hence, the term in his writings need not necessarily refer to this particular articulation of “sacral philology,” which was a
            widely reprinted, edited (and read) handbook for Biblical interpretation. </note> But one would also have to note the paradox that, from
          the moment writing is taken to have spirit and sense; from the moment it is holy—and, consequently, a writing that must decry writing in its
          finite form—its further writing cannot stop.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an incisive discussion of the centrality of the book—as
            Bible—to the Romantic project, see Lacoue-Labarthe / Nancy 195.</note> Consequently, no text, no Bible, can be complete, which can be just
          as well articulated by asserting, as Schlegel does at one point, “Fragments (sayings) [{<emph>Sprüche</emph>}] are the proper form of
          Biblical delivery<emph>”</emph> (18: 201)—or, as he does at another, “the Bible had the beautiful disposition to be an &lt;absolutely
          universal&gt; <emph>popular novel</emph> that could <hi rendition="#smallcaps">always be furthered [immer fortgesetzt]</hi>; Luther’s
          mistake was to fix it and to cut off the <emph>Legends”</emph> (16: 123). The Bible—or the utterly dislimited, <emph>biblical</emph> text—as
          fragment and novel, as the two forms of Romantic literature <emph>per se</emph>, is structured such that there will always be more to read,
          and to read more. </p>
               <p>More than this, the reverse is also true: it is structured such that, in its furtherance, it may always be interrupted and further cut.
          Here, once again, Schlegel’s Lessing edition is exemplary. For in his introduction to the second volume, Schlegel writes, <quote>In that
            now, however, everything that relates to the thoughts of another, to objects that are now completely indifferent, to opinions that are
            forgotten, to books that are so good as obliterated, had to be struck out, only fragments remained from the greater part of Lessing’s
            writings, which have become this [fragments] entirely without our doing, or rather, this is what they were from the very start, and only
            after the disturbing interpolations [<emph>Zwischendinge</emph>] were taken away, could they appear in their original shape. (2: 3)
          </quote> The continuation of the book is its cutting, and this cutting, a return to its origin, since what was originally fragmentary can
          only be realized as such after the fact. However, Schlegel suggests no necessary or causal force behind the indifference, forgetting, and
          destruction that will render parts of a book extraneous to it. This progress is without orientation and thus no progress at all, and yet it
          turns Lessing’s collected writings into an assembly of fragments, which Schlegel himself can only reproduce by removing from Lessing’s
          writing what turns out to have always belonged to others, and by breaking off what had appeared to be complete. The task of the philologist,
          then, would be the critical task of deciding the original—as it always was for the classicist, concerned as he is with removing
          interpolations, or at least striving to restore the text “nearer to its former and proper form [<emph>propius ad antiquam et suam
            formam</emph>]” (Wolf 1)—but with the caveat that the original can become apparent only over time in the first place. And because the task
          of curating its appearance is infinite, it can only be cut off—and, at another point, by another reader, at another time, <hi rendition="#smallcaps">furthered</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One of the best commentaries on philology as furtherance is
            Hamacher’s <emph>Für—die Philologie</emph> 40 c.f. See also <emph>Entferntes Verstehen</emph> 229.</note> So long as the end of time has
          not arrived, no word will have found its ultimate place, date, or attribution; no spirit of any writer will have appeared; and modern
          philology will have to continue, with more or less precision, until the Revelation, which would “make an end to philology proper” (16:
          41).</p>
               <p>Hence, Schlegel can affirm repeatedly the (relative) coincidence of Lutheranism and progressive philology and, in consonance with such
          assertions, write, “philologia sacra, a non-entity [<emph>Unding der philologia sacra</emph>]” (16: 41). But the paradox also follows: in
          the age of books and bibles, where no letter and no writer is certain, sacral or progressive philology may be performed only upon the
          profane classical text, and the fragmentary remains of antiquity may be the only finished text as such: “Among the ancients, one sees the
          achieved letter of poetry in its entirety: in newer [writers], one intimates the evolving spirit [<emph>In den Alten sieht man den
            vollendeten Buchstaben der ganzen Poesie: in den Neuern ahnet man den werdenden Geist</emph>]<emph>”</emph> (2: 158).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Of course, as Lagny / Thouard remark in their discussion of Schlegel’s Lessing studies, the moment that a work is taken as
            an object of reading, it is taken as a classical text (612)—which Schlegel’s Marcus states explicitly in the <emph>Conversation on Poetry
            </emph>(2: 340). However, this only strengthens, rather than weakens, the fragility of the classical text as such.</note> Upon these
          premises, the modern age of <emph>mere</emph> literature would be utterly bereft of letters and thus like “a collection of variations with
          running commentary [...] for which the classical text was lost” (2: 198). But the classical <emph>text</emph>—which by definition no longer
          speaks or says its myth—<emph>is</emph> from the moment it becomes the object of bibliophilic philology.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            This is also one of the most radical consequences of Friedrich August Wolf’s <emph>Prolegomena ad Homerum</emph>, which suggests that the
            closest we might come to the original Homeric poems is the critical editions of the first Alexandrian scholars (3). Schlegel stresses the
            importance of Wolf’s philology to his own explicitly in his notebooks “<emph>Zur Philologie I</emph>” and “<emph>Zur Philologie II</emph>”
            (16: 25–81), and in his earlier, published essay “Über die Homerische Poesie,” which begins with a footnote, in praise of Wolf’s
              <emph>Prolegomena</emph> (1: 116). </note> At the same time, the original that each edition provisionally manifests—each time “now for
          the first time [<emph>erst jetzt</emph>]”—has and will change. And each different original can, consequently, be neither old nor new.
          Rather, it would be the promise of an original that was and is still to come, the temporary product of a philological decision, which, from
          its inscription, is also irrevocable and irrevocably lost, like the text before us, in the blink of an eye.—</p>
               <p>All of these observations have important consequences for Schlegel-philology, for his philology and for those who would take his text
          (which is at once incomplete and excessive, full of fragmentary variations that reprise and even reverse earlier versions) seriously. In
          other words, what Schlegel says of modern letters is and will be true, first of all, of his own, which, in turn, invalidates many of the
          terms that are still operative in literary scholarship today. Others, such as Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Susan Bernstein,
          have exposed incisively how Schlegel’s Romantic writing (itself a fraught category) makes the work, the subject of writing and reading, the
          boundaries and contours of a text (or “fragment”)—and thus their potential characterization as an object of study, reading, and writing—as
          well as the historical status of all these ideal entities, untenable.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This list is necessarily incomplete,
            given the vast amount of scholarship devoted to the problem of addressing Schlegel’s writing in terms adequate to it. Still, there are few
            scholars who take this problem seriously enough to let it inflect their own scholarly prose. Other notable exceptions would include
            Blanchot and Benjamin.</note> But if this has all been said, as Werner Hamacher has said, citing Schlegel, “nothing is said yet
            [<emph>Nichts ist noch gesagt</emph>]”—at least not so that it were not possible to say it further (<emph>Entferntes Verstehen</emph>
          197). And one might add that the critical dissolution of our contemporary philological categories follows from the distinction between the
          spirit and the letter that Schlegel draws repeatedly throughout his œuvre.—</p>
               <p>If the difference between spirit and letter <emph>per se </emph>compels one to distinguish, in writing, something other than rules,
          science, or causes—and therefore something that cannot be prescribed, known, and determined—the more immediate origins of this distinction
          would nonetheless be crucial to study in approaching Schlegel’s philology. First of all, his affirmation of spirit in writing solicits
          closer attention to Fichte, whom Schlegel proclaims the proper heir of Lessing’s thought in the dedication, “<emph>An Fichte</emph>,” that
          opens his Lessing edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The most extensive commentary on Fichte’s distinction between spirit and letter
            is Weissberg, who devotes much attention to the tensions between his essay and Friedrich Schiller’s <emph>On the Aesthetic Education of
              Man</emph>, which led to the breach between Fichte and Schiller, the latter of whom had intended to publish Fichte’s text in the
              <emph>Horen</emph>—until he read it. Nonetheless, the more general scope of her study means that her account differs from the narrower
            analysis of Fichte’s text that I am offering.</note> And few writers insisted upon the spirit of writing so strongly and repeatedly as
          Fichte, who draws the distinction between spirit and letter with each iteration of his <emph>Wissenschaftslehre</emph>, before elaborating
          it at length in an epistolary essay from 1794, <emph>On Spirit and Letter in Philosophy</emph>. There, what begins as a response to his
          correspondent’s question on studiously reading philosophical texts develops into reflections on spirit as such, which, like Schlegel’s
            “<emph>Sage</emph>” or “<emph>Mythus</emph>,” is one: “Spirit is one [<emph>der Geist ist Einer</emph>]<emph>,</emph> and what is set
          through the essence of reason is one and the same in all reasonable individuals” (I,6: 354). </p>
               <p>Because spirit, or reason, is one and the same in all, it is absolute and absolved from the categorical determinations that allow us to
          construe objects <emph>a priori</emph> and to know them when they appear—including the empty category “<emph>is</emph>” (I,6: 340,
            341).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Structurally, the problem of speaking of spirit, or of a spirit that would speak in and through
            letters, thus resembles the problem of Fichte’s first foundational proposition of the <emph>“</emph>I” that sets itself, as Hamacher
            describes it in <emph>Entferntes Verstehen</emph>: “sheer performation, the setting <emph>I</emph> is capable of no constatation, but is
            absolute excess over every possible objectification and every subject reflecting itself in an object as itself. If this performation
            nonetheless becomes an object of constatation, then its setting must cease / set out in a set law, must be brought to an end set not in
            itself; it must be broken off and can therefore no longer be constated as performation and reflected as constating [<emph>schiere
              Performation, ist die Setzung Ich keiner Konstatierung fähig, ist sie absoluter Exzeß über jede mögliche Vergegenständlichung und jedes
              sich in einem Objekt als sich selbst reflektierende Subjekt. Wird diese Performation dennoch Gegenstand einer Konstatieren, so muß ihr
              Setzen in einem Gesetzten aussetzen, muß an ein in ihr selbst nicht gesetztes Ende gebracht, abgebrochen werden und kann also nicht mehr
              als Performation konstatiert und konstatierend reflektiert werden</emph>]” (208).</note> For this reason, spirit cannot itself be
          represented or desired—or predicated. What is within us all, because it is within us, and not an object for us, cannot but be utterly
          foreign—at least at first. On the first analysis, we recognize nothing besides what we know and want, ourselves being the “<emph>now</emph>”
          of a “present need” (I,6: 348). Spirit would be nothing to speak of, and different from all we could speak, but suddenly: “That which is in
          us through the aesthetic drive is discovered through an unxpected, surprising, completely purposeless, intentionless contentment or
          discontent that stands in no conceivable relation to the remaining faculties of our mind” (I,6: 345). Aesthetic pleasure, as well as spirit,
          which will be its poetic counterpart, is discovered—discovers itself [<emph>entdeckt sich</emph>]—and takes us by surprise. In the blink of
          an eye, the moments of intention, purpose, conceptualization and anticipation, the finished and finite faculties of the mind, are suspended.
          But no sensation of this ungraspable intervention is sufficient to assure us of spirit, either. Captivated by the highest pleasure, Fichte
          continues, one is “still in danger to mistake a pleasure that rests upon an obscure, undeveloped, entirely empirical and individual
          practical consciousness, for an aesthetic pleasure” (I,6: 347). Such pleasure is “entirely similar [<emph>völlig ähnlich</emph>]” to and
          thus empirically indistinguishable from the pleasure a magnet would have every time it attracts and thereby receives “a preponderant feeling
          of itself, of its force” (I,6: 344). It may, in other words, be nothing more than an effect of a determining mechanism. </p>
               <p>Fichte asserts that this attraction would differ from the one that is proper to spirit, in that the latter should remain separate from the
          empirical individual—and therefore truly apart from what we may know and want, including, above all, ourselves. The love of spirit would
          consist, rather, in the kind of increase in accord that a songstress would enjoy every time she—were she driven along the scale of tones by
          a force unknown to her—perceived a “concord [<emph>Zusammenstimmung</emph>]” (I,6: 346). Here, the measure is not given by force and mass,
          but by the “scale [<emph>Stufenleiter</emph>]” of tones, and thus an ideal, mathematical topology of harmonic relations that exist <emph>in
            potentia</emph> for all time. But in both cases, the law of pleasure is <emph>more</emph>, and it is no accident that, in contrasting the
          attraction of metal to the immaterial cohesion of harmonics, Fichte draws together a sentient magnet and an inspired performer deprived of
          her senses, nearly pure matter and nearly pure spirit. For with these fantastic hypotheses, in the spirit of E.T.A. Hoffmann, Fichte
          illustrates two diametrically opposed moments of pleasure, which always exceed the conscious self, but which are, at the same time, the
          conditions for being conscious of oneself in the first place. So constituted, the self, properly speaking, is only, as such, ecstatic and
          certainly could not, for itself, tell the difference between magnetism and harmony. Despite their polarity, then, Fichte’s hypothetical
          examples blur as forces and feelings of attraction—like spirit, which may be clothed in different figures, but should be one.</p>
               <p>If there is something more than what we can know and desire, in and other than objects and selves, and thus, in and other than all that we
          can manipulate and dominate, how can one decide between spirit and stone? Since Fichte’s symmetrical opposition of magnet and musician will
          break down utterly, he suggests that we cannot. The first and lowest incarnation of aesthetic taste will manifest itself in pleasure, “in
          the garish colors that violently stimulate the dull eye, and in the sheen of rich metals” (I,6: 349); that is, in gold. Likewise, pure
          spiritual pleasure will be articulated in terms of an economy of accumulation: “Our single greed [<emph>Geiz</emph>], which is precious,
          seizes us to collect spiritual treasures, simply in order to have them and to enthrall us with their sight” (I,6: 350). Beyond the “present
          need” that, for Fichte, defines us as empirical individuals—so that, as individuals, each of us would be nothing other than one shifting
            “<emph>now,</emph>” but also simultaneously opposed to all others—the aesthetic sense owes itself first of all to a surplus: “During calm
          observation that no longer intends the knowledge of what is long since known, but approaches the object once more, superfluously so to
          speak—the aesthetic sense [...] develops” (I,6: 351). And when this surplus becomes productive; when the “gift of inspiration
            [<emph>Eingebung</emph>]” becomes “yield [<emph>Ausgabe</emph>]”; when the artist, overcome, invests spirit in a “more solid body
            [<emph>festeren Körper</emph>]”—and this body is called a “letter [<emph>Buchstabe</emph>]”—he may share his work with others, in order to
          make them, like his work, in his inspired likeness. He may thereby reproduce the supposed unity of spirit <emph>per se</emph>, at least in
          image, and in so doing, he may even complete half the work towards the establishment of a free community, a golden age—as Fichte suggests in
          the last sentence of his text (I,6: 361). But the logic of possession here suggests that spirit would be nothing other than a transposition
          of the very register of need and use value that it should have surpassed. So long as spirit is not articulated differently, so long as there
          is nothing more than more, the work of inspiration will oscillate between accumulation and lack; between the extension of a present need and
          its fulfillment; between ecstasy and doubt—so that the only alternative to gross materialism is an equally extravagant debt. </p>
               <p>Although spirit is one, common to all—and thus, the precondition of all common sense and consensus among free individuals, who are above
          all “free” of their empirical individuality—the moment of inspiration is absolutely fleeting. Any attempt to present it already reflects its
          loss. Before all, Fichte writes, the artist produces artifacts “in order to secure his believe for himself before the hour of cooling and
          doubt” (I,6: 354). Far from redemption, the artist distributes “over his entire species the debt which the make-up
          [<emph>Einrichtung</emph>] of his species charged him with” (I,6: 339). This remark may simply imply that we are obliged to attune ourselves
          to the spirit of his work—and later, Fichte uses the lexicon of music to describe the universal obligation of correct artistic judgment,
          recalling his songstress: “there is a point upon the scale [<emph>Stufenleiter</emph>] of the spiritual formation of all where this work
          would necessarily make the intended impression” (I,6: 354). However, there is no guarantee that anyone will reach this point, or that the
          impression an artwork makes is the intended one. And at the same time, Fichte’s rhetoric implies that the “makeup
          [<emph>Einrichtung</emph>]” of our species, like the “faculties [<emph>Verrichtungen</emph>]” of our mind, is ordered such that there is no
          way to grasp ourselves nor to give ourselves over, as we would have had to, when we encounter traces of spirit, caught as we are in a syntax
          of knowledge or desire. Either way, the gift of the inspired artist would engender a debt that renders his work, its history—as well as any
          philological relation to it, in Schlegel’s sense—utterly precarious.—</p>
               <p>For the logic of pledges and debts that Fichte evokes, however, the original is Paul, who is sealed (σφραγισάμενος) by spirit, bears its
          inscription in his heart, as in his letters, and refers to spirit as a pledge (ἀρραβῶνα) in its own right (2 Cor. 1: 22). The spirit is an
          inherent guarantee for his person and text, through which he, the Paul of Scripture, has come to the Corinthians: ”<emph>this,</emph>” he
          writes in and of his epistle, “<emph>is the third time I come to you</emph>” (2 Cor. 13: 1). However, the spirit, imprinted in his writing,
          is a guarantee only because he, living, gives himself perpetually and repeatedly (ἀεί) to death for the sake of Christ, so that the life of
          Christ, that is spirit, may appear in our mortal carcasses (2 Cor. 4: 11). And as soon as letters are no longer written in stone, like
          Mosiac law, but in spirit, everything, apostle and epistle alike, may be its writing. Thus, Paul dislimits the letter just when he appears
          to dispense with it, so that persons, too, are letters—or, as Fichte puts it in his <emph>Vocation of Man</emph> [<emph>Bestimmung des
            Menschen</emph>], “presentations [<emph>Darstellungen</emph>]” and “likenesses [<emph>Abbildungen</emph>]”—of spirit (I,6: 308). If the
          letter “<emph>kills</emph>” (ἀποκτένει), but the spirit “<emph>makes life</emph>” (ζῳοποιεῖ), the letter of spirit that Paul bears and
          disseminates—the “<emph>new testament, not of letter but of spirit,”</emph> which is writing—must kill and make life at once (2 Cor. 3: 6).
          Such is the paradox of the Pauline distinction between spirit and letter. Likewise, Fichte’s artist, who would make eternal images of
          spirit, must sacrifice himself first of all, in and for the work (I,6: 338), or, as Schlegel puts it in his <emph>Ideen</emph>: “to become
          an artist means to dedicate oneself to the subterraneous gods. In the inspiration of annihilation the sense of divine creation reveals
          itself” (2: 269). Moreover, the same sacrificial demand would fall upon his readers, for all who inherit this testament, or—to speak with
          Paul—his διαθηκή, “<emph>distribution.</emph>”</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this sacrificial logic, the inspired artist makes a security deposit that should secure credit against the moment of doubt,
          and from this moment forward, the debt that is thereby accrued can only increase. The mark of spirit already anticipates the “hour of doubt”
          and thus already belongs to the successive hours that differ from the instant of inspiration. Here, it is no coincidence that the Pauline
          affirmation of the Old Testament, inspired anew, “having the same spirit of belief, according to what was written: ‘I believe, whence I
          speak,’ we also believe, whence we also speak“ (2 Cor. 4: 13), is implicitly inverted: I also write, thence to believe. Also inverted is
          Paul’s unconditional affirmation, “What is announced to you through us [...] was not engendered as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ but has in itself the
          ‘Yes.’ For all that is reported of God, in itself is the ‘Yes’” (2 Cor. 19–20): for what is announced through the artwork, where spirit is
          no longer or not yet, is a congenital “No.”</p>
               <p>As with the structure of revelation, which Fichte had elaborated in his <emph>Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation </emph>around the
          time he was drafting his epistle on spirit and letter, the distinguishing feature of inspiration is the uncertainty of its occurrence, and
          the proliferation of testimonies makes it only harder to tell. If repetition characterizes Paul’s affirmation, repetition becomes
          necessary—though no longer affirmative—in Fichte’s variation of testimony. And again, the law is <emph>more</emph>. Under the auspices of a
          coming hour of doubt, the original inspiration can only be substituted by a model of infinite reproduction, first in the artwork and then in
          its reception. This also has historical implications, for Fichte’s correspondent writes that such reproduction should be a holy day that
          would repeatedly scan, and thus suspend, the calendar until the end of days: “where educated men live, the commemoration of [the artist’s]
          long since extinguished inspiration will be celebrated with its repetition until the end of days” (I,6: 339).</p>
               <p>Either the extinguished inspiration or the inspiration itself is repeated and celebrated, which would amount to either an infinite process
          of reproduction—an end, of sorts, of days—or the instant that would incinerate of all these things, which would no longer be a repetition.
          But even if the repetition should be of the “inspiration” itself, as a repetition, it could not constitute instanteous absolution and could
          therefore only be the preparation for the first, inspired moment, still to come. This structure of the spirited letter thus infinitely
          approximates what Schlegel will note, repeatedly, in his <emph>Philosophical Apprenticeship</emph> [<emph>Philosophische Lehrjahre</emph>],
          in the context of allusions to Fichte’s <emph>Vocation of Man</emph>, which was published in the same year as his essay on the spirit and
          letter, and presented, too, as a text written after the “fire” of “inspiration”—as its afterimage—:<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Fichte
            writes in his preface, “at least the author is aware that he did not set out to work without inspiration,” then adds: “often the fire with
            which one took hold of one’s purpose vanishes during the toil of carrying it out [...]” (I,6 :189). </note> “All humanity is set upon the
          one moment of self-destruction. What is not remembrance of the golden age cannot be anything but [...] preparation for that single moment,
          the festival of all festivals, the mourning play of joy” (18: 394, cf. 18: 175). All humanity would be set towards <emph>the</emph> single
            moment—<emph>each </emph>single moment, which, like inspiration, cannot but be repeatedly assured, even as it should be, finally,
          realized, and no longer remembered. Humanity would be determined to the dissolution of determination; to the instantaneous attainment of the
          absolute, annihilating pleasure of an end of all ends, of all finite being, itself first of all. Here, one finds the origins of Schlegel’s
          approach to Lessing’s writings, where each new testament to his spirit would also be a repetition of the old that erases and replaces it, to
          be continued until the original is at once revealed and absolved from its successive appearances. </p>
               <p>Were there a relation to an artwork that would neither meld into an economy of gain and loss nor dissolve into an ultimate annihilation;
          were there a time for a philological intervention that neither progresses towards the revelatory <emph>telos</emph> that would destroy it,
          nor recycles spiritual material for accumulation and use, it would have to take place as a moment of crisis—a crisis of moments—suspended
          between an immediate “<emph>now</emph>” that no one can fulfill and a date that has not yet been given. And were the distinction between
          spirit and letter to mark this crisis in such a way that no debt or credit would be accrued, spirit could not be an anticipatory or
          promissory pledge. It would have to differ from any such unit or measure of value, and thus also from any unity that might be known through
          its magnitude—or magnetude—of pleasure and accord. The writing the reader takes in, that takes him by surprise or leaves him cold, would
          have to be closer to the ghosts of Hades that haunt Fichte’s interlocutor than the Holy Spirit Paul vouches: “and so often even you believe
          yourself to have grasped its spirit, it slips away from you beneath your very hands” (I,6: 334). At any rate, the spirit cannot be one. “But
          what consensus is there,” asks Paul, “in the temple of God with ghosts?” (2 Cor. 6: 16).—</p>
               <p>Even before Fichte published his essay on spirit and letter, Schlegel reiterates, “Spirit and letter is a religious distinction,” in his
          philosophical notebooks under the heading, “Spirit of the Fichtean Doctrine of Science” (18: 39). And after the appearance of Fichte’s
          essay, it haunts Schlegel’s texts repeatedly—his notes on philology, his <emph>Philosophical Apprenticeship</emph>, and his
            <emph>Ideen</emph>. Above all, however, it haunts the <emph>Conversation on Poetry </emph>[<emph>Gespräch über die Poesie</emph>]. For
          Schlegel opens this text with an affirmation of the unity of reason, which will soon be called spirit, one and the same in all (2: 284; cf.
          Fichte I,6: 354). Throughout his prologue, Schlegel retraces and alters Fichte’s <emph>topoi</emph>—as when the “crowd” that, under the
          influence of Fichte’s artist, “flows together [<emph>zusammenfließt</emph>] into one soul” (338) becomes Schlegel’s “muse,” who “seeks and
          finds the other, and all streams of poetry flow together [<emph>fließen zusammen</emph>] into the universally great sea“ (2: 84). Finally,
          the text nearly closes, like Fichte’s, with praise of Goethe, who clothes, for Schlegel’s poetic personae as for Fichte, “the ancient spirit
          in a modern veil” (2: 346). But all that was affirmed in Fichte’s epistles becomes, in Schlegel’s text, subject to a dispute on love and
          poetry—on philology.</p>
               <p>Fichte never ceases to affirm the eternal unity and self-equivalence of spirit, and thus a common origin and end of all art. But in his
            <emph>Conversation</emph>, Schlegel insists on singular difference through the personae of his dialogue. To begin towards the end: when
          Ludoviko, like Fichte, affirms Goethe’s ability to unite antiquity and modernity—for, he adds, “the spirit of poetry is only one and
          everywhere the same”—Lothario intervenes and appeals to the law of the letter, which is separation: “The spirit indeed! But I would like to
          apply here the division into spirit and letter. [...] In spirit your unconditional combination [<emph>Verbindung</emph>] of the ancients and
          moderns may take place, [...] but not in the letter of poetry. The ancient rhythm, for example, and the measures of rhyme remain eternally
          opposed. There is no third, middle term between both” (2: 348). </p>
               <p>At first, of course, Lothario appears merely to modify the opposition between a unity of spirit and a multitude of letters, which Fichte
          and Ludoviko share. But as he goes on to discuss mutually incompatible prosodies, he goes further than any affirmation or negation of this
          principle difference. For in taking up the very measures of <emph>tempus</emph> in language, rhythm, and meter, and in asserting their
          absolute difference for different languages at different times, Lothario suggests that this feature of letters, before any letter or word,
          would preclude the unification or mediation of two epochs in any poet’s works. As soon as there are at least two measures, the possibility
          of a standard that might unite them, and thus a standard measure at all, is negated: <emph>tertium non datur</emph>. And one can go still
          further, to read this turn in Lothario’s response as an implicit argument against the unity of spirit <emph>per se</emph>. Since, as
          Fichte’s references to harmonic scale had implied, spirit was analogous to formal measures, a fundamental difference in prosodic measure
          would also speak against the structure according to which a common spirit might be posited in the first place. </p>
               <p>Ultimately, there is no unit or unity to be found here. What is “one [<emph>Eins</emph>]” in Lothario’s rejoinder is not ‘unification’ or
            “<emph>Ver-ein-i-gung</emph>”—which he reformulates as combination “<emph>Ver-bind-ung,</emph>” placing an accent upon the
            <emph>bin</emph>ary—but, literally, “division [<emph>Ein-teilung</emph>].” And if this virtuosic performance in language does not
          constitute an argument against Fichte—it may simply be a play on words—any refutation of it, in turn, could rest only upon the conviction
          that arguments take place at a level distinct from the letter. And such a conviction cannot be taken for granted, for this is the topic of
          dispute—and not the standard for truth—among Schlegel’s interlocutors. </p>
               <p>Writing in or against the spirit of Fichte’s letters can only take place in and through further writing, and thus in a way where no
          hermeneutic recuperation of sense or spirit can be guaranteed. To return to the beginning: already in the prologue to his dialogue on
          poetry, Schlegel interrupts Fichte’s proclamation of unity: <quote>Reason is only one and in all the same: but just as each man has his
            proper nature and love, so too does each bear his own poetry within himself. This must and should remain to him, as surely as he is who he
            is, as surely as anything soever original was in him; and no critique can and may rob him of his most proper essence, his most inward
            force, in order to cleanse and purify him into a universal image without spirit or sense, just as fools strive to do, who know not what
            they wish. (2: 284). </quote> Following an apodictic sentence, reminiscent of Fichte, a colon: Schlegel’s assertion of universal reason
          is, in itself, incomplete, and if reason is one and the same in all, there is something else in each that is proper to him, and thus
          distinct, even if it is also proper to all others, which the distributive ”each” not only does not exclude, but grammatically implies. The
          same sentence of reason and poetry splits, then, between two incompatible universalities: the reason inherent in all and the poetry that
          each bears within him, like love and nature. The split is legible at the level of lexis—”in all [...] in himself “—as well as syntax, as the
          form of predication, bound by the copula (“<emph>reason is</emph> [...]“), gives way to an analogy (“<emph>just as </emph>[...]<emph> so
            too</emph>”). Here, the transcendental term cannot but (“<emph>but</emph>”) be disjunctively related to what follows, as Schlegel’s
          rhetoric shifts from what is one in all to determinate natures and inclinations, whereby the distributive does not affirm or negate,
          perpetuate or end, the initial testimony to unity. Unbound from the unity of reason, the predicates proper to each are, in turn, loosely
          connected with another, as to each man who has them. But how propriety should belong to each man is elaborated only in the following
          sentence, and in such a way that the unity of “<emph>each,</emph>” too, dissolves upon scrutiny. For as long as anyone <emph>is</emph>, be
          it that his most proper determination is no more than <emph>that</emph> he is who he is, no one can <emph>be</emph> one image, even of
          himself. His identity could only be affirmed in the redoubling and the minimal difference inscribed in “he is who he is,” where
            “<emph>he</emph>” oscillates between a pronomial placeholder and a deictic determination that points only to his further displacement. </p>
               <p>This means, perhaps, that nothing could be less certain than the identity of each, and thus his existence—though it is still possible to
          say that something “original was in him” and, as an original determination, made him the singular being that he may be. But if both
          propositions are “so sure,” and for the same reason, so equally uncertain, then there is no one “image,” neither singular nor general, of
          the spirit, the letter, or the apostle who would mediate the two. To want this image, which is the idea of Fichte’s “I,” if there ever was
          one, is to wish for the annihilation of any one and any thing that could be, on the part of those who know not what they do. </p>
               <p> It would be tempting, at this point, to suggest that Schlegel revises the catastrophic unity that characterizes Fichte’s spirit by
          dividing his text among many participants, themselves divided, including “<emph>me.</emph>” After all, it is after his opening presentation
          of a universal religion of poetic affiliation—”Poetry binds and befriends all minds that love her with insoluble bonds” (2: 284), and after
          his affirmation of a poetry proper to each—that Schlegel articulates the necessity of exceeding one’s own proper view of poetry by imparting
          it with others. This becomes, in turn, the immediate occasion for him to write in the first-person, for the first time—”For me it had always
          been very exciting to speak with poets and poetically minded people about poetry” (2: 286)—only to go further and reproduce the many other
          voices which will compose the <emph>Conversation</emph>, which is, in turn, only one among “many such conversations,” and thus itself
          partial (2: 286). But insofar as each cannot be one, if he is to be at all, Schlegel cannot but present a plurality of alter egos, who
          dissemble more than resemble the members of the Romantic circle with whom they are so often identified, and thus elude any historiographical
          or biographical determination.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Many others have linked the <emph>Gespräch</emph> to the union of the
            Romantics in 1799, including Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy (273–74), who base their brief discussion of this historical coincidence upon
            Ayrault’s four-volume study of the genesis of Romanticism. </note> The text he introduces, for those who wish “to initiate themselves into
          the holy mysteries of nature and poetry by force of their inner fullness of life” (2: 286–87), is no temple of spirit, nor a demand for the
          sacrificial dedication of artist and reader, but a party of ghostly lovers of the word, or an orgy of spirits, “who occupy themselves freely
          and gladly with their predeliction [<emph>Liebhaberei</emph>]” (2: 287)—and who may never have been. </p>
               <p>Equally uncertain is the time of the conversation itself, where, suspended between “fantasy” and “remembrance,” “much is real, and other
          parts, invented” (2: 286), and where nothing that is said to have happened can be plotted along the lines of a sequence or encompassed in a
          model of cyclical repetitions. In his introduction to the <emph>Conversation</emph> proper, in which he records the conditions surrounding
          its occurrence, Schlegel evokes and disrupts both of these alternatives in terms that echo the determination of the single moment of
          inspired speech, so crucial to Fichte’s letters as to Schlegel’s own <emph>Ideen</emph>. The conversation begins as the interruption of
          “many other similar ones” (2: 286), which had hitherto taken place “without appointed time or law [<emph>ohne Verabredung oder
          Gesetz</emph>]” (2: 287). These continue even now, with a dispute between Amalia and Camilla on the appointed day, in the absence of two
          latecomers—until, that is, “two of the expected friends, whom we will call Marcus and Antonio, entered the society with loud laughter” (2:
          287). Beginning with this interruption, which will inaugurate <emph>the</emph> conversation, Schlegel will return to it only after
          recounting the circumstances that preceded it, which include the decree—during a previous, similar conversation—that it should no longer be
          a conversation at all, but the reading of speeches that individuals of this group are to write, to be delivered on a particular date: “the
          interest grew with the work and the preparations for it; the women made themselves a festival [<emph>Fest</emph>] out of it, and finally a
          date was fixed [<emph>festgesetzt</emph>] on which each should read what he would bring” (2: 287). </p>
               <p>Already here, Schlegel suggests that the singular and commemorative date, the “<emph>Fest</emph>” that would differ from other days, is not
          one, but aligned with the many “preparations” of the women. Meanwhile, they prepare indefinitely, before “finally” a day is “fixed,” whereby
          Schlegel’s formulation here still defers <emph>the </emph>day, marking only the entrance of “an appointed time or law” into this society.
          Or, to put it differently, the “festival [<emph>Fest</emph>]” melds with “law [<emph>Gesetz</emph>]” in the “fixed
          [<emph>festgesetzt</emph>]” date, but only insofar as each amounts, together, to the promise of a day that will not have yet arrived.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The suspension of both <emph>Fest </emph>and <emph>Gesetz</emph> in this passage is reinforced by the way in
            which the two clauses, “the women made themselves a festival out of it [<emph>die Frauen machten sich ein Fest daraus</emph>]” and “and
            finally a date was fixed [<emph>es wurde endlich ein Tag festgesetzt</emph>]” form two iambic pentameter cola in which <emph>Fest</emph>
            and <emph>fest</emph> appear in the same metrical positions. Such parallelism in Schlegel’s rhetoric implies a formal structure of
            repetition that turns the singularity of the festival and the establishment of law—the law, that is, of the appointed day—into periodic
            occurences, literally.</note> And, in fact, this day is never narrated explicitly, as the “circumstances” that precede it give way
          seamlessly to the dispute between Camilla and Amalia on the appointed day, to be interrupted, first by the arrival of the last two guests
          and then, finally, by the first speech. But then, as the date, law, and letter should coincide in a new event—”so that something new would
          happen, a change from [their] eternal reading”—the change that is thereby heralded is nothing other than an exchange of more texts, variant
          readings (2: 287). </p>
               <p>This text of these texts, of the <emph>Conversation, </emph>can thus only be a narrative, alternating between the preterite and the
          subjunctive, of what had happened, if there were no guarantee of a date, nor the beginning, middle, and end of an event. That is, it can
          only be a narrative that is governed by no law of succession or repetition. This is also why, by the time Marcus and Antonio interrupt for
          the second time in Schlegel’s account, Antonio can have already arrived and participated in Amalia and Camilla’s debate on the
          theater—”‘grant us our way of doing things,’ said Antonio, as he ostensibly took the side of Camilla, ‘when for once, through a happy
          coincidence, a spark of life, of joy and spirit, develops in the common mass’” (2: 288). Thus it is no coincidence that, when “the entering
          friends” enter the conversation next, only the second of them, Marcus, will be named (2: 289). In the blink of an eye, what was written can
          alter, and if it can alter, it can alter endlessly—which is why, even in the passage that seals the agreement among these lovers of words to
          read their writings on poetry, the privileged conjunction is the disjunctive “or”: “each, or [...] whoever has the most desire to do so,
          should for once utter his thoughts on poetry, or on a part [...] of it, or rather write it out, so that one has it in black and white” (2:
          287). When, next, Camilla ”most animatedly agreed with her friend,” there is no way to tell what is thereby accorded in this bare
          affirmiation of φιλία. No choice could be definitively determined as true or false, as a decision or as a counterfactual conditional. No,
          nothing could have been promised or fulfilled here, since teleological or cyclical completion—including a complete assumption into the unity
          of spirit—would have been a fatal end: “absolute achievement is only in death” (2: 286). Rather, the law that is agreed upon is lawless.
            <emph>With</emph> every announcement, <emph>with</emph> every affirmation—and their possible repetitions—there is a congenital
          alternative—neither “<emph>Yes</emph>” nor “<emph>No</emph>”—that frees what is bound in and by these letters from the assumption of a
          unified spirit, reason, or poetry, as well as from the fatal logic of exchange, accumulation, or promissory seals that govern Paul’s and
          Fichte’s letters on spirit.—</p>
               <p>But, perhaps, the most precise analysis of philology as well as history—its end or “purpose,” as Schlegel had written elsewhere (16:
          37)—took place at the opening of the first lecture, on the “Epochs of Poetry,” where spirit and letter return once again in Andrea’s account
          of ancient and modern, old and new poetic art. Andrea—who is, perhaps, a variant of the Other, the “<emph>Andere,</emph>” in
            person<emph>—</emph>begins: “Where any living spirit whatsoever appears bound in well-formed letters, there is art, there is separation,
          material to overcome, tools to use, a draft and laws of treatment. Therefore we see the masters of poetry strive most powerfully to form
          themselves in the most multifaceted way” (2: 290). He thus begins what would be a lecture on classical poetry, with the distinction that
          defines progressive or sacral philology, the binary pair, “<emph>Geist und Buchstabe.</emph>” And if this may seem to invert the epochal
          order that otherwise plays a crucial role in the philologies of the brothers Schlegel, as well as Winckelmann—to whom Andrea explicitly and
          implicitly refers throughout his speech—it will not be the first or last time, nor will the operations of his philology remain restricted to
          inversion. </p>
               <p>As for the letter, the sequence of “living spirit [<emph>lebendiger Geist</emph>]” and “well-formed letter [<emph>gebildeten
            Buchstaben</emph>]” in Andrea’s opening sentence involves a series of inversions that liquidate the distinction between the two, as well
          as each term itself. With the exceptions of two letters, <emph>r </emph>and <emph>t</emph>, “<emph>lebendiger</emph>” and
            “<emph>gebildeten</emph>” are anagrams of each other, with the opposite sequence of vowels; rhythmically, they share the same shape (– ' –
          –), and besides, within the writings of Schlegel, what is living and what is formed should be two inseparable aspects of the same.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, Schlegel writes in his <emph>Ideen</emph>, “There should be absolutely no common standpoint, no
            natural way of thinking only in opposition to law and formation, no mere life [<emph>Einen gemeinsamen Standpunkt, eine nur im Gegensatz
              der Kunst und Bildung natürliche Denkart, ein bloßes Leben soll es gar nicht geben</emph>]” (2: 261). He also binds the two terms in the
            prologue to the <emph>Conversation</emph>, writing “Immeasurable and inexhaustible is the world of poetry, like the richness of enliving
            nature in plants, animals, and formations of every kind, shape, and color [<emph>Unermeßlich und unerschöpflich ist die Welt der Poesie
              wie der Reichtum der belebenden Natur an Gewächsen, Tieren und Bildungen jeglicher Art, Gestalt und Farbe</emph>]” (2: 285).</note>
          Between their prosodic and alphabetical arrangements, as well as their semantic similarities, the adjectives that should distinguish spirit
          and letter alike, blend. And at the same time, each also becomes divided and distinct from itself, so that one cannot tell, precisely, what
          is bound here—whereby the adjective “bound [<emph>gebunden</emph>]” echoes the “well-formed letter [<emph>
                     <hi rend="bold underline">ge</hi>
                  </emph>
                  <emph>-bildeten</emph>
                  <emph>
                     <hi rend="bold underline">Bu</hi>
                  </emph>
                  <emph>-chstab-</emph>
                  <emph>
                     <hi rend="bold underline">en</hi>
                  </emph>],” too, unbinding and
          recombining the elements of these terms as well, and turning them into something other than they were. In other words, synthesis and
          analysis coincide here, forming and dissolving at once what should have been the topic of discussion. The beginning of the “Epochs of
          Poetry” is, in short, incessantly splitting and turning from itself, as well as any commonplaces of philological or philosophical
          inquiry—like spirit and letter.</p>
               <p>Still more importantly, beyond any such inversion and before any history is given, the topic of his speech, albeit liquidated, should be an
          inspired letter that “appears [<emph>erscheint</emph>]” in the absence of any artist or agency. And there, where it appears, because it
          simply appears, it would be, at least at first, a radically indefinite phantom, absolved from any particular relations that might determine
          its time or genesis. The historical inquiry that Andrea will draw from this utterly unaccountable moment—which vanishes in the blink of an
          eye, so that “art” and “separation” can follow “there,” in its place—is thus utterly contingent upon a moment that, for itself, can be
          attributed to no source or end, and that is thus before its proper history and future. Only “<emph>around</emph>” this
            “<emph>there</emph>”—”<emph>darum</emph>”—do we “see the masters of poetry strive most powerfully to form themselves in the most
          multifaceted way,” as though nothing were there yet, no art, but rather the separate stages and elements of its production: “material to
          overcome, tools to use, a draft and laws of treatment.” </p>
               <p>Where there is poetic art, there is separation, and where there is separation, one might add that there is an infinite distance to any
          artwork. Instead, a series of infinitives, designating the sheer work of overcoming, using, and executing, postpones <emph>the</emph> work
          precisely through its prescription. Meanwhile, what we “see [<emph>sehn</emph>]” when the artwork is not yet or no longer “there,” and
          therefore infinitely distant from any moment or locus we could point out, becomes, at least for lovers, a “longing
          [<emph>Sehn-sucht</emph>]”—for its history: "where she [art] not yet was, there she should come to be, and if she was, she surely arouses in
          those who truly love her a strong longing [<emph>Sehnsucht</emph>] to know her, to understand the intention of the master, to grasp the
          nature of the work, to experience the origin of the school, the course of her formation. Art rests upon knowing, and the knowledge of art is
          her history” (2: 290). But because art should rest upon the knowing that <emph>is </emph>its history, its history would have to be
          restlessly in advance of art itself—or art would have to be predicated upon a history that cannot yet have happened, but that its lovers, in
          its absence, strongly desire to see and to know. At the same time, its past and future <emph>are</emph> articulated in terms of an ethical
          exhortation (“should”) and an erotic excitation (“arouse”), so that the only difference between past and future appears to be the difference
          these two verbs demarcate, and the present is nothing other than the scission, or sexus, of these two modes of desire.— </p>
               <p>Each such historical intersection might be read as an inclination or <emph>philia</emph>—towards nothing we might have or accumulate,
          promise or provide, at the limits of spirit and letter—and this might also have been the end or purpose of Friedrich Schlegel’s philology.
          History, of art as of ethics or sex, may be nothing other than the scansion of imperatives and seductions, and thus oriented towards what
          can never have been, what we could not even will or want, were we truly lovers.—</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay explores post-Kantian challenges to the Aristotelian proposition and the rationalist model of proof. The first part focuses on Friedrich Schlegel’s efforts to develop a discourse that could reconcile the demand to speak freely with the demand to speak the truth. The second part shows how Edgar Allan Poe and Stéphane Mallarmé continue Schlegel’s project as they grapple with Romantic ideas about wit and the autonomy of poetic language.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>In a deceptively simple pronouncement that succinctly encapsulates the Enlightenment understanding of language, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac
          declares: “every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas. It seems that one ought to begin by composing
          this language, but people begin by speaking and writing and the language remains to be composed” (<emph>Le commerce et le gouvernement,
          </emph>qtd. in Braudel 234). Although Condillac does not pursue the ramifications of these remarks, they bear further consideration. If a
          science is to be a process of genuine investigation and discovery rather than the presentation of predetermined results articulated within
          existing paradigms—if it is to speak a “special language” of true inquiry rather than rehearsing the rhetorical gestures of established
          systems—it must call for a discourse that is at present no more than a hypothesis. Whether or not such a language can or will become a
          reality may be irrelevant, since the scientific enterprise will never be patient enough to wait and see if its demand for a new discursive
          field will be met. Far from fashioning its own tongue, a science contents itself with surrogates, and the anticipated language—the language
          by virtue of which a scientific project would become the singular inquiry that it aspires to be—remains unrealized. Even hazier is the fate
          of each science’s “own ideas.” Their specificity may be preserved as they are articulated in whatever dialect can be cobbled together, or
          their uniqueness may remain a fantasy, as chimerical as the “special language” that is never seen to fruition. </p>
               <p> In this essay, I argue that Friedrich Schlegel’s theory of language emerges within the economy of surrogate tongues that Condillac
          describes. As is well known, Schlegel finds in Kant the inspiration for an account of poetry as an unconditionally autonomous discourse.
          What is less often observed is that Schlegel, like his contemporary Hegel, works to unsettle the hegemony of the Aristotelian proposition
            (<emph>logos apophantikos</emph>), a sentence—a coordination of subject and predicate—that bears a truth or falsehood. From Descartes and
          Leibniz to Locke and Hume, the practice of philosophy is the evaluation of such statements. Without some reliance on this basic discursive
          form, the rigorous investigation of our opinions and beliefs would be impossible. In Kant, this state of affairs begins to change. With the
          antinomies, the categorical imperative, and his theory of taste, the preeminence of the proposition is severely tested; in many respects,
          doing philosophy for Kant means trying to unsettle the proposition’s authority. Nevertheless, his understanding of judgment remains at its
          core a conventional logical model in which the predicate of a subject is affirmed or denied.</p>
               <p> Hegel goes further, explicitly rejecting traditional propositional thinking in which the subject is a stable element to which various
          predicates can be added or subtracted in order to fashion statements of truth or falsity. In his doctrine of the “speculative sentence,” it
          is not simply that the distinction between subject and predicate is erased or that they are melded together into some “higher” unity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See in particular §58–§66 of Hegel’s <emph>Phenomenology of Spirit</emph>.</note> Conceptualized
          dialectically, subject and predicate are no longer independent terms to be coordinated or distinguished. Instead, they are constitutively
          transitional elements in an expressive dynamic in which the subject loses and recovers itself in the predicate, but this happens in such a
          way as to reveal that the substance of what is being articulated is precisely a movement of interruptions, reversals, and repetitions more
          than the identity of any specific figure or relationship. In Kantian terms, it is as if synthetic and analytic judgments were taking place
          simultaneously. </p>
               <p>To analyze a speculative sentence is not to follow a linear trajectory from start to finish. The path is alternately a circle, an
          oscillation forward and backward, and a series of nearly discontinuous starts and stops. Throughout, the constitutive incompleteness and
          instability of any given sentence is glaringly on display. No individual formulation can be entirely self-determining, establish itself as
          the definitive iteration of a series, or have the final word. To the extent that the transitional elements of a speculative sentence do
          harmonize with one another, any equilibrium is short-lived, and the distinction between subject and predicate reasserts itself in a new
          statement whose substance is incompatible with the previous one. For Hegel, a sentence is understood “speculatively” precisely insofar as we
          recognize that it is one of many sentences, or if you like, there are speculative sentence<emph>s</emph>, but there is no speculative
          sentence.</p>
               <p> Although Schlegel may appear to go in the opposite direction with his account of an unconditionally autonomous utterance, I intend to show
          that he shares Hegel’s skepticism about the stability of the sentential form. To begin, I will describe Schlegel’s reconceptualization of
          the traditional proposition, focusing on his notions of wit and linguistic arbitrariness (<emph>Willkür</emph>). I will then turn to the
          work of Edgar Allan Poe and Stéphane Mallarmé, two authors who reflected extensively on the Romantic legacy and its implications for the
          theory of language. Their texts give us a glimpse of a discourse of Schlegelian perversion in which one may “begin,” as Condillac put it,
          “by speaking and writing” only insofar as the most basic syntactic and grammatical forms have become foreign and unpredictable. </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>*</head>
                  <p>What does it mean for an argument to be invested in its “own” terms rather than in words it has borrowed, as Condillac would have it, from
          somewhere else? In the course of questioning the hegemony of the proposition, Schlegel challenges the authority of established philosophical
          terminology, as well. Playing with the vocabularies of his predecessors, he repeatedly casts doubt on the internal consistency and
          completeness of the nomenclatural schemes from which they emerge. This considerably complicates the discussion, as Schlegel’s texts often
          seem to lurch back and forth between arguments about words and arguments about syntax and predication, without making it clear whether these
          analyses are mutually illuminating or incompatible. Schlegel does not simply present words as the “building blocks” of propositions or the
          parts that make up a whole. At the same time, his critiques of terminological and propositional thinking do appear to be intimately
          interrelated. </p>
                  <p>At the beginning of <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 238, Schlegel writes, “There is a kind of poetry whose essence lies in the relation
          between ideal and real, and which therefore, by analogy to philosophical jargon [<emph>Kunstsprache</emph>], should be called transcendental
          poetry” (<emph>Fragments</emph> 50).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The fragment in its entirety: <quote>There is a kind of poetry whose
              essence lies in the relation between ideal and real, and which therefore, by analogy to philosophical jargon, should be called
              transcendental poetry. It begins as satire in the absolute difference of ideal and real, hovers in between as elegy, and ends as idyll
              with the absolute identity of the two. But just as we wouldn’t think much of an uncritical transcendental philosophy that doesn’t
              represent the producer along with the product and contain at the same time within the system of transcendental thoughts a description of
              transcendental thinking: so too this sort of poetry should unite the transcendental raw materials and preliminaries of a theory of
              poetic creativity—often met with in modern poets—with the artistic reflection and beautiful self-mirroring that is present in Pindar, in
              the lyric fragments of the Greeks, in the classical elegy, and, among the moderns, in Goethe. In all its descriptions, this poetry
              should describe itself, and always be simultaneously poetry and the poetry of poetry. (<emph>Fragments</emph> 50-1) </quote>

              als Elegie in der Mitte, und endigt als Idylle mit der absoluten Identität beider. So wie man aber wenig Wert auf eine

          which the demand for verbal exactitude and the aim of finding precisely the right word for what one wants to say shade into confusion or
          obscurity. A term that proves to be singular in its reference or signification risks losing its claim to semantic generality, and hence its
          very status as a word, becoming either an impenetrable cipher or a transparent token devoid of any meaning beyond its mechanical application
          in a particular context. The fantasy of fashioning a language that is definitively one’s own or of appropriating someone else’s vocabulary
          for one’s own ends turns out to be as much a matter of limiting or destroying meaning as of creating it.</p>
                  <p>In <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 238, philosophy’s jargon at first appears to assist Schlegel in devising his own jargon of
          “transcendental poetry.” As the fragment goes on, however, it moves from enumerating the common traits of poetry and philosophy to asserting
          that transcendental poetry must live up to its new name. In effect, the analogy becomes “aspirational,” that is, a variety of inferences are
          drawn about what this poetry must be like based on the fact that it now carries this new label. As much authority as has been conferred upon
          the transcendental, it is analogy itself that seems to be the real force here, albeit an analogy in which the alignment of terms generates
          correspondences between them rather than the other way around. </p>
                  <p>The violence of precisely this form of argument is a central concern in <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 82, whose first half reads,
        <quote>The demonstrations of philosophy are precisely demonstrations in the sense of military jargon. The deductions are no better than political
          ones; even in the sciences [<emph>Wissenschaften</emph>] one first occupies a terrain and only proves his right to it after the fact. To its

          explanations that obscure everything. Correct definitions cannot be improvisational but have to come of their own accord; a definition that
          isn’t witty is worthless, and there are an infinite number of real definitions for every individual. (<emph>Fragments</emph> 27-8;

              virtuosity, these latter qualities have their purpose and value, like the bravura arias of singers and the Latin prose of philologists.
              Also they make a considerable rhetorical impression. But the main point is that one knows something and that one says it. To want to
              prove or even explain it is in most cases wholly unnecessary. The categorical style of the laws of the twelve tablets and the thetical
              method, where we find set down the pure facts of reflection without concealment, adulteration, or artificial distortion, like texts for
              the study of symphilosophy, are still the most appropriate for a studied natural philosophy. In a case where one has both to propose and
              prove something, it’s indisputably more difficult to propose than to prove. There are lots of formally splendid proofs for perverse and
              platitudinous propositions. Leibniz proposed and Wolff proved. Need one say more? [<emph>Das ist genug gesagt</emph>.]

              die man so in der Welt hat. Es gibt drei Arten von Erklärungen in der Wissenschaft: Erklärungen, die uns ein Licht oder einen Wink
              geben; Erklärungen, die nichts erklären; und Erklärungen, die alles verdunkeln. Die rechten Definitionen lassen sich gar nicht aus dem

        Schlegel characterizes philosophy’s demonstrations as displays of power, or as he writes in another fragment, “According to the way many
          philosophers think, a regiment of soldiers <emph>en Parade</emph> is a system” (23). In contrast to the transcendental poetry of fragment
          238, which was expected to live up to its new name, philosophy’s deductions never measure up to their billing as systematic processes of
          reasoning that move smoothly from general premises to valid conclusions. Instead, a philosophical argument begins with the adoption of a
          position that is retrospectively understood to be the result of a series of steps that emerge after the conclusion that they “produce.”
          Possession is 10/10ths of the lawfulness of this <emph>ex post facto</emph> law. </p>
                  <p>Introduced in the first sentence of <emph>Athenaeum</emph> 82, the fluidity of the phrase “in the sense of” potentially infects every word
          in the fragment, and it is difficult to ascertain what is being modeled with reference to what. The concepts under
          consideration—demonstration, deduction, definition—all begin with the letter <emph>d</emph>, as if Schlegel had opened his dictionary of
          philosophical terms to a random page and begun filling in the blanks, later turning the page to <emph>e</emph> and “explanation” when the
          reservoir of words beginning with <emph>d</emph> had been exhausted. Of course, these words happen to be some of the key concepts in the
          thought of Leibniz, who is celebrated in the fragment’s final lines as the “real” philosopher.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Given what
            Schlegel argues about the military fiat that undergirds philosophical operations, it is not obvious whether his reflections on these terms
            will prove more substantial if the words are pulled arbitrarily from the dictionary or invoked in a scholarly flourish as part of the core
            legacy of his rationalist predecessor. As the fragment continues, it neither steers clear of jargon nor takes care to define its own
            terms, particularly when it comes to the string of near-but-not-so-near synonyms for <emph>Philosophie</emph> or
            <emph>Wissenschaft</emph>, including <emph>Kunstphilosophie</emph>, <emph>Symphilosophie</emph>, and <emph>Naturphilosophie</emph>.</note>
          For Leibniz, “demonstration” names the foundational philosophical operation by which one attempts to determine a proposition’s status as
          true or false. Epitomizing the procedure that Schlegel’s fragment debunks, such an evaluation considers the inferences or deductions a
          statement generates, assisted by definitions, postulates, and theorems that have already been proven. With what Leibniz calls a necessary
          proposition or “truth of reason,” the assessment of a statement will, in a finite number of steps, arrive at an identity or equivalence such
          as <emph>A is A</emph> or <emph>2 + 2 = 4</emph>, thereby confirming the statement’s validity; or else it will produce an outright
          contradiction, revealing the statement to be false. By contrast, with a contingent proposition or “truth of fact” in which what is at issue
          is a statement about the “infinitely complex individual concepts of contingently existing individuals,” the claim being considered may well
          be true, but “we can never demonstrate this, nor can the proposition ever be reduced to an equation or identity, [for] the analysis proceeds
          to infinity, only God being able to see, not the end of the analysis indeed, since there is no end, but the nexus of terms” (<emph>Logical
          </emph>97). Here a conclusion exists only as a phantasmagoric endpoint, a limit to be approached, such that even an infinite number of
          inferences leave us an infinite number of steps away from a definite result.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Schlegel’s engagement with
            Leibniz’s doctrines is heavily influenced by Kant. Considerations of regressive series abound in the <emph>Critique of Pure Reason</emph>,
            where Kant at one point attempts to distinguish <emph>regressus in infinitum</emph> from <emph>regressus in indefinitum</emph>
            (A514/B542). Kant specifically addresses the infinite analysis of the infinite complexity of individual contingencies with his claims
            about the regulative rather than constitutive nature of the ideas of reason. He argues that a constitutive idea would be akin to Leibniz’s
            divine comprehension and that to have access to “the absolute totality of the series of conditions,” one must mistakenly attribute
            objective reality to an idea that is actually only a rule (A509/B537).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the distinction between necessary and contingent propositions proves less stable than Leibniz implies, truths of reason may periodically
          give rise to demonstrations that flounder in a “nexus of terms” rather than crystallizing into expressions of equivalence or contradiction.
          This may not be a terribly destabilizing prospect, for in such cases the discourse will still be grounded in its core definitions, which
          ought to be exempt from the demonstrations required of propositions. “By definition,” a definition should be a reliably bounded utterance, a
          sentence or proto-sentence that begins where a demonstration of a truth of reason leaves off, with the affirmation of an identity or
          equivalence. Schlegel’s concern is that any definition is potentially under suspicion of being an arbitrary alignment of terms disguised as
          a proposition. On this account, a definition would be a military demonstration that makes no effort to dissimulate its martial character—the
          first step is the last, and vice versa. This is close to Hume’s critique of rationalist thought, which maintains that the very distinction
          between definitions and propositions is a fiction, since the latter are analytic in nature and thus constitute covert instantiations of the
            former.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See in particular Section IV of Hume’s <emph>An Enquiry Concerning Human
            Understanding</emph>.</note> This would mean, as Hegel might have it, that no proposition is ever as propositional as it proposes itself
          to be. </p>
                  <p>In exploring these questions, Schlegel makes no attempt to define definition; in another nod to military jargon, he instead “deploys” a
          quip from the eighteenth-century aphorist Nicolas Chamfort in order to set out the various types of definitions, explaining the genus by
          enumerating its species: “To [philosophy’s] definitions one could apply what Chamfort says in remarking upon the sort of friends one has in
          worldly life. There are three kinds of explanations in science: explanations that give us an illumination or an inkling of something;
          explanations that explain nothing; and explanations that obscure everything” (<emph>Fragments 27</emph>). Echoing the analogy to
          philosophical jargon in the opening line of <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 238, this is an argument by analogy—or rather, by homology: one
          trio is supposed to elucidate the features of another. Still, the parallels feel tenuous. In “The Cynic’s Breviary,” Chamfort proposes that
          friends can either love, ignore, or detest us. Although one could certainly make a case for how these three kinds of friendship could be
          aligned with Schlegel’s three types of explanation, this looks more like a mock comparison than a substantive demonstration; and the fact
          that Schlegel never explicitly spells out Chamfort’s claims adds to the artificiality of the set-up. </p>
                  <p>As it turns out, any skepticism we may muster proves irrelevant, for we have to make the alignment work if we want to follow Schlegel’s
          “demonstration.” In a perfect example of the military operation described at the fragment’s outset, we have no choice but to act as if the
          comparison between types of friends and types of definitions were illuminating. The juxtaposition of elements comes first, and we fill in
          the connections afterward, as if the substance of the links had been the driving force behind the coordination of the elements in the first
          place. If in <emph>Athenaeum</emph> 238 we have to play along with the name that Schlegel bestows on a particular type of poetry, here in
            <emph>Athenaeum</emph> 82 we have to play along with the form of analogy itself. </p>
                  <p>The significance of these claims for propositions about contingent individuals becomes clearer as Schlegel’s fragment introduces more
          Leibnizian terminology: “Correct definitions cannot be improvisational but have to come of themselves; a definition that isn’t witty is
          worthless, and there are an infinite number of real definitions for every individual” (<emph>Fragments </emph>27–8). What Leibniz calls
          “nominal definitions” are based on clear and distinct knowledge of something and may even enumerate enough defining traits to distinguish
          that thing from everything else, but they do not confirm the possibility of their object <emph>a priori</emph>. In contrast, what Leibniz
          terms “real definitions” do substantiate the possibility of their object <emph>a priori</emph> because they go beyond an explanation of its
          core structure and show that it does not rest on any contradiction between concepts or axioms.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Real
            definitions may also explain how to produce what they define; Leibniz’s preferred example is Euclid’s definition of a circle. See Leibniz,
              <emph>Philosophical Essays</emph>, 23-27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Schlegel’s claim that there are an infinite number of real definitions of an individual may appear to be consistent with Leibniz’s claim
          that contingently existing individuals are infinitely complex.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Leibniz writes, “Only someone who is
            capable of grasping the infinite could know the principle of individuation of a given thing. This arises from the influence, properly
            understood, that all the things in the universe have on one another” (<emph>New Essays</emph> 290).</note> Each of the infinitely many
          definitions of an individual that Schlegel envisions, however, is nominal, not real, because in isolation each definition only confirms the
          possibility of its object <emph>a posteriori</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> At points, Leibniz allows that some real definitions
            confirm the possibility of something <emph>a posteriori</emph> rather than <emph>a priori</emph>, a qualification that in its own right
            potentially threatens his real/nominal distinction.</note> To the question of how one might sum this infinite series of determinations and
          thus move from the nominal to the real, Schlegel’s answer is wit: “a definition that isn’t witty is worthless.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century letters, wit designated a kind of cunning or cleverness distinguished by the
            ability to make surprising connections or unexpectedly illuminating associations. For Schlegel, it also has a lighter side. “Reason
            suffers,” he writes, but wit is “free” and “thoroughly playful” (<emph>Kritische Ausgabe</emph> XII: 393, my translation). Of course,
            wit’s characteristic flash of insight—what Schlegel describes as a “lightning bolt from the unconscious world”—is also frightening, for it
            is not so much a question of deciding whether or not to make use of wit as of surrendering to its designs, which may not be our own (393,
            my translation). As August Wilhelm Schlegel maintains in <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 106: “You must consider that man wittiest who is
            witty not merely without intending to be so, but actually against his own intention” (<emph>Fragments </emph>30).</note> For Schlegel, the
          key feature of a witticism is that it is “completely unconnected with what came before it,” but despite this fact, it somehow invariably
          stands “in glaring contradiction” to what preceded it (<emph>Kritische Ausgabe</emph> XII: 393, my translation). A flash of wit is entirely
          unexpected—it cannot be anticipated or shown to follow logically from what has already been said—but, as if by serendipity, it consistently
          negates what it follows. Independent of what has taken place and yet utterly at odds with it, wit’s manifestation is impossible.
          Nonetheless, it is in and through this impossible non-relation of disconnection that wit does bring things together, creating connections on
          the basis of disjunctions at the same time as it breaks connections that did not previously exist. As Schlegel writes in
            <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 37: “Many witty ideas are like the sudden meeting of two friendly thoughts after a long separation”
            (<emph>Fragments </emph>23). Wit reveals resemblances—for instance, between transcendental philosophy and poetry—only insofar as it
          threatens to undermine one or both of the fields it coordinates, challenging the capacity of each to account for the nature of its
          correspondences with the other. Witty definitions, in turn, facilitate determinations of individuals that respect their infinite complexity
          yet delimit them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Leibniz, a real definition demonstrates the possibility of something; for Schlegel,
            a real definition of the individual shows that the possibility of defining that individual is also the impossibility of defining it
            insofar as such a definition would have to be a finite proposition. Each of the infinitely many real definitions of the individual is both
            infinitely complete and infinitely incomplete—or rather, each of the infinitely many real definitions of an individual is witty in that it
            is absolutely unrelated to any of the other real definitions of that individual and nonetheless potentially contradicts their claims to
            define. </note> These definitions alter what is being defined in the course of defining it, in the process potentially changing the very
          definition of definition as well. </p>
                  <p>However witty a philosophical demonstration may be, it is always at risk of degenerating into formulaic patterns that remain rhetorically
          powerful but predictable, or worse, become mere “etiquette.” Whereas Condillac cautions that we are unlikely to outfit our new ideas with a
          new language, Schlegel warns that the more convincing our proofs become, the more mechanical—and unremarkable—they will seem. This leads him
          to the bold conclusion of <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 82: 
        <quote>The main point is that one knows something and that one says it. To want to prove or even explain it is in most cases wholly unnecessary.
          The categorical style of the laws of the twelve tablets and the thetical method, where we find set down the pure facts of reflection without
          concealment, adulteration, or artificial distortion, like texts for the study of symphilosophy, are still the most appropriate for a studied
          natural philosophy. In a case where one has both to propose and prove something, it’s indisputably more difficult to propose than to prove.
          There are lots of formally splendid proofs for perverse and platitudinous propositions. Leibniz proposed and Wolff proved. Need one say
          more? [<emph>Das ist genug gesagt</emph>.] (<emph>Fragments</emph> 28)</quote>
        Propositions that call out for the proofs required to validate or refute them betray their own incompleteness. Taking his cue from Kant’s
          categorical imperative and Fichte’s thetic judgment, Schlegel enjoins us to state what we know without any trace of a desire to explain,
          much less to prove, what we are saying—indeed with no concern for being understood at all. This is an utterance that makes no demands; it
          asks for nothing, expects nothing, and is in no way reliant on the anticipation, much less the fact, of a response. Only such a proposition,
          possibly an impossible proposition, says something rather than implicitly or explicitly laying the groundwork for something that will be
          articulated in a final form in a future statement. Only such a proposition makes a claim that belongs to it alone rather than being the
          premise or instigation for remarks to follow. </p>
                  <p>Such an utterance must be witty. As Schlegel writes in another fragment, wit “is like someone who should perform his social duties
          according to the rules, but instead simply <emph>does </emph>something” (<emph>Fragments </emph>33). Witticisms propose without confirming
          their capacity to do so, which is why they never become models for future speech acts, even witty ones. They posit “the facts of reflection”
          without becoming implicated in reflexive gestures that might facilitate inferences about what they have proven or what needs to be
          demonstrated in their wake. Witticisms are the paradigm of an autonomous claim, yet for this very reason they remain a-paradigmatic. If the
          rationalist ideal—or fantasy—of precise, transparent communication envisions absolutely stable terms whose content is at once fixed and
          self-explanatory, witticisms are both anti-demonstrative and anti-definitional. Their significance lies solely in what they do—in the
          impossible connections they make and the non-existent connections they break. </p>
                  <p> Read with the sentence that precedes it—“Leibniz proposed and Wolff proved”—the final sentence of <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 82, “Das
          ist genug gesagt,” can be translated as “Enough said,” or more archly as “Need I say more?”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This
            expression may sound slightly odd to the contemporary German ear. It is certainly less familiar than <emph>Es ist genug gesagt
              worden</emph> or <emph>Es ist alles gesagt</emph>.</note> “Das ist genug gesagt” is, however, more than just a coda to the punchline it
          follows. Schlegel maintains that if a proposition is to be autonomous, it cannot depend on any supplemental clarification, explanation, or
          proof. In this sense, “enough said” is the implicit conclusion of all truly unconditioned, unqualified utterances that actually say
            <emph>something</emph> rather than prepare us for what will or must subsequently be said. Of course, in being articulated at the end of a
          fragment that maintains that “enough said” is the message of any genuinely substantive pronouncement, this particular instance of “enough
          said” threatens to undermine the argument it purports to conclude. Its appearance compromises the completeness of what has come before by
          suggesting that “enough said” was not implied loudly or clearly enough. The attempt to clarify that enough <emph>is</emph> enough undoes the
          tautological certainty of the idiom at the very moment that <emph>enough is enough</emph> is identified as the basic statement of identity
          underwriting any verbal assertion. No pronouncement about <emph>enough</emph> can ever suffice to bring a witty demonstration to a close.
          “Enough said” will always be both a truth of reason, a truth about the very nature of speech, masquerading as a truth of fact, and a truth
          of fact, a truth about a contingent utterance and a contingent discourse, masquerading as a truth of reason.</p>
                  <p> “The main point is that one knows something and that one says it.” Is the distinction between knowing and saying sustainable, or is the
          very need to express oneself, to say what one knows, itself restrictive, amounting to an acknowledgement, however minimal, that what is
          being said is dependent on at least the possibility of a supplementary explanation or proof that would validate it? In another fragment,
          Schlegel describes a truly unconstrained discourse that unfolds such that a commitment to continue is never in force. He writes, “Even a
          friendly conversation that cannot freely break off at any moment, completely arbitrarily [<emph>aus unbedingter Willkür</emph>], has
          something illiberal about it” (<emph>Fragments</emph> 5). This is a call for a language that would be entirely indifferent to the need to
          continue with, much less complete, any given utterance. No longer simply the punctuation at the end of every pronouncement, “enough said”
          should inform every word or phrase before it is articulated, meaning, paradoxically, that silence itself may signify that enough has been
          said. </p>
                  <p>Insofar as each and every verbal element is to be distinguished by the fact that it need never have been expressed because the speaker
          might have broken off at the previous moment, no utterance can constitute a promise that there is more to come. No instance of a truly free
          language submits itself to a regulation that would require that it be followed by more language. Syntax and grammar, the norms of narrative,
          or the logic of philosophical demonstrations—none of these paradigms will necessarily be violated or compromised, but they are all
          subordinated to the possibility that the discourse may stop at any point for reasons that have nothing to do with grammatical, narrative, or
          logical dictates. </p>
                  <p>Informed neither by an internal nor an external compulsion on the basis of which its appearance might be legitimated, this is a language of
          pure choice (<emph>Willkür</emph>), pure arbitrariness (<emph>Willkür</emph>).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In Kant,
              <emph>Willkür</emph> names the ability to make choices that are yours and yours alone, a radical caprice, if you like, that is entirely
            free of exogenous pressures. According to the <emph>Grimm</emph>, the original meaning of <emph>Willkür</emph> was “freie Wahl oder
            Entschließung”; by the early nineteenth century, it had begun to acquire the negative connotation of “despotism” it has today, e.g., the
            tyrant is the individual who can decide at his whim to spare or execute someone. This last connotation plays an important role in
            Schlegel’s “Essay on Republicanism.” </note> Crucially, the power to break off at any point completely arbitrarily is not the confirmation
          of a speaker’s capacity to resist or negate, both of which would be responses to impulses that preceded them rather than instances of
          spontaneity, evidence of constraint rather than proof of reason’s unfettered freedom in its pursuit of unconditioned praxis. This is why
          Schlegel maintains that any actual interruption “must still at bottom be simply necessary and rational [<emph>vernünftig</emph>]; otherwise
          the whim [<emph>Laune</emph>] becomes willful [<emph>Eigensinn</emph>], becomes illiberality, and self-restriction turns into
          self-destruction” (<emph>Fragments</emph> 5). To demand that a writer be forever capricious would be to organize the potentiality of pure
          fancy into a method or posture that was only a step or two away from devolving into the rhetorical etiquette critiqued in
            <emph>Athenaeum</emph> fragment 82.</p>
                  <p> According to Schlegel, a truly autonomous sentence simultaneously says “enough said” and “this might not have been said since the
          discourse could have arbitrarily broken off the sentence before.” This is not simply a language in a perpetual state of becoming, forever
          nearing the ideal of submitting itself exclusively to the laws it fashions for itself, as Schlegel’s “progressive universal poetry” is often
          characterized. While Schlegel’s willingness to borrow from Kant and Fichte invites us to gloss his claims in terms of imperatives, promises,
          and language’s paradoxical positing of its own ground, each of these dynamics risks becoming another form of “illiberality” that compromises
          the autonomy of an utterance. Similarly, Schlegel cannot be content with Hegel’s insight that any proposition will inevitably generate new
          statements that counter it, since this ties a statement’s meaningfulness to something other than what it says<emph>.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, various authors grapple with Schlegel’s pure linguistic <emph>Willkür</emph> and
          the curious sentential forms it inspires. One of the most far-reaching of these contributions is the work of Edgar Allan Poe, who throughout
          his career was preoccupied with Kant’s philosophy. Poe’s affinities with Schlegel are nowhere more in evidence than in the short story “The
          Imp of The Perverse,” the title of which offers an epithet for the darker, more tyrannical side of Schlegel’s notions of autonomy and
          arbitrariness. </p>
                  <p>Poe’s first-person narrative relates the story of a man who commits a crime to considerable financial advantage and gets off scot-free,
          leaving everyone convinced that his victim died from natural causes. A few years later, a mysterious impulse drives the narrator to confess,
          and he recounts his experiences to the reader from his cell only hours before his execution. Prior to revealing his fate, the bulk of the
          text unfolds as a treatise on philosophical psychology with an almost parodic indulgence in terminological excess and speculative
          reflections on a “radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment” that is universal to our species, “an innate [. . .] principle of human action,
          a paradoxical something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term” (827).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It
            was not until later in the nineteenth century that “perverse” acquired the sense of “sexually deviant.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The narrator insists that the power of this drive that he settles on terming “perverse” has never been recognized because it serves no need
          or goal. So strong is our allegiance to utility that if something’s usefulness cannot be identified, we are prone to overlook its existence
          altogether, however influential it may be.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The core provocation of this perversity seems to lie in the
            narrator’s claim that it compels us to act “for the reason that we should <emph>not</emph>”; it is “the tendency to do wrong for the
            wrong’s sake” (827). This is not an anti-moralistic or outright nihilistic impulse; in the narrator’s terms, both would constitute a
            reaction to something rather than being, as he repeatedly insists this perversity is, a purely primal impulse. The challenge, then, is to
            conceive of this perversion as the first term of a causal sequence. It is not that we confront a norm—the reasonable, the logical, the
            morally upstanding—from which it is then possible to deviate; rather it is only in virtue of this distortion or corruption that a norm is
            made manifest at all. If one does not insist on this paradoxical point, then “for the sake of”—whether it is “right for the sake of right”
            or “wrong for the sake of wrong”—may still be implicated in a standard of usefulness, part of an evaluation of how well something makes
            use of itself.</note> This line of argument opens into a critique of human self-understanding as such. Recalling the military
          demonstrations Schlegel diagnoses in rationalist philosophy, Poe’s narrator claims that we begin with a set of premises about God and His
          aims for humanity and reach our “conclusions” about what people do and why they do it by assuming that their goals and behaviors reflect
          these divine designs, in effect positing our “results” at the start. This mix of utilitarianism and bad-faith idealism is critiqued in many
          of Poe’s texts, although here as elsewhere the playful tone makes it difficult to decide just how widespread or consequential these suspect
          doctrines are supposed to be.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Throughout “The Imp of the Perverse,” the elaborate interweaving of
            philosophical, medical, and psychological jargons, often with a polylinguistic flair, keeps the tone light, if not outright humorous. The
            narrator moves without comment between the tenets of phrenology and “metaphysicianism”; his discussion touches on the <emph>a
              priori</emph> and the <emph>a posteriori</emph> while confronting various principles, sentiments, and logical schemas; and he hunts
            after a “<emph>mobile</emph> without motive” and “a motive not <emph>motivirt</emph> [sic]” (827, emphasis in original). In many sections,
            the narrator appears to take it for granted that we all have the same philosophy of action, and he is explicitly self-reflexive about his
            argumentative tactics, constantly identifying his presuppositions and showing how he draws inferences from them: “Through [this impulse’s]
            promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the
            proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should <emph>not</emph>” (827, emphasis in original).
          </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the blind spot of human self-understanding, such perversity is not simply difficult to talk about—it defines the ways in which people
          use and abuse language. From the Latin <emph>perversus</emph> (“turned away from what is right”), perversion has a long history as a
          linguistic concept, sharing an etymological root with “verse” in the Latin <emph>versus</emph>, “a turn of the plow” or “a line of writing.”
          As is often noted, the logic of this nearly-dead metaphor marks off units of poetic text as furrows in a field, each line of verse delimited
          by the turn into it from the previous one and its subsequent turn into the next. (The Latin <emph>vertere</emph>, “to turn,” has the sense
          of “to translate” as well as “to transform.”) In post-classical Latin, a <emph>perversio</emph> names the reversal of words in a sentence,
          whereas in medieval Latin it comes to denote a falsification, an erroneous inversion of terms, or even an outright corruption of the text
          (e.g., a copyist’s error). Poe’s story is thus perched on the uncertain border between a substantive reversal of words or meanings and a
          mistake. A <emph>per-version</emph> is a verbal movement that has gone too far, a turn of language that pits the exchanges and substitutions
          essential to language against language itself such that it ceases to be possible to distinguish between “legitimate” linguistic operations
          and errors.</p>
                  <p>Emerging where linguistic self-reflexivity becomes linguistic self-diremption, perversity inevitably confounds the discourse on perversity.
          This is why the narrator’s prime example of being beset by the imp of the perverse involves a “usually curt, precise, and clear” individual
          who gives in to the desire to “tantalize a listener by circumlocution” (828). Unsurprisingly, this is precisely what the narrator does to
          his reader, discoursing repetitively about this perverse impulse from as many different perspectives as possible before finally making it
          clear that he has fallen victim to this primitive, irreducible sentiment not once but twice, first in confessing to his perfect crime and
          then in trying to tell us about it. Perverse words beget more perverse words and deeds, and it quickly becomes uncertain if there is any
          other kind. </p>
                  <p>When Poe’s narrator says that he “settles” on “perversion” as his jargon of choice, he indirectly acknowledges that “perversion” is exactly
          the right word for his discussion, because what is at issue is the always-already-perverted quality of terminology, which inevitably
          confronts us as the product of one turn too few or too many and therefore as overly transparent or inordinately obscure. A discourse may lay
          claim to its own words, but only insofar as it abuses them. This is why the narrator, having explicitly questioned the suitability of the
          word “perversion,” nonetheless has to embrace it, his tale building to the title’s sole appearance in the body of the text as he grandly
          names himself “one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse” (830). If this right-wrong word was selected “for want of a
          more characteristic term,” the narrator adds insult to injury by showcasing it via its instantiation in the figure of the imp who ostensibly
          embodies this uncharacteristic character trait. </p>
                  <p> “The main point is that one knows something and that one says it.” That the unavoidable consequence of this injunction is the perversion
          of the most fundamental language of the self becomes clear when Poe’s narrator recounts the circumstances of his downfall as he went about
          town enjoying the fact that he had killed with impunity: 
        <quote>I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.” One day, whilst
          sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I
          remodeled them thus; “I am safe—I am safe—yes—if I be not fool enough to make open confession!” No sooner had I spoken these words, than I
          felt an icy chill creep to my heart. (831)</quote>
        Syntactically, grammatically, and rhetorically, “I am safe” is a straightforward, even banal utterance. However, the moment the narrator is
          struck by perversity and starts to elucidate its logic, if only to himself, the proposition begins to do strange things. The punctuation
          marks between the different iterations of the three-word sentence and the accompanying exclamations (“I am safe—I am safe—yes—if . . .”)
          prove to be more <emph>Witzstriche</emph> (“wit-dashes”) than <emph>Gedankenstriche</emph> (“thought-dashes”), betraying the abyssal
          quasi-relations that simultaneously link and divide the statements and the interjections. The very need to repeat the claim about security
          threatens to negate it, meaning that the second “I am safe” becomes an expression of anxiety—“I am not safe”—at which point we must follow
          the narrator in re-reading the first “I am safe” and finding it to be as much ironic as anything else. With the identity of <emph>know
            it/say it</emph> broken, it is not clear whether “I am safe” is a constative utterance, a performative utterance (“he is safe if he says
          he is safe”), or an anti-performative utterance (“he is not safe because he says he is”). In Schlegel’s terms, the problem confronting Poe’s
          narrator is that once he begins to talk about his situation, he cannot break off at any point, completely arbitrarily. His “casual
          self-suggestion”—“if I be not fool <emph>enough</emph> . . .”— underscores his inability to know when and how to say “enough,” as if nothing
          he says can even hint at a subtext of “enough said.” Ostensibly a self-comforting gesture, “I am safe” becomes the quintessentially perverse
          form of self-affection, turning the discourse of the self against itself: against the “I,” against “safety,” and against the propositional
          form that would coordinate them in the figure of a predicate representing the situation of the subject. The “pure arbitrariness” of the
          phrase’s articulation marks the point at which the language of the self no longer belongs to the self. Neither descriptive nor expressive,
          this “I am safe” is an example of language turned against the turns of language. </p>
                  <p>In the course of Poe’s story, Schlegel’s <emph>Willkür</emph> is perverted into <emph>perversity</emph>, the rightest wrong word for a
          basic human drive that is not human at all, and <emph>perversity</emph> is “in turn” perverted into the “the imp of the perverse.” With the
          standards for “enough said” hopelessly confounded, one anticipates that there are more, and potentially more disruptive,
            <emph>per-versions</emph> to come, and one is not disappointed. Poe’s great admirer Charles Baudelaire translated/perverted the “The Imp
          of the Perverse” into French, titling it “Le Démon de la perversité,” and this demon re-turns in yet another perverted form in Stéphane
          Mallarmé’s early prose poem “Le Démon de l’analogie,” a text he wrote shortly after he had begun translating/perverting Poe into French. </p>
                  <p>As a number of scholars have noted, “The Demon of Analogy” is a close reading of Poe’s story. While it is not immediately obvious why
          analogy as such is perverse, its transformative powers are on exhibit in every sentence of Mallarmé’s poem. In a tribute to—or parody
          of—Baudelaire, symbolic correspondences proliferate in the text to the point that almost any alignment of two terms becomes potentially
          meaningful. Various sensory and intelligible orders stand in for one another metonymically and metaphorically, ensuring that the dynamics of
          perception, memory, and language become hopelessly intertwined. </p>
                  <p>From the first words of Mallarmé’s prose poem, we are also dealing with a ghostly, if not a monstrous, sentence, and the poet’s trials and
          tribulations will focus on trying to reconcile sentential and analogical powers:

        In contrast to Poe’s narrator, for whom the “absurdity” of the statement “I am safe” was not immediately evident, Mallarmé’s poet starts
          out from this judgment. Virtually every commentator on the poem has followed the speaker in agreeing that “The Penultimate is dead” is a
          mysterious and probably nonsensical sentence. This rush to judgment is surprising given that the word “penultimate” is not in itself
          especially unusual, particularly in this context. As the poet himself helpfully explains, the penultimate “is a lexical term signifying the
          next-to-last syllable of a word”; “its appearance,” he adds, “[is] merely the unwanted residue of the linguistic labor through which my
          noble poetic faculty daily sobs to see itself interrupted” (18). In these terms, the appearance of a ghostly sentence is an ordinary feature
          of the psychopathology of everyday life, unconscious detritus that drifts into the consciousness of a writer who cannot put his work aside
          as he strolls around the city—a writer who clearly cannot break off at any moment, completely arbitrarily. </p>
                  <p> Like “I am safe,” there is nothing grammatically or syntactically puzzling about “the Penultimate is dead.” However, if this proposition
          is first presented to the reader as a compact four-word statement, this is decidedly not how it initially manifests itself to the poet. He
          describes the mysterious voice that articulates these words as pronouncing them such that they are part of two distinct lines of a poem; or
          rather, based on the intonation, the first two words constitute the end of a line of verse, then the turn (<emph>versus</emph>) into the
          next line is deferred as the last two words break off, perversely, if not <emph>aus unbedingter Willkür</emph>. Versification invades and
          begins to pervert the prose poem, only subsequently to be turned back into prose. Perhaps in response, the word “Penultimate” itself is
          subject to considerable violence at the level of the letter. Both here and later in the text, the poet perverts the word’s syllabification
          as he creates a new syllable and a new word: <emph>n-u-l</emph>. </p>
                  <p> For better or worse, building a word with which to comment on the vexingly meaningful instances of meaninglessness with which he is
          confronted does not help the poet escape the utterance that stalks him and the incomprehensibility that it evidently brings with it:
        <quote>[T]he sentence came back, a virtual reality, detached from any previous stroke of plumes or palms, heard henceforth only through the voice,
          until finally it articulated itself all alone, animated by its own personality. I walked along (no longer contenting myself with mere
          perception), reading it at the end of a line, and, having once adapted it as an experiment to my voice, soon pronounced it with a pause
          after “Penultimate,” in which I felt a painful pleasure: “The Penultimate,” then the taut forgotten string, stretched over the
            <emph>nul</emph> sound, which broke, no doubt, and I added, in the manner of a funeral oration, “Is dead.” (17-18; translation
          modified)</quote>
        Although he can rationalize why the word “penultimate” belongs to him, the poet continues to be tormented by this sentence that is not his
          own. At the same time, he does gradually appear to be able to exert some control over the language, moving from “perceiving” the line to
          “reading it” to pronouncing it as he sees fit, thereby ostensibly co-opting the articulation of the utterance at the very moment that it
          confronts him as autonomous. To be sure, the authority the poet gains over the line by repeating it only goes so far, since he is not, like
          Schlegel’s free conversationalist, able to break off whenever he likes. If Mallarmé’s poet can pause between the first and the last two
          words, he must finish the sentence, the mechanics of his speech becoming interwoven with the physical logic of the string motif that runs
          throughout the text. Like Poe’s narrator, he is beset by linguistic compulsion.</p>
                  <p>As a sentence that is not quite a sentence, a section of two lines of a poem that is not quite a section of two lines of a poem, an
          utterance with straightforward grammar comprising four eminently definable words whose literal and metaphorical meanings are nonetheless
          mysterious, “the Penultimate is dead” begs for exegesis. Mallarmé’s poet, however, is content to recite it and then reword it, as if this
          will somehow neutralize the insistent haunting: “I resolved to let the sad words wander on my lips, and I walked on, murmuring comfortingly,
          as it offered condolences, ‘The Penultimate is dead, she is dead, really dead, the poor desperate Penultimate,’ thinking that . . . by
          expanding the speech, I might bury her once and for all” (18). “Enough said” has been said, but the ghostly sentence is not listening. If
          anything, it is the simplicity and compactness of the spectral formulation that must be combatted, as if the Penultimate will never truly be
          dead and buried if all one can say about it is that it is dead and buried. This is why melancholia comes to the fore in the final line of
          the text, as the poet declares that despite his best efforts to come to terms with this linguistic phantom, he is “condemned forever to wear
          mourning for the inexplicable Penultimate” (18). </p>
                  <p>Perhaps the mistake lies in treating the Penultimate as an autonomous unit, since by definition it is subordinate to an ordering logic that
          it does not control. Considered in isolation, as a self-same term, the “next-to-last” inevitably appears as a sort of ghost, an apparition
          that hints at a larger series that may be invisible or lost. Having raised this problem in the form of a sentence that comes out of nowhere,
          Mallarmé’s prose poem closes with the “Penultimate” as its last rather than its second-to-last word, which could be read as the poem’s
          attempt to kill the penultimate by transforming it into the ultimate. The logic, however, cuts both ways, since the gesture to close with
          the next-to-last risks negating the authority of the poem’s last word as “last.” If the last word is no longer final but merely almost
          final, then there must be more to come, if only in ghostly form, in which case the false conclusion of the text would affirm the continued
          supremacy of the Penultimate’s haunting.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the question of the poem’s “last” word, see Lyu. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We might surmise that it is imperative that the Penultimate not have the last word, even if it is the last word of the poem and if this
          last word concludes a pithy pronouncement of the Penultimate’s death. In fact, this does not turn out to be the central concern. As the poet
          tells it, the truly shocking aspect of the experience is not the prospect of interminable mourning, with which he associates sadness or
          resignation rather than surprise or dread. The real horror is the moment in the penultimate paragraph of the poem at which the poet realizes
          that the voice that has been autonomously articulating the sentence plaguing him is actually his own. This uncanny instance of linguistic
          self-recognition as self-alienation is followed by a second shock in the final paragraph when the poet notices that he is standing outside a
          shop selling string instruments. A complex web of wing, plumage, and string motifs runs throughout the text and is repeatedly perverted into
          all manner of sensible and intelligible forms. When this forest of symbols is suddenly instantiated in a collection of physical objects in
          the shop window, the poet is confronted with a signifying field in which analogism has been generalized to such a degree that it elides the
          very distinctions that make comparisons possible, and resemblances lose their capacity to signify. If the sentence “the Penultimate is dead”
          is powerful, it is because it stands outside of the field of correspondences structuring the poet’s experience of it. The ghostly utterance
          marks a limit at which the demon of analogy and the perversity of pure linguistic arbitrariness are at once most similar and dissimilar. </p>
                  <p> Schlegel asks us to envision a discourse in which every word or syllable is completely informed by and yet utterly indifferent to the fact
          that it may be the last word or syllable. The spontaneity of expression, or silence, is thereby pitted against the sentential paradigms of
          syntax, grammar, and logical predication. In Poe, the authority of the sentence persists, but in a perverted dynamic, turned not simply
          against the formal and semantic features that underwrite its constation or performance, but against linguistic iterability itself. The
          narrator’s stutter, “I am safe—I am safe,” is a Schlegelian witticism, its second instance emerging out of nowhere at the same time as it
          both dutifully repeats what has come before it and negates it. No matter how short or simple, a perverted sentence can never account for the
          connections, or the lack thereof, between its terms. In the end, “I am safe” is more terrifying than comforting because it cannot guarantee
          that this “I” has any relationship with “am” or “safe.” </p>
                  <p>In Mallarmé’s reading of Poe’s perversion of Schlegel’s language of <emph>Willkür</emph>, the notion that every word will potentially be
          the last is displaced by the proposal that each word is no more or less than the penultimate one. In these terms, verbal autonomy occurs as
          the universalization of an ordering principle that, like a flawed application of Kant’s categorical imperative, undermines the condition of
          possibility of that principle—in this case, of sequencing in language. The status of the penultimate as penultimate is thus negated at the
          very moment that this perverse penultimacy threatens to take over every other place in the series: first, middle, and last. </p>
                  <p>Read together, Schlegel, Poe, and Mallarmé present us with an eccentric cousin of Hegel’s speculative sentence that I have termed the
          “Romantic sentence.” On the one hand, such an utterance stridently gives voice to its own limitations, laying the groundwork for new
          sentential formations to come. On the other hand, it implies that the syntactic and semantic dynamics it comprises are singularly powerful
          and not easily superseded. According to Condillac, systematic inquiry never takes the time to fashion a “special language” for its ideas,
          instead contenting itself with discursive stand-ins. When the Romantic sentence becomes one such surrogate, it proves to be far from benign,
          perversely rendering the assumptions and goals of its would-be speaker all but unrecognizable.</p>
