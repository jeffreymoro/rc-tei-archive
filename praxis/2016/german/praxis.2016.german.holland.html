               <p>As is the case with its English counterpart, <em>equilibrium</em>, the German word <em>Gleichgewicht</em> is a concept whose origins are rooted in the world of materiality and practice. Both
                  can be traced to the simple act of balancing objects on a scale (<em>libra</em> in Latin and <em>Wiege</em> in German, which is the root of <em>Gewicht</em>): this familiar practice and the equally simple instrument associated with it form
                  the material basis for quantitative measures of equilibrium. For every case where
                  equilibrium can be determined through calculations, however, there are others where
                  it is deployed as metaphor to reflect intuitive impressions of balance or imbalance.
                  Equilibrium’s conceptual mobility derives from the fact that it requires only a single
                  act of differentiation to become applicable—at heart, it is a figure that describes
                  a relation between a minimum of any two given things—and it can therefore be said
                  to occupy a fundamental position within almost any conceivable discourse. Statics,
                  medicine, and physiological theory have various models to account for things in and
                  out of equilibrium, but so do theology, political science, and aesthetics. These “things”
                  need not even belong to the same class: physical bodies can be in equilibrium, as
                  can ideas, but it is also possible and even unremarkable to describe relations of
                  equilibrium between material and non-material concepts. For example, any handbook
                  of mechanics will contain descriptions of equilibrium between weights and forces,
                  which underscores that equilibrium relies upon an equivalence of effect, not a relationship
                  of identity. This truism is worthy of more attention in the contexts of Romanticism
                  and nature philosophy around 1800, where ideas from the natural sciences are often
                  repackaged in innovative ways, and where equilibrium has a fundamental role to play
                  that hinges upon its ability to negotiate even the most radical differences. To paraphrase
                  a thought by Schelling that will be taken up in more detail below, one could go so
                  far as to say that once the first distinction of object and representation has been
                  made—once their original identity has been replaced by a relationship of equivalence—equilibrium
                  as metaphor is already in play. With this idea, Schelling links the concept of equilibrium
                  inextricably to the physical or material origin of abstract thought.

            <p>Schelling’s willingness to grant equilibrium a central position in philosophical thinking
               by situating it at the beginning of reflection can be considered as one moment in
               a conceptual narrative that develops and takes different turns in nature philosophy
               and Romanticism before receiving its most dramatic formulation in the psychology of
               Carl Eschenmayer a decade later. We see traces of this same narrative, for example,
               when the mechanical balance and the mathematical laws associated with it are used
               as a figure of thought even in contexts removed from the sciences. To be sure, there
               is a pre-history for integrating quantitative thinking in qualitative contexts, also
               where equilibrium is concerned: already in Kant’s 1763 essay, “Attempt to Introduce
               the Concept of Negative Quantities into Philosophy” (<em>Versuch, den Begriff der negativen Grössen in die Weltweisheit einzuführen</em>), we find the concept of equilibrium used in an audacious application of mechanical
               and mathematical thinking to quantify human feelings. In subject philosophy, German
               Romanticism, and early nineteenth-century psychology—i.e., wherever theories of the
               self are set into juxtaposition with the laws of nature—one finds the physics of equilibrium
               invoked to make arguments in more speculative contexts. In other words, one can say
               that the defining characteristic of equilibrium as concept for Schelling, its ability
               to move between the material and non-material, becomes a topic for reflection and
               a tool of philosophical thinking in its own right. The use of the mechanical balance
               as figure of thought is simply a variation of the same theme.</p>
            <p>This paper will take a closer look at the concept of equilibrium around 1800, to understand
               its use, and to trace the different ways in which Schelling’s positioning of equilibrium
               at the beginning of reflection transforms a commonplace scientific concept into a
               philosophically powerful one. It will first focus on the early nature philosophy of
               Schelling and Eschenmayer and the aphorisms of Novalis around 1800 before turning
               to Eschenmayer’s later work on psychology from 1814, simply because for each, their
               work on equilibrium combines familiarity with physical theories with philosophical
               experiments in speculative contexts. To be sure, the encyclopedic thinking of Novalis,
               as well as the willingness of Schelling and Eschenmayer to allow a number of scientific
               ideas and theories to permeate their writing, challenge any univocal understanding
               of how quantitative descriptions of equilibrium are applied to systems of thought
               not native for them. This is particularly true since equilibrium itself is well-suited
               to serve the familiar Romantic strategy of bringing oppositions into productive tension
               with one another. Against the backdrop of this intellectual landscape, the following
               readings will concentrate on two related tendencies in the discussion on equilibrium:
               the first relating to its ability to move between the immaterial and the material,
               the second relating to questions of visibility that such movement entails. </p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Schelling depicts the beginning of philosophical reflection as a division of
                     the self from the world, he describes this event as a disruption of an equilibrium
                     state. In the <em>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature </em>(1797), he suggests that we, as thinkers, emerge from an original condition in which
                     there is “an absolute equilibrium of forces and of consciousness,” a condition which
                     can be both removed and reinstated (in a qualified way) through the free act of the
                     will (<em>Ideas</em> 71).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Unless otherwise noted all translations are mine.</span></div>
                     </div> Schelling then allows this hypothesis about the origin of reflection to be embodied
                     in the narrative of the first person to exercise his will in such a way: “Who first
                     found that he could distinguish [<em>unterscheiden</em>] himself from external things, and that he could thereby distinguish his ideas from
                     objects, and conversely, [objects from ideas], was the first philosopher. He was the
                     first to interrupt the mechanism of his thinking, to displace the equilibrium of the
                     consciousness, in which subject and object are united” (<em>Ideas</em> 72). With the distinction of ideas from objects, the world becomes observable and
                     our thinking about it does as well. Schelling thereby establishes a vital connection
                     between equilibrium and the problem of visibility in the broadest sense, one to which
                     he will return throughout his work.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For Schelling, there is no complete return to absolute equilibrium in the course of
                     life from the subject’s point of view—such a state of absolute rest would be an absurdity
                     or <em>Unding</em> (<em>World Soul</em> 79). Equally undesirable is a situation of living in complete isolation from the reality
                     of the world, caught up in the chimera (<em>Hirngespinst</em>) of one’s imagination. Instead man finds himself in dynamic relation to a world “which
                     has influence upon him, lets him feel its power, and upon which he can react, to exercise
                     all his forces: between him and the world therefore there must be no fast divide,
                     contact and exchange must be possible between both; for only then will man become
                     man” (<em>Ideas</em> 71).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“ . . . die auf ihn Einfluß hat, ihre Macht ihn empfinden läßt, und auf die er zurückwirken
                              kann, alle seine Kräfte zu üben: zwischen ihm und der Welt also muß keine Kluft befestigt,
                              zwischen beyden muß Berührung und Wechselwirkung möglich seyn; denn so nur wird der
                              Mensch zum Menschen.”</span></div>
                     </div> This model of equilibrium defined by “contact and exchange” must necessarily, by Schelling’s
                     own definition, be considered relative, not absolute, and it allows the relationship
                     between object and thought to be maintained without risk of either total identity
                     with the world or total detachment from it. The correlating state from the physical
                     world that Schelling references here is one of opposing pairs of forces that influence
                     and limit each other and which are able to enter states of relative equilibrium (see <em>Ideas </em>102). The departure from absolute equilibrium is therefore a rejection of the initial
                     identity between self and world that nonetheless allows relations of thought to object
                     and the distinctions between them to be maintained.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Eschenmayer’s <em>Propositions from Nature-Metaphysics Applied to Chemical and Medicinal Objects</em> (1797), published the same year as Schelling’s <em>Ideas</em>, approaches the discussion of equilibrium from a different direction, first focusing
                  on states of nature rather than situating absolute and relative equilibrium in a philosophical
                  narrative of intellectual emergence, as Schelling does. For Eschenmayer, relative
                  equilibrium emerges when “two opposed degrees of reality work in opposition” (<em>Propositions </em>22). Like Schelling, he makes a critical distinction between forces which are completely
                  sublated (<em>aufgehoben</em>), so as to be considered identical, and those whose effects are considered equivalent.
                  For Eschenmayer, however, absolute equilibrium is a special case in the physical world:
                  it is “there where two forces completely sublate their effects, so that they are no
                  longer an object, neither for mathematical construction nor for the analysis of experience”
                  (ibid.). Eschenmayer thereby introduces the relation of equilibrium to consciousness
                  indirectly, not as the beginning of philosophical reflection, but in terms of a particular
                  experience that would constitute the end of cognitive “visibility.” He then uses the
                  example of the mechanical lever (which is essentially the same object as a balance)
                  in order to reinforce the idea that equilibrium, whether relative or absolute, is
                  something to be expressed in terms of visualization. He first takes the case of relative
                  equilibrium: when the forces applied to a lever or balance are divided upon the arms
                  around a fulcrum point, Eschenmayer writes, then one calculates whether their mechanical
                  moments are equal in order to ascertain whether or not the object is in a state of
                  relative equilibrium. He then adjusts the imaginary lever for the case of absolute
                  equilibrium: if the forces acting upon the lever are simply joined in the fulcrum
                  point—the visual correlate being a lever with no arms—then the lever’s magnitude of
                  motion becomes zero: “this is the absolute mechanical equilibrium which is no longer
                  an object for the mathematician” (ibid.). Though the context is different, Eschenmayer’s
                  strategy is analogous to Schelling’s: just as Schelling positions the concept of equilibrium
                  at the division of thought and object, Eschenmayer manipulates the lever so that it
                  allows us to visualize both relative equilibrium, which is defined as the presence
                  of forces in tension, and absolute equilibrium, in which these forces are completely
                  sublated. To paraphrase Eschenmayer, it allows us to visualize even that which is
                  no longer there, to model invisibility as a special case of the visible. He also emphasizes
                  that this same idea has currency in other scenarios, such as the relationship between
                  positive and negative electrical charges, or the forces of expansion and repulsion
                  in matter. These are scenarios where it would be difficult to visualize the lever
                  or incorporate it into an experimental setting, but where the spatial image of distances
                  from the lever’s fulcrum collapsing to zero can still be retained as metaphor—where
                  the trace image of the lever’s materiality continues to play a role.</p>
               <p>The examples from Schelling and Eschenmayer referred to above, as revealing as they
                  may be of a philosophical interest in equilibrium, are also indicative of the difficulties
                  involved in pinning the concept down. After all, “absolute equilibrium” cannot itself
                  be considered a firm reference point, given that, for all their overlap, Schelling’s
                  and Eschenmayer’s “absolutes” emerge in two very different contexts—Schelling’s within
                  a description of the subject, and Eschenmayer’s in the context of mechanics. The examples
                  they give of relative equilibrium are also drawn from different physical and philosophical
                  contexts. In each case, however, equilibrium or a related concept such as the mechanical
                  lever connects in some way to the boundary between the material and the immaterial,
                  conditions that are turn expressed in terms of visibility and invisibility. This state
                  of affairs argues for an aesthetics of equilibrium—i.e., that there are aspects to
                  how the concept of equilibrium is utilized around 1800 that can be codified in general
                  terms of techniques of visualization that begin with Schelling’s original association
                  between reflection and the loss of equilibrium and then return in surprising ways.
                  At the very least, the basic distinction between absolute and relative equilibrium
                  lends itself to being understood as the presence or absence of an aesthetically neutral
                  state prior to or deprived of representations, whether in a global sense (Schelling)
                  or a local one (Eschenmayer). </p>
               <p>First, however, the question of what kinds of equilibrium states deserve to be called
                  “visible” in the nature philosophical context, and what an aesthetics of equilibrium
                  might entail, deserves to be considered in more detail. This requires a further look
                  at Eschenmayer’s definition of absolute equilibrium and his comment that something
                  in this state is no longer an object. He implies that such a construction of absolute
                  equilibrium is not of interest because it has been effectively rendered neutral: it
                  has ceased to call attention to itself as something in need of contemplation and analysis,
                  and is no longer a catalyst of change for the particular mechanics of the system under
                  observation. For those of us who are neither mathematicians nor nature philosophers,
                  however, and who are considering precisely those cases where the mechanical laws of
                  equilibrium are being imported into different contexts, the question of analytical
                  visibility versus transparence is perhaps more interesting than Eschenmayer would
                  have us believe. This holds true for both Schelling and Eschenmayer’s own nature philosophy,
                  because it suggests that there is an aesthetic code with its own logic that corresponds
                  to natural law. For Eschenmayer, the absence of absolute equilibrium becomes a precondition
                  for the visibility of the phenomenal world, just as it is the precondition for philosophical
                  observation in Schelling. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Their use of spatial descriptions also argues for an aesthetics of equilibrium: just
                     as Eschenmayer understands the difference between the absolute and the relative in
                     terms of the distance from the fulcrum point, Schelling’s distinction between these
                     two states is also dependent on concepts of spatiality. This is an idea which could
                     also be explored further in Schelling’s writing about art, and in particular, his
                     1802–03 lectures. There, he draws upon the concept of equilibrium as a problem for
                     artistic composition, such as the balancing of colors and grouping of objects in painting,
                     and as a problem for the observer of the work of art, whose spirit Schelling describes
                     as maintained in a state of “the highest desire, between disturbed and restored equilibrium,
                     at once in motion and in peace” (<em>Lectures</em> 188). The observation of the work of art generates a particular cognitive experience
                     defined in terms of a relative equilibrium where the “forces” in question have not
                     been sublated.

               <p>In the context of Schelling’s nature philosophy, however, the notion of an “aesthetics”
                  of equilibrium can be understood even more broadly because it has the ability to connote
                  various registers of visibility (and invisibility), whether in the context of a subject
                  philosophy, as an instrument of thought, or in terms of equilibrium states in nature.
                  With regard to the latter, Schelling and Eschenmayer understand the transition from
                  absolute to relative equilibrium to be accompanied by phenomena that emerge through
                  the process of attaining and maintaining relative equilibrium, a process that endlessly
                  echoes the original disruption from the state of absolute equilibrium. In the <em>World Soul</em>, for example, Schelling observes a general striving for equilibrium in all of nature.
                  Every principle, once aroused, awakens an opposed principle with which it comes to
                  be in equilibrium (125): “The tension of posited and opposed forces is itself productive,
                  as in the case of chemical processes:<em>Because</em> in every chemical process there <em>emerge</em> qualities which were not there before, and which owe their origin simply to the striving
                  of opposed forces to place themselves in equilibrium” (<em>World Soul</em>, 126, emphasis in the original). Schelling rephrases this idea from a more general
                  perspective of physical objects when he comments that the only reason we can perceive
                  matter in space is because of its tendency toward equilibrium states: “One has to
                  claim that both attractions stand under the same original law, namely the one according
                  to which matter reveals its existence in space through a continuous striving for equilibrium,
                  without which all substances would be submitted to dispersal into the infinite” (ibid.).
                  Here, the perspectives of physics and philosophy coincide: from the point of view
                  of a subject philosophy, our departure from absolute equilibrium guarantees our ability
                  to observe forms in nature, and from the point of view of physics, perception of form
                  is always to some degree the perception of an equilibrium state. These examples also
                  make the processual nature of equilibrium clear—i.e., that it has temporal duration—and
                  highlight the fact that it persists even after having been (relatively) attained.
                  Eschenmayer’s <em>Propositions</em> also describe the process through which equilibrium itself is achieved—i.e., as something
                  that emerges by degrees (“<em>nach und nach</em>,” 23)—and indicate that our perception of phenomena such as an electrical charge
                  depends upon such systems not being in a state of absolute (mechanical) equilibrium.
                  The idea of equilibrium emerging by degrees is important because it takes a process
                  that might be beyond the empirical experience of the observer and artificially slows
                  it down and makes it quantifiable, thereby stretching time and revealing the duration
                  of phenomena that might appear to occur instantaneously.</p>
               <p>Taken together, these passages from Schelling and Eschenmayer show how different scenarios
                  emerge—i.e., the departure from absolute equilibrium, the striving for and maintenance
                  of relative equilibrium, along with the inevitable disruptions and restorations—within
                  which the concept of equilibrium connects and articulates the differences between
                  the material and the non-material, between objects and their representations, and
                  between the effects of natural processes and the forces that produce them. Yet rather
                  than vanishing within the dynamics of its own philosophical function, equilibrium
                  both acts in the service of visibility and acquires this quality for itself, becoming
                  both the subject and object of its own aesthetic interests.</p>

                  <p>With reference to nature philosophy, to Idealism and the subject philosophy of the
                     1790s, and not least of all to its own poetic concerns, early German Romanticism also
                     incorporates equilibrium into its conceptual vocabulary. Novalis’s notes and fragments
                     on equilibrium draw from multiple sources, but they are joined by a concern for applying
                     the language of mechanical equilibrium to philosophical and poetic contexts. It comes
                     as little surprise that Novalis collects examples from the work of other philosophers,
                     including Fichte and Eschenmayer, who share the same interest in importing mechanical
                     models for their own use. In his notes on Fichte, Novalis transcribes the philosopher’s
                     description of a “pure ego” (<em>reinen Ich</em>) that brooks neither change nor opposition, permitting only rest and identity. Only
                     with regard to a subject does it allow for division: “The ego is absolutely unity—the
                     subject absolutely divided—reciprocity of the ego in itself—it wants unity, it wants
                     to be divided. In the pure ego . . . no change—no opposition—no <em>continuity</em>—standstill—rest—identity—With relation to the subject its character—activity conditioned
                     by rest—must be a manifold” (2.133.44). The relationship between the pure ego and
                     the subject is well-trodden ground, thanks to the work of Dieter Henrich and Manfred
                     Frank, among others.

                     the language Fichte uses to describe the original unity and division of the ego is
                     the same that is used to describe mechanical states of absolute and relative equilibrium,
                     which comes as a surprise regarding a generation of philosophers generally thought
                     to have eschewed mechanical metaphors for organic ones.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Novalis engages extensively with Eschenmayer’s early nature philosophy, and in particular
                     the 1797 <em>Propositions</em>. He transcribes passages from the section on mechanical propositions which references
                     the definition of mechanical equilibrium discussed above, as well as the passage on
                     what constitutes an analytical “object” from a mathematical perspective (i.e., when
                     forces act at a distance as opposed to being collapsed and completely sublated at
                     the fulcrum). He also notes Eschenmayer’s analogy between mechanical equilibrium and
                     electricity and was therefore familiar with the idea that simple systems of equilibrium
                     could be used to describe various kinds of phenomena. Although there are numerous
                     references to equilibrium in Novalis’s work, two aphorisms move more clearly than
                     the others to conceptualize it in terms of a speculative aesthetics that still pays
                     homage to its nature-philosophical basis. Though different in their emphases, each
                     aphorism connects equilibrium to cognitive processes that include (without being limited
                     to) visual metaphors and play with the distinction between the material and the immaterial.
                     In the first, from his notes for the encyclopedia project, Novalis writes, <span class="quote">‘The temper [<em>Stimmung</em>] of the consciousness—of representation of all kinds is the tenor of crystallization,
                        of formation—and multiplication—thus <em>maintained rest—static force—</em>rationalizing (equilibrating) force—proportional force of evolution—a <em>constant quantity</em> in the variable change (point of rest on the lever). (3.432.836)’</span> The tone of the aphorism is much closer to a nature philosophical model of the consciousness
                     than it is to Fichte’s discussion of the ego. Even though it indexes various modes
                     of growth (mineral, organic, and mathematical), these differences collapse in light
                     of the aphorism’s essential analogy between representation and relative equilibrium.
                     We are far from a scenario (such as Schelling’s absolute equilibrium or Fichte’s pure
                     ego) where forces (or differences) are indistinct, and very much in a vibrant, living
                     state of equilibrium where they are allowed to emerge, to change, and to persist,
                     all the while held in check. Like Eschenmayer, then, Novalis also invokes the image
                     of the mechanical lever as a technique of visualization, both through visual metaphors
                     and through the quantification of immaterial things. These rhetorical shifts mirror
                     the mechanics they describe, allowing different aspects of equilibrium to emerge that
                     move the mind’s eye without creating an imbalance. <span class="quote">‘The second aphorism returns to the same idea, approaching it from a different direction:
                        The theory of relations belongs to algebra—or the natural history of quantities. (The <em>verbs </em>[<em>Verba</em>] are the actual word forces [<em>Wortkräfte</em>]—the so-called <em>nouns</em> [<em>Substantiva</em>] have emerged from <em>verbs</em>—and the verbs have emerged from nouns. Motion and rest [<em>Ruhe</em>]—Variable—constant x. All rest [<em>Ruhe</em>] is <em>figure</em>.) (3.400.691)’</span> There are various points of reference that could be invoked in order to orient oneself
                     with regard to this aphorism. One could, for example, refer back to an idea discussed
                     above that Schelling first articulates in the <em>Ideas</em> and then repeats in the <em>World Soul</em> (a text also read and noted by Novalis), where he claims that forces of attraction
                     and repulsion are necessarily in equilibrium in individual bodies, which is why they
                     keep their form, and that this necessity is felt only in opposition to the possibility
                     of equilibrium being destroyed. Or one could turn to the passage in the <em>World Soul</em>, cited above, where he adds that the only reason we perceive matter in space is because
                     of its striving for equilibrium: physical bodies are visible to us because they achieve
                     a relative equilibrium. These ideas help substantiate Novalis’s understanding of active
                     rest—i.e., relative equilibrium—as figure. The second tradition this aphorism recalls,
                     if less overtly, is connected to Kant’s use of algebraic notation to quantify emotions
                     referred to at the beginning of this essay. Both Kant and Novalis use algebraic ideas
                     and notation to quantify and create relations (in Kant’s case, between feelings of
                     pleasure and displeasure, and in Novalis’s case, between words that are not physical
                     objects but are effectively treated as such). Novalis taps into these traditions from
                     the perspective of the formation of language. In his vision, words stabilize into
                     figures—and not just rhetorical figures, but actual forms. We can also observe a certain
                     interplay between the function of nouns and verbs and their integration into this
                     mode of equilibrium. As suggested by the German, nouns (<em>Substantive</em>), however abstract they may be, are rooted in the notion of substance. Verbs, in
                     German (as was the case in Novalis’s day), are also known as <em>Zeitworte</em> because they express change and temporality; this aspect is deemphasized by Novalis’s
                     use of the Latin <em>Verba</em>. Novalis plays with such superficial distinctions, noting that both verbs and nouns
                     have the ability to transmute, each into the other, and it is this linguistic phenomenon
                     that underscores the analogy with mechanical equilibrium as a figure that can join
                     the material and immaterial. The Romantic contribution to the aesthetics of equilibrium
                     therefore lies in considering questions of perception not only from the point of view
                     of consciousness, in the tradition of Fichte, Schelling, or Eschenmayer, but also
                     from the point of view of a most fundamental poetics, the emergence and balance of
                     words themselves. In addition to the two cases discussed above, there are other aphorisms
                     by Novalis that take up the concept of equilibrium from the point of view of poetic
                     production: in one case, wit (<em>Witz</em>) is defined as both a consequence of equilibrium’s disruption and as the instrument
                     of its reestablishment (2.424.30), and in another case, Novalis refers to a perfect
                     genius (a loose translation for “<em>eine vollendete, genialische Constitution</em>”) where the inner and outer senses are in equilibrium (2.454.93). In Novalis’s notes,
                     one can even find a glimmer of an analogy to Schelling’s “first philosopher.” Given
                     that, for Novalis, the interplay of change [<em>Veränderung</em>] and persistence [<em>Beharrung</em>] are the defining characteristics statics and mechanics (3.780),
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> then with regard to his statement that “The philosopher changes in the eternally persistent”
                     [“<em>Der Philosoph verändert sich im ewig Beharrlichen</em>”] (3.693.705), one see that the activity of Novalis’s philosopher, like Schelling’s,
                     is also defined in comparable terms. If Schelling’s philosopher equates the origin
                     of philosophical thinking with the disruption of absolute equilibrium, then Novalis’s
                     philosopher is his logical disciple, someone who exists in an actively restful state
                     of relative equilibrium.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">3. Applied equilibrium: Eschenmayer’s psychology</span></h2>
               <p>Eschenmayer’s 1817 treatise, <em>Psychology in Three Parts as Empirical, Pure, and Applied</em>, exhibits the most advanced theoretical thinking about equilibrium’s function to
                  connect the material and non-material and as a concept that becomes an object of visualization
                  in its own right. Eschenmayer’s text invokes the lever’s law of equilibrium in each
                  section, shaping it according to the context, such that it emerges each time as the
                  physical counterpoint to a subjective understanding of equilibrium. In this treatise,
                  psychology usurps the place of philosophy. It has become the master discourse that
                  is, for Eschenmayer, nothing less than the “<em>elementary science</em> or the root of all philosophy” (<em>Psychology </em>2). It is the psychologist who embodies one of the central arguments Eschenmayer develops—arguably
                  the most important one, and certainly the one that bears most directly on the concept
                  of equilibrium—because it is the psychologist, not the philosopher or scientist, who
                  is aware that that all laws of nature are corollaries of subjective intuitions, and
                  that this structure is replicated in psychological theories on the structure of the
                  brain itself.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Even though Eschenmayer’s thinking about equilibrium is most extensive and innovative
                     in the section on applied psychology, it is helpful to see how it enters the discussion
                     in the first two sections of his treatise because the function of equilibrium in the
                     final section enacts a synthesis of what comes before. In the first section, on empirical
                     psychology, the faculty of feeling is the one most worthy of attention according to
                     Eschenmayer because it is situated both “in the middle row of the faculties” and “in
                     the middle point of the entire human,” a position analogous to the fulcrum (<em>Psychology</em> 85).

                              on negative quantities.</span></div>
                     </div> The centrality of this faculty functions for Eschenmayer within a logic of equilibrium,
                     because it is here that one finds “the absolute unity or the absolute equilibrium
                     of the entire mental [<em>geistigen</em>] organism in man” (ibid.). Absolute equilibrium should not be understood here as
                     “original” as described by Fichte and Schelling but rather in the sense of an absolute
                     mechanical equilibrium advocated in Eschenmayer’s earlier texts, as a constant point
                     of departure and return among a stream of external impulses. The metaphor Eschenmayer
                     uses—a purely aesthetic one—is the plucking of a string: “Thus what enters into the
                     faculty of feeling plucks as it were all of man’s strings at once, and its harmonious
                     or disharmonious tone, that is, pleasure or displeasure, is felt in the entire human”
                     (ibid.). Eschenmayer mobilizes his description of the faculty of feeling as a point
                     of departure for a series of ever farther-reaching comparisons, whereby man is always
                     in the middle point, between the traditional dichotomies such as spirit and nature,
                     mind and body. The mechanical model of equilibrium is prefigured here without yet
                     receiving the full exposition it will in the following sections, but the example Eschenmayer
                     gives of the figure of navigation between the material and the immaterial fits well
                     with the dichotomies listed above: “All mental oppositions in man are mediated through
                     the <em>ego</em> . . . thus in mechanics, for example, the <em>hypomochlion</em> on the <em>lever</em> [is] that which mediates between force and weight” (<em>Psychology </em>188, emphasis in the original).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the second section, on pure psychology, we learn the degree to which Eschenmayer
                     is willing to pursue his comparison between equilibrium among the components of his
                     model of the self and the law of equilibrium as it applies to the mechanical balance
                     or lever. The self, for Eschenmayer, is at the fulcrum or hypomochlion of being and
                     knowing: “<em>self-consciousness</em> is a <em>knowledge of the self about being</em>” whereby the self serves as “copula” between the two (<em>Psychology </em>287). Though being and knowing have a relation to each other through their mutual
                     relation to the self, Eschenmayer is careful to point out that this common relation
                     does not make them identical: “what matters here is that we do not confuse a <em>relational </em>[<em>beziehungsweises</em>] <em>equivalence</em> with a <em>complete identity</em>” (ibid.).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                              (9)

                     </div> In other words, we are dealing with a model of relative equilibrium, of effects that
                     have not been completely sublated. Once again, Eschenmayer turns to the lever’s law
                     of equilibrium, this time as an example that includes a diagram that could be found
                     in any textbook on classical mechanics that symbolizes the act of balancing between
                     something material (a weight) and something abstract (force): 
                     <blockquote class="quote"><img src="https://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/german/images/force.hypom.weight.png" alt="" class="graphic"/> 
                        <p class="noCount">Force and weight are opposed to each other, but both balance each other out relatively
                           [<em>beziehungsweise</em>] in a third, namely the hypomochlion, without however becoming identical to each
                           other.</p> 
                        <p class="noCount">Nature philosophy distinguishes between a <em>relative and an absolute equilibrium</em>. Relative is the equilibrium on the lever, when weight and force lie beyond the hypomochlion,
                           and for that reason are also object of intuition and calculation. If one brings, however,
                           weight and force closer and closer together, and finally too close, so that they collapse
                           with the hypomochlion, then equilibrium becomes absolute and thus has nothing more
                           to offer the intuition.</p> 
                        <p class="noCount">In a similar relation, the three factors that lie in the proposition [<em>Satz</em>] of the self-consciousness can be portrayed:</p> 
                        <p class="noCount"><em>Knowledge. Self. Being. </em></p> 
                        <p class="noCount">(<em>Psychology </em>288)</p>
                     </blockquote> For the first time in the treatise, Eschenmayer introduces diagrams as a technique
                     of graphic visualization. In the first, the model of the mechanical lever is visualized,
                     and it is presumably in relative equilibrium because “force” and “weight” have not
                     collapsed in the hypomochlion. This diagram resembles a physical lever and functions
                     accordingly, and it also instates its own artificiality as diagram and visualizes
                     the theoretical construct that the physical lever embodies. It is a projection of
                     the “object of intuition” in print. The second diagram—<em>Knowledge . Self . Being</em>.—only deserves such a designation because of the italics and white space that set
                     it off from the rest of the text and because it is meant to recall the first diagram
                     in its linear arrangement of three terms, whereby the outside two compete in their
                     relations with the central term. The diagrams each function doubly: first, they show
                     how the material assemblage of the lever (as it is faithfully represented as diagram)
                     has the ability to make connections between abstract terms and things that are material
                     or accessible to the senses. They also show, through the repetition of the second
                     diagram, that equilibrium itself can serve as a hermeneutic tool, and that it is possible
                     to make comparisons between equilibrium states to advance our understanding of how
                     the mind works through a provocative analogy between the immateriality of knowledge
                     and the materiality of being.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Eschenmayer develops this model in his section on applied (or “practical”) psychology,
                     which he describes as a “new attempt” (10) in the field. Although the phrase “applied
                     psychology” appears as early as the 1790s in Karl Philipp Moritz’s <em>Magazine for Empirical Psychology </em>[<em>Magazin für Erfahrungsseelenkunde</em>], Eschenmayer’s text represents the first attempt to think systematically about an
                     applied psychology in any depth.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                              (10)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The only person who seems to have thought systematically about an applied psychology
                              before Eschenmayer is Johann Karl Wezel. In Wezel’s text, there is no clear distinction
                              made between empirical and applied psychology.</span></div>
                     </div> As he states in the introductory paragraph, the word “applied” is to be understood
                     in the same sense as a mathematician—or indeed, any theorist—would take theoretical
                     propositions and apply them to cases drawn from experience. We do not have to look
                     far to encounter the concept of equilibrium once more: “Thus the general formulas
                     and equations of mathematics, for example the proposition of the equilibrium of mass
                     with speed, find their application in mechanics, statics, astronomy. Entirely in this
                     sense I position a <em>pure</em> and <em>applied</em> psychology in opposition to each other” (<em>Psychology </em>423). It is possible to see that equilibrium, a concept deployed in mechanics, statics,
                     and astronomy, has come to embody the figure of application itself. It thereby becomes
                     an example for how quantitative models can be seen to influence methodological approaches:
                     metaphors of equilibrium have become metaphors of method.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The purpose of an applied psychology is much more than a unidirectional application
                  of theory to experience. It is an argument that “laws of thought” (<em>Geseze</em> [sic] <em>des Denkens</em>) become objective in “physical nature”—that there is complete congruence between
                  the intellectual “realm of freedom” and the physical “realm of necessity” (<em>Psychology </em>428). The discovery of this congruence may well begin with experience. The counterpoint
                  to Fichte and Schelling’s narrative of “the philosopher” is Eschenmayer’s natural
                  scientist (<em>Naturforscher</em>) who gathers elements of experience and observations of the world, orders them, and
                  tries to find the laws governing them even as, unbeknownst to him, he is being led
                  from the general law that exists within himself. Once again, the special case that
                  illustrates this general point is the lever: <span class="quote">‘The physicist believes, for example, that he invented the law of the lever. The psychologist,
                     however, shows him the prototype of it already in the law of self-consciousness and
                     can demonstrate to the physicist that such an expression of equilibrium in nature
                     must necessarily take place. (<em>Psychology </em>435)’</span> The law of the lever also illustrates how knowledge-building works in two directions,
                  that physical laws can be “applied” to the self-consciousness to reveal something
                  new even if these laws are images [<em>Abbilder</em>] of the mind. Eschenmayer reminds us that the opposition of force and weight mirrors
                  that of knowledge and being, that the mediating function of being is expressed in
                  the lever’s hypomochlion, and that “the equation of knowledge and being is expressed
                  through the relative equilibrium of weight and force” (<em>Psychology </em>448). There is another aspect to the law of the lever relevant here, however: that
                  the lever or balance is in equilibrium when the ratio weight and force is the inverse
                  of their distance from the hypomochlion. According to Eschenmayer, this is also applicable
                  to the self-consciousness: <span class="quote">‘Knowledge namely becomes an even greater force, and stands in equilibrium with an
                     even greater weight, the more it is removed from the standpoint of the self, and thereby
                     approaches the standpoint of ideas. Thus the law of self-consciousness expresses in
                     its objective form precisely that which the law of mechanics does in its objective
                     form, and this correspondence is not a contingent, but rather a necessary one. Nature
                     cannot appear to us otherwise than in such forms that are innate [<em>eingebildet</em>] to our spirit. (<em>Psychology </em>435)’</span> This passage reinforces the fact that at the heart of Eschenmayer’s “applied psychology”
                  one finds an “applied equilibrium.” After its appropriation from the physical world
                  in the service of philosophical theory, at one time it might have been sufficient
                  to say that equilibrium’s instrumental value simply lies in the connection of material
                  and non-material concepts, but Eschenmayer’s psychology proves that this is no longer
                  the case. Equilibrium has been promoted to an instrument of reasoning in its own right.
                  As the above examples have shown, however, this does not mean that the mechanical
                  balances and levers have been left behind. Rather, they have remained, as diagrams
                  and figures of thought, and as reminders that the concept of equilibrium itself has
                  become necessary for continued negotiations between the physical world on the one
                  hand and the world of abstract forces, knowledge, and consciousness on the other.
                  Any “aesthetics of equilibrium” in the nature-philosophical context must therefore
                  also refer to the negotiations that take place between the two.</p>
