            </div>
            <p>In a deceptively simple pronouncement that succinctly encapsulates the Enlightenment
               understanding of language, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac declares: “every science requires
               a special language because every science has its own ideas. It seems that one ought
               to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing and
               the language remains to be composed” (<em>Le commerce et le gouvernement, </em>qtd. in Braudel 234). Although Condillac does not pursue the ramifications of these
               remarks, they bear further consideration. If a science is to be a process of genuine
               investigation and discovery rather than the presentation of predetermined results
               articulated within existing paradigms—if it is to speak a “special language” of true
               inquiry rather than rehearsing the rhetorical gestures of established systems—it must
               call for a discourse that is at present no more than a hypothesis. Whether or not
               such a language can or will become a reality may be irrelevant, since the scientific
               enterprise will never be patient enough to wait and see if its demand for a new discursive
               field will be met. Far from fashioning its own tongue, a science contents itself with
               surrogates, and the anticipated language—the language by virtue of which a scientific
               project would become the singular inquiry that it aspires to be—remains unrealized.
               Even hazier is the fate of each science’s “own ideas.” Their specificity may be preserved
               as they are articulated in whatever dialect can be cobbled together, or their uniqueness
               may remain a fantasy, as chimerical as the “special language” that is never seen to
               fruition.</p>
            <p>In this essay, I argue that Friedrich Schlegel’s theory of language emerges within
               the economy of surrogate tongues that Condillac describes. As is well known, Schlegel
               finds in Kant the inspiration for an account of poetry as an unconditionally autonomous
               discourse. What is less often observed is that Schlegel, like his contemporary Hegel,
               works to unsettle the hegemony of the Aristotelian proposition (<em>logos apophantikos</em>), a sentence—a coordination of subject and predicate—that bears a truth or falsehood.
               From Descartes and Leibniz to Locke and Hume, the practice of philosophy is the evaluation
               of such statements. Without some reliance on this basic discursive form, the rigorous
               investigation of our opinions and beliefs would be impossible. In Kant, this state
               of affairs begins to change. With the antinomies, the categorical imperative, and
               his theory of taste, the preeminence of the proposition is severely tested; in many
               respects, doing philosophy for Kant means trying to unsettle the proposition’s authority.
               Nevertheless, his understanding of judgment remains at its core a conventional logical
               model in which the predicate of a subject is affirmed or denied.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Hegel goes further, explicitly rejecting traditional propositional thinking in which
                  the subject is a stable element to which various predicates can be added or subtracted
                  in order to fashion statements of truth or falsity. In his doctrine of the “speculative
                  sentence,” it is not simply that the distinction between subject and predicate is
                  erased or that they are melded together into some “higher” unity.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See in particular §58–§66 of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit.</span></div>
                  </div> Conceptualized dialectically, subject and predicate are no longer independent terms
                  to be coordinated or distinguished. Instead, they are constitutively transitional
                  elements in an expressive dynamic in which the subject loses and recovers itself in
                  the predicate, but this happens in such a way as to reveal that the substance of what
                  is being articulated is precisely a movement of interruptions, reversals, and repetitions
                  more than the identity of any specific figure or relationship. In Kantian terms, it
                  is as if synthetic and analytic judgments were taking place simultaneously.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To analyze a speculative sentence is not to follow a linear trajectory from start
               to finish. The path is alternately a circle, an oscillation forward and backward,
               and a series of nearly discontinuous starts and stops. Throughout, the constitutive
               incompleteness and instability of any given sentence is glaringly on display. No individual
               formulation can be entirely self-determining, establish itself as the definitive iteration
               of a series, or have the final word. To the extent that the transitional elements
               of a speculative sentence do harmonize with one another, any equilibrium is short-lived,
               and the distinction between subject and predicate reasserts itself in a new statement
               whose substance is incompatible with the previous one. For Hegel, a sentence is understood
               “speculatively” precisely insofar as we recognize that it is one of many sentences,
               or if you like, there are speculative sentence<em>s</em>, but there is no speculative sentence.</p>
            <p>Although Schlegel may appear to go in the opposite direction with his account of an
               unconditionally autonomous utterance, I intend to show that he shares Hegel’s skepticism
               about the stability of the sentential form. To begin, I will describe Schlegel’s reconceptualization
               of the traditional proposition, focusing on his notions of wit and linguistic arbitrariness
               (<em>Willkür</em>). I will then turn to the work of Edgar Allan Poe and Stéphane Mallarmé, two authors
               who reflected extensively on the Romantic legacy and its implications for the theory
               of language. Their texts give us a glimpse of a discourse of Schlegelian perversion
               in which one may “begin,” as Condillac put it, “by speaking and writing” only insofar
               as the most basic syntactic and grammatical forms have become foreign and unpredictable.</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">*</span></h2>
               <p>What does it mean for an argument to be invested in its “own” terms rather than in
                  words it has borrowed, as Condillac would have it, from somewhere else? In the course
                  of questioning the hegemony of the proposition, Schlegel challenges the authority
                  of established philosophical terminology, as well. Playing with the vocabularies of
                  his predecessors, he repeatedly casts doubt on the internal consistency and completeness
                  of the nomenclatural schemes from which they emerge. This considerably complicates
                  the discussion, as Schlegel’s texts often seem to lurch back and forth between arguments
                  about words and arguments about syntax and predication, without making it clear whether
                  these analyses are mutually illuminating or incompatible. Schlegel does not simply
                  present words as the “building blocks” of propositions or the parts that make up a
                  whole. At the same time, his critiques of terminological and propositional thinking
                  do appear to be intimately interrelated. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the beginning of <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 238, Schlegel writes, “There is a kind of poetry whose essence lies in the
                     relation between ideal and real, and which therefore, by analogy to philosophical
                     jargon [<em>Kunstsprache</em>], should be called transcendental poetry” (<em>Fragments</em> 50).

                              jargon, should be called transcendental poetry. It begins as satire in the absolute
                              difference of ideal and real, hovers in between as elegy, and ends as idyll with the
                              absolute identity of the two. But just as we wouldn’t think much of an uncritical
                              transcendental philosophy that doesn’t represent the producer along with the product

                              of transcen…</span></div>
                     </div> The German <em>Kunstsprache </em>and the English <em>jargon</em> are similarly ambiguous in naming both a precisely calibrated field of terms, i.e.,
                     the lexicon of a trade or discipline, and the private word stock of a group, which
                     may seem obscure or impenetrable to outsiders. Jargon is the point at which the demand
                     for verbal exactitude and the aim of finding precisely the right word for what one
                     wants to say shade into confusion or obscurity. A term that proves to be singular
                     in its reference or signification risks losing its claim to semantic generality, and
                     hence its very status as a word, becoming either an impenetrable cipher or a transparent
                     token devoid of any meaning beyond its mechanical application in a particular context.
                     The fantasy of fashioning a language that is definitively one’s own or of appropriating
                     someone else’s vocabulary for one’s own ends turns out to be as much a matter of limiting
                     or destroying meaning as of creating it.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 238, philosophy’s jargon at first appears to assist Schlegel in devising
                  his own jargon of “transcendental poetry.” As the fragment goes on, however, it moves
                  from enumerating the common traits of poetry and philosophy to asserting that transcendental
                  poetry must live up to its new name. In effect, the analogy becomes “aspirational,”
                  that is, a variety of inferences are drawn about what this poetry must be like based
                  on the fact that it now carries this new label. As much authority as has been conferred
                  upon the transcendental, it is analogy itself that seems to be the real force here,
                  albeit an analogy in which the alignment of terms generates correspondences between
                  them rather than the other way around.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The violence of precisely this form of argument is a central concern in <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 82, whose first half reads, <span class="quote">‘The demonstrations of philosophy are precisely demonstrations in the sense of military

                        but have to come of their own accord; a definition that isn’t witty is worthless,

                     writes in another fragment, “According to the way many philosophers think, a regiment
                     of soldiers <em>en Parade</em> is a system” (23). In contrast to the transcendental poetry of fragment 238, which
                     was expected to live up to its new name, philosophy’s deductions never measure up
                     to their billing as systematic processes of reasoning that move smoothly from general
                     premises to valid conclusions. Instead, a philosophical argument begins with the adoption
                     of a position that is retrospectively understood to be the result of a series of steps
                     that emerge after the conclusion that they “produce.” Possession is 10/10ths of the
                     lawfulness of this <em>ex post facto</em> law.</p>

                     the fragment, and it is difficult to ascertain what is being modeled with reference
                     to what. The concepts under consideration—demonstration, deduction, definition—all
                     begin with the letter <em>d</em>, as if Schlegel had opened his dictionary of philosophical terms to a random page
                     and begun filling in the blanks, later turning the page to <em>e</em> and “explanation” when the reservoir of words beginning with <em>d</em> had been exhausted. Of course, these words happen to be some of the key concepts in
                     the thought of Leibniz, who is celebrated in the fragment’s final lines as the “real”
                     philosopher.

                              it is not obvious whether his reflections on these terms will prove more substantial
                              if the words are pulled arbitrarily from the dictionary or invoked in a scholarly
                              flourish as part of the core legacy of his rationalist predecessor. As the fragment
                              continues, it neither steers clear of jargon nor takes care to define its own terms,
                              particularly when it comes to the string of near-but-not-so-near synonyms for Philosophie
                              or Wissenschaft, including Kunstphilosophie, Symphilosophie, and Naturphilosophie…</span></div>
                     </div> For Leibniz, “demonstration” names the foundational philosophical operation by which
                     one attempts to determine a proposition’s status as true or false. Epitomizing the
                     procedure that Schlegel’s fragment debunks, such an evaluation considers the inferences
                     or deductions a statement generates, assisted by definitions, postulates, and theorems
                     that have already been proven. With what Leibniz calls a necessary proposition or
                     “truth of reason,” the assessment of a statement will, in a finite number of steps,
                     arrive at an identity or equivalence such as <em>A is A</em> or <em>2 + 2 = 4</em>, thereby confirming the statement’s validity; or else it will produce an outright
                     contradiction, revealing the statement to be false. By contrast, with a contingent
                     proposition or “truth of fact” in which what is at issue is a statement about the
                     “infinitely complex individual concepts of contingently existing individuals,” the
                     claim being considered may well be true, but “we can never demonstrate this, nor can
                     the proposition ever be reduced to an equation or identity, [for] the analysis proceeds
                     to infinity, only God being able to see, not the end of the analysis indeed, since

                     such that even an infinite number of inferences leave us an infinite number of steps
                     away from a definite result.

                              of regressive series abound in the Critique of Pure Reason, where Kant at one point
                              attempts to distinguish regressus in infinitum from regressus in indefinitum (A514/B542).
                              Kant specifically addresses the infinite analysis of the infinite complexity of individual
                              contingencies with his claims about the regulative rather than constitutive nature
                              of the ideas of reason. He argues that a constitutive idea would be akin to Leibniz’s
                              divine comprehension and that to have access to “the absolute totality of…</span></div>

                  <p>If the distinction between necessary and contingent propositions proves less stable
                     than Leibniz implies, truths of reason may periodically give rise to demonstrations
                     that flounder in a “nexus of terms” rather than crystallizing into expressions of
                     equivalence or contradiction. This may not be a terribly destabilizing prospect, for
                     in such cases the discourse will still be grounded in its core definitions, which
                     ought to be exempt from the demonstrations required of propositions. “By definition,”
                     a definition should be a reliably bounded utterance, a sentence or proto-sentence
                     that begins where a demonstration of a truth of reason leaves off, with the affirmation
                     of an identity or equivalence. Schlegel’s concern is that any definition is potentially
                     under suspicion of being an arbitrary alignment of terms disguised as a proposition.
                     On this account, a definition would be a military demonstration that makes no effort
                     to dissimulate its martial character—the first step is the last, and vice versa. This
                     is close to Hume’s critique of rationalist thought, which maintains that the very
                     distinction between definitions and propositions is a fiction, since the latter are
                     analytic in nature and thus constitute covert instantiations of the former.

               </div>
               <p>In exploring these questions, Schlegel makes no attempt to define definition; in another
                  nod to military jargon, he instead “deploys” a quip from the eighteenth-century aphorist
                  Nicolas Chamfort in order to set out the various types of definitions, explaining
                  the genus by enumerating its species: “To [philosophy’s] definitions one could apply
                  what Chamfort says in remarking upon the sort of friends one has in worldly life.
                  There are three kinds of explanations in science: explanations that give us an illumination
                  or an inkling of something; explanations that explain nothing; and explanations that
                  obscure everything” (<em>Fragments 27</em>). Echoing the analogy to philosophical jargon in the opening line of <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 238, this is an argument by analogy—or rather, by homology: one trio is
                  supposed to elucidate the features of another. Still, the parallels feel tenuous.
                  In “The Cynic’s Breviary,” Chamfort proposes that friends can either love, ignore,
                  or detest us. Although one could certainly make a case for how these three kinds of
                  friendship could be aligned with Schlegel’s three types of explanation, this looks
                  more like a mock comparison than a substantive demonstration; and the fact that Schlegel
                  never explicitly spells out Chamfort’s claims adds to the artificiality of the set-up.</p>
               <p>As it turns out, any skepticism we may muster proves irrelevant, for we have to make
                  the alignment work if we want to follow Schlegel’s “demonstration.” In a perfect example
                  of the military operation described at the fragment’s outset, we have no choice but
                  to act as if the comparison between types of friends and types of definitions were
                  illuminating. The juxtaposition of elements comes first, and we fill in the connections
                  afterward, as if the substance of the links had been the driving force behind the
                  coordination of the elements in the first place. If in <em>Athenaeum</em> 238 we have to play along with the name that Schlegel bestows on a particular type
                  of poetry, here in <em>Athenaeum</em> 82 we have to play along with the form of analogy itself.</p>

                  <p>The significance of these claims for propositions about contingent individuals becomes
                     clearer as Schlegel’s fragment introduces more Leibnizian terminology: “Correct definitions
                     cannot be improvisational but have to come of themselves; a definition that isn’t
                     witty is worthless, and there are an infinite number of real definitions for every
                     individual” (<em>Fragments </em>27–8). What Leibniz calls “nominal definitions” are based on clear and distinct knowledge
                     of something and may even enumerate enough defining traits to distinguish that thing
                     from everything else, but they do not confirm the possibility of their object <em>a priori</em>. In contrast, what Leibniz terms “real definitions” do substantiate the possibility
                     of their object <em>a priori</em> because they go beyond an explanation of its core structure and show that it does
                     not rest on any contradiction between concepts or axioms.

                              cleverness distinguished by the ability to make surprising connections or unexpectedly
                              illuminating associations. For Schlegel, it also has a lighter side. “Reason suffers,”
                              he writes, but wit is “free” and “thoroughly playful” (Kritische Ausgabe XII: 393,
                              my translation). Of course, wit’s characteristic flash of insight—what Schlegel describes
                              as a “lightning bolt from the unconscious world”—is also frightening, for it is not
                              so much a question of deciding whether or not to make use of wit as of surrendering

                     </div> For Schlegel, the key feature of a witticism is that it is “completely unconnected
                     with what came before it,” but despite this fact, it somehow invariably stands “in
                     glaring contradiction” to what preceded it (<em>Kritische Ausgabe</em> XII: 393, my translation). A flash of wit is entirely unexpected—it cannot be anticipated
                     or shown to follow logically from what has already been said—but, as if by serendipity,
                     it consistently negates what it follows. Independent of what has taken place and yet
                     utterly at odds with it, wit’s manifestation is impossible. Nonetheless, it is in
                     and through this impossible non-relation of disconnection that wit does bring things
                     together, creating connections on the basis of disjunctions at the same time as it
                     breaks connections that did not previously exist. As Schlegel writes in <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 37: “Many witty ideas are like the sudden meeting of two friendly thoughts
                     after a long separation” (<em>Fragments </em>23). Wit reveals resemblances—for instance, between transcendental philosophy and
                     poetry—only insofar as it threatens to undermine one or both of the fields it coordinates,
                     challenging the capacity of each to account for the nature of its correspondences
                     with the other. Witty definitions, in turn, facilitate determinations of individuals
                     that respect their infinite complexity yet delimit them.

               <p>However witty a philosophical demonstration may be, it is always at risk of degenerating
                  into formulaic patterns that remain rhetorically powerful but predictable, or worse,
                  become mere “etiquette.” Whereas Condillac cautions that we are unlikely to outfit
                  our new ideas with a new language, Schlegel warns that the more convincing our proofs
                  become, the more mechanical—and unremarkable—they will seem. This leads him to the
                  bold conclusion of <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 82: <span class="quote">‘The main point is that one knows something and that one says it. To want to prove
                     or even explain it is in most cases wholly unnecessary. The categorical style of the
                     laws of the twelve tablets and the thetical method, where we find set down the pure
                     facts of reflection without concealment, adulteration, or artificial distortion, like
                     texts for the study of symphilosophy, are still the most appropriate for a studied
                     natural philosophy. In a case where one has both to propose and prove something, it’s
                     indisputably more difficult to propose than to prove. There are lots of formally splendid
                     proofs for perverse and platitudinous propositions. Leibniz proposed and Wolff proved.
                     Need one say more? [<em>Das ist genug gesagt</em>.] (<em>Fragments</em> 28)’</span> Propositions that call out for the proofs required to validate or refute them betray
                  their own incompleteness. Taking his cue from Kant’s categorical imperative and Fichte’s
                  thetic judgment, Schlegel enjoins us to state what we know without any trace of a
                  desire to explain, much less to prove, what we are saying—indeed with no concern for
                  being understood at all. This is an utterance that makes no demands; it asks for nothing,
                  expects nothing, and is in no way reliant on the anticipation, much less the fact,
                  of a response. Only such a proposition, possibly an impossible proposition, says something
                  rather than implicitly or explicitly laying the groundwork for something that will
                  be articulated in a final form in a future statement. Only such a proposition makes
                  a claim that belongs to it alone rather than being the premise or instigation for
                  remarks to follow.</p>
               <p>Such an utterance must be witty. As Schlegel writes in another fragment, wit “is like
                  someone who should perform his social duties according to the rules, but instead simply
                  <em>does </em>something” (<em>Fragments </em>33). Witticisms propose without confirming their capacity to do so, which is why they
                  never become models for future speech acts, even witty ones. They posit “the facts
                  of reflection” without becoming implicated in reflexive gestures that might facilitate
                  inferences about what they have proven or what needs to be demonstrated in their wake.
                  Witticisms are the paradigm of an autonomous claim, yet for this very reason they
                  remain a-paradigmatic. If the rationalist ideal—or fantasy—of precise, transparent
                  communication envisions absolutely stable terms whose content is at once fixed and
                  self-explanatory, witticisms are both anti-demonstrative and anti-definitional. Their
                  significance lies solely in what they do—in the impossible connections they make and
                  the non-existent connections they break.</p>

                     </div> “Das ist genug gesagt” is, however, more than just a coda to the punchline it follows.
                     Schlegel maintains that if a proposition is to be autonomous, it cannot depend on
                     any supplemental clarification, explanation, or proof. In this sense, “enough said”
                     is the implicit conclusion of all truly unconditioned, unqualified utterances that
                     actually say <em>something</em> rather than prepare us for what will or must subsequently be said. Of course, in being
                     articulated at the end of a fragment that maintains that “enough said” is the message
                     of any genuinely substantive pronouncement, this particular instance of “enough said”
                     threatens to undermine the argument it purports to conclude. Its appearance compromises
                     the completeness of what has come before by suggesting that “enough said” was not
                     implied loudly or clearly enough. The attempt to clarify that enough <em>is</em> enough undoes the tautological certainty of the idiom at the very moment that <em>enough is enough</em> is identified as the basic statement of identity underwriting any verbal assertion.
                     No pronouncement about <em>enough</em> can ever suffice to bring a witty demonstration to a close. “Enough said” will always
                     be both a truth of reason, a truth about the very nature of speech, masquerading as
                     a truth of fact, and a truth of fact, a truth about a contingent utterance and a contingent
                     discourse, masquerading as a truth of reason.</p>
               </div>
               <p>“The main point is that one knows something and that one says it.” Is the distinction
                  between knowing and saying sustainable, or is the very need to express oneself, to
                  say what one knows, itself restrictive, amounting to an acknowledgement, however minimal,
                  that what is being said is dependent on at least the possibility of a supplementary
                  explanation or proof that would validate it? In another fragment, Schlegel describes
                  a truly unconstrained discourse that unfolds such that a commitment to continue is
                  never in force. He writes, “Even a friendly conversation that cannot freely break
                  off at any moment, completely arbitrarily [<em>aus unbedingter Willkür</em>], has something illiberal about it” (<em>Fragments</em> 5). This is a call for a language that would be entirely indifferent to the need
                  to continue with, much less complete, any given utterance. No longer simply the punctuation
                  at the end of every pronouncement, “enough said” should inform every word or phrase
                  before it is articulated, meaning, paradoxically, that silence itself may signify

               <p>Insofar as each and every verbal element is to be distinguished by the fact that it
                  need never have been expressed because the speaker might have broken off at the previous

                  of a truly free language submits itself to a regulation that would require that it
                  be followed by more language. Syntax and grammar, the norms of narrative, or the logic
                  of philosophical demonstrations—none of these paradigms will necessarily be violated
                  or compromised, but they are all subordinated to the possibility that the discourse
                  may stop at any point for reasons that have nothing to do with grammatical, narrative,
                  or logical dictates. </p>

                              a radical caprice, if you like, that is entirely free of exogenous pressures. According
                              to the Grimm, the original meaning of Willkür was “freie Wahl oder Entschließung”;
                              by the early nineteenth century, it had begun to acquire the negative connotation
                              of “despotism” it has today, e.g., the tyrant is the individual who can decide at
                              his whim to spare or execute someone. This last connotation plays an important role
                              in Schlegel’s “Essay on Republicanism.”</span></div>
                     </div> Crucially, the power to break off at any point completely arbitrarily is not the confirmation
                     of a speaker’s capacity to resist or negate, both of which would be responses to impulses
                     that preceded them rather than instances of spontaneity, evidence of constraint rather
                     than proof of reason’s unfettered freedom in its pursuit of unconditioned praxis.
                     This is why Schlegel maintains that any actual interruption “must still at bottom
                     be simply necessary and rational [<em>vernünftig</em>]; otherwise the whim [<em>Laune</em>] becomes willful [<em>Eigensinn</em>], becomes illiberality, and self-restriction turns into self-destruction” (<em>Fragments</em> 5). To demand that a writer be forever capricious would be to organize the potentiality
                     of pure fancy into a method or posture that was only a step or two away from devolving
                     into the rhetorical etiquette critiqued in <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 82.</p>
               </div>
               <p>According to Schlegel, a truly autonomous sentence simultaneously says “enough said”
                  and “this might not have been said since the discourse could have arbitrarily broken
                  off the sentence before.” This is not simply a language in a perpetual state of becoming,
                  forever nearing the ideal of submitting itself exclusively to the laws it fashions
                  for itself, as Schlegel’s “progressive universal poetry” is often characterized. While
                  Schlegel’s willingness to borrow from Kant and Fichte invites us to gloss his claims
                  in terms of imperatives, promises, and language’s paradoxical positing of its own
                  ground, each of these dynamics risks becoming another form of “illiberality” that
                  compromises the autonomy of an utterance. Similarly, Schlegel cannot be content with
                  Hegel’s insight that any proposition will inevitably generate new statements that
                  counter it, since this ties a statement’s meaningfulness to something other than what
                  it says<em>.</em></p>
               <p>In the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, various authors grapple with
                  Schlegel’s pure linguistic <em>Willkür</em> and the curious sentential forms it inspires. One of the most far-reaching of these
                  contributions is the work of Edgar Allan Poe, who throughout his career was preoccupied
                  with Kant’s philosophy. Poe’s affinities with Schlegel are nowhere more in evidence
                  than in the short story “The Imp of The Perverse,” the title of which offers an epithet
                  for the darker, more tyrannical side of Schlegel’s notions of autonomy and arbitrariness.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Poe’s first-person narrative relates the story of a man who commits a crime to considerable

                     died from natural causes. A few years later, a mysterious impulse drives the narrator
                     to confess, and he recounts his experiences to the reader from his cell only hours
                     before his execution. Prior to revealing his fate, the bulk of the text unfolds as
                     a treatise on philosophical psychology with an almost parodic indulgence in terminological
                     excess and speculative reflections on a “radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment”
                     that is universal to our species, “an innate [. . .] principle of human action, a

                              wrong for the wrong’s sake” (827). This is not an anti-moralistic or outright nihilistic
                              impulse; in the narrator’s terms, both would constitute a reaction to something rather

                              The challenge, then, is to conceive of this perversion as the first term of a causal

                     </div> This line of argument opens into a critique of human self-understanding as such. Recalling
                     the military demonstrations Schlegel diagnoses in rationalist philosophy, Poe’s narrator
                     claims that we begin with a set of premises about God and His aims for humanity and
                     reach our “conclusions” about what people do and why they do it by assuming that their
                     goals and behaviors reflect these divine designs, in effect positing our “results”
                     at the start. This mix of utilitarianism and bad-faith idealism is critiqued in many
                     of Poe’s texts, although here as elsewhere the playful tone makes it difficult to
                     decide just how widespread or consequential these suspect doctrines are supposed to
                     be.

               <p>As the blind spot of human self-understanding, such perversity is not simply difficult
                  to talk about—it defines the ways in which people use and abuse language. From the
                  Latin <em>perversus</em> (“turned away from what is right”), perversion has a long history as a linguistic
                  concept, sharing an etymological root with “verse” in the Latin <em>versus</em>, “a turn of the plow” or “a line of writing.” As is often noted, the logic of this
                  nearly-dead metaphor marks off units of poetic text as furrows in a field, each line
                  of verse delimited by the turn into it from the previous one and its subsequent turn
                  into the next. (The Latin <em>vertere</em>, “to turn,” has the sense of “to translate” as well as “to transform.”) In post-classical
                  Latin, a <em>perversio</em> names the reversal of words in a sentence, whereas in medieval Latin it comes to
                  denote a falsification, an erroneous inversion of terms, or even an outright corruption
                  of the text (e.g., a copyist’s error). Poe’s story is thus perched on the uncertain
                  border between a substantive reversal of words or meanings and a mistake. A <em>per-version</em> is a verbal movement that has gone too far, a turn of language that pits the exchanges
                  and substitutions essential to language against language itself such that it ceases
                  to be possible to distinguish between “legitimate” linguistic operations and errors.</p>
               <p>Emerging where linguistic self-reflexivity becomes linguistic self-diremption, perversity
                  inevitably confounds the discourse on perversity. This is why the narrator’s prime
                  example of being beset by the imp of the perverse involves a “usually curt, precise,
                  and clear” individual who gives in to the desire to “tantalize a listener by circumlocution”
                  (828). Unsurprisingly, this is precisely what the narrator does to his reader, discoursing
                  repetitively about this perverse impulse from as many different perspectives as possible
                  before finally making it clear that he has fallen victim to this primitive, irreducible
                  sentiment not once but twice, first in confessing to his perfect crime and then in
                  trying to tell us about it. Perverse words beget more perverse words and deeds, and
                  it quickly becomes uncertain if there is any other kind. </p>
               <p>When Poe’s narrator says that he “settles” on “perversion” as his jargon of choice,
                  he indirectly acknowledges that “perversion” is exactly the right word for his discussion,
                  because what is at issue is the always-already-perverted quality of terminology, which
                  inevitably confronts us as the product of one turn too few or too many and therefore
                  as overly transparent or inordinately obscure. A discourse may lay claim to its own
                  words, but only insofar as it abuses them. This is why the narrator, having explicitly
                  questioned the suitability of the word “perversion,” nonetheless has to embrace it,
                  his tale building to the title’s sole appearance in the body of the text as he grandly
                  names himself “one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse” (830).
                  If this right-wrong word was selected “for want of a more characteristic term,” the
                  narrator adds insult to injury by showcasing it via its instantiation in the figure
                  of the imp who ostensibly embodies this uncharacteristic character trait. </p>
               <p>“The main point is that one knows something and that one says it.” That the unavoidable
                  consequence of this injunction is the perversion of the most fundamental language
                  of the self becomes clear when Poe’s narrator recounts the circumstances of his downfall
                  as he went about town enjoying the fact that he had killed with impunity: <span class="quote">‘I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a
                     low undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.” One day, whilst sauntering along the streets,
                     I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.
                     In a fit of petulance, I remodeled them thus; “I am safe—I am safe—yes—if I be not
                     fool enough to make open confession!” No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt
                     an icy chill creep to my heart. (831)’</span> Syntactically, grammatically, and rhetorically, “I am safe” is a straightforward,
                  even banal utterance. However, the moment the narrator is struck by perversity and
                  starts to elucidate its logic, if only to himself, the proposition begins to do strange
                  things. The punctuation marks between the different iterations of the three-word sentence
                  and the accompanying exclamations (“I am safe—I am safe—yes—if . . .”) prove to be
                  more <em>Witzstriche</em> (“wit-dashes”) than <em>Gedankenstriche</em> (“thought-dashes”), betraying the abyssal quasi-relations that simultaneously link
                  and divide the statements and the interjections. The very need to repeat the claim
                  about security threatens to negate it, meaning that the second “I am safe” becomes
                  an expression of anxiety—“I am not safe”—at which point we must follow the narrator
                  in re-reading the first “I am safe” and finding it to be as much ironic as anything
                  else. With the identity of <em>know it/say it</em> broken, it is not clear whether “I am safe” is a constative utterance, a performative
                  utterance (“he is safe if he says he is safe”), or an anti-performative utterance
                  (“he is not safe because he says he is”). In Schlegel’s terms, the problem confronting
                  Poe’s narrator is that once he begins to talk about his situation, he cannot break
                  off at any point, completely arbitrarily. His “casual self-suggestion”—“if I be not
                  fool <em>enough</em> . . .”— underscores his inability to know when and how to say “enough,” as if nothing
                  he says can even hint at a subtext of “enough said.” Ostensibly a self-comforting
                  gesture, “I am safe” becomes the quintessentially perverse form of self-affection,
                  turning the discourse of the self against itself: against the “I,” against “safety,”
                  and against the propositional form that would coordinate them in the figure of a predicate
                  representing the situation of the subject. The “pure arbitrariness” of the phrase’s
                  articulation marks the point at which the language of the self no longer belongs to
                  the self. Neither descriptive nor expressive, this “I am safe” is an example of language
                  turned against the turns of language.</p>
               <p>In the course of Poe’s story, Schlegel’s <em>Willkür</em> is perverted into <em>perversity</em>, the rightest wrong word for a basic human drive that is not human at all, and <em>perversity</em> is “in turn” perverted into the “the imp of the perverse.” With the standards for
                  “enough said” hopelessly confounded, one anticipates that there are more, and potentially
                  more disruptive, <em>per-versions</em> to come, and one is not disappointed. Poe’s great admirer Charles Baudelaire translated/perverted
                  the “The Imp of the Perverse” into French, titling it “Le Démon de la perversité,”
                  and this demon re-turns in yet another perverted form in Stéphane Mallarmé’s early
                  prose poem “Le Démon de l’analogie,” a text he wrote shortly after he had begun translating/perverting
                  Poe into French.</p>
               <p>As a number of scholars have noted, “The Demon of Analogy” is a close reading of Poe’s
                  story. While it is not immediately obvious why analogy as such is perverse, its transformative
                  powers are on exhibit in every sentence of Mallarmé’s poem. In a tribute to—or parody
                  of—Baudelaire, symbolic correspondences proliferate in the text to the point that
                  almost any alignment of two terms becomes potentially meaningful. Various sensory
                  and intelligible orders stand in for one another metonymically and metaphorically,
                  ensuring that the dynamics of perception, memory, and language become hopelessly intertwined.
                  </p>
               <p>From the first words of Mallarmé’s prose poem, we are also dealing with a ghostly,
                  if not a monstrous, sentence, and the poet’s trials and tribulations will focus on
                  trying to reconcile sentential and analogical powers: </p>

               <p> In contrast to Poe’s narrator, for whom the “absurdity” of the statement “I am safe”
                  was not immediately evident, Mallarmé’s poet starts out from this judgment. Virtually
                  every commentator on the poem has followed the speaker in agreeing that “The Penultimate
                  is dead” is a mysterious and probably nonsensical sentence. This rush to judgment
                  is surprising given that the word “penultimate” is not in itself especially unusual,
                  particularly in this context. As the poet himself helpfully explains, the penultimate
                  “is a lexical term signifying the next-to-last syllable of a word”; “its appearance,”
                  he adds, “[is] merely the unwanted residue of the linguistic labor through which my
                  noble poetic faculty daily sobs to see itself interrupted” (18). In these terms, the
                  appearance of a ghostly sentence is an ordinary feature of the psychopathology of
                  everyday life, unconscious detritus that drifts into the consciousness of a writer
                  who cannot put his work aside as he strolls around the city—a writer who clearly cannot
                  break off at any moment, completely arbitrarily.</p>
               <p>Like “I am safe,” there is nothing grammatically or syntactically puzzling about “the
                  Penultimate is dead.” However, if this proposition is first presented to the reader
                  as a compact four-word statement, this is decidedly not how it initially manifests
                  itself to the poet. He describes the mysterious voice that articulates these words
                  as pronouncing them such that they are part of two distinct lines of a poem; or rather,
                  based on the intonation, the first two words constitute the end of a line of verse,
                  then the turn (<em>versus</em>) into the next line is deferred as the last two words break off, perversely, if not
                  <em>aus unbedingter Willkür</em>. Versification invades and begins to pervert the prose poem, only subsequently to
                  be turned back into prose. Perhaps in response, the word “Penultimate” itself is subject
                  to considerable violence at the level of the letter. Both here and later in the text,
                  the poet perverts the word’s syllabification as he creates a new syllable and a new
                  word: <em>n-u-l</em>.</p>
               <p>For better or worse, building a word with which to comment on the vexingly meaningful
                  instances of meaninglessness with which he is confronted does not help the poet escape
                  the utterance that stalks him and the incomprehensibility that it evidently brings
                  with it: <span class="quote">‘[T]he sentence came back, a virtual reality, detached from any previous stroke of
                     plumes or palms, heard henceforth only through the voice, until finally it articulated
                     itself all alone, animated by its own personality. I walked along (no longer contenting
                     myself with mere perception), reading it at the end of a line, and, having once adapted
                     it as an experiment to my voice, soon pronounced it with a pause after “Penultimate,”
                     in which I felt a painful pleasure: “The Penultimate,” then the taut forgotten string,
                     stretched over the <em>nul</em> sound, which broke, no doubt, and I added, in the manner of a funeral oration, “Is
                     dead.” (17-18; translation modified)’</span> Although he can rationalize why the word “penultimate” belongs to him, the poet continues
                  to be tormented by this sentence that is not his own. At the same time, he does gradually
                  appear to be able to exert some control over the language, moving from “perceiving”
                  the line to “reading it” to pronouncing it as he sees fit, thereby ostensibly co-opting
                  the articulation of the utterance at the very moment that it confronts him as autonomous.
                  To be sure, the authority the poet gains over the line by repeating it only goes so
                  far, since he is not, like Schlegel’s free conversationalist, able to break off whenever
                  he likes. If Mallarmé’s poet can pause between the first and the last two words, he
                  must finish the sentence, the mechanics of his speech becoming interwoven with the
                  physical logic of the string motif that runs throughout the text. Like Poe’s narrator,
                  he is beset by linguistic compulsion.</p>
               <p>As a sentence that is not quite a sentence, a section of two lines of a poem that
                  is not quite a section of two lines of a poem, an utterance with straightforward grammar
                  comprising four eminently definable words whose literal and metaphorical meanings
                  are nonetheless mysterious, “the Penultimate is dead” begs for exegesis. Mallarmé’s
                  poet, however, is content to recite it and then reword it, as if this will somehow
                  neutralize the insistent haunting: “I resolved to let the sad words wander on my lips,
                  and I walked on, murmuring comfortingly, as it offered condolences, ‘The Penultimate
                  is dead, she is dead, really dead, the poor desperate Penultimate,’ thinking that
                  . . . by expanding the speech, I might bury her once and for all” (18). “Enough said”
                  has been said, but the ghostly sentence is not listening. If anything, it is the simplicity
                  and compactness of the spectral formulation that must be combatted, as if the Penultimate
                  will never truly be dead and buried if all one can say about it is that it is dead
                  and buried. This is why melancholia comes to the fore in the final line of the text,
                  as the poet declares that despite his best efforts to come to terms with this linguistic
                  phantom, he is “condemned forever to wear mourning for the inexplicable Penultimate”
                  (18). </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Perhaps the mistake lies in treating the Penultimate as an autonomous unit, since
                     by definition it is subordinate to an ordering logic that it does not control. Considered
                     in isolation, as a self-same term, the “next-to-last” inevitably appears as a sort
                     of ghost, an apparition that hints at a larger series that may be invisible or lost.
                     Having raised this problem in the form of a sentence that comes out of nowhere, Mallarmé’s
                     prose poem closes with the “Penultimate” as its last rather than its second-to-last
                     word, which could be read as the poem’s attempt to kill the penultimate by transforming
                     it into the ultimate. The logic, however, cuts both ways, since the gesture to close
                     with the next-to-last risks negating the authority of the poem’s last word as “last.”
                     If the last word is no longer final but merely almost final, then there must be more
                     to come, if only in ghostly form, in which case the false conclusion of the text would
                     affirm the continued supremacy of the Penultimate’s haunting.

               <p>We might surmise that it is imperative that the Penultimate not have the last word,
                  even if it is the last word of the poem and if this last word concludes a pithy pronouncement
                  of the Penultimate’s death. In fact, this does not turn out to be the central concern.
                  As the poet tells it, the truly shocking aspect of the experience is not the prospect
                  of interminable mourning, with which he associates sadness or resignation rather than
                  surprise or dread. The real horror is the moment in the penultimate paragraph of the
                  poem at which the poet realizes that the voice that has been autonomously articulating
                  the sentence plaguing him is actually his own. This uncanny instance of linguistic
                  self-recognition as self-alienation is followed by a second shock in the final paragraph
                  when the poet notices that he is standing outside a shop selling string instruments.
                  A complex web of wing, plumage, and string motifs runs throughout the text and is
                  repeatedly perverted into all manner of sensible and intelligible forms. When this
                  forest of symbols is suddenly instantiated in a collection of physical objects in
                  the shop window, the poet is confronted with a signifying field in which analogism
                  has been generalized to such a degree that it elides the very distinctions that make
                  comparisons possible, and resemblances lose their capacity to signify. If the sentence
                  “the Penultimate is dead” is powerful, it is because it stands outside of the field
                  of correspondences structuring the poet’s experience of it. The ghostly utterance
                  marks a limit at which the demon of analogy and the perversity of pure linguistic
                  arbitrariness are at once most similar and dissimilar. </p>
               <p>Schlegel asks us to envision a discourse in which every word or syllable is completely
                  informed by and yet utterly indifferent to the fact that it may be the last word or
                  syllable. The spontaneity of expression, or silence, is thereby pitted against the
                  sentential paradigms of syntax, grammar, and logical predication. In Poe, the authority
                  of the sentence persists, but in a perverted dynamic, turned not simply against the
                  formal and semantic features that underwrite its constation or performance, but against
                  linguistic iterability itself. The narrator’s stutter, “I am safe—I am safe,” is a
                  Schlegelian witticism, its second instance emerging out of nowhere at the same time
                  as it both dutifully repeats what has come before it and negates it. No matter how
                  short or simple, a perverted sentence can never account for the connections, or the
                  lack thereof, between its terms. In the end, “I am safe” is more terrifying than comforting
                  because it cannot guarantee that this “I” has any relationship with “am” or “safe.”
                  </p>
               <p>In Mallarmé’s reading of Poe’s perversion of Schlegel’s language of <em>Willkür</em>, the notion that every word will potentially be the last is displaced by the proposal
                  that each word is no more or less than the penultimate one. In these terms, verbal
                  autonomy occurs as the universalization of an ordering principle that, like a flawed
                  application of Kant’s categorical imperative, undermines the condition of possibility
                  of that principle—in this case, of sequencing in language. The status of the penultimate
                  as penultimate is thus negated at the very moment that this perverse penultimacy threatens
                  to take over every other place in the series: first, middle, and last.</p>
               <p>Read together, Schlegel, Poe, and Mallarmé present us with an eccentric cousin of
                  Hegel’s speculative sentence that I have termed the “Romantic sentence.” On the one
                  hand, such an utterance stridently gives voice to its own limitations, laying the
                  groundwork for new sentential formations to come. On the other hand, it implies that
                  the syntactic and semantic dynamics it comprises are singularly powerful and not easily
                  superseded. According to Condillac, systematic inquiry never takes the time to fashion
                  a “special language” for its ideas, instead contenting itself with discursive stand-ins.
                  When the Romantic sentence becomes one such surrogate, it proves to be far from benign,
                  perversely rendering the assumptions and goals of its would-be speaker all but unrecognizable.</p>

                  and which therefore, by analogy to philosophical jargon, should be called transcendental
                  poetry. It begins as satire in the absolute difference of ideal and real, hovers in
                  between as elegy, and ends as idyll with the absolute identity of the two. But just
                  as we wouldn’t think much of an uncritical transcendental philosophy that doesn’t
                  represent the producer along with the product and contain at the same time within
                  the system of transcendental thoughts a description of transcendental thinking: so
                  too this sort of poetry should unite the transcendental raw materials and preliminaries
                  of a theory of poetic creativity—often met with in modern poets—with the artistic
                  reflection and beautiful self-mirroring that is present in Pindar, in the lyric fragments
                  of the Greeks, in the classical elegy, and, among the moderns, in Goethe. In all its
                  descriptions, this poetry should describe itself, and always be simultaneously poetry
                  and the poetry of poetry. (<em>Fragments</em> 50-1)’</span><span class="quote">‘Es gibt eine Poesie, deren eins und alles das Verhältnis des Idealen und des Realen

                  und Realen, schwebt als Elegie in der Mitte, und endigt als Idylle mit der absoluten
                  Identität beider. So wie man aber wenig Wert auf eine Transzendentalphilosophie legen

                  jargon. The deductions are no better than political ones; even in the sciences [<em>Wissenschaften</em>] one first occupies a terrain and only proves his right to it after the fact. To
                  its definitions one could apply what Chamfort says in remarking upon the sort of friends
                  one has in worldly life. There are three kinds of explanations in science: explanations
                  that give us an illumination or an inkling of something; explanations that explain
                  nothing; and explanations that obscure everything. Correct definitions cannot be improvisational
                  but have to come of their own accord; a definition that isn’t witty is worthless,
                  and there are an infinite number of real definitions for every individual. The necessary
                  formalizations/formalities [<em>Förmlichkeiten</em>] of the philosophy of art degenerate into etiquette and luxury. As a way of verifying
                  and testing virtuosity, these latter qualities have their purpose and value, like
                  the bravura arias of singers and the Latin prose of philologists. Also they make a
                  considerable rhetorical impression. But the main point is that one knows something
                  and that one says it. To want to prove or even explain it is in most cases wholly
                  unnecessary. The categorical style of the laws of the twelve tablets and the thetical
                  method, where we find set down the pure facts of reflection without concealment, adulteration,
                  or artificial distortion, like texts for the study of symphilosophy, are still the
                  most appropriate for a studied natural philosophy. In a case where one has both to
                  propose and prove something, it’s indisputably more difficult to propose than to prove.
                  There are lots of formally splendid proofs for perverse and platitudinous propositions.
                  Leibniz proposed and Wolff proved. Need one say more? [<em>Das ist genug gesagt</em>.] (<em>Fragments</em> 27-28)’</span><span class="quote">‘Die Demonstrationen der Philosophie sind eben Demonstrationen im Sinne der militärischen
                  Kunstsprache. Mit den Deduktionen steht es auch nicht besser wie mit den politischen;
                  auch in den Wissenschaften besetzt man erst ein Terrain, und beweist dann hinterdrein
                  sein Recht daran. Auf die Definitionen läßt sich anwenden, was Chamfort von den Freunden
                  sagte, die man so in der Welt hat. Es gibt drei Arten von Erklärungen in der Wissenschaft:
                  Erklärungen, die uns ein Licht oder einen Wink geben; Erklärungen, die nichts erklären;
                  und Erklärungen, die alles verdunkeln. Die rechten Definitionen lassen sich gar nicht
                  aus dem Stegreife machen, sondern müssen einem von selbst kommen; eine Definition
                  die nicht witzig ist, taugt nichts, und von jedem Individuum gibt es doch unendlich
                  viele reale Definitionen. Die notwendigen Förmlichkeiten der Kunstphilosophie arten
                  aus in Etikette und Luxus. Als Legitimation und Probe der Virtuosität haben sie ihren
                  Zweck und Wert, wie die Bravourarien der Sänger, und das Lateinschreiben der Philologen.
                  Auch machen sie nicht wenig rhetorischen Effekt. Die Hauptsache aber bleibt doch immer,
                  daß man etwas weiß, und daß man es sagt. Es beweisen oder gar erklären wollen, ist
                  in den meisten Fällen herzlich überflüssig. Der kategorische Styl der Gesetze der
                  zwölf Tafeln, und die thetische Methode, wo die reinen Fakta der Reflexion ohne Verhüllung,
                  Verdünnung und künstliche Verstellung wie Texte für das Studium oder die Symphilosophie

               it is not obvious whether his reflections on these terms will prove more substantial
               if the words are pulled arbitrarily from the dictionary or invoked in a scholarly
               flourish as part of the core legacy of his rationalist predecessor. As the fragment

               particularly when it comes to the string of near-but-not-so-near synonyms for <em>Philosophie</em> or <em>Wissenschaft</em>, including <em>Kunstphilosophie</em>, <em>Symphilosophie</em>, and <em>Naturphilosophie</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of regressive series abound in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, where Kant at one point attempts to distinguish <em>regressus in infinitum</em> from <em>regressus in indefinitum</em> (A514/B542). Kant specifically addresses the infinite analysis of the infinite complexity
               of individual contingencies with his claims about the regulative rather than constitutive
               nature of the ideas of reason. He argues that a constitutive idea would be akin to
               Leibniz’s divine comprehension and that to have access to “the absolute totality of
               the series of conditions,” one must mistakenly attribute objective reality to an idea
               that is actually only a rule (A509/B537).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century letters, wit designated a kind of cunning or
               cleverness distinguished by the ability to make surprising connections or unexpectedly
               illuminating associations. For Schlegel, it also has a lighter side. “Reason suffers,”
               he writes, but wit is “free” and “thoroughly playful” (<em>Kritische Ausgabe</em> XII: 393, my translation). Of course, wit’s characteristic flash of insight—what
               Schlegel describes as a “lightning bolt from the unconscious world”—is also frightening,
               for it is not so much a question of deciding whether or not to make use of wit as
               of surrendering to its designs, which may not be our own (393, my translation). As
               August Wilhelm Schlegel maintains in <em>Athenaeum</em> fragment 106: “You must consider that man wittiest who is witty not merely without
               intending to be so, but actually against his own intention” (<em>Fragments </em>30).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               a real definition of the individual shows that the possibility of defining that individual
               is also the impossibility of defining it insofar as such a definition would have to
               be a finite proposition. Each of the infinitely many real definitions of the individual
               is both infinitely complete and infinitely incomplete—or rather, each of the infinitely
               many real definitions of an individual is witty in that it is absolutely unrelated
               to any of the other real definitions of that individual and nonetheless potentially
               contradicts their claims to define. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               if you like, that is entirely free of exogenous pressures. According to the <em>Grimm</em>, the original meaning of <em>Willkür</em> was “freie Wahl oder Entschließung”; by the early nineteenth century, it had begun
               to acquire the negative connotation of “despotism” it has today, e.g., the tyrant
               is the individual who can decide at his whim to spare or execute someone. This last
               connotation plays an important role in Schlegel’s “Essay on Republicanism.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">The core provocation of this perversity seems to lie in the narrator’s claim that
               it compels us to act “for the reason that we should <em>not</em>”; it is “the tendency to do wrong for the wrong’s sake” (827). This is not an anti-moralistic
               or outright nihilistic impulse; in the narrator’s terms, both would constitute a reaction
               to something rather than being, as he repeatedly insists this perversity is, a purely
               primal impulse. The challenge, then, is to conceive of this perversion as the first
               term of a causal sequence. It is not that we confront a norm—the reasonable, the logical,
               the morally upstanding—from which it is then possible to deviate; rather it is only
               in virtue of this distortion or corruption that a norm is made manifest at all. If
               one does not insist on this paradoxical point, then “for the sake of”—whether it is
               “right for the sake of right” or “wrong for the sake of wrong”—may still be implicated
               in a standard of usefulness, part of an evaluation of how well something makes use
               of itself.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">Throughout “The Imp of the Perverse,” the elaborate interweaving of philosophical,
               medical, and psychological jargons, often with a polylinguistic flair, keeps the tone
               light, if not outright humorous. The narrator moves without comment between the tenets
               of phrenology and “metaphysicianism”; his discussion touches on the <em>a priori</em> and the <em>a posteriori</em> while confronting various principles, sentiments, and logical schemas; and he hunts
               after a “<em>mobile</em> without motive” and “a motive not <em>motivirt</em> [sic]” (827, emphasis in original). In many sections, the narrator appears to take
               it for granted that we all have the same philosophy of action, and he is explicitly
               self-reflexive about his argumentative tactics, constantly identifying his presuppositions
               and showing how he draws inferences from them: “Through [this impulse’s] promptings
               we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction
               in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings
               we act, for the reason that we should <em>not</em>” (827, emphasis in original).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
