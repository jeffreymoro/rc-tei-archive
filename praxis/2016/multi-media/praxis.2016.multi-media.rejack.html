               media specifically with respect to Lord Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> (1819-1824). The essay’s primary contention is that OOO provides a conceptual stance
               well-suited to reveal some of the early media-ontological speculations performed in,
               around, and through <em>Don Juan</em>. This object-oriented ontology of media, rooted in Romantic-era texts, also provides
               us with tools for analyzing our current media ecology.</p>

                  <p>As I compose this paragraph on an Apple laptop projected through a 27-inch LED monitor,
                     on my desk next to these objects sits a cardboard virtual reality viewer with a smartphone
                     tucked inside it. On a shelf behind me lie boxes containing several antiquated gaming
                     consoles, a smattering of game cartridges, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol required
                     to clean decades of disuse off the connector pins and thereby coax the games back
                     to life. Surely we mean items like these when we us the term “multi-media.” Why, then,
                     am I arguing for a multi-media Romanticism through the case of Lord Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> (1819-1824)? <em>Don Juan</em> certainly enables engagement with the broader nineteenth-century media ecology, as
                     others have demonstrated.

                              through the underground radical press and its correlative pornographic print industry
                              (and particularly the connection between Don Juan’s harem cantos and pornographic
                              representations of the harem in visual culture). Both Tom Mole and Ghislaine McDayter
                              demonstrate the crucial role of visual culture (and of the broader media ecology of
                              the Romantic era) to Byron’s status as and negotiation of celebrity. Many others have
                              also examined Byron’s place in the specifically literary print arena. To name only

                     </div> In this essay, however, I develop a vocabulary for describing the multiplicity of
                     a singular medium: print (even though to call it singular belies its assemblage-like
                     nature and its capacity to remediate other objects into its regime). My broader aim
                     is to demonstrate the complexity of thought around notions of media and mediation
                     displayed by Romantic-era writers. It would be naïve to assert that nineteenth-century
                     print matches our modern communications technologies when it comes to relative degrees
                     of multiplicity and complexity of mediation. Even so, I adopt a speculative attitude
                     in order to leave room for the possibility that we might not yet fully know a medium’s
                     capacities; by attending to earlier interventions in media practice and theory, we
                     might encounter new ones.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>So why <em>Don Juan</em>? Even though the Romantic era did not produce a fully developed notion of media theory,
                     nor a clearly articulated definition of “medium” as a technological communicative
                     apparatus, that does not preclude the possibility that those using, creating, and
                     speculating on instantiations of different media were engaged in complex ways.

                     </div> The discourse around <em>Don Juan</em>, in particular, shows a wide range of that complexity. The poem’s forms of mediation
                     accounted for as much of its reception as did its scandalous content. John Gibson
                     Lockhart, in <em>John Bull’s Letter to Lord Byron </em>(1821), draws attention to this fact when describing the poem’s appearance and impact:
                     “Every body poring over the wicked smiling face of Don Juan,—pirated duo-decimo competing
                     it all over the island with furtive quarto” (83-4). Because John Murray would not
                     acknowledge himself as the poem’s publisher, piracies flooded the market.

                              Juan piracies as well as on Murray’s various editions. Murray’s reluctance to acknowledge
                              himself as the publisher stemmed from his concern that the poem would be deemed blasphemous
                              or seditious, which would render him liable for prosecution and strip him of any copyright

                     </div> are clearly understood by the <em>Quarterly</em> reviewer (believed to be Robert Southey) who writes, “‘Don Juan’ in quarto and on
                     hot-pressed paper would have been almost innocent—in a whity-brown duodecimo it was
                     one of the worst of the mischievous publications that have made the press a snare”
                     (“Cases” 128). Engagement with the complexity of nineteenth-century media is also
                     one of Byron’s frequent moves in the poem. Its founding impulse emerges from Byron’s
                     attention to the contingencies of paper. <em>Don Juan</em> begins with the poet seeking out a new hero in the pages of contemporary newsprint,
                     and Byron frequently performs other self-reflexive tropes, as when he ends Canto I
                     with the famous borrowing—and mockery—of Southey’s lines bidding the “‘little book’”
                     (1.222.1769) to go out into the world in search of “gentle reader[s]! and / Still
                     gentler purchaser[s]!” (1.221.1761-2).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Indeed, that self-reflexivity is arguably the poem’s most consistent feature, particularly
                     as it relates to the materiality of the media ecology from which it emerges and into
                     which Byron serially casts it. Byron’s sense of mediation insists on the poem’s contingency,
                     its uncertainty, and its correspondence with speculation. Paper—one readily identifiable
                     medial substrate of the poem—exudes a lively variability, which contributes to the
                     multiplicity of the poem’s mediation. As Byron repeatedly jokes about the fate of
                     “uncertain paper” (1.218.1738), his poem, thanks in part to its wide availability
                     in pirated form, could have easily found a second life lining a trunk (“the next time
                     their servants tie on / Behind their carriages their new portmanteau, / Perhaps it
                     may be lined with this my canto” [2.16.126-8]), as culinary wrapping paper (“What,
                     must I go to the oblivious cooks? / Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?”
                     [4.108.861-2]), or perhaps worse, as a “rare deposit” discovered “In digging the foundation
                     of a closet” (3.89.807-8), a metonymic association which, we might say, in the paronomastic
                     spirit of <em>Don Juan</em>, links literary posterity with the paper needs of the posterior.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But I digress. In pointing toward the poem’s self-reflexivity about its material manifestations,
                     I raise a familiar, fundamental issue for literary studies: the relation between text
                     and physical object. In particular for literary critics engaging with book and media
                     history, this question remains central. In nineteenth-century literary studies, we
                     see such efforts in recent books by Andrew Piper and Leah Price, both of whom argue
                     that to understand books as objects, we need to attend to how writers from the period
                     imaginatively represent books and the interactions they afford. Byron in general,
                     and <em>Don Juan</em> in particular, offer bountiful material for querying what it means for a poem and
                     a book to exist in 1819. In what follows, I suggest that object-oriented ontology
                     (OOO) provides a conceptual stance well-suited to reveal some of the early media-ontological
                     speculations performed in, around, and through <em>Don Juan</em>. Following an overview of OOO and my reading of it in relation to media studies,
                     I offer analyses of how <em>Don Juan</em> interrogates two media objects essential to its existence: paper and ink. In so doing,
                     I suggest that despite its complicated relationship with materialism, OOO nonetheless
                     equips us with tools for rethinking the materiality of media—a necessarily multiple
                     materiality—in the Romantic era and beyond.

                              Harman insists throughout his work on his adherence to realism in opposition to materialism.
                              Levi Bryant, however, has begun to distance himself from the OOO label, calling his
                              most recent work “machine-oriented ontology” (Onto-Cartography 15), and in the process

                     </div> OOO was christened by Graham Harman, who, along with Levi Bryant and Timothy Morton,
                     forms the core group of OOO practitioners. OOO is a subset of the broader Speculative
                     Realist movement, first dubbed as such at a workshop held in 2007 (titled simply,
                     “Speculative Realism: A One-Day Workshop”), which featured talks by Harman, Ray Brassier,
                     Iain Hamilton Grant, and Quentin Meillassoux. The loose grouping of Speculative Realists
                     is held together by their shared rejection of what Meillassoux terms “correlationism,”
                     the tendency in post-Kantian philosophy to investigate only the correlation between
                     being and thought, never being itself.

                     </div> The OOO answer to correlationism is to affirm the existence of objects apart from
                     relations and to insist on objects’ “withdrawal” (the term that Harman, in <em>Tool-Being</em> [2002], adapts from Heidegger’s tool analysis from <em>Being and Time</em> [1927]). OOO is speculative in that it affirms the being of objects but not their
                     presence to us, to other objects, or to themselves. In a formulation similar to Meillassoux’s,
                     Harman claims that “contrary to the dominant assumption of philosophy since Kant,
                     the true chasm in ontology lies not between humans and the world, but between <em>objects and relations</em>” (<em>Tool-Being</em> 2). What emerges from this recognition, as Harman puts it in <em>Guerilla Metaphysics</em> (2005), is the centrality of withdrawal: “Object-oriented philosophy has a single
                     basic tenet: the withdrawal of objects from all perceptual and causal relations” (20).
                     Objects only ever enter into relations through some form of translation, which means
                     that relation never exposes the essence of the object. And this truth applies to relations
                     with humans (as when a human reads a poem by translating “a small drop of ink” into
                     a “lasting link / Of ages” [3.88.793, 797-8]), and also to relations between non-human
                     objects (as when an aeolian harp translates the wind into song).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As suggested by the focus on causality in Morton’s <em>Realist Magic</em> (2013), OOO offers great insight on how objects come to interact with one another
                     despite their mutual conditions of withdrawal. If objects ontologically withdraw from
                     full presence, then the work of speculative philosophy means exploring how these “vacuum-sealed”
                     entities (Harman, <em>Guerilla Metaphysics</em> 2) communicate, correspond, or otherwise enter into relation. That focus on relation
                     ports smoothly into media studies, particularly to help think through the relation
                     between the fraught terms, book and text—or, put another way, the relation between
                     the mediating object and the object mediated. This has been and continues to be a
                     pressing question for book and media history. For instance, in <em>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</em> (2004), William St Clair notes that “when we have reconstructed the production, access,
                     sales, and readerships of the materiality of books [. . .] our best resource for understanding
                     the impact of the reading of the literature of the romantic period may be the literature
                     itself” (412). Or to pose the issue more succinctly via Andrew Piper, “Literature
                     makes books as much as books make literature” (11). This claim applies especially
                     to the Romantic era since books were still relatively fluid cultural objects. As Ina
                     Ferris and Paul Keen note in their introduction to <em>Bookish Histories</em> (2009), “[print] remained visible as a medium, palpable [. . .]. Books were not the
                     taken-for-granted objects they would soon become” (5). St Clair, Piper, and Ferris
                     and Keen all demonstrate that how Romantic readers (and how we) understand a given
                     book, or the book, connects intimately with how we understand the literary (or non-literary)
                     objects that come into being through books. From an OOO perspective, a poem is an
                     object, and it exists independently of its particular material instantiations. Of
                     course, this notion is nothing new to literary scholars—one thinks of F. W. Bateson’s
                     famous question, as paraphrased by James McLaverty: “If the <em>Mona Lisa </em>is in the Louvre, where are <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Lycidas</em>?” (82). But OOO would also add that the gap between poem and its appearance to us
                     in different mediated forms is not some trick of textuality but the condition of being
                     itself. All objects withdraw, not just poems whose existence cannot be reduced to
                     their bibliographic histories. An object-oriented media studies can therefore investigate
                     object relations that extend into realms we might not typically see with a solely
                     textual focus.

                              chemicals, and other things involved in media are considered as essential to media
                              history and archaeology” (25). Parikka’s focus rests primarily on contemporary computational
                              media, and although I do not develop such an approach at length here, I do suggest
                              that an object-oriented ontology of media offers the potential to perform such explorations
                              with respect to older forms of mediation as well.</span></div>
                     </div> To employ that claim in Byronic terms, such an approach enables our critical Muses

                  <p>As such, an object-oriented ontology of media enables us to see media from their side
                     as well as from ours. In the case of books, it helps us to imagine, as Price does
                     in her reading of it-narratives, “how accounts of print culture would look different
                     if narrated from the point of view not of human readers and users, but of the book”
                     (“From <em>The History</em>” 120). Book history’s fundamental premise, as D. F. McKenzie claims, is that “[i]t
                     can, in short, show the human presence in any recorded text” (29). But in order to
                     understand what it means to come into contact with a book, or with a human presence
                     through a book, we need first to understand the object and the nature of its object
                     relations. Though it may seem counterintuitive, I contend that we can better conceive
                     of the human presence in books if we first attend to how they exist in their strange
                     bookishness, how they enlist many non-human agents in order to exist.

                     mode of appearing in that medium. An object-oriented media studies thus affirms the
                     existence of media objects and their irreducibility to their qualities or relations.
                     The result is a greater capacity to account for qualities or relations of which we
                     may be unaware but which may emerge through unforeseen contingencies. Typically in
                     book history and media studies, analysis of book/media objects focuses on subject-object
                     relations (e.g., between human subject and book/media object, as in H. J. Jackson’s
                     study of Romantic-era marginalia), or on object-object relations (e.g., the relations
                     between books and the other objects which make up the systems of print circulation,
                     as in McKenzie’s “sociology of texts,” or Robert Darnton’s similar “communications
                     circuit”). Eugene Thacker, in theorizing what he calls “dark media,” suggests that
                     we shift away from those models and instead attend to object-thing relations.

                     </div> Such a method would interrogate media as paradoxical mixtures of intentional objects-for-us
                     and things-in-themselves that resist full access from any other beings—human or otherwise.
                     Dark media demonstrate more clearly what is true of all media: that they withdraw
                     from full access even when hinting at their existence through particular qualities
                     and appearances. When we theorize mediation, we must contend with the deeply inhuman
                     core of those media objects to which we ascribe so much human presence. Media objects
                     benefit from an object-oriented position precisely because it’s all too easy to locate
                     their essences <em>as</em> mediums in the emergent properties of their uses for us. It may seem odd to imagine
                     a book apart from the human actions that brought it into being, or the intentions
                     humans had for it, or the uses to which humans put it. Yet, an object-oriented media
                     studies calls for just that, and we can do so by entertaining Byron’s speculations
                     on the non-human elements of mediation in <em>Don Juan</em>.</p>

               <p>Paper is a speculative material. We speculate on it, with it, and through it. And
                  it remains subject to ever more instances of speculation, or as Byron phrases it in
                  <em>Don Juan</em>, it remains always “uncertain,” always poised between existing as communicative medium
                  and as mere material object (“a rag like this” [3.88.799]). As such, paper brings
                  to light the complex temporality inherent to any act of mediation, which can be posed
                  in the form of Craig Dworkin’s question in <em>No Medium</em> (2013): “was the paper you are holding already a medium before it was brought together
                  with the ink?” (29). To ponder the answer to that question is to pursue an ontology
                  of media. Dworkin turns to a process-based answer when he asserts that “[media] are
                  not things, but rather activities” (28). As I discussed above, OOO refutes process
                  (or activity, flow, relation, etc.) as a ground for ontology. Following that refutation,
                  we find in Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> an approach to mediation which likewise insists on “things” over “activities.” In
                  the next two sections, I’ll briefly read Byron’s engagements with mediation through
                  the two objects mentioned in Dworkin’s question: paper and ink.</p>

                  <p>While we tend to think of paper as an inert substance awaiting the variable accidents
                     of new and true poetic attempts, Byron’s poem repeatedly poses paper as itself an
                     agential object. He writes to Murray a month after the publication of <em>Don Juan</em>: “I <em>have</em> no plan—I <em>had</em> no plan—but I have or had materials” (<em>Letters </em>207). Of course, Byron here means <em>source</em> materials or ideas, but this comment should nonetheless suggest to us that Byron’s
                     poetics embraces the contingency of matter. Paper functions as an insistently material
                     presence, though one with a vitality we tend not to associate with material objects
                     like fused bits of cloth.

                              (23). In referring to paper’s “vitality,” I have in mind something akin to Jane Bennett’s
                              account in Vibrant Matter (2010) of the agency of things outside of human control.</span></div>
                     </div> From early in the poem, and throughout its development, Byron’s paper moves. Or in
                     OOO terms, it withdraws, escaping full apprehension and only showing itself and its
                     powers in partial, translated manners. Toward the end of Canto I, in one of Byron’s
                     many digressions about the nature of fame, paper’s materiality first surfaces with
                     “the end of fame” amounting to nothing more than a spatial concern: “’tis but to fill
                     / A certain portion of uncertain paper” (1.218.1737-8). As he is “born for opposition”
                     (15.22.176), it comes as no surprise that Byron employs “certain” in its two oppositional
                     senses: the “certain portion” refers to an undetermined or unspecified amount (and
                     thus, a not very certain portion after all), and then the “uncertain paper” calls
                     to mind the opposite meaning (fixed, determined, stable), though here negated by the
                     prefix.

                              he writes that Laura “was not old, nor young, nor at the years / Which certain people
                              call a ‘certain age,’ / Which yet the most uncertain age appears” (22.169-71). A similar
                              joke recurs in Don Juan: “A lady of a ‘certain age,’ which means / Certainly aged”
                              (6.69.546-7).</span></div>
                     </div> Fame, then, requires a certain—that is to say, an unknown—amount of material production,
                     which resides in an object whose stability is likewise suspect. Paper must be acted
                     upon by willful agents, but that control over paper is compromised by the material’s
                     own particularities. In this case paper’s instability primarily results from change
                     over time, but it possesses synchronic as well as diachronic uncertainty. Although
                     the latter sense is more apparent, Byron at least gestures toward paper’s lively materiality
                     with the rhyming words, “vapour” and “taper,” a trio employed three more times across
                     the poem. The vapour appears in another metaphor for fame (that of walking up a hill
                     “lost in vapour” [1.218.1740]), but the echoing of paper with a seemingly immaterial
                     substance rhetorically heightens the changeability of the former. And the “taper,”
                     which metonymically stands in for literary production (“bards burn[ing] what they
                     call their ‘midnight taper’” [1.218.1742]), also reminds us that the paper medium
                     requires additional material supports (such as light, ink, quill, etc.). Paper and
                     taper are etymologically as well as sonically linked, both coming from “papyrus,”

                     fibers) assembled for the purposes of writing and printing. Through the ottava rima
                     form’s particular affordances, the linking of paper/vapour/taper encourages us to
                     consider paper’s multiplicity and variability even as it exists in a single moment.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Given that the first instance of the paper/taper rhyme occurs just twenty stanzas
                  earlier, as Julia composes her farewell letter to Juan, it’s worth linking the two
                  passages and their approaches to paper as a medium. The narrator informs us that “This
                  note was written upon gilt-edged paper / With a neat crow-quill.” As Julia uses a
                  candle to seal the letter, “Her small white fingers scarce could reach the taper.”
                  The seal itself, with its “white cornelian” and its motto reading “‘<span class="foreign">Elle vous suit partout</span>,’” functions as another layering of mediation with text inscribed in wax sealing
                  in text upon “gilt-edged paper” (1.198.1577-9, 1582-3). And Julia (or at least her
                  letter) does indeed follow Juan everywhere for a time, as the paper (and Juan) travels
                  to sea to begin Canto II. Byron undoes the sincerity of Julia’s composition with Juan’s
                  nauseous response to his reading of it (helped along by the lurching of the ship).
                  After Juan’s reading of the letter, it appears once more after the shipwreck but only
                  for its material substrate: “At length the lots were torn up, and prepared, / But
                  of materials that much shock the Muse— / Having no paper, for the want of better,
                  / They took by force from Juan Julia’s letter” (2.74.589-92). Paper at first functions
                  as the medium for Julia’s sincere outpouring of feeling, but even so its significance
                  depends on the quality of the paper, the wax seal, and the motto. And then in its
                  final form (as lots to decide which shipwrecked survivor will be eaten), the paper
                  signifies a death sentence for “poor Pedrillo” (2.77.616)—there being essentially
                  no distinction between the content and the medium. The paper in this final instance
                  carries meaning only through its dimensions relative to other bits of rag. We might
                  recall here the <em>Quarterly Review</em> distinguishing between a proper “‘Don Juan’ in quarto and on hot-pressed paper” and
                  the smaller, lesser quality “whity-brown duodecimo,” which renders the poem so potentially
                  dangerous. As Andrew Franta writes of the scene, the focus on the “materials that
                  much shock the Muse” suggests that Byron “offers a proleptic acknowledgment of the
                  reading public’s outraged response to the eating of Juan’s tutor, Pedrillo” (52).
                  Moreover, the emphasis on “materials” points toward the physical media responsible
                  for conveying the poem’s “shocking” content. Again, Byron demonstrates the potential
                  of the paper medium to acquire agential force. Any attempt to account for the poem
                  and its significance thus requires attention to the relations into which it enters
                  via multiple modes of mediation. To return to the language of OOO, the poem exists,
                  but it also withdraws from full presence, only ever showing glimmers of itself through
                  the different material media that make it possible and which Byron figures into his
                  poetics. Even though Byron claims in <em>Don Juan</em> to “rattle on exactly as I’d talk / With any body in a ride or walk” (15.19.151-2),
                  his attention to the materiality of composition and printing demonstrates that his
                  poetic process emerges from his acute awareness of the movement from speech to writing
                  and from writing to print. And his poetic treatment of paper is crucial for understanding
                  those processes.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Inky Objects</span></h2>
               <p>As seen in the shipwreck episode or in the references to reused paper, the medium
                  does not require written or printed content for it to matter significantly. But paper
                  acquires particular powers when brought into contact with another object of interest
                  to Byron: ink. In one of Byron’s most famous statements on the nature of literary
                  fame, he begins with an optimistic notion of literary production and dissemination:
                  “But words are things, and a small drop of ink, / Falling like dew, upon a thought,
                  produces / That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think” (3.88.793-5). Byron
                  supposes that an ostensibly minor material intervention (“a small drop of ink”) has
                  the potential to influence greatly that which is known and thought. “Words are things”
                  at least in part because of their material carriers. Ink is not merely subordinate
                  to discourse but, rather, intimately connected (materially as well as sonically via
                  the ink/think rhyme) with the mental activity we tend to view as the primary mover
                  of cultural production. Writing and printing also appear superior to the more immaterial
                  act of speech (working as it does through the evanescent mediums of “vapour” and air):
                  “’Tis strange, the shortest letter which man uses / Instead of speech, may form a
                  lasting link / Of ages” (3.88.796-8). Prefiguring a later passage in the poem which
                  similarly pits the materials of literary production against human thought (“’Tis strange
                  the mind, that very fiery particle, / Should let itself be snuffed out by an Article”
                  [11.60.79-80]), Byron begins to mourn the human reliance on the vagaries of matter.
                  The stanza’s final lines intensify that feeling of regret, but they also offer potential
                  consolation, as the poet turns from ink back to paper: “to what straits old Time reduces
                  / Frail man, when paper—even a rag like this, / Survives himself, his tomb, and all
                  that’s his” (3.88.798-800). The human body and paper share a common frailty, and yet
                  the greater durability of the latter offers the potential to make up for the former’s
                  rapid movement toward “dust” (3.89.801). But the “rag like this” reminds us again
                  that paper is “uncertain,” that it involves change, and that it ultimately withdraws
                  from any full presence to other objects. Paper is nothing but rag, but it is not <em>only</em> rag. The poem to which Byron refers exists apart from, even as it relies on, any
                  single, stable paper substrate.</p>
               <p>Of course, even if paper lasts long enough to secure some semblance of fame for the
                  person responsible for sending that rag out into the world, fame may not persist in
                  a true form (as with “some dull MS” Byron imagines being recovered from “oblivion”
                  in the next stanza [3.89.805]). Byron explores this concern repeatedly while discussing
                  newspapers’ lists of soldiers killed in combat. Newspapers, of course, are defined
                  by their ephemerality. They must present that which is new, and they must do so serially
                  (whether daily, weekly, etc.). “[M]odern fame” moves at such speed that “ere the ink
                  be dry,” the newspapers move on to the next story (13.51.402, 405). Byron thus pits
                  the “poet’s page” (1.5.36) against the gazettes with their lists of the dead, which
                  are at best well-intentioned but flawed. As Daniel Hitchens suggests about Byron’s
                  attitudes toward misprints, Byron takes seriously the notion that “poets should feel
                  as great a responsibility as they would if they were at war,” and they thus “ought
                  to be wary of hastiness, of textual mistakes, omissions, misprints” (139). What matters
                  for Byron, according to Hitchens, is “the weight of detail, digression, anecdote and
                  inconsistency” (140) in contrast with history, which “can only take things in the
                  gross” (8.3.17). Hitchens connects that use of “gross” with Byron’s couplet about
                  the soldier “whose loss / Was printed <em>Grove</em>, although his name was Grose” (8.18.143-4). Nothing but “a small drop of ink” separates
                  Grove from Grose. Byron’s poem, with its embrace of contradiction, change, digression,
                  and detail strives to correct such inky mistakes, but it also opens itself up to other
                  inevitable new ones, particularly since the poem appeared in so many guises with varied
                  levels of stability and authenticity. The fluidity of ink means that it is rooted
                  in and leads to further change. Poets are similarly fluid with their feeling, as “they
                  are such liars, / And take all colours—like the hands of dyers” (3.87.791-2). Instead
                  of rejecting or condemning that fluidity, however, Byron accepts contradiction and
                  opposition: “But if a writer should be quite consistent, / How could he possibly show
                  things existent?” (15.87.695-6). Ink matters for poetry precisely because it dwells
                  both in (withdrawn) existence and in inconsistency (variable processes).</p>
               <p>If, as Siegfried Zielinski writes, “Media are spaces of action for constructed attempts
                  to connect what is separated” (5), then the meeting of paper and ink is one space
                  where such attempts seek to connect a variety of separated things. But as Alexander
                  Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark argue in <em>Excommunication</em> (2013), “non-media always lurk at the threshold of media” (11). Rag and paper, drops
                  of ink and words—the objects through which we attempt to connect what is separated
                  also contain within themselves a fundamental alterity, which insists that no separation
                  is ever entirely overcome. We’ve known at least since Robert Hooke’s <em>Micrographia</em> (1665) that the meeting of inked type and paper (the essential process of the print
                  medium) is not always entirely as it appears. What looks to unaided human eyes as
                  a circular full stop featuring stable rounded edges appears with the help of a microscope
                  as <a class="link_ref" href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015020857309;view=1up;seq=45">ragged and irregular</a>, like “<em>smutty daubings</em>” or “a great splatch of <em>London</em> dirt” (3). When ink meets paper, the two objects enter into a fluid aesthetic dance—one
                  in which ink bleeds into paper, and paper receives ink, in unpredictable ways. The
                  two objects enter into relation, but they do so only through their particular mechanisms
                  of translating one another. We see the objects not for what they are but for how they
                  affect and allude to one another. Mediation, by definition an attempt to overcome
                  separation, only ever alludes to those separated things. Mediation is predicated on
                  absence, but that does not mean mediation accomplishes nothing. Byron clearly recognizes
                  the potential for paper, ink, and humans to interact with and affect other existing
                  objects. But his approach to mediation in <em>Don Juan</em> continually recognizes the reality of contingency and the necessary agency of non-human
                  objects.</p>
               <p>So that I might “end at least with the beginning” (13.73.584), I’ll turn for a moment
                  to <em>Beppo: A Venetian Story</em> (1818), which is where <em>Don Juan</em> arguably has its beginning. In addition to the former poem supplying the latter with
                  its stanzaic form, both poems share a focus on the materiality of media. In <em>Beppo</em> Byron speaks of hating “an author that’s <em>all author</em>, fellows / In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink” (75.593-4), a formulation which
                  merges the body of the human author with the non-human objects (paper and ink) responsible
                  for making authors. Earlier in the poem he offers another connection between clothing
                  and the cloth so crucial to the print medium, when he compares Laura’s beauty to an
                  image from a “frontispiece of a new Magazine, [. . .] / Coloured, and silver paper
                  leav’d between / That and the title-page, for fear the press / Should soil with parts
                  of speech the parts of dress” (57.452, 454-6). As is true of the simplest printed
                  mark in Hooke’s <em>Micrographia</em>, ink here bleeds into paper of its own accord. Writers, publishers, and readers can
                  merely and futilely attempt to maintain the separation of language and materiality.
                  We might put this truth in more positive terms by connecting it to Byron’s desire
                  to capture truth and reality in his poem, which he poses in contrast to the “cant”
                  that he saw characterizing the spirit of the age. For Byron, poetic truth emerges
                  out of an approach to materiality which leaves behind the illusion of total discursive
                  control. The reference to “parts of speech” and “parts of dress” subtly reminds readers
                  that when they encounter speech translated into writing or print, such language is
                  conveyed on the parts of dress (i.e., rags turned into paper). But dress is not mere
                  brute materiality: it involves arrangement, form, and shape. Dress is aesthetic. It
                  requires discourse and materiality as well as the productive tensions emerging from
                  their collision. <em>Beppo</em> ends not so much when the discursive gives up on making material interventions, as
                  when the material refuses to accommodate the discursive any longer: “My pen is at
                  the bottom of a page, / Which being finished, here the story ends; / ’Tis to be wished
                  it had been sooner done, / But stories somehow lengthen when begun” (99.789-92). The
                  story “slips for ever through [the poet’s] fingers” (63.498), lengthening with a desire
                  of its own by entering into relation with other material objects. The discursive can
                  never leave behind the material, nor can it ever fully exhaust it. An object-oriented
                  ontology of <em>media</em> applies this logic specifically to communications media in order to refocus our critical
                  vision on media’s material resistance to discourse, culture, or pure formalism. Byron’s
                  attention to the instability of inky marks on paper translates the material reality
                  of mediation—presenting an unknowable absence—into aesthetic, discursive, and often
                  comic forms of signification. Ultimately it’s that probing of the relation between
                  the material and the discursive that an object-oriented ontology of media can assist
                  us in performing and which Byron’s poetics continue to instigate as we (“Why, I’m
                  Posterity—and so are you” [12.19.145]) take up his materials anew.</p>

                              As Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark write in Excommunication
                              (2013), with obvious fatigue from having made the point many times already, “So let’s

                     media? We see this question probed in several recent media studies projects which,
                     in different ways, tend to emphasize media as processes or activities rather than
                     as things or objects.

                     because they are not things, but rather activities” (28). While process ontologies,
                     such as Dworkin’s, productively illuminate the variability of media, they also risk
                     eliminating distinctions between things. If all is process, then any media object
                     can be <em>processed</em> into any other, like discrete bits of cow flesh rendered into pink slime. In borrowing
                     from OOO, media studies can make room for both the simultaneous plenitude of distinct
                     objects and their strange, processual variability by reversing Dworkin’s claim: media
                     are things, not activities. Media of course involve activities, but activities are
                     not the same as, and should not take priority over, the media objects themselves.

                     etc.). As I’ve discussed, <em>Don Juan</em> is particularly receptive to an object-oriented ontology of media since it exploits
                     the extent to which the existence of a media object is always multiple—not because
                     its existence is predicated upon a variety of activities, but because objects (such
                     as poems and paper and ink) withdraw from access.</p>

                     and to eliminate any variations that would upset the algorithmic machinery. As William
                     Blake wrestled with the machines of church and state, we now face media as the gardens
                     of love in which our joys and desires are bound in the briars of algorithmic reduction.
                     The rhetoric of process—which implies that activities (like data manipulation) are
                     all that matter—risks capitulating to such restriction. If we abandon the notion of
                     the irreducible existence of media and of other objects, if we focus instead on pure
                     flows and endless process as the things to which objects are reduced, and if we accept
                     that all objects and all media exist merely as different data configurations of the
                     same inert substance, then we embrace twenty-first-century global capitalism and its
                     fantasies of immaterial production. Even though a philosophy centered on objects may
                     seem to imply a dull, static materialism, OOO actually reveals the plenitude at the
                     core of all objects. In applying this logic to media, I do not claim that older media
                     are somehow more real or more physical than electronic media. The latter too have
                     equal claims on reality and materiality.

                     </div> But I resist the notion that we can ignore or transcend materiality (an attitude often
                     expressed with respect to computational media), and the reductionism of process-based
                     ontologies risks leading us down that path. If we go that route we’ll find nothing
                     more than the endless procession of the same dull round, to which we can only reply
                     as one: 
                     <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/multi-media/images/rejack-image1.png" alt="" class="inline"/></figure>. An object-oriented ontology of media shows us that, as in <em>Don Juan</em>—whose narrator claims, “my tale is / ‘De rebus cunctis et quibûsdam aliis’” (“Of
                     everything that is and a few other things besides” [16.3.23-4])—we benefit from speculating
                     beyond the everything that is.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For instance, Colette Colligan analyzes <em>Don Juan</em>’s (1819-1824) “unruly copies” circulating through the underground radical press and
               its correlative pornographic print industry (and particularly the connection between
               <em>Don Juan</em>’s harem cantos and pornographic representations of the harem in visual culture).
               Both Tom Mole and Ghislaine McDayter demonstrate the crucial role of visual culture
               (and of the broader media ecology of the Romantic era) to Byron’s status as and negotiation
               of celebrity. Many others have also examined Byron’s place in the specifically literary
               print arena. To name only a few: Jerome Christensen recognizes Byron’s strength as
               the ability to resist, while participating in, the commercial print market; Nicholas
               Mason demonstrates the pivotal role of advertising in creating the brand of Byron
               that Christensen characterizes; Mark Schoenfield examines Byron’s career-long preoccupation
               with doing battle in the trenches of periodical magazines and reviews; and William
               St Clair tracks Byron’s cultural impact as viewed through publication histories (“The
               Impact of Byron’s Writings”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               himself as the publisher stemmed from his concern that the poem would be deemed blasphemous
               or seditious, which would render him liable for prosecution and strip him of any copyright

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">For instance, see Timothy Morton’s <em>Realist Magic</em> (2013), in which he argues that materialism is merely a form of correlationism, the
               stance against which OOO argues (61-2). Graham Harman insists throughout his work
               on his adherence to realism in opposition to materialism. Levi Bryant, however, has
               begun to distance himself from the OOO label, calling his most recent work “machine-oriented
               ontology” (<em>Onto-Cartography</em> 15), and in the process he has advocated for a revival of materialism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Several scholars have in recent years brought Speculative Realism and/or OOO to bear
               on Romanticism (and the other way around as well). I’m indebted to them for the many
               insights I’ve gleaned from their conference papers, published arguments, and from
               the conversations shared with them at conferences and other events as I’ve developed
               my own thinking on the topic as presented here. Among these are: Greg Ellermann, with
               recent articles in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> (“Late Coleridge and the Life of Idealism”) and <em>SubStance</em> (“Speculative Romanticism”); Evan Gottlieb, who recently published an essay titled,
               “Seeing into the Life of Things: Re-Viewing Early Wordsworth through Object-Oriented
               Philosophy,” and whose monograph titled, <em>Romantic Realities: British Romanticism and Speculative Realism</em>, has just been published in the Speculative Realism series from Edinburgh University
               Press (unfortunately the book’s release came too late for me to consult it for this
               essay); Anne McCarthy, who has a forthcoming essay in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> which reads “Mont Blanc” through the work of Quentin Meillassoux; Aaron Ottinger,
               whose essay on Wordsworth, affect, and geometry situates the poet’s thinking in relation
               to the current “speculative turn”; Michele Speitz, who brilliantly combines a new
               formalist method with strains of new materialist thinking in “Catastrophe and Form;
               or, an Experiment in Formal Historicism”; and Chris Washington, who has offered compelling
               readings of Speculative Realism in two recent articles, “Byron’s Speculative Turn:
               Visions of Posthuman Life in <em>Cain</em>,” and “Romanticism and Speculative Realism.” This meeting of contemporary continental
               philosophy and Romantic studies, particularly in recent scholarly work, represents
               an exciting direction for the future of the field.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in media are considered as essential to media history and archaeology” (25). Parikka’s
               focus rests primarily on contemporary computational media, and although I do not develop
               such an approach at length here, I do suggest that an object-oriented ontology of
               media offers the potential to perform such explorations with respect to older forms
               of mediation as well.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               OOO made by Nathan Brown and others: that it amounts to nothing more than verbal and
               stylistic window-dressing on the firmer foundations of other, more fully consistent
               philosophical systems. Not being a philosopher, I have no stake in defending or attacking
               the viability of OOO as a philosophy. But, as <em>Don Juan</em> teaches us, “words are things” (3.88.793), and the value of developing and employing
               new conceptual vocabularies should not be overlooked, especially since as scholars
               and teachers, interventions in the materiality of language are our last and best hopes

         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">As should be apparent to readers of this <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> volume, Romanticist scholars in recent years have shown a surge of interest in rethinking
               media, particularly junior scholars like those of us gathered together in this volume.
               James Brooke-Smith and Andrew Burkett have both recently published articles on the
               topic, the former finding William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage engaged in a nascent
               “media theory in the absence of a <em>technological</em> media concept” (2), and the latter reading <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818, 1831) as a novel wrestling with the fraught connection between embodiment
               and information (a connection that Burkett links to N. Katherine Hayles’ work on the
               history of cybernetics, but one that has been less visible in studies of the long
               eighteenth century [584]). Like my colleagues also featured in this volume, I have
               found significant theoretical, methodological, and historical grounding in the following
               work: Miranda Burgess’s work on affect and the significance of mediation to eighteenth-
               and nineteenth-century models of sympathy; Kevis Goodman’s <em>Georgic Modernity </em>(2004), in which she approaches “the early history of contemporary media in relation
               to print culture” (10) by reading the georgic as the primary mode of mediating the
               affects of history in the long eighteenth century; Celeste Langan’s reading of Sir
               Walter Scott’s <em>Lay of the Last Minstrel </em>(1805), and how in that poem “the medium of print becomes recognizable <em>as</em> a medium” (70); Langan and Maureen McLane’s contention that “Romantic poetry might
               even serve as a synonym for what we mean by multimedia” (239); and Andrew Piper’s
               <em>Dreaming in Books </em>(2009), which demonstrates “how the history of books, and romantic books in particular,
               can help us contextualize our understanding of digital or new media today” (8). Many
               Romanticists are also <em>making</em> innovative digital work, not the least of which are <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/"><em>The Blake Archive</em></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.nines.org/s"><em>NINES</em></a>, two longstanding digital humanities projects which have spread their influence far
               beyond the purview of nineteenth-century studies. I also have in mind work like Paul
               Youngquist’s playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic Romantic Futurism,” an essay
               in the shape of hypertext fiction, in which he suggests that we might imagine <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/950.html">“criticism of Romanticism as a field of digital possibility,”</a> a realm where the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/190.html">hacker is the hero of “digital resistance,” analogous to the Romantics hacking textuality
                  in the nineteenth century</a>. Andrew Stauffer has especially broadened one area of digital possibility (digitization)
               with his call to arms for humanists to play a larger role in reckoning with the massive
               commercial digitization projects that have unfolded in the last decade. He insists
               that, in the digitizing and archiving of nineteenth-century texts, we ought to “use
               the digital environment not to supplant the paper record, but to develop a more nuanced
               critical method for understanding the physical forms and features of the papers that
               the Romantics left behind” (17), an insistence that Stauffer has supported with his
               recent “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.booktraces.org/">Book Traces</a>” project. In <em>A New Republic of Letters</em> (2014), Jerome McGann presents a compelling argument and model for how such future
               scholarly work will reckon with the reality that “the whole of our cultural inheritance
               has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures” (1).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">At this point, it almost goes without saying that the “new” of new media is problematic.
               As Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark write in <em>Excommunication</em> (2013), with obvious fatigue from having made the point many times already, “So let’s
               have no more talk about ‘new media’—as if we already knew everything about old media”
               (2). That caveat aside, it behooves me to recognize some of the specific ways in which
               scholars have resisted the uncritical deployment of the “new” in new media. Jay David
               Bolter and Richard Grusin argue that the “logics of remediation have a long history,”
               the opposite poles of hypermediacy and immediacy characterizing different aesthetic
               modes “from the Renaissance to the present day” in their analysis (21). Two anthologies,
               <em>New Media, 1740–1915</em> (2003) and <em>New Media, Old Media; A History and Theory Reader </em>(2006), demonstrate that already in the early 2000s there was significant desire to
               “[shift] from ‘what is new’ to what work the new does” (Chun 3). Lisa Gitelman’s <em>Always Already New</em> (2006) is rooted in that shift. She argues that “the introduction of new media [.
               . .] is never entirely revolutionary: new media are less points of epistemic rupture
               than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning as such”
               (6). Gitelman acknowledges in her approach a debt to media archaeology, a field that
               has surfaced in several recent literary-focused studies of media. A primary aim of
               the media archaeological approach, as Siegfried Zielinksi poses it, is to “not seek
               the old in the new, but find something new in the old” (3). Following that impulse,
               Lori Emerson pursues the task of “wield[ing] media archaeology as a conceptual knife
               that cuts into the present and the near future, not just [. . .] into the past” (2),
               one she accomplishes by tracing an aesthetic of the interface from Emily Dickinson,
               to mid-twentieth-century typewriter poetry, to various instances of contemporary new
               media art. Yohei Igarashi’s recent article in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> represents another merging of literary studies and media archaeology, although as
               he notes, his adoption of the method is tentative, recognizing the potential pitfalls
               of anachronism inherent to it (177-8).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
