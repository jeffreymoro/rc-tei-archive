      <div type="abstract">
        <p rend="noCount">In an effort to square today’s findings that Romantic poets are early media theorists with Raymond Williams’s older claim
          that Romantic poets were “poets or sociologists,” the essay reframes Percy Shelley’s writing—and even his sometimes obscure poetic style—as
          engaged in a cultural sociology alert to the aesthetics of imaginative media. Grounded in sociological thought from Romantic-era sciences of
          society to Émile Durkheim, “Shelley amid the Age of Separations” suggests that the problem of “Romantic media” does not ultimately involve
          greater or better connectedness but rather the feeling of social dissolution amid heightened infrastructural concentration. The essay
          concludes by reading <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> (1821) and some of Shelley’s other works as inquiries into how poetry might
          model a form of relationality fit for modern societies, an interaction that is neither principally commercial nor amatory.</p>

        </epigraph>
        <p>This volume, as the co-editors explain in their introduction, foregrounds the connection between new media and forms of social and
          intellectual organization during the Romantic era in England. While the term “media,” as we now know it, was not available until the
          later-nineteenth century (Guillory 321), media, multi-media, remediations, as well as media awarenesses and practices, and so on, are
          nowadays imputed to prior literary-historical periods, including Romanticism. What was or is especially Romantic about multi-mediality,
          then? Celeste Langan and Maureen N. McLane’s important essay, “The Medium of Romantic Poetry” adduces the period’s silent reading norms, the
          ballad revival, and “self-consciousness about the problem of poetry’s medium and the status of its mediation” (246), among other things.
          Overall, Langan and McLane’s essay makes a forceful case for “Romantic poetry as media theory” (256). Social organization, mentioned in this
          volume’s introduction, invokes another area of theoretical inquiry: sociology. But the relation between a “Romantic media theory” and a
          “Romantic sociology” is not immediately evident, even if it seems that it would have been difficult to think about “media” independent of
          that umbrella, “society,” howsoever imaginary or occult.<note place="foot" resp="editors"><p rend="noCount">I thank Suzanne Barnett, Michael
              Gamer, Kate Singer, and Chris Washington, as well as the co-editors of this volume, for sharing with me their responses to an earlier
              version of this essay.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Christopher Herbert’s readings of a variety of canonical social scientific works demonstrate how theories of culture or
              society as a “complex whole” resort to “fantastical imagery of invisible forces and frameworks” (15) of relation. In a section that is
              pertinent here, Herbert shows that although Adam Smith in “The History of Astronomy” is alert to the magical connections (“inventions of
              the imagination”) on which systems depend, he relies on the same kind of fictional, invisible links in <title level="m">The Theory of
                Moral Sentiments </title>(1759) (i.e., custom and sympathy) and in <title level="m">The Wealth of Nations</title> (1776) (i.e.,
              exchange or “the trucking disposition”) (79-105). For similar conclusions, see Clifford Siskin’s “Novels and Systems” (209) and Ian
              Duncan’s “The Pathos of Abstraction” (43-44).</p></note> Setting out from observations on Percy Shelley, for whom “the problem of
          poetry’s medium” and social organization are inextricable preoccupations, my thoughts below lead to how Romantic media, in this instance,
          involve a range of searching desires pertaining to connection—desires that arise from, and at the same time constitute, a modern social
            imaginary.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This last concept invokes Charles Taylor’s work, which defines a “social imaginary” as “the
            ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the
            expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations” (23). Shelley’s
            poetic-sociological reflections deal in precisely such “notions and images” of social bonds and systems—both received “notions and images”
            and those he creates.</note> Hybridizing a phrase from conjectural historian Adam Ferguson’s <title level="m">An Essay on the History of
            Civil Society</title> (1767) and the title of Nancy K. Baym’s recent book, one could describe the most significant problem for Shelley as
          “Personal Connections in the Age of Separations.” In <title level="m">Epipsychidion </title>(1821) and elsewhere, Shelley leaves
          discoverable a certain feeling of social disconnectedness amid heightened medial and infrastructural connectedness and a sense of how the
          poetic medium, under such circumstances, might model a form of relationality that is neither principally economic nor amatory.</p>
        <p>The Shelley revitalized as media theorist in the concluding section of Langan and McLane’s essay—who is prominent even among his
          contemporaries in “establish[ing] a horizon for thinking the conditions of mediality” (257)—is, after all, simultaneously a sociologist. As
          Raymond Williams’ “The Romantic Artist” chapter in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> (1958) reminded us long ago, “what were seen
          at the end of the nineteenth century as disparate interests, between which a man must choose and in the act of choice declare himself poet
          or sociologist, were, normally, at the beginning of the century, seen as interlocking interests: a conclusion about personal feeling became
          a conclusion about society” (30). Williams’ observation tallies with Alvin W. Gouldner’s “sociology of sociology” (358), which notes the
          affinities between the inaugural, positivist strain of sociology in St. Simon and Auguste Comte, and European Romanticism generally
            (332-334).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also Regina Hewitt’s <title level="m">The Possibilities of Society</title> (1997). It is
            useful to combine Hewitt’s understanding of Romantic “poetic sociology” (ix) (which, she argues, arrives in the wake of the French
            Revolution, far in advance of sociology’s belated discipline formation a century later) with John D. Brewer’s argument that
            pre-sociological discourse—like what Mark Salber Phillips calls “the discourse of the social” (18)—emerged in Adam Ferguson’s Scottish
            conjectural history, a key context therefore for Romantic “poetic sociology.”</note> Williams then proceeds in this now textbook account
          to describe the interrelated social transformations that undo these “interlocking interests” of poetry and sociology from one another,
          sealing the fate of Romanticism’s poetic brand of “criticism of industrialism” (43). “What happened, under the stress of events, was a
          series of simplifications” whereby “art became a symbolic abstraction for a whole range of general human experience” threatened by the
          modern industrial order, and thus, “a general social activity was forced into the status of a department or province, and actual works of
          art were in part converted into a self-pleading ideology” (47). With the conjuncture of developments responsible for the specialization and
          marginalization of literary culture in full view, he confesses that “the last pages of Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of Poetry
          </title>are painful to read” (47). Williams concludes almost elegiacally that “the bearers of a high imaginative skill become suddenly the
          ‘legislators,’ at the very moment when they were being forced into practical exile” (47).</p>
        <p>From the viewpoint of Williams’ “The Romantic Artist,” poet or media theorist Shelley would at least partly undermine “poet or sociologist”
          Shelley. In such a psychomachia, the former’s assumptions about the linguistic-poetic medium and his typical handling of it—his style—would
          only exacerbate the broader social shifts underway “to isolate art, to specialize the imaginative faculty to this one kind of activity, and
          thus to weaken the dynamic function which Shelley proposed for it” (43). For if <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry </title>(comp. 1821)
          exalts poetry over the other arts because language is the clearest among “mediums of communication” (513) for thoughts, at other moments
          Shelley stresses how language, once organized into poetry, is a profoundly unclear medium.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All page and
            line numbers for Shelley’s poetic and prose works refer to <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> (2002).</note> He wavers,
          as William Keach too has noted, between celebrating “language as the medium of poetry” and a “linguistic skepticism that runs throughout the
            <title level="m">Defence</title> like a counterplot” (22). For example, in another well-known moment in the <title level="m"
            >Defence</title>, Shelley describes poetic composition as a “feeble shadow of the original conception” (531). It turns out that poetic
          language can be “a cloud which enfeebles” thought, just as much as the media used by “sculptors, painters, and musicians” that he demotes
          below those of poets (513). And the obscure poetic style he at times adopts further interposes between composition and audience, as though
          to overlay the linguistic “cloud which enfeebles” the poet’s conception with another layer of darkness—a “figured curtain” (533)—that could
          enfeeble normative kinds of comprehension and sympathy typically involved in reception. What good are perceptive sociological theories of
          modernity when conveyed in an opaque medium made doubly opaque? The embarrassment Williams confesses feeling at the peroration of Shelley’s
            <title level="m">Defence</title> appears to be an embarrassment in glimpsing Shelley’s writing as an emblem of literary discourse in
          general, registering and responding to its own declining relevance in ways that served only “to isolate art, to specialize the imaginative
          faculty” further, caught in a perturbed, self-defeating pattern.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Contrary to Raymond Williams, one recalls
            that Shelley himself was cognizant of his dual commitment to poetry and the social sciences, as well as the fact that poets were “being
            forced into practical exile”: “I consider Poetry very subordinate to moral &amp; political science, &amp; if I were well, certainly I
            would aspire to the latter” (<title level="m">Letters </title>II:71). On Romantic poets’ very self-aware and deliberate engagements of
            moral philosophical discourse, see Maureen McLane (10-42). </note></p>
        <p>But perhaps Shelley’s theories of artistic media, including poetic obscurity, play a special role in his poetic sociology. Williams, in
          another work, <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977), opens the way to this possibility as he outlines what a Marxist
          cultural sociology would look like. Overcoming the tendencies of bourgeois sociology, this sociology of culture would avoid neutralizing
          complex social and class relations into inert abstractions (“mass public,” “mass communication”) and fully account for imaginative works and
          the forms they take—all without reducing the imagination to “knowledge” nor the “social forms of language and movement and representation”
          (139) to categories like “books” (140). This sociology of culture would be “a task distinct from a reduced sociology of institutions,
          formations, and communicative relationships and yet, as a sociology, radically distinct from the analysis of isolated forms” (140). Briefly,
          it is “at once a ‘sociology’ and an ‘aesthetics’” (141). Shelley’s writing, on this view, need not chiefly be “self-pleading ideology” on
          behalf of literary culture, sociopolitically impotent and uncommunicative: it may be those things too, but it is also at once a sociology
          and an aesthetics, including a media aesthetics, to the extent that it is a sociology awake to the medial facets and specificities of
          imaginative works. Careful to avoid the theoretical reductions and neutralizations which make poetry a transparent index or deliverer of
          knowledge or which measure poetry on these grounds—as the prompt for Shelley’s somewhat humorless response, Thomas Love Peacock’s “The Four
          Ages of Poetry,” satirically does—Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> attempts to account for poetic form and media within a larger
          “enquiry into the principles of society itself” (511).<note place="foot" resp="editors">At the start of the <title level="m"
            >Defence</title>, Shelley appears to decline taking on this largest of subjects—“let us dismiss those more general considerations which
            might involve an enquiry into the principles of society itself” (511)—but this is also a disclosure, via paralepsis, of the principal task
            at hand.</note></p>
        <p>At minimum, the recognition that Shelley is attempting at once a sociology and a media aesthetics clears up certain problems pertaining to
          his style. We are not dealing with the fetishization of literary obscurity for its own sake, of course, or even an “analysis of isolated
          forms” or media. The question of whether or not Shelleyan obscurity diminishes his political vision also begins to appear less urgent: as
          the argument goes, the obscurity of works like <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820) and the actually miniscule supply and demand
          for many of Shelley’s works—about which William St Clair’s <title level="m">The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</title> (2004)
          provides statistical confirmation (218)—dampen the sociopolitical force of his writing.<note place="foot" resp="editors">To give one
            example, Steven Goldsmith points out that <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s (1820) “internal political dynamics are taken to
            be one and the same as its political effects, by which I mean the way it participates in actual social struggles regarding the relations
            of power. The limitations of this otherwise valuable approach appear as soon as the liberating impact of the play is made to depend on
            readers, for indeed Shelley’s actual audience was and is very small and remarkably homogeneous” (211n3). This essay concurs with
            Goldsmith’s argument that Shelley’s effects—here I am maintaining poetic-medial-sociological insight—need to be reconstructed in a manner
            other than one that equates them directly with his works’ “internal political dynamics.” </note> But a better way to approach Shelley’s
          sometimes unclear style dismisses from the outset the assumptions “that a clear style results in a popular audience and that political
          engagement requires having the most extensive audience possible” (137), as Michael Warner has put it. In Warner’s terms, which happen to
          characterize Shelley’s predicament very well, “those who write [opaquely] might very well feel that they are [. . .] writing to a public
          that does not yet exist [. . .] and finding that their language can circulate only in channels hostile to it, they write in a manner
          designed to be a placeholder for a future public” (130). Better yet, Shelley’s opaque poetry is not only “a placeholder for a future public”
          but also a set of sociological reflections incorporating, and of course performed in, the poetic medium. Finally, there is more to say
          beyond the fact that Shelley strategically modulates his style based on his imagined audience, that his poetry can be “exoteric” or
          “esoteric.” This is certainly the case, as Stephen Behrendt’s illuminating discussion of Shelley’s stylistic decisions shows. Shelley
          himself reflected on the comparative accessibilities of his works: <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819), a work “of a more popular
          kind” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II:108), the “sermo pedestris” of “Julian and Maddalo” (comp. 1819) (<title level="m"
            >Letters</title> II:196), and the political songs of 1819, all against the obscurity of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>.<note
            place="foot" resp="editors"> See Stephen Behrendt (143-185).</note> But there is also the question of how Shelley imagines the clarity or
          unclarity of the poetic-linguistic medium beyond its bearing on the circulation of his works. What comes into view when obscurity is removed
          from the framework of audience or reception and recognized as a model of sociality? </p>
        <p>If, per Williams, “a conclusion about personal feeling became a conclusion about society” for Shelley, and such conclusions about society
          integrate theories of imaginative media and the forms they take, it makes sense to begin with one of his conclusions about a personal
          feeling. The essay fragment, “On Love” (comp. 1818) sets out from a specific premise about social dissimilitude in similitude. The
          superficial, visual resemblances between the speaker and his addressees belie a profound disjunction between them: <quote>I see that in some
            external attributes they resemble me, but when misled by that appearance, I have thought to appeal to something in common and unburthen my
            inmost soul to them I have found my language misunderstood like one in a distant and savage land. The more opportunities they have
            afforded me for experience the wider has appeared the interval between us, and to a greater distance have the points of sympathy been
            withdrawn [. . .]. I [. . .] have found only repulse and disappointment. (503)</quote> I would like to consider these lines not in the
          context of, for example, sympathy (and its difficulties) or Shelley’s expatriation, but rather from the assumption that an additional
          problem shapes these reflections: the problem of a community whose individuals coalesce by virtue of some similarities yet find themselves
          growing apart. The scenario nominally involves one speaker and a yearning for potential interlocutors or lovers, but it senses a larger
          social transformation wherein those imagined as belonging to the same group or social framework—defined by geographical area, nation,
          etc.—lack what Shelley refers to as that “something in common.” </p>
        <p>Shelley’s fragment engages in sociological discourse concerning the separation of individuals in the specific context of modern societies
          defined by the division of labor. He joins Ferguson’s <title level="m">An Essay on the History of Civil Society</title> as well as French
          positivist thought, all of which variously theorized how the division of labor impacted social and class relations. For example, Ferguson
          observes, <quote>The mighty engine which we suppose to have formed society, only tends to set its members at variance, or to continue their intercourse
            after the bands of affection are broken (24) [. . .]. [T]he separation of professions, while it seems to promise
            improvement of skill, and is actually the cause of why the productions of every art become more perfect as commerce advances; yet in its
            termination, and ultimate effect, serves, in some measure, to break the bands of society [. . .]. (206-207)</quote> As John D. Brewer and
          others point out, Adam Smith, David Hume, and John Millar were more sanguine about the division of labor, believing that commercial
          interdependence among individuals would ultimately facilitate social cohesion (in anticipation of Émile Durkheim’s notion of “organic
          solidarity”) (17-22).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a concurring account, see Phillips (180-181). </note> Still, Ferguson worried
          that while individuals increasingly had many occasions to conduct business, the more crucial “bands of affection” that guarantee the
          integrity and overall health of the society were relaxing. Specialization and repetitive tasks circumscribed the perspective of individuals
          and therefore slackened, or worse, would totally dissolve the affective-social ties constituting the national body. Likewise, Comte, who
          studied Ferguson (Jones xiv), concludes in his “Considerations of the Spiritual Power” (1825-1826) that “the necessary result of this
          constantly developing specialization is that each individual and each people is habitually confined to a more and more limited perspective,
          and inspired by interests that are more and more particular” (211), thereby diminishing their sense of a collective life. Shelleyan love—the
          “[thirst] after likeness” (504)—is a feeling specific to a modern social structure viewed from this sociological vantage.</p>
        <p>Appealing as it might be to dwell on how the Romantic era’s variety of written media—literary works, books, letters, newspapers—occasioned
          contact between individuals and formed networks (perhaps on the analogy of today’s social media), media in this period did not only bring
          people together, nor did the density of communicative networks necessarily mean a greater overall sense of affective contact or transfer.
          Shelley’s fragment hints at this fact insofar as the otherwise similar “external attributes” and an existing, underlying sense of connection
          or togetherness are what heighten the pathos of the lamented “interval” and “greater distance” he feels. More to the point, routine contact
          and more regular communication practices can and did aggravate, rather than alleviate, the feeling of social atomization, or even cause it
          in the first place. Here is Ferguson’s republican version of this thought: “The members of a community may [. . .] have no common affairs to
          transact, but those of trade: Connections, indeed, or transactions, in which probity and friendship may still take place; but in which the
          national spirit, whose ebbs and flows [. . .] cannot be exerted” (208). Later, Durkheim posits that a more concentrated form of social
          organization, arising from improvements in communications media and transportation infrastructure, as well as from urbanization, is the very
          cause of the division of labor. “The number and speed of the means of communication and transmission” (what he calls “material density”)
          meant that “similar occupations located at different sites over an area enter into fiercer rivalry” (<title level="m">Division of Labor
          </title>209); this evolutionary mechanism, in turn, drove the creation of newer, narrower specializations.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            >Clifford Siskin too, in <title level="m">The Work of Writing</title> (1998), links a communications development (the proliferation of
            printed matter in this same period) to an intensification of the drive to specialization in intellectual labor, i.e., into different kinds
            of modern professions (104 inter alia).</note> Durkheim emphatically puts it this way: “We state, not that the growth and condensation of
          societies <emph>permit</emph> a greater division of labor, but that they necessitate it. It is not the instrument whereby that division is
          brought about; but it is its determining cause” (<title level="m">Division of Labor </title>206). Now, “material density,” according to
          Durkheim, should ordinarily correspond, as it did in France, with “dynamic” or “moral” density, which he defines as the shared feeling of a
          collective life, where “individuals [. . .] are effectively engaged not only in commercial but also moral relationships with each other” and
          “live their life together in common” (<title level="m">Rules</title> 92). But not so in England: “Roads, railways, etc.”—and one has to
          include those objects and practices put under the heading “media”—“serve commercial exchanges better than they can serve the fusion of
          populations” (<title level="m">Rules</title> 93).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the earlier work, <title level="m">The Division of
              Labor</title> (1893), Emile Durkheim makes a similar exception for England: “Yet it may well be that in any given society, a certain
            division of labor, and in particular the economic division of labor, is very developed, although the segmentary social type is still very
            strongly pronounced. Indeed, this seems to be the case in England. Large-scale industry and commerce appear to be as developed there as on
            the Continent, although the ‘alveolar’ system is still very marked, as is demonstrated both by the autonomy of local life and by the
            authority preserved by tradition” (221n31). Following Durkheim, James W. Carey, in the American context, distinguishes between the
            “transmission” and “ritual” views of communication, which respectively correspond more or less to Durkheim’s “material density” and “moral
            density” (12-18). </note> Communicative connectedness in England developed, as did the division of labor and commercial interdependence,
          without an attendant sense of large-scale sentimental social coalescence; networks of communication and transportation, far from only
          connecting people, were at the same time the very cause of “the interval between us” felt by Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            >Durkheim’s account of “material density” is corroborated by Miranda Burgess’ recent work (see, e.g., “Transport”), one aspect of which
            recovers the period’s networks of carriage. I believe there is something close to what Burgess calls “anxiety” in <title level="m"
              >Epipsychidion</title>’s troubled image of social agglutination, discussed below. </note> With respect to analyses of Romantic or other
          media, one might say that ideally they would observe the distinctions between (say) sibling relationality versus one’s connection to a
          milliner or a solicitor—the latter are “connections, indeed [. . .] in which probity and friendship may still take place”—rather than reduce
          the complex dynamics of each interaction by incorporating them all into, or even positing in the first place, flat networks of affective
          circulation on the basis of communicative frequency or density.</p>
        <p>Thus it is not only, in Wordsworthian terms, that “the increasing accumulation of men in cities” and “the uniformity of their occupations”
          caused “a craving for extraordinary incident which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifie[d]” (<title level="m">Lyrical
            Ballads</title> 294). At the same time, as Wordsworth and Shelley probably grasped, “the rapid communication of intelligence,” along with
          “the increasing accumulation of men in cities,” were themselves responsible for the material concentration (i.e., “material density”) that
          led to a greater division of labor and the monotonous “uniformity” of each kind of work. Wordsworth’s depiction of his reading audience as
          those in a state of “savage torpor” (294) is a precise allusion to Smith’s figure of “the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few
          simple operations [. . . and who] has no occasion to exert his understanding”: as Smith describes him, “the torpor of his mind renders him,
          not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment”
            (II:782).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> James Chandler also notices this allusion in <title level="m">An Archaeology of Sympathy
            </title>(2013) (284). </note> This kind of “torpor,” then, led to yet more craving after “the rapid communication of intelligence” for
          stimulation. Clearly, the issue in Romantic media is not exclusively or primarily the fact of connectivity: instead, the main problems are
          the historically specific sense of disconnectedness in concentration/connectedness (recall Ferguson’s identification of “intercourse after
          the bands of affection are broken”), and the possibility of connection amidst a pervasive, historically specific sense of disconnectedness
          (a big issue, among others, to which Romantic “poets or sociologists” addressed themselves). In this light, seemingly unremarkable lines
          from Romantic poetry become legible as compressions of significant questions about social structure: lines like “greetings where no kindness
          is” (“Tintern Abbey” 131) or “some inane and vacant smile” (<title>The Cenci</title> 3.1.277) come first to mind, but there are countless
          others. Not mere complaints about personal encounters with hypocrisy from social life, they together also form a poetic-sociological topos,
          a “charged semantic figure” (Goodman 7), marking the non-exchange of affects that bind and matter the most, amidst a present characterized
          by an intensified communications environment.</p>
        <p>In response to the estrangement between individuals, felt to be yawning to the point that the ties constitutive of society were in danger
          of dissolution, Shelley in “On Love” proposes or wishes that love is an original psychic human principle that might reconstruct “community”
          (503). Colored by necessitarian doctrine, Shelley’s essay would like to believe that what Ferguson diagnosed as the broken “bands of
          affection” might be healed, and a social reintegration realized, by the magnetic, attractive force of “love,” a force as natural and
          universal as gravitation.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As P. M. S. Dawson puts it, “Shelley’s poetic use of language exploits the
            ambiguity present in the ordinary usage of ‘attraction’ (as both the physical force of gravitation and the moral force of love) to suggest
            that gravitation can be seen as physical manifestation of love, or love as the moral manifestation of gravitation” (28). </note> Shelley
          counters Smith’s own irreducible psychic principle, the “trucking disposition”: a “certain propensity in human nature [. . .] the propensity
          to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another” (I:25). Nevertheless, Shelley eventually intuits the inadequacy of love to the problem
          of sentimental dispersal-in-interconnectedness in a modern social order. He does so most vividly in <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title>.
          His own disavowal of the poem—“it is a production of a portion of me already dead” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II:262-263)—is arguably
          based on some recognition that his own brand of love resembles the ties of interdependence characteristic of modern commercial societies: <quote><lg>
              <l>We – are we not formed, as notes of music are,</l>
              <l>For one another, though dissimilar; </l>
              <l>Such difference without discord, as can make</l>
              <l>Those sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake</l>
              <l>As trembling leaves in a continuous air? (142-146)</l>
            </lg></quote> “[D]ifference without discord” rehearses an unmistakable signature of a social system made up of specialized parts working
          in harmonious concert, about which <title level="m">Epipsychidion </title>is otherwise trying to articulate a critique. Nearby, to give one
          example, he criticizes the practice of monogamy on the grounds that it is like monotonous, alienated labor (“Narrow / The heart that loves,
          the brain that contemplates, / [. . .] One object” [169-72]). Yet like later readers of Smith, Shelley perhaps grasps the uncanny
          similarities between sympathy or love and the solidarity that issues from commercial dependencies—that love itself may be said to love
          (“[thirst] after its likeness”) exchange.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See note 1 above, as well as Robert Mitchell’s <title level="m">Sympathy and the State in the
            Romantic Era</title> (2007).</note> Let us not forget either those awkward lines that specify the speaker as property owner (“This isle and house
          are mine” [513]), and Emily as, dissimilarly yet essentially in this insular division of labor, the housewife. For one thing, then, <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> reflects back at Shelley, when he is most intent on adumbrating how love works, not the mirror
          image of the “ideal prototype of everything excellent or lovely” (“On Love” 504) but an image of a modern social system of enmeshed
          complementary labor, to which he has been at pains to imagine an alternative. </p>
        <p>But there is another problem, this one from the other direction. <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> intimates that love is equally in
          peril of lapsing into a morbid fusion of identities. As the poem hastens to an end, he writes: <quote><lg>
              <l>We shall become the same, we shall be one </l>
              <l>Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?</l>
              <l>……………………………………………… </l>
              <l>One hope within two wills, one will beneath</l>
              <l>Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,</l>
              <l>One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,</l>
              <l>And one annihilation. (573-74; 584-87)</l>
            </lg></quote> Shelley comes close to what Durkheim will describe as “agglutination” (<title level="m">Division of Labor</title> 50). In
          arguing that “organic solidarity” based on complementarity ensues from the division of labor, Durkheim warns against this kind of sameness,
          which would presumably bring to a halt the dynamic system of differences he is outlining. Explaining how individuals imagine and internalize
          others in society (“images”), Durkheim explains that “when union derives from the similarity between two images, it consists in an
          agglutination” (50). Unlike the division of labor, wherein “they remain outside each other and are linked only because they are distinct,”
          in this kind of psychic and social lumping “they fuse completely, becoming one” (50). The implication for <title level="m"
            >Epipsychidion</title> is that this “scheme of life,” and this Edenic couple, would reproduce a social structure that, in swerving away
          from networks of interest, and in order to maintain true “bands of affection,” would veer into the other problems of homogeneity and social
          stasis. It seems possible too that Shelley writes himself into a recognition of his revamped society for the strikingly regressive vision that
          it is: a pre-commercial, pre-industrial, pastoral societal phase recognizable from Enlightenment stadial and conjectural histories. Lastly,
          the poem here concludes with figures of discrete but united individuals, but such figures gradually give way to the repetition of
          singularity (“One [. . .] one [. . .] one [. . .]” etc.). Evocative of the tyranny of “one will” on another, these final images are finally
          continuous with the masculine impositions exemplified by mesmeric control and Coleridgean voluntarism, both of which consistently troubled
          Shelley (Leask 60). It is not clear which would be worse for Shelley: love reduced to organic solidarity or to the agglutination of
          subjectivities.</p>
        <p>But it is significant, then, that the poem also occasions in Shelley a serious consideration of how poetry might simultaneously be a
          communicative medium and, at the same time, not one. <title level="m">Epipsychidion </title>begins and ends by viewing itself as a species
          of communication that may be “sufficiently intelligible to a certain class of readers” but “to a certain other class [. . .]
          incomprehensible” (“Advertisement” 392). That is, for select readers, poetry is a medium insofar as it conveys thoughts and feelings. Then
          again, for others, poetry is only tenuously, or perhaps not at all, a medium, remaining an “incomprehensible” interceding object; as in the
          lyric he appends to his “Advertisement,” these readers will be “Quite unaware of what thou dost contain” (393). Shelley frames <title
            level="m">Epipsychidion</title> with reflections on how poetry may have an inbuilt capacity to transmit or not to transmit, a semantic
          on/off switch—or, the capacity to elicit something between these two poles of contact, perhaps like Keatsian half-knowledge, depending on
          the reader. Such modes of interaction, as can occur in relation to and around poetry, are also figured at the start of “The
          Sensitive-Plant”: <quote><lg>
              <l>And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light</l>
              <l>And closed them beneath the kisses of night (3-4)</l>
            </lg></quote> “Leaves” elsewhere in Shelley’s work stand in for pages and his own writing generally, so his description of the sensitive
          mimosa plant conjures the materiality of literary works as opened and closed books. But at a further metaphorical remove, the one relevant
          here, his lines suggest that literary works can be semantically “open” at some moments and to/by some people, “closed” at other times and
          to/by others.</p>
        <p>In short, poetry can be clear or cloudy or dark, and everything in between. But might not poetry, for this very reason, model a form of
          interaction fit for “The Age of Separations” (Ferguson 175) then, and perhaps also now? Whatever else <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title>
          has to say, it raises the question of how interactions might tend more toward the poetic. It is not as though Shelley is proposing that
          reading—literary reading—is how society actually works; rather this is how a society, of two or the totality, would be more bearable.
          Interactions would have the potential of connecting individuals in immersive, intersubjective relations, as in that of poet-audience or
          “stranger relationality” (Warner 74-75) among readers; such relations involve, but are not finally reducible to, dependencies of exchange
          and often surpass them toward a different kind of imagined solidarity. At the same time, individuals would be buffered against the
          intersubjective encroachments dramatized by <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title>, in the same way that mediatedness and the potential for
          cloudiness, like an opt-out clause, allow readers to curse a work’s obscurity and shut the book, or have unintended responses or different
          responses than other readers, or altogether avoid reading the work—or, as the case may be, leave bottles filled with knowledge or poetry
          unopened. Such a vision never takes hold, failing to overcome the rule of communicative clarity in modernity or the priority of
          specialization. But it is worth appreciating Shelley’s attempts—as poet or sociologist or media theorist—at imagining a different basis for
          sociality. Something like: good “figured curtain[s]” make good neighbors.</p>
