            <p class="noCount">In an effort to square today’s findings that Romantic poets are early media theorists
               with Raymond Williams’s older claim that Romantic poets were “poets or sociologists,”
               the essay reframes Percy Shelley’s writing—and even his sometimes obscure poetic style—as
               engaged in a cultural sociology alert to the aesthetics of imaginative media. Grounded
               in sociological thought from Romantic-era sciences of society to Émile Durkheim, “Shelley
               amid the Age of Separations” suggests that the problem of “Romantic media” does not
               ultimately involve greater or better connectedness but rather the feeling of social
               dissolution amid heightened infrastructural concentration. The essay concludes by
               reading <em>Epipsychidion</em> (1821) and some of Shelley’s other works as inquiries into how poetry might model
               a form of relationality fit for modern societies, an interaction that is neither principally
               commercial nor amatory.</p>

               <p>This volume, as the co-editors explain in their introduction, foregrounds the connection
                  between new media and forms of social and intellectual organization during the Romantic
                  era in England. While the term “media,” as we now know it, was not available until
                  the later-nineteenth century (Guillory 321), media, multi-media, remediations, as
                  well as media awarenesses and practices, and so on, are nowadays imputed to prior
                  literary-historical periods, including Romanticism. What was or is especially Romantic
                  about multi-mediality, then? Celeste Langan and Maureen N. McLane’s important essay,
                  “The Medium of Romantic Poetry” adduces the period’s silent reading norms, the ballad
                  revival, and “self-consciousness about the problem of poetry’s medium and the status
                  of its mediation” (246), among other things. Overall, Langan and McLane’s essay makes
                  a forceful case for “Romantic poetry as media theory” (256). Social organization,
                  mentioned in this volume’s introduction, invokes another area of theoretical inquiry:
                  sociology. But the relation between a “Romantic media theory” and a “Romantic sociology”
                  is not immediately evident, even if it seems that it would have been difficult to
                  think about “media” independent of that umbrella, “society,” howsoever imaginary or
                  occult.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I thank Suzanne Barnett, Michael Gamer, Kate Singer, and Chris Washington, as well
                           as the co-editors of this volume, for sharing with me their responses to an earlier
                           version of this essay. Christopher Herbert’s readings of a variety of canonical social
                           scientific works demonstrate how theories of culture or society as a “complex whole”
                           resort to “fantastical imagery of invisible forces and frameworks” (15) of relation.
                           In a section that is pertinent here, Herbert shows that although Adam Smith in “The
                           History of Astronomy” is alert to the magical connections (“inventions of the imagination”)
                           …</span></div>
                  </div> Setting out from observations on Percy Shelley, for whom “the problem of poetry’s
                  medium” and social organization are inextricable preoccupations, my thoughts below
                  lead to how Romantic media, in this instance, involve a range of searching desires
                  pertaining to connection—desires that arise from, and at the same time constitute,
                  a modern social imaginary.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This last concept invokes Charles Taylor’s work, which defines a “social imaginary”
                           as “the ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others,
                           how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally
                           met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations”
                           (23). Shelley’s poetic-sociological reflections deal in precisely such “notions and
                           images” of social bonds and systems—both received “notions and images” and those he
                           creates.</span></div>
                  </div> Hybridizing a phrase from conjectural historian Adam Ferguson’s <em>An Essay on the History of Civil Society</em> (1767) and the title of Nancy K. Baym’s recent book, one could describe the most significant
                  problem for Shelley as “Personal Connections in the Age of Separations.” In <em>Epipsychidion </em>(1821) and elsewhere, Shelley leaves discoverable a certain feeling of social disconnectedness
                  amid heightened medial and infrastructural connectedness and a sense of how the poetic
                  medium, under such circumstances, might model a form of relationality that is neither
                  principally economic nor amatory.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Shelley revitalized as media theorist in the concluding section of Langan and
                  McLane’s essay—who is prominent even among his contemporaries in “establish[ing] a
                  horizon for thinking the conditions of mediality” (257)—is, after all, simultaneously
                  a sociologist. As Raymond Williams’ “The Romantic Artist” chapter in <em>Culture and Society</em> (1958) reminded us long ago, “what were seen at the end of the nineteenth century
                  as disparate interests, between which a man must choose and in the act of choice declare
                  himself poet or sociologist, were, normally, at the beginning of the century, seen
                  as interlocking interests: a conclusion about personal feeling became a conclusion
                  about society” (30). Williams’ observation tallies with Alvin W. Gouldner’s “sociology
                  of sociology” (358), which notes the affinities between the inaugural, positivist
                  strain of sociology in St. Simon and Auguste Comte, and European Romanticism generally
                  (332-334).

                           Hewitt’s understanding of Romantic “poetic sociology” (ix) (which, she argues, arrives
                           in the wake of the French Revolution, far in advance of sociology’s belated discipline
                           formation a century later) with John D. Brewer’s argument that pre-sociological discourse—like
                           what Mark Salber Phillips calls “the discourse of the social” (18)—emerged in Adam
                           Ferguson’s Scottish conjectural history, a key context therefore for Romantic “poetic
                           sociology.”</span></div>
                  </div> Williams then proceeds in this now textbook account to describe the interrelated social
                  transformations that undo these “interlocking interests” of poetry and sociology from
                  one another, sealing the fate of Romanticism’s poetic brand of “criticism of industrialism”
                  (43). “What happened, under the stress of events, was a series of simplifications”
                  whereby “art became a symbolic abstraction for a whole range of general human experience”
                  threatened by the modern industrial order, and thus, “a general social activity was
                  forced into the status of a department or province, and actual works of art were in
                  part converted into a self-pleading ideology” (47). With the conjuncture of developments
                  responsible for the specialization and marginalization of literary culture in full
                  view, he confesses that “the last pages of Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry </em>are painful to read” (47). Williams concludes almost elegiacally that “the bearers
                  of a high imaginative skill become suddenly the ‘legislators,’ at the very moment
                  when they were being forced into practical exile” (47).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From the viewpoint of Williams’ “The Romantic Artist,” poet or media theorist Shelley
                  would at least partly undermine “poet or sociologist” Shelley. In such a psychomachia,
                  the former’s assumptions about the linguistic-poetic medium and his typical handling
                  of it—his style—would only exacerbate the broader social shifts underway “to isolate
                  art, to specialize the imaginative faculty to this one kind of activity, and thus
                  to weaken the dynamic function which Shelley proposed for it” (43). For if <em>A Defence of Poetry </em>(comp. 1821) exalts poetry over the other arts because language is the clearest among
                  “mediums of communication” (513) for thoughts, at other moments Shelley stresses how
                  language, once organized into poetry, is a profoundly unclear medium.

                  </div> He wavers, as William Keach too has noted, between celebrating “language as the medium
                  of poetry” and a “linguistic skepticism that runs throughout the <em>Defence</em> like a counterplot” (22). For example, in another well-known moment in the <em>Defence</em>, Shelley describes poetic composition as a “feeble shadow of the original conception”
                  (531). It turns out that poetic language can be “a cloud which enfeebles” thought,
                  just as much as the media used by “sculptors, painters, and musicians” that he demotes
                  below those of poets (513). And the obscure poetic style he at times adopts further
                  interposes between composition and audience, as though to overlay the linguistic “cloud
                  which enfeebles” the poet’s conception with another layer of darkness—a “figured curtain”
                  (533)—that could enfeeble normative kinds of comprehension and sympathy typically
                  involved in reception. What good are perceptive sociological theories of modernity
                  when conveyed in an opaque medium made doubly opaque? The embarrassment Williams confesses
                  feeling at the peroration of Shelley’s <em>Defence</em> appears to be an embarrassment in glimpsing Shelley’s writing as an emblem of literary
                  discourse in general, registering and responding to its own declining relevance in
                  ways that served only “to isolate art, to specialize the imaginative faculty” further,
                  caught in a perturbed, self-defeating pattern.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Contrary to Raymond Williams, one recalls that Shelley himself was cognizant of his
                           dual commitment to poetry and the social sciences, as well as the fact that poets
                           were “being forced into practical exile”: “I consider Poetry very subordinate to moral
                           &amp; political science, &amp; if I were well, certainly I would aspire to the latter” (Letters
                           II:71). On Romantic poets’ very self-aware and deliberate engagements of moral philosophical
                           discourse, see Maureen McLane (10-42).</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But perhaps Shelley’s theories of artistic media, including poetic obscurity, play
                  a special role in his poetic sociology. Williams, in another work, <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977), opens the way to this possibility as he outlines what a Marxist cultural sociology
                  would look like. Overcoming the tendencies of bourgeois sociology, this sociology
                  of culture would avoid neutralizing complex social and class relations into inert
                  abstractions (“mass public,” “mass communication”) and fully account for imaginative
                  works and the forms they take—all without reducing the imagination to “knowledge”
                  nor the “social forms of language and movement and representation” (139) to categories
                  like “books” (140). This sociology of culture would be “a task distinct from a reduced
                  sociology of institutions, formations, and communicative relationships and yet, as
                  a sociology, radically distinct from the analysis of isolated forms” (140). Briefly,
                  it is “at once a ‘sociology’ and an ‘aesthetics’” (141). Shelley’s writing, on this
                  view, need not chiefly be “self-pleading ideology” on behalf of literary culture,
                  sociopolitically impotent and uncommunicative: it may be those things too, but it
                  is also at once a sociology and an aesthetics, including a media aesthetics, to the
                  extent that it is a sociology awake to the medial facets and specificities of imaginative
                  works. Careful to avoid the theoretical reductions and neutralizations which make
                  poetry a transparent index or deliverer of knowledge or which measure poetry on these
                  grounds—as the prompt for Shelley’s somewhat humorless response, Thomas Love Peacock’s
                  “The Four Ages of Poetry,” satirically does—Shelley’s <em>Defence</em> attempts to account for poetic form and media within a larger “enquiry into the principles
                  of society itself” (511).

                           enquiry into the principles of society itself” (511)—but this is also a disclosure,

               <p>At minimum, the recognition that Shelley is attempting at once a sociology and a media
                  aesthetics clears up certain problems pertaining to his style. We are not dealing
                  with the fetishization of literary obscurity for its own sake, of course, or even
                  an “analysis of isolated forms” or media. The question of whether or not Shelleyan
                  obscurity diminishes his political vision also begins to appear less urgent: as the
                  argument goes, the obscurity of works like <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820) and the actually miniscule supply and demand for many of Shelley’s works—about
                  which William St Clair’s <em>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</em> (2004) provides statistical confirmation (218)—dampen the sociopolitical force of

                           by which I mean the way it participates in actual social struggles regarding the relations
                           of power. The limitations of this otherwise valuable approach appear as soon as the
                           liberating impact of the play is made to depend on readers, for indeed Shelley’s actual
                           audience was and is very small and remarkably homogeneous” (211n3). This essay concurs
                           with Goldsmith’s argument that Shelley’s effects—here I am maintaining poetic-me…</span></div>
                  </div> But a better way to approach Shelley’s sometimes unclear style dismisses from the
                  outset the assumptions “that a clear style results in a popular audience and that
                  political engagement requires having the most extensive audience possible” (137),
                  as Michael Warner has put it. In Warner’s terms, which happen to characterize Shelley’s
                  predicament very well, “those who write [opaquely] might very well feel that they
                  are [. . .] writing to a public that does not yet exist [. . .] and finding that their
                  language can circulate only in channels hostile to it, they write in a manner designed
                  to be a placeholder for a future public” (130). Better yet, Shelley’s opaque poetry
                  is not only “a placeholder for a future public” but also a set of sociological reflections
                  incorporating, and of course performed in, the poetic medium. Finally, there is more
                  to say beyond the fact that Shelley strategically modulates his style based on his
                  imagined audience, that his poetry can be “exoteric” or “esoteric.” This is certainly
                  the case, as Stephen Behrendt’s illuminating discussion of Shelley’s stylistic decisions
                  shows. Shelley himself reflected on the comparative accessibilities of his works: <em>The Cenci</em> (1819), a work “of a more popular kind” (<em>Letters</em> II:108), the “sermo pedestris” of “Julian and Maddalo” (comp. 1819) (<em>Letters</em> II:196), and the political songs of 1819, all against the obscurity of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.

                  </div> But there is also the question of how Shelley imagines the clarity or unclarity of
                  the poetic-linguistic medium beyond its bearing on the circulation of his works. What
                  comes into view when obscurity is removed from the framework of audience or reception
                  and recognized as a model of sociality?</p>
            </div>
            <p>If, per Williams, “a conclusion about personal feeling became a conclusion about society”
               for Shelley, and such conclusions about society integrate theories of imaginative
               media and the forms they take, it makes sense to begin with one of his conclusions
               about a personal feeling. The essay fragment, “On Love” (comp. 1818) sets out from
               a specific premise about social dissimilitude in similitude. The superficial, visual
               resemblances between the speaker and his addressees belie a profound disjunction between
               them: <span class="quote">‘I see that in some external attributes they resemble me, but when misled by that
                  appearance, I have thought to appeal to something in common and unburthen my inmost
                  soul to them I have found my language misunderstood like one in a distant and savage
                  land. The more opportunities they have afforded me for experience the wider has appeared
                  the interval between us, and to a greater distance have the points of sympathy been
                  withdrawn [. . .]. I [. . .] have found only repulse and disappointment. (503)’</span> I would like to consider these lines not in the context of, for example, sympathy
               (and its difficulties) or Shelley’s expatriation, but rather from the assumption that
               an additional problem shapes these reflections: the problem of a community whose individuals
               coalesce by virtue of some similarities yet find themselves growing apart. The scenario
               nominally involves one speaker and a yearning for potential interlocutors or lovers,
               but it senses a larger social transformation wherein those imagined as belonging to
               the same group or social framework—defined by geographical area, nation, etc.—lack
               what Shelley refers to as that “something in common.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Shelley’s fragment engages in sociological discourse concerning the separation of
                  individuals in the specific context of modern societies defined by the division of
                  labor. He joins Ferguson’s <em>An Essay on the History of Civil Society</em> as well as French positivist thought, all of which variously theorized how the division
                  of labor impacted social and class relations. For example, Ferguson observes, <span class="quote">‘The mighty engine which we suppose to have formed society, only tends to set its members
                     at variance, or to continue their intercourse after the bands of affection are broken
                     (24) [. . .]. [T]he separation of professions, while it seems to promise improvement
                     of skill, and is actually the cause of why the productions of every art become more
                     perfect as commerce advances; yet in its termination, and ultimate effect, serves,
                     in some measure, to break the bands of society [. . .]. (206-207)’</span> As John D. Brewer and others point out, Adam Smith, David Hume, and John Millar were
                  more sanguine about the division of labor, believing that commercial interdependence
                  among individuals would ultimately facilitate social cohesion (in anticipation of
                  Émile Durkheim’s notion of “organic solidarity”) (17-22).

                  </div> Still, Ferguson worried that while individuals increasingly had many occasions to
                  conduct business, the more crucial “bands of affection” that guarantee the integrity
                  and overall health of the society were relaxing. Specialization and repetitive tasks
                  circumscribed the perspective of individuals and therefore slackened, or worse, would
                  totally dissolve the affective-social ties constituting the national body. Likewise,
                  Comte, who studied Ferguson (Jones xiv), concludes in his “Considerations of the Spiritual
                  Power” (1825-1826) that “the necessary result of this constantly developing specialization
                  is that each individual and each people is habitually confined to a more and more
                  limited perspective, and inspired by interests that are more and more particular”
                  (211), thereby diminishing their sense of a collective life. Shelleyan love—the “[thirst]
                  after likeness” (504)—is a feeling specific to a modern social structure viewed from
                  this sociological vantage.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Appealing as it might be to dwell on how the Romantic era’s variety of written media—literary
                  works, books, letters, newspapers—occasioned contact between individuals and formed
                  networks (perhaps on the analogy of today’s social media), media in this period did
                  not only bring people together, nor did the density of communicative networks necessarily
                  mean a greater overall sense of affective contact or transfer. Shelley’s fragment
                  hints at this fact insofar as the otherwise similar “external attributes” and an existing,
                  underlying sense of connection or togetherness are what heighten the pathos of the
                  lamented “interval” and “greater distance” he feels. More to the point, routine contact
                  and more regular communication practices can and did aggravate, rather than alleviate,
                  the feeling of social atomization, or even cause it in the first place. Here is Ferguson’s
                  republican version of this thought: “The members of a community may [. . .] have no
                  common affairs to transact, but those of trade: Connections, indeed, or transactions,
                  in which probity and friendship may still take place; but in which the national spirit,
                  whose ebbs and flows [. . .] cannot be exerted” (208). Later, Durkheim posits that
                  a more concentrated form of social organization, arising from improvements in communications
                  media and transportation infrastructure, as well as from urbanization, is the very
                  cause of the division of labor. “The number and speed of the means of communication
                  and transmission” (what he calls “material density”) meant that “similar occupations
                  located at different sites over an area enter into fiercer rivalry” (<em>Division of Labor </em>209); this evolutionary mechanism, in turn, drove the creation of newer, narrower
                  specializations.

                           the drive to specialization in intellectual labor, i.e., into different kinds of modern
                           professions (104 inter alia).</span></div>
                  </div> Durkheim emphatically puts it this way: “We state, not that the growth and condensation
                  of societies <em>permit</em> a greater division of labor, but that they necessitate it. It is not the instrument
                  whereby that division is brought about; but it is its determining cause” (<em>Division of Labor </em>206). Now, “material density,” according to Durkheim, should ordinarily correspond,
                  as it did in France, with “dynamic” or “moral” density, which he defines as the shared
                  feeling of a collective life, where “individuals [. . .] are effectively engaged not
                  only in commercial but also moral relationships with each other” and “live their life
                  together in common” (<em>Rules</em> 92). But not so in England: “Roads, railways, etc.”—and one has to include those objects
                  and practices put under the heading “media”—“serve commercial exchanges better than
                  they can serve the fusion of populations” (<em>Rules</em> 93).

                  people, were at the same time the very cause of “the interval between us” felt by

                           of carriage. I believe there is something close to what Burgess calls “anxiety” in

                  </div> With respect to analyses of Romantic or other media, one might say that ideally they

                  probity and friendship may still take place”—rather than reduce the complex dynamics
                  of each interaction by incorporating them all into, or even positing in the first
                  place, flat networks of affective circulation on the basis of communicative frequency
                  or density.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus it is not only, in Wordsworthian terms, that “the increasing accumulation of
                  men in cities” and “the uniformity of their occupations” caused “a craving for extraordinary
                  incident which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifie[d]” (<em>Lyrical Ballads</em> 294). At the same time, as Wordsworth and Shelley probably grasped, “the rapid communication
                  of intelligence,” along with “the increasing accumulation of men in cities,” were
                  themselves responsible for the material concentration (i.e., “material density”) that
                  led to a greater division of labor and the monotonous “uniformity” of each kind of
                  work. Wordsworth’s depiction of his reading audience as those in a state of “savage
                  torpor” (294) is a precise allusion to Smith’s figure of “the man whose whole life
                  is spent in performing a few simple operations [. . . and who] has no occasion to
                  exert his understanding”: as Smith describes him, “the torpor of his mind renders
                  him, not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation,
                  but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment” (II:782).

                  </div> This kind of “torpor,” then, led to yet more craving after “the rapid communication
                  of intelligence” for stimulation. Clearly, the issue in Romantic media is not exclusively
                  or primarily the fact of connectivity: instead, the main problems are the historically
                  specific sense of disconnectedness in concentration/connectedness (recall Ferguson’s
                  identification of “intercourse after the bands of affection are broken”), and the
                  possibility of connection amidst a pervasive, historically specific sense of disconnectedness
                  (a big issue, among others, to which Romantic “poets or sociologists” addressed themselves).
                  In this light, seemingly unremarkable lines from Romantic poetry become legible as
                  compressions of significant questions about social structure: lines like “greetings
                  where no kindness is” (“Tintern Abbey” 131) or “some inane and vacant smile” (<em>The Cenci</em> 3.1.277) come first to mind, but there are countless others. Not mere complaints about
                  personal encounters with hypocrisy from social life, they together also form a poetic-sociological
                  topos, a “charged semantic figure” (Goodman 7), marking the non-exchange of affects
                  that bind and matter the most, amidst a present characterized by an intensified communications
                  environment.</p>

               <p>In response to the estrangement between individuals, felt to be yawning to the point
                  that the ties constitutive of society were in danger of dissolution, Shelley in “On
                  Love” proposes or wishes that love is an original psychic human principle that might
                  reconstruct “community” (503). Colored by necessitarian doctrine, Shelley’s essay
                  would like to believe that what Ferguson diagnosed as the broken “bands of affection”
                  might be healed, and a social reintegration realized, by the magnetic, attractive
                  force of “love,” a force as natural and universal as gravitation.

                           and the moral force of love) to suggest that gravitation can be seen as physical manifestation
                           of love, or love as the moral manifestation of gravitation” (28). </span></div>
                  </div> Shelley counters Smith’s own irreducible psychic principle, the “trucking disposition”:
                  a “certain propensity in human nature [. . .] the propensity to truck, barter, and
                  exchange one thing for another” (I:25). Nevertheless, Shelley eventually intuits the
                  inadequacy of love to the problem of sentimental dispersal-in-interconnectedness in
                  a modern social order. He does so most vividly in <em>Epipsychidion</em>. His own disavowal of the poem—“it is a production of a portion of me already dead”
                  (<em>Letters</em> II:262-263)—is arguably based on some recognition that his own brand of love resembles
                  the ties of interdependence characteristic of modern commercial societies: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                  </blockquote> “[D]ifference without discord” rehearses an unmistakable signature of a social system
                  made up of specialized parts working in harmonious concert, about which <em>Epipsychidion </em>is otherwise trying to articulate a critique. Nearby, to give one example, he criticizes
                  the practice of monogamy on the grounds that it is like monotonous, alienated labor
                  (“Narrow / The heart that loves, the brain that contemplates, / [. . .] One object”
                  [169-72]). Yet like later readers of Smith, Shelley perhaps grasps the uncanny similarities
                  between sympathy or love and the solidarity that issues from commercial dependencies—that
                  love itself may be said to love (“[thirst] after its likeness”) exchange.

                  </div> Let us not forget either those awkward lines that specify the speaker as property
                  owner (“This isle and house are mine” [513]), and Emily as, dissimilarly yet essentially
                  in this insular division of labor, the housewife. For one thing, then, <em>Epipsychidion</em> reflects back at Shelley, when he is most intent on adumbrating how love works, not
                  the mirror image of the “ideal prototype of everything excellent or lovely” (“On Love”
                  504) but an image of a modern social system of enmeshed complementary labor, to which
                  he has been at pains to imagine an alternative.</p>
            </div>
            <p>But there is another problem, this one from the other direction. <em>Epipsychidion</em> intimates that love is equally in peril of lapsing into a morbid fusion of identities.
               As the poem hastens to an end, he writes: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">We shall become the same, we shall be one </div>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Shelley comes close to what Durkheim will describe as “agglutination” (<em>Division of Labor</em> 50). In arguing that “organic solidarity” based on complementarity ensues from the
               division of labor, Durkheim warns against this kind of sameness, which would presumably
               bring to a halt the dynamic system of differences he is outlining. Explaining how
               individuals imagine and internalize others in society (“images”), Durkheim explains
               that “when union derives from the similarity between two images, it consists in an
               agglutination” (50). Unlike the division of labor, wherein “they remain outside each
               other and are linked only because they are distinct,” in this kind of psychic and
               social lumping “they fuse completely, becoming one” (50). The implication for <em>Epipsychidion</em> is that this “scheme of life,” and this Edenic couple, would reproduce a social structure
               that, in swerving away from networks of interest, and in order to maintain true “bands
               of affection,” would veer into the other problems of homogeneity and social stasis.
               It seems possible too that Shelley writes himself into a recognition of his revamped
               society for the strikingly regressive vision that it is: a pre-commercial, pre-industrial,
               pastoral societal phase recognizable from Enlightenment stadial and conjectural histories.
               Lastly, the poem here concludes with figures of discrete but united individuals, but
               such figures gradually give way to the repetition of singularity (“One [. . .] one
               [. . .] one [. . .]” etc.). Evocative of the tyranny of “one will” on another, these
               final images are finally continuous with the masculine impositions exemplified by
               mesmeric control and Coleridgean voluntarism, both of which consistently troubled
               Shelley (Leask 60). It is not clear which would be worse for Shelley: love reduced
               to organic solidarity or to the agglutination of subjectivities.</p>
            <p>But it is significant, then, that the poem also occasions in Shelley a serious consideration
               of how poetry might simultaneously be a communicative medium and, at the same time,
               not one. <em>Epipsychidion </em>begins and ends by viewing itself as a species of communication that may be “sufficiently
               intelligible to a certain class of readers” but “to a certain other class [. . .]
               incomprehensible” (“Advertisement” 392). That is, for select readers, poetry is a
               medium insofar as it conveys thoughts and feelings. Then again, for others, poetry
               is only tenuously, or perhaps not at all, a medium, remaining an “incomprehensible”
               interceding object; as in the lyric he appends to his “Advertisement,” these readers
               will be “Quite unaware of what thou dost contain” (393). Shelley frames <em>Epipsychidion</em> with reflections on how poetry may have an inbuilt capacity to transmit or not to
               transmit, a semantic on/off switch—or, the capacity to elicit something between these
               two poles of contact, perhaps like Keatsian half-knowledge, depending on the reader.
               Such modes of interaction, as can occur in relation to and around poetry, are also
               figured at the start of “The Sensitive-Plant”: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light</div>
                  <div class="l">And closed them beneath the kisses of night (3-4)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> “Leaves” elsewhere in Shelley’s work stand in for pages and his own writing generally,
               so his description of the sensitive mimosa plant conjures the materiality of literary
               works as opened and closed books. But at a further metaphorical remove, the one relevant
               here, his lines suggest that literary works can be semantically “open” at some moments
               and to/by some people, “closed” at other times and to/by others.</p>
            <p>In short, poetry can be clear or cloudy or dark, and everything in between. But might
               not poetry, for this very reason, model a form of interaction fit for “The Age of
               Separations” (Ferguson 175) then, and perhaps also now? Whatever else <em>Epipsychidion</em> has to say, it raises the question of how interactions might tend more toward the
               poetic. It is not as though Shelley is proposing that reading—literary reading—is
               how society actually works; rather this is how a society, of two or the totality,
               would be more bearable. Interactions would have the potential of connecting individuals
               in immersive, intersubjective relations, as in that of poet-audience or “stranger
               relationality” (Warner 74-75) among readers; such relations involve, but are not finally
               reducible to, dependencies of exchange and often surpass them toward a different kind
               of imagined solidarity. At the same time, individuals would be buffered against the
               intersubjective encroachments dramatized by <em>Epipsychidion</em>, in the same way that mediatedness and the potential for cloudiness, like an opt-out
               clause, allow readers to curse a work’s obscurity and shut the book, or have unintended
               responses or different responses than other readers, or altogether avoid reading the
               work—or, as the case may be, leave bottles filled with knowledge or poetry unopened.
               Such a vision never takes hold, failing to overcome the rule of communicative clarity
               in modernity or the priority of specialization. But it is worth appreciating Shelley’s
               attempts—as poet or sociologist or media theorist—at imagining a different basis for
               sociality. Something like: good “figured curtain[s]” make good neighbors.</p>

               <p class="noCount">I thank Suzanne Barnett, Michael Gamer, Kate Singer, and Chris Washington, as well
                  as the co-editors of this volume, for sharing with me their responses to an earlier
                  version of this essay.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">Christopher Herbert’s readings of a variety of canonical social scientific works demonstrate
                  how theories of culture or society as a “complex whole” resort to “fantastical imagery
                  of invisible forces and frameworks” (15) of relation. In a section that is pertinent
                  here, Herbert shows that although Adam Smith in “The History of Astronomy” is alert
                  to the magical connections (“inventions of the imagination”) on which systems depend,
                  he relies on the same kind of fictional, invisible links in <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments </em>(1759) (i.e., custom and sympathy) and in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776) (i.e., exchange or “the trucking disposition”) (79-105). For similar conclusions,
                  see Clifford Siskin’s “Novels and Systems” (209) and Ian Duncan’s “The Pathos of Abstraction”
                  (43-44).</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">This last concept invokes Charles Taylor’s work, which defines a “social imaginary”
               as “the ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others,
               how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally
               met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations”
               (23). Shelley’s poetic-sociological reflections deal in precisely such “notions and
               images” of social bonds and systems—both received “notions and images” and those he
               creates.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">See also Regina Hewitt’s <em>The Possibilities of Society</em> (1997). It is useful to combine Hewitt’s understanding of Romantic “poetic sociology”
               (ix) (which, she argues, arrives in the wake of the French Revolution, far in advance
               of sociology’s belated discipline formation a century later) with John D. Brewer’s
               argument that pre-sociological discourse—like what Mark Salber Phillips calls “the
               discourse of the social” (18)—emerged in Adam Ferguson’s Scottish conjectural history,
               a key context therefore for Romantic “poetic sociology.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Contrary to Raymond Williams, one recalls that Shelley himself was cognizant of his
               dual commitment to poetry and the social sciences, as well as the fact that poets
               were “being forced into practical exile”: “I consider Poetry very subordinate to moral
               &amp; political science, &amp; if I were well, certainly I would aspire to the latter” (<em>Letters </em>II:71). On Romantic poets’ very self-aware and deliberate engagements of moral philosophical
               discourse, see Maureen McLane (10-42).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">At the start of the <em>Defence</em>, Shelley appears to decline taking on this largest of subjects—“let us dismiss those
               more general considerations which might involve an enquiry into the principles of
               society itself” (511)—but this is also a disclosure, via paralepsis, of the principal
               task at hand.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">To give one example, Steven Goldsmith points out that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s (1820) “internal political dynamics are taken to be one and the same as its political
               effects, by which I mean the way it participates in actual social struggles regarding
               the relations of power. The limitations of this otherwise valuable approach appear
               as soon as the liberating impact of the play is made to depend on readers, for indeed
               Shelley’s actual audience was and is very small and remarkably homogeneous” (211n3).
               This essay concurs with Goldsmith’s argument that Shelley’s effects—here I am maintaining
               poetic-medial-sociological insight—need to be reconstructed in a manner other than
               one that equates them directly with his works’ “internal political dynamics.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               labor, i.e., into different kinds of modern professions (104 inter alia).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">In the earlier work, <em>The Division of Labor</em> (1893), Emile Durkheim makes a similar exception for England: “Yet it may well be
               that in any given society, a certain division of labor, and in particular the economic
               division of labor, is very developed, although the segmentary social type is still
               very strongly pronounced. Indeed, this seems to be the case in England. Large-scale
               industry and commerce appear to be as developed there as on the Continent, although
               the ‘alveolar’ system is still very marked, as is demonstrated both by the autonomy
               of local life and by the authority preserved by tradition” (221n31). Following Durkheim,
               James W. Carey, in the American context, distinguishes between the “transmission”
               and “ritual” views of communication, which respectively correspond more or less to
               Durkheim’s “material density” and “moral density” (12-18).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Durkheim’s account of “material density” is corroborated by Miranda Burgess’ recent
               work (see, e.g., “Transport”), one aspect of which recovers the period’s networks
               of carriage. I believe there is something close to what Burgess calls “anxiety” in
               <em>Epipsychidion</em>’s troubled image of social agglutination, discussed below.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               present in the ordinary usage of ‘attraction’ (as both the physical force of gravitation
               and the moral force of love) to suggest that gravitation can be seen as physical manifestation
               of love, or love as the moral manifestation of gravitation” (28). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
