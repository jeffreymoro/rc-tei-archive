            <p>Letitia Landon has often been seen, both in her own time and ours, as a prolific writer
               catering to mass audiences with repetitive tales of exotic romance. This essay proposes
               that Landon’s verse narratives, and the inset poems they include, repeat tales using
               different media less as a stock performance of the sentimental woman but as an acute
               inquiry into her own multiply mediated landscape. In doing so, she constructs an archive
               of mashed-up older and newer technologies that engineer a layered sensory, affective,
               and temporal experience, which we can read through the techniques of non-linear media
               archaeology and machine-assisted reading.</p>

               <p>Having produced during her lifetime what Glenn T. Dibert-Himes once estimated to be
                  over thirteen-hundred works (170), Letitia Elizabeth Landon was both immensely popular
                  and lambasted by critics for her sloppiness, repetition, and pandering to the developing
                  mass of British middle class readers. L. E. L., one contemporary critic snidely wrote,
                  “is a mere machine wound up by the clock-work of rhythm” (as cited by Vincent, 27).
                  Current scholarship has more often than not followed suit: Glennis Stephenson’s <em>Letitia Landon</em> (1995) portrays a poet who “constructed the conventionally female poetic self of L.
                  E. L.,” a poetess who is bound by social prohibitions to write on love and whose feelings
                  “are immediately spewed out upon the page” (15, 10).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>While Landon scholarship has begun to consider a wider scope beyond the poetess figure,
                           including Landon’s concerns with subjectivity (Cope), historicity (Reiss), and classicism
                           (Comet), even if we view L. E. L. as poetess donning a constructed and at times self-critical
                           mask, her performances are seen to be largely those of sentiment. See, for instance,
                           Mary Waters’s “Letitia Landon’s Literary Criticism and Her Romantic Project: L. E.
                           L.’s Poetics of Feeling and the Periodical Reviews” as well as Angela Leighton’s classic
                           Victorian Women Poets: Writing Against the Heart (1992).</span></div>
                  </div> An engine of verse, she deployed the repetitive contrivances of feeling, for some
                  readers, <em>ad nauseam</em>. In her essay, “On the Ancient and Modern Influence of Poetry,” Landon explicitly
                  denies having become a Stepford wife of nineteenth-century poetry, writing “vain will
                  be the effort to regulate mankind like machinery” (<em>Selected</em> 164). She implicitly argues for a different type of technology, “the hazel rod pointed
                  by the hand of truth” (<em>Selected</em> 164) that will find the hidden fountains of future poetry. While metaphors of divine
                  inspiration uncovering the liquid depths of poetic feeling may be nothing new, it
                  is Landon’s interest in previous forms of technology—the hazel rod, the lute, and
                  the lyre—that reveals her poetry’s mediated complexity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Bypassing a romanticized or idealized voice of inspiration, several of Landon’s longer
               poems interweave and reckon with past technologies and older media. In addition to
               a hoard of annual and newspaper verse, Landon wrote eleven volumes of poetry, seven
               of which begin with verse narratives riddled with smaller inset poems and songs. <em>The Troubadour</em> (1825) and <em>The Golden Violet</em> (1827), for example, both rehearse medieval poetic contests, while <em>The Improvisatrice</em> (1824) and <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> (1835) both supply tales of minstrels who frequently devolve into song. These longer
               poems offer more than a machine of sentiment and instead rehearse a veritable treasury
               of songs: Greek lyric, Medieval romance, troubadour song, crusade <em>chanson</em>, Turkish or Arabic tales, folk song, and Italian improvisation. The improvisatrice,
               the troubadour, English bard, and the lute-toting minstrel together compose a pantheon
               of older media. Such repetitive interludes embody a corpus of poems not automatically
               spouting the gush of the feminine to less literate consumers but instead constructing
               a non-linear media archaeology, an archive of mashed-up older and newer technologies
               that engineer a multiply mediated, affective, temporal experience.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>No stranger to the colloquy among audio and visual media during the Romantic period,
                  Landon was one of the queens of the annuals, almost single-handedly writing <em>Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap-book</em> for seven years (1832-1839). She often received engravings for these volumes and then
                  wrote poems to accompany them.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A good primer for Landon’s annual writing is Terence Allan Hoagwood and Gina Elizabeth
                           Opdycke’s introduction to their facsimile reproduction of the 1836 Fisher’s Drawing
                           Room Scrap-book.</span></div>
                  </div> What Nicholas Mason titles her “visual turn” consisted not only in her keen interest
                  in art but also in a series of portraits commissioned as a marketing ploy to bolster
                  L. E. L.-mania when it began to flag in the mid-1820s (104). Landon’s poems often
                  juxtapose engravings, narrative, songs, and musical settings within poems or among
                  volumes. Dibert-Himes once called these “multimedia presentations,” but Landon’s repetitive
                  cultural mediations move beyond the <em>agon</em> between the sister arts into a layered, dynamic method of “remediation,” what Jay
                  David Bolter and Richard Grusin in their book describe as “the representation of one
                  medium in another” (45). While <em>Remediation</em> (2000) made a pervasive mark on media theory fifteen years ago, scholars including
                  N. Katherine Hayles have updated the relation among media through concepts of “intermediation”
                  and “intermediality.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In My Mother was a Computer (2005), Hayles writes that she chooses “intermediation”
                           to consider the “multiple causality in emphasizing interactions among media” (33),
                           a technique that suits the contemporary and digital nature of the media she probes.</span></div>
                  </div> Even more recently, Jussi Parrika in <em>What is Media Archaeology?</em> (2012) argues that remediation is an “intuitively good way” to investigate intermedial
                  relations over time, both through scholarship and within art itself (137). While we
                  could easily read Landon’s attention to voice and art through the lens of mode, genre,
                  ekphrasis, or the special concerns in women’s writing with the sister arts, a media-theoretical
                  approach allows us to see and most fully explore the poet’s distinctive play with
                  sound and noise—indeed, with the questions of new media as they were unfolding in
                  the early-nineteenth century.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the course of her numerous experiments with the long verse narrative, Landon attempts
               several strategies of remediation, which we can see by first doing a bit of media
               archaeology. Her printed narrative poems represent older forms of song and verse from
               an array of historical periods. In later works the page as a visual screen supplies
               a means of flattening the representation of aural poetry into an archive of verse
               that disregards temporal provenance, not to erase historicity, but to reformulate
               relations between history and media. Such a theoretical perspective is made concrete—and
               is perhaps best evidenced—by forms of machine-assisted reading offered at this paper’s
               end, as one more remediation via digital techniques. Word frequency analyses, visualized
               by word clouds and force graphs, extend Landon’s own techniques and enable us to read
               her texts at a greater distance. Together, these two complementary if diverse methods
               of remediation undermine a reading of Landon’s sentiment that repeats itself merely
               to make noise, and instead they amplify her layering of media that, when looked at
               through more granularity, expose a dynamic affect that sounds off through mediated
               differences.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Landon’s attention to the “early music” of Sappho and the troubadours would seem to
                  channel unmediated feeling, what Jean-Jacques Rousseau, among others, associated with
                  the most potent and simple emotions at the beginnings of language, and what Celeste
                  Langan has called the “outmoded medium of the poem” (50). Langan summarizes this position
                  in her discussion of Sir Walter Scott: “the same way that oral history projects like
                  Scott’s <em>Minstrelsy</em> attempt to fix and preserve the vanishing traces of folk expression, so (written)
                  lyric comes to be seen as an attempt to arrest the semiotic babble and rapid evanishments
                  of emotion” (50). She suggests that written poetry silences the medium’s auditory
                  mellifluence in favor of the “musical scene of the poem,” allowing the reader a virtual
                  playground for audio-visual hallucinations. Erik Simpson, writing of British minstrelsy
                  in the Romantic period similarly explains Landon’s attention to the troubadour/minstrel
                  as a “fantasy of poetry being produced under the immediate influence of strong emotion
                  and directed to an identifiable audience,” which evokes the “intimate connection between
                  poet and listener in packaged texts of many layers [. . .] [that] acknowledge the
                  loss of this fantasy” (18, 19). Both Langan and Simpson posit a hallucination or fantasy
                  instigated by the audio-visual terrain of the song. Landon’s poems differently construct
                  a notion of media in excess of either the nostalgic playback of primitive songs for
                  women’s easy listening pleasure
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a more recent example of a similar phenomenon, see Lisa Gitelman’s description
                           of the advent of the phonograph in Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data
                           of Culture (2006): “the new medium of recorded sound was deeply defined by women,
                           generally middle-class women, who helped to make it a new, newly intelligible medium
                           for home entertainment” (14).</span></div>
                  </div> or the fantasy of interiority that evokes virtual sensory landscapes. Her poetic representation
                  of early aural media supplies a series of remediations—a hypermediated excess—that
                  moves beyond nostalgia, fantasy, and the construction of a performative, abyssally
                  self-conscious subject. Rather, Landon highlights the manifold ways that a modern
                  listener might hack into older songs collected on the page. Her poet-singers collect
                  various moments of singing technology and enact them to compare, negotiate, and temporarily
                  embody them. The page becomes an occasion (and not the only one) for archiving, reprocessing,
                  and reproducing anew the visual, the textual, the verbal, and the aural.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Landon begins her polyphonic composition with <em>The Improvisatrice</em>, her first published volume and perhaps her greatest commercial success. She sets
                  the poem ostensibly in the past, yet the timeless guitar-toting, Florentine performer
                  evokes a flexible historicity that signals a versatile channeling of minstrelsy for
                  modern purposes.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For an alternative view, see Angela Esterhammer’s reading of Landon for the argument
                           about her idealization of the classical figure: “Landon adopts the classical topos
                           only as a vehicle for a timeless and potentially autobiographical story, ‘an ideal
                           not a historical picture,’ as she puts it in her introductory note. This idealization
                           involves endowing the Greek poetess Erinna with some of the characteristics of the
                           Improvisatrice persona as depicted in Corinne” (99).</span></div>
                  </div> The narrative depicts the eponymous, unnamed tragic figure who meets Lorenzo at a
                  party, falls in love with him, and then becomes lovesick after stumbling upon his
                  wedding to another. Although Lorenzo eventually proclaims his love to her, she nevertheless
                  dies only to be memorialized by a portrait and an urn installed in Lorenzo’s home.
                  Such a narrative has given rise to readings of the improvisatrice as a nostalgic figure
                  for narrative romance and the minstrel, whose songs become conventional when the singer
                  lives her sung tragedy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This allegedly driving narrative of the improvisatrice’s love becomes nearly secondary
                  to the remediated art housed within the poem—the numerous descriptions of her paintings
                  and inset songs that compose close to 40% of the poem.

                  </div> The poem begins by stacking several in quick succession: two paintings done by the
                  improvisatrice, both of struggling minstrels, are followed by eight inset poems, a
                  painting of a tragic Ariadne, and the poem ends with the description of the improvisatrice’s
                  portrait next to her urn. The poems themselves are wide ranging, highlighting our
                  minstrel’s potent talents that, similar to Mary Robinson’s Sappho and Madame de Staël’s
                  Corinne, wane as her seemingly unrequited love intensifies. We hear “Sappho’s Song,”
                  “A Moorish Romance,” “The Charmed Cup,” “The Hindoo Girl’s Song,” “The Indian Bride,”
                  “Song,” “Leades and Cydippe,” and “Lorenzo’s History.”</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We can make a few observations about the poem’s texture that exemplifies Landon’s
                  handling of media as more than an ironic and self-fulfilling performance of tragic,
                  sentimental femininity. The poem promotes a veneer of affective and poetic immediacy
                  that it nevertheless undercuts in several ways. The individual paintings and inset
                  poems at first seem to express unmediated emotional experience. Her first resort to
                  song occurs as she ends the description of her second painting, of course, a painting
                  of a minstrel: “I deemed, that of lyre, life, and love / She was a long, last farewell
                  taking;— / That from her pale and parched lips, / Her latest, wildest song was breaking.”
                  She then commences “Sappho’s Song,” singing, “Farewell, my lute!—and would that I
                  / Had never waked thy burning chords! / Poison has been upon thy sigh / And fever
                  has breathed in thy words” (10).

                  </div> The emotional portrait of the minstrel nearly jumps off the page and into song. As
                  Bolter and Grusin suggest of remediation, the poem presents an interface “that erases
                  itself, so that the user is no longer aware of confronting a medium, but instead stands
                  in an immediate relationship to the contents of that medium” (24). The plot seems
                  to propel the reader from one palpable song and emotional crisis to the next. Nevertheless,
                  the series of songs that shuttles readers back and forth from narrative to song proper
                  effectively dispels the supposed immediacy of the improvisatrice’s overarching narrative
                  as well as the supposedly direct, emotional message of her individual performances.
                  These ruptures between poem and song become more intense and distracting as the poem
                  continues. The improvisatrice’s steadily accumulating boxed set of greatest hits appears
                  to trump the narrative, and rather than immediacy, their excess provides a sense of
                  hypermediation, what Bolter and Grusin describe as a fragmentation and heterogeneity
                  that emphasizes performance and process rather than a transparent, finished art object
                  (54-55).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This heterogeneity is nowhere more apparent than in the improvisatrice’s continual
                  references to lyres and lutes, a repetition which increasingly encourages the reader
                  to understand the supposed youth and naiveté of the ingénue performer as already mediated
                  by an obsession with an older media—not just one but various iterations of the defunct
                  singer. Her paintings of the minstrel with the lyre as well as Sappho’s song remediate
                  Grecian performers who used that U-shaped instrument. She does not merely imitate
                  Sappho’s form but modernizes Sappho’s voice through Sicilian or heroic quatrains (abab
                  iambic tetrameter). The improvisatrice most often plays a lute, an instrument whose
                  long history evokes a number of different versions of the early guitar most likely
                  transmitted from the East to Europe via Moorish Spain during the Crusades.

                  </div> While the lute’s popularity rose through medieval troubadour music and perhaps accompanied
                  some medieval romance narratives, in the early modern period it became the most common
                  household instrument and a featured part of British court music. It then waned from
                  use by the early- to mid-eighteenth century, not to revive again until the turn of
                  the twentieth. This makes the lute-playing improvisatrice herself most likely not
                  a contemporary figure, yet we cannot easily idealize the improvisatrice’s songs into
                  generic lute songs. Rather, she channels different examples of minstrels, bards, singers,
                  poets, and performers through her set list. After the Grecian “Sappho’s Song,” we
                  have two mini-medieval romance narratives, “A Moorish Romance” and “The Charmed Cup.”
                  These two evoke the fashion for romance plots of crossed lovers, eastern tales, and
                  pagan magic. The “The Hindoo Girl’s Song” and “The Indian Bride” are both sung by
                  our heroine at a masked ball, and while they may be related to first-person poems
                  of female alterity and sensibility (including Felicia Hemans’s <em>Records of Woman</em> [1828] or even William Wordsworth’s “The Forsaken Indian Woman”), they even more powerfully
                  allude to the non-Western provenance of the lute and the eastern traditions of female
                  singing that were beginning to infiltrate other Romantic-era texts such as Percy Bysshe
                  Shelley’s “Alastor” (1816).

                  </div> Through these inset poems, the improvisatrice collects, resurrects, modernizes, and
                  perhaps scrambles multiple song forms including Greek lyric, European medieval romance,

            <p>Landon’s poetic text archives a media archaeology that intertwines poetry, music,
               voice, and song. <em>The Improvisatrice</em> encapsulates that paradox of remediation whereby new media (the page) refashions
               the old (the oral) becoming simultaneously automatic and interactive. While Bolter
               and Grusin remind us that remediation raises an awareness of immediacy as an ideology,
               Landon reveals how easily the supposedly older, automatic media become new and fashionable
               when resurrected. The improvisatrice’s art transforms her (and her voice) into a dynamic
               archive of sound; she simultaneously archives and plays back a playlist that reorganizes
               time and media. Media—perhaps not unlike women’s bodies and their sentiment—are not
               simply stuck in the embodied, material time of their provenance but recur, resurrected
               as they arise from one art form or performance to another. Parikka further theorizes
               such a mashup of new and old: <span class="quote">‘New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never
                  left us. They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new uses, contexts,
                  adaptations. In the midst of talk of ‘dead media’ by such writers as Bruce Sterling,
                  it is clear that a lot of dead media were actually zombie-media: living deads, that
                  found an afterlife in new contexts, new hands, new screens and machines. (3) ’</span> Unlike John Keats’s la belle dame sans merci who paralyzes her prey into the knight
               of the living dead, Landon’s improvisatrice resurrects supposedly ephemeral, diverse
               forms of lute song and lyric performance.</p>
            <p>While we might see the collection of songs in the single body and voice of the improvisatrice
               as a flattening of formal and historical variation, the embodied voice remediated
               by the printed page may, in fact, represent an alternate vision of the archive itself.
               Parikka reminds us of the notion of an “archive in motion”: “What this means is a
               turn from object-centered archiving to objects in the software sense, their searchability
               and transformation into forms that make them viewable and experiential through encoding,
               streaming and other software techniques” (124). The improvisatrice is less concerned
               with the preservation of the songs as stable artifacts and more so with the possibilities
               of encoding, processing, streaming—those operations that make transmission possible
               and probable. Landon writes many of the improvisatrice’s songs in similar verse forms—a
               combination of the tetrameter couplet and the heroic quatrain—and in doing so, updates
               and processes earlier media through the technological operating system of easily read
               modern verse. </p>
            <p>Moreover, through her remediations, as a form of reiteration, Landon addresses whether
               repetition in her work actually advances instantaneous, easily digested sentiment.
               Her techniques suggest that media play becomes a means to change our distance from
               the art object, a means of making its sound clearer or muddier. It is perfunctory
               for Landon scholars to remark on the repetitive nature of both her larger frame narratives
               and their songs—each one seems to document a lovelorn, tragic minstrel. This sort
               of redundancy may be less an effect of what friend and biographer Laman Blanchard
               called her “breathless and reckless rapidity” of composition (as cited by Baiesi,
               78) than a tension between clear sound and noise. As Parikka reminds us, information
               scientists in the mid-twentieth century as well as telegraphers used redundant signals
               to “battle the various kinds of disturbances in the communication channel” (98). A
               more contemporaneous example occurs in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811) when Marianne Dashwood embarrassingly sends John Willoughby multiple letters,
               assuming that their transmission has been somehow interrupted or misunderstood. Like
               Marianne’s missives, gauche in their excess, redundancy can clarify a message, but
               it can also become like spam, spurring an “unwanted flow of messages” that necessitates
               “various kinds of filters and scanners [. . .] to cope with it” (Parikka 98). Marianne’s
               jejune, ardent effort to transmit a narrative carrying clear affect potentially turns
               into its opposite. Sentimental narrative, when repeated over time, can transmute into
               noise as repetition loses its meaning, becoming a series of unpleasant sounds. When
               <em>The Improvisatrice</em> diachronically narrates a series of inset songs, it reproduces the danger that such
               vocalizations will begin to sound like a particularly feminine sort of noise—the suffering
               woman singing the same song over and over again. Although the hypermediated poem attempts
               to refocus the reader not so much on individual songs or precious voices but on the
               process of reproducing, comparing, and processing sound, if we read these songs too
               easily, without attention to media, we cannot easily compare or differentiate them
               as they repeat through time.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Landon’s long poem <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> represents a late effort to tackle these problems once again in what F. J. Sypher
                  describes as “a curious return on the part of Landon to a poetic genre that was by
                  1835 clearly outmoded and unprofitable” (10). While Sypher argues that the nostalgia
                  for her youthful success spurred the volume, the poet’s revisiting verse narrative
                  likewise represents her rethinking techniques of remediation—especially since the
                  poem’s narrative is, before it even reaches the page, already twice remediated. She
                  takes her subject from Daniel Maclise’s painting of the same name, which itself was
                  inspired by a line from Scott’s <em>Lay of the Last Minstrel</em> (1805).

                  </div> At its start, Landon inserts visual metaphors to frame and flatten the poem so that
                  the diachronically told inset songs and tales can be read more synchronically. The
                  opening lines of the poem begin by constructing a contrast between present and past,
                  with each of the first three stanzas starting with the exclamation, “THE present!”
                  and the fourth with “The past!” In her first critique of the present, she inveighs,
                  “I love it not—it taketh its birth / Too near to the dull and common earth” (3). This
                  remark might surprise typical readers of Landon because the speaker protests against
                  sorrows that are “so fresh” and “so near.” The speaker is “[t]oo near” to the “common
                  earth” and to the “sweat of the brow”; the materiality of feeling’s embodied, phenomenological
                  presence lies too “heavy” (3). Here Landon markedly distances herself from the immediacy
                  of both the present moment and the intense feelings that characterize her earlier
                  verse. The past, as one might expect of Landon’s infatuation with knights, maidens,
                  and troubadours, provides a better world. She writes, “It softens the present, and
                  flings / A grace, like the ivy, wherever it clings” (4). Poetry, Landon suggests,
                  can put a box around feelings, compartmentalizing and distancing us from the harsh
                  realities of the present, as a building is picturesquely framed with ivy. The poet
                  accordingly “calls up the shadows of ages long fled” and “[s]hades and softens the
                  world-worn, the harsh and the mean” (6). This description is not simply a sloppy metaphorical
                  bait and switch but Landon’s multimedia thinking about how the visual qualities of
                  the printed poem might remediate past music.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The softening shadows add a visual noise that alters our views of the seemingly stock
               poems they frame. This visual remediation aggregates another mashed-up, dynamic archive
               even as it constructs a different sort of noise—made from visual static—to dissipate
               the dangers of unhelpful redundancy or mechanistic song. In <em>The Vow</em>, certain types of noise work to drown out the narrative and even the emotive force
               purveyed through the poem’s romance plot, focusing the reader’s attention more directly
               upon the construction of a series of songs sung by different singers. Various remediations
               along a single plane act perspicaciously as an archive of multiple temporalities and
               media that dispel any dominant narrative, theme, or sentiment. Looking specifically
               at the structure of this poem after these introductory comments, the speaker executes
               a short ekphrasis ostensibly of Maclise’s painting, then launches into the story of
               Catherine, Queen of Cyprus, who asks her minstrel Azalio to tell a tale of her ancestors.
               The minstrel promptly begins “The Vow of the Peacock,” an inset romance narrative
               about the former Queen Irene, who had journeyed to Venice in search of a knight; soon
               after, a second minstrel appears who turns out to be the knight’s disguised lovelorn
               ward, Amenaïde, singing tunes from her youth. The diachronic sequence of songs moves
               backwards in time from contemporary verse to romance narrative to minstrel song to
               folk tunes. However, within a visual frame where all parts of the image can be seen
               along the same plane, if not at once, songs are heard within an archive not necessarily
               organized by linear provenance.</p>
            <p>Moreover, songs become notoriously difficult to track, date, and historicize, especially
               once they are already remediated, echoed, and processed by other singers, texts, and
               images, as Maureen McLane’s recent work on eighteenth-century ballads has attested.
               The poem’s two final inset songs, Amenaïde’s “Letter” of farewell to Leoni and a funeral
               “Dirge” about her death, reify this complicated temporal heterogeneity of oral performances.
               The tension they evoke between the living and the dead catapults us back to the poem’s
               multiple frames. Who, we wonder, is really living and who is dead, if song itself
               is a zombie-media resurrecting many living deads, not the least of which are two deposed
               Queens in the decade after Caroline of Brunswick’s exile? Just afterward, the poem’s
               final fourteen lines fail to close the frame, and it is difficult to tell whether
               they are sung by Azalio or written by the poem’s speaker. This confusion heightens
               the poem’s hypermediacy by muddling <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> and “The Vow of the Peacock” and by mixing up the minstrel songs of L. E. L., Azalio,
               the Moorish minstrel, and Amenaïde.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Landon’s almost vertiginous, repetitive mediations, however, may require something
                  beyond media archaeology’s retro-futuristic approach, a different form of analysis
                  that can take us an even greater distance from historically mediated sound and noise.
                  Digital tools that amass word frequencies and collocations might help to make sense
                  of narrative repetition that, to our ears, sounds like sentimental static. Machine-assisted
                  reading, moreover, helps to raise questions about how noise might frame productive,
                  alternate readings and reframe Landon’s poems at large. Stephen Ramsay, in his manifesto <em>Reading Machines: Toward An Algorithmic Criticism</em> (2011), traces the advent of smaller scale, algorithmic reading from the legacy of
                  Oulipo and deformance, experiments that disrupt our perceptions of the text and open
                  up suggestive gaps encouraging new theories and narratives to emerge.

                  charts, and force graphs. These tools can definitively show us where the obvious repetition
                  in Landon’s work lies—no small feat. But this final remediation of poem and song—the
                  digitization of poem data and the new narrative interpretations they suggest—becomes
                  a part of what Ramsay calls “the larger document space within which it is already
                  implicated” (80). My digital methodology in this part of the paper does not seek to
                  propose a single argumentative strand but, rather, is meant to offer an initial range
                  of tools and their visualizations, a heterogeneous set of observations aimed at provoking
                  close reading and other textual sensitivities by studying word density, frequency,
                  and proximity. It is as if the unclosed frame of <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> continues with data visualizations as one more modern, mashed-up version of the various
                  minstrel songs. These visualizations intensify Landon’s focus on the colliding categories
                  of poetry, song, music, sound, and textual noise.</p>

            <p><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>’s text analysis software, developed by literary scholars Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey
               Rockwell, provides a web-based portal enabling some initial data mining. The popular,
               low-threshold, web-based tool allows users to input text files of their own and quickly
               reveal basic information about one or more texts alongside an easily digestible set
               of visualizations. This counting and sorting can help to filter out frequent keywords
               in the poems, collocations among keywords (their frequency use in proximity to one
               another), and the lexical density of the poems (a measure of unique and different
               words used). By looking at local repetition (word frequency) and trends (word repetition
               over time; word repetition in context of other repetitions), we can filter out both
               poetic and critical narratives that keep us in ruts of reading. As in <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em>, but to a greater degree, flattening the poems and reducing plot to a framing, static
               noise helps to elevate other nodes of repetition, those places that do create meaningful
               sounds through iteration.</p>

                  these frequencies is to look at Voyant’s data about lexical density. Landon’s two
                  volumes discussed here are lower than volumes by Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
                  Hemans, Scott, and Charlotte Smith:

                  </blockquote> Since her poems have fewer unique words (using the same words more often), we might
                  assume they have less intellectual density. But Ramsay’s discussion of lexical richness
                  among American novelists should give us pause, when he reminds us that William Faulkner’s <em>A Light in August</em> (1932) is exceedingly less vocabulary rich than many other novels of its time (71-73).
                  Perhaps Landon’s word choice may not be a repetitive dumbing down but the signal of
                  her poem’s historical flexibility, hybridity, and modernity. The mashup of old and
                  new songs may be enabled by a fluid and easily processing form (couplets and heroic
                  quatrains). This operating language includes word choices (diction) that tend toward
                  monosyllabic nouns and simple adjectives that will not fade from use—modern in their
                  succinctness, concision, and directness of expression.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The word clouds themselves are especially provocative in suggesting how we define
               sound and noise. The smaller words, placed on the outskirts of the field of knowledge,
               might be distracting noise from the top frequency hits: “like,” “love,” “heart,” “light,”
               “sweet,” “young,” “fair,” “dark,” “bright,” and so on in Figure 1. Alternately, like
               Landon’s description of the past as a visual scene of noise that distances us from
               the present, this noise might create the edges of coherence that allow us to see meaning
               in those items most repeated. The central words, like Marianne’s letters and Landon’s
               techniques in <em>The Improvisatrice</em>, however, may themselves represent the noise of the poem—the unctuous sounds of love
               and heart that become feminine noise. Word clouds may help us to see those words at
               the middle distance, around the periphery, which represent less noisy and more meaningful
               coding of the poem’s subject—here the “song,” “music,” and “words” that construct
               the archive as an array of various mediations.</p>
            <p>Within Landon’s published volumes of poetry, “song” has its highest frequency in <em>The Improvisatrice</em>, <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em>, and <em>The Golden Violet</em>; “music” crests in the first two and “sound” remains more or less constant across
               volumes. When these mid-frequency words peak in particular volumes, they may supply
               hints to hidden meta-subjects:</p>

                        </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Figures 6 and 7 use a slightly different corpus for Landon’s works because they look
                        at only her seven volumes structured around an eponymous romance narrative: The Fate
                        of Adelaide (1821), The Improvisatrice (1824), The Troubadour (1825), The Golden Violet
                        (1827), The Venetian Bracelet (1829), The Vow of the Peacock (1835), The Zenana (1839).
                        The corpus has been culled in this way to enable a more accurate comparison among
                        like volumes.</span></div>

            </figure>
            <p>If we want to understand how different kinds of sound relate to each other, one final
               visualization depicts clusters of keywords that frequently occur together, collocations
               on a force graph: </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/multi-media/images/image6.png" alt="Force graph of word collocations in Landon’s published volumes." class="graphic" style=" width:16.51cm; height:6.769805555555555cm;"/></figure>
            <p>The larger the word, the more frequently it appears in Landon’s work; the closer the
               words sit, the more frequently they appear together. The graph represents some interesting
               relationships between “song,” “music,” “sound,” “voice,” and “poetry,” words selected
               to be the central nodes of the graph. “Song” is proximate to “voice” via “love,” but
               “voice” (by the way, one of the most frequently occurring words in Hemans’s corpus)
               does not appear close to either “poetry” or “sound.” “Music”—the written melody of
               rhythm or the aural melodies we imagine—is the channel that leads from “song” to “sound,”
               from meaning to noise. These collocations highlight the systems of sound operating
               within and among her works. If “song,” “music,” “voice,” and “sound” lie on a spectrum
               of communication possibilities, it may be that music—the easy prosody of Landon’s
               versification—creates the processing language that converts sound into song and vice
               versa. Landon’s repetition may be about processing sound into noise and back again,
               just like the very media that perform that trick.</p>
            <p>Landon’s poems give us a technique of remediation that hacks into minstrelsy and offers
               a valve for increasing and decreasing the level of sound and noise in any given sound
               system. Her remediations collapse time, and in doing so, she allows us to survey the
               field of song and all its noisy relatives once separated by history and now joined
               together on the printed and digital screen. Landon’s play with media juxtapositions
               neither offers a linear version of history (progressive or tragic), nor does it idealize
               us out of history into some lovely classical past. Her archives of song present what
               Parikka calls “future-pasts” and “past-futures” (5), or what I would argue are alternatives
               to empirical notions of historicity that bind the woman writer to the nineteenth century’s
               cultural and social prohibitions on her writing. Future pasts and past futures are
               a means of remediating women out of their present and ours, to imagine other futures
               and pasts with either looser or simply different demands upon gendered subjectivity.
               Whether or not such retro-hipster temporalities and media experiments are uniquely
               Romantic, they certainly reveal Landon as more than a poet of nostalgia, constructed
               femininity, and self-conscious belatedness. Her provocative experiments with sound
               and vision invite new modes of steampunk analysis where mechanisms may not tend toward
               the gross and violent but to collective, analytic engines of reading. The operating
               system of her poetry runs less on the often foretold, sickly sweet buzz of feminine
               sentiment but through scalar models of spoken and bespoken art. </p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">While Landon scholarship has begun to consider a wider scope beyond the poetess figure,
               including Landon’s concerns with subjectivity (Cope), historicity (Reiss), and classicism
               (Comet), even if we view L. E. L. as poetess donning a constructed and at times self-critical
               mask, her performances are seen to be largely those of sentiment. See, for instance,
               Mary Waters’s “Letitia Landon’s Literary Criticism and Her Romantic Project: L. E.
               L.’s Poetics of Feeling and the Periodical Reviews” as well as Angela Leighton’s classic
               <em>Victorian Women Poets: Writing Against the Heart </em>(1992).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">A good primer for Landon’s annual writing is Terence Allan Hoagwood and Gina Elizabeth
               Opdycke’s introduction to their facsimile reproduction of the 1836 <em>Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap-book</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>My Mother was a Computer </em>(2005), Hayles writes that she chooses “intermediation” to consider the “multiple
               causality in emphasizing interactions among media” (33), a technique that suits the
               contemporary and digital nature of the media she probes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">For a more recent example of a similar phenomenon, see Lisa Gitelman’s description
               of the advent of the phonograph in <em>Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture </em>(2006): “the new medium of recorded sound was deeply defined by women, generally middle-class
               women, who helped to make it a new, newly intelligible medium for home entertainment”
               (14).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For an alternative view, see Angela Esterhammer’s reading of Landon for the argument
               about her idealization of the classical figure: “Landon adopts the classical topos
               only as a vehicle for a timeless and potentially autobiographical story, ‘an ideal
               not a historical picture,’ as she puts it in her introductory note. This idealization
               involves endowing the Greek poetess Erinna with some of the characteristics of the
               Improvisatrice persona as depicted in <em>Corinne</em>” (99).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Looking at word counts, the entire poem spans 10,727 words, while the inset poems
               together amount to 4,744.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">References throughout will be made to page numbers of the poems’ facsimile editions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">For initial information on the history of the lute see Matthew Spring’s <em>The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music</em> (2001) (415).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">The lute most likely derives from the Arabic oud, which came to Europe via the crusades
               most likely through Moorish Spain or Sicily. For a discussion of Romantic-era attention
               to the tradition of South Asian singing, see Tilar Mazzeo’s essay on Shelley’s “Alastor,”
               a poem that clearly influenced Landon. For the connections between Landon and Shelley,
               see Michael O’Neill’s “‘Beautiful but Ideal’: Intertextual Relations between Letitia
               Elizabeth Landon and Percy Bysshe Shelley.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Daniel Maclise and Landon were well acquainted as he painted several portraits of
               her and may have been romantically involved with her as well. See F. J. Sypher’s long
               footnote (19-21 n21).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">While <em>The Improvisatrice</em> might be akin to an anthology like the medieval chansonniers, or songbooks of a single
               minstrel’s works, <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> is closer to the romance narrative’s slightly different mode of collection and circulation.
               As Ardis Butterfield suggests in <em>Poetry and Music in Medieval France </em>(2002), “Chansonnier and romance intersect in that whereas the chansonniers have already
               created the authorial image of the trouvère, and have already given his songs a developed
               social context, the romance in turn constitutes the work of anthologising and recording
               the songs as an identifiable repertory” (41). Ironically, songbooks bound by an authorial
               persona provide a less diverse and less narratively-bound set of songs than the narrative
               romance, which offers multiple voices or occasions for song.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Stephen Ramsay is especially useful in this case because, unlike the calls for “distant
               reading” by Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, which seek to analyze (rather than
               read) thousands of texts at once, Ramsay’s method of algorithmic criticism can be
               leveraged at single or multiple texts. Distant reading, what Jockers has termed “macroanalysis,”
               focuses on large collections of digital texts revealing “an examination of an aggregated
               ecosystem or ‘economy’ of texts” (32). While Ramsay is also interested in a “larger
               document scope” that reveals patterns, he helps to turn our attention to the numerous
               microscopic observations furnished by toggling between numerical data and the text.

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">“Unsupervised” is the term Jockers uses to suggest that computer analysis, unlike
               human reading, does not come to the text with ideas of what to look for (123).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">These word clouds are meant to provide suggestive linguistic context rather than determinative
               statistics. They are based on the full text versions of poets’ works available, with
               varying levels of OCR correctness. Landon’s are the most accurate, having been taken
               from ProQuest’s <em>Literature Online</em> (LION), a full-text database of over 355,000 literary works. Figure 1 collects Landon’s
               eleven volumes of poems: <em>The Fate of Adelaide </em>(1821), <em>The Improvisatrice</em> (1824), <em>The Troubadour</em> (1825), <em>The Golden Violet</em> (1827), <em>The Venetian Bracelet</em> (1829), <em>The Easter Gift</em> (1832), <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> (1835), <em>Traits and Trials</em> (1836), <em>Flowers of Loveliness</em> (1838), <em>The Zenana</em> (1839), and <em>Life and Literary Remains</em> (1841). They do not include many of the occasional, gift book, or annual poems Landon
               wrote, as these have never been collected, and it would take an entirely separate
               editing project to do so. Texts for Hemans’s poems are taken from The <em>Internet Archive</em>’s full text version of <em>The Poems of Felicia Hemans</em> (1875), Byron’s from Project Gutenberg’s <em>The Works of Lord Byron</em> (1898-1905), and Scott’s from the <em>Internet Archive</em>’s full text version of <em>The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott</em> (1822). In an attempt to ensure that the word clouds were comparing similar corpuses
               (i.e., comparing complete sets of poems rather than volumes with various sorts of
               editorial apparatus), I omitted Ernest Hartley Coleridge’s introductions and copious
               footnotes from Byron’s <em>Works </em>as well as the transcribed page headings from the Scott collection.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">Frequency counts exclude stopwords, or what <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/sgsinclair/Voyant/tree/master/src/main/webapp/resources/voyant/current/docs/docs/guides/stopwords">Voyant Tools describes</a> as “so-called function words that don’t carry as much meaning, such as determiners
               and prepositions.” I use the tool’s standard English stopwords except in the case
               of Byron’s <em>Works, </em>where certain Roman numerals were omitted. Which words we deem less meaningful are,
               of course, open to interpretation, so I err on the side of extreme inclusion. I present
               this more or less raw data because it was the basis for my own curiosity and because
               I intended to use these visualizations in the classroom and wanted to raise questions
               about meaning (e.g., Is “like” or “o’er” a significant repeated word in these texts?).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">Figures 6 and 7 use a slightly different corpus for Landon’s works because they look
               at only her seven volumes structured around an eponymous romance narrative: <em>The Fate of Adelaide </em>(1821), <em>The Improvisatrice</em> (1824), <em>The Troubadour</em> (1825), <em>The Golden Violet</em> (1827), <em>The Venetian Bracelet</em> (1829), <em>The Vow of the Peacock</em> (1835), <em>The Zenana</em> (1839). The corpus has been culled in this way to enable a more accurate comparison
               among like volumes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
