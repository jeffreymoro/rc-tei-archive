                    spiritual intensities to the status of cultural differences from everyday life.
                    Hogg did not divide up the world in quite that way, a point with implications

<div type="section">
                <p>Is there a place for the spiritual in literature? On its surface, the answer to
                    this question would seem to be yes, whether we respond with an eye to the
                    tradition of liberal humanism (where most comers are, if not welcome, at least
                    tolerated, even in an era of microaggressions) or to the present era of the
                    postsecular. Indeed, as Justine Murison and Jordan Alexander Stein remark, “the
                    ‘religious turn’ in literary studies—taking place since the late 1990s but
                    reimagined in more urgent terms following 9/11—has made a discipline-wide
                    fashion” of religion and hence, by extension, of a category like spirituality
                    (1). And yet, religion is hardly a self-evident category (are we talking about
                    sectarian institutions? about a militant organization like ISIS? about something
                    more broadly anthropological, like the connection between language and ritual?),
                    and neither, perforce, is the spiritual. Rosi Braidotti, for example, appeals to
                    “postsecular spirituality” (251) as a way of forging a materialist ethics that
                    is “resolutely atheistic” (256). Her reason for invoking a traditionally
                    religious category to make a patently non-religious argument is that postsecular
                    spirituality provides a nuanced matrix for a concept of subjectivity “linked to
                    affects, to the imagination,” and to notions of “transformative becoming”
                    (251).</p>
                <p>And yet, none of this really answers the question of whether there is a place for
                    the spiritual in literature, or what that place might be (are we talking about a
                    thematic subject? a principle of form? allusive atmospherics?), if only because
                    we have not defined what we mean by <emph>the spiritual</emph>. But is an
                    adequate definition even possible? I ask because, as the young Derrida reminded
                    us in endless analyses of Hegel, the spiritual may not simply be one category in
                    a sea of others.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For matter to <emph>be</emph>, for it to have
                        something like an essence, it must also be spiritual. Hence, “to be opposed
                        to its own tendency, to itself, to matter, it must be spirit. And it if
                        yields to this tendency, it is still spirit. It is spirit in any case; its
                        essence is nothing but spiritual. There is no essence but spiritual”
                        (Derrida 22).</note> Consider Steven Goldsmith’s recent, and cogent,
                    observations concerning the status of the imagined dialectical opposite of the
                    spiritual, the material, in modern literary studies:<quote>
                        No doubt materialism is too multivalent to invoke so broadly, but it is
                            also a conceptual ground so pervasive as to operate virtually
                            uncontested. If materialism means “the explanation of the higher by the
                            lower,” as Bourdieu once suggested, it encompasses not only Marxist
                            tradition but our criticism’s tendency always to descend further (toward
                            whatever is smallest, neglected, and least elevated or heroic), with its
                            understanding that beneath the materialist floor as currently conceived
                            there is always a still lower condition awaiting discovery
                            .&#160;.&#160;.. Although we might challenge or promote one version or
                            another (historicist, economic, affective, dialectical, speculative,
                            ecological, thing theorized, object oriented, new empirical), no one
                            today would seriously argue <emph>against</emph> materialism—and that
                            consensus is enough to make me wonder about the work we want our
                            materialisms to perform. (416)</quote> While I concur with
                    Goldsmith’s conclusions, the “multivalent” status of materialism reintroduces
                    the notion of the spiritual through the back door. Consider what it means for
                    there to be, in Bourdieu’s words, a “higher” notion of materialism, a kind of
                    (divine or simply peer-review-sanctioned) canon under which we may group the
                    various orders of materiality (“historicist, economic, affective, dialectical,
                    speculative, ecological,” and so on). In the scenario Goldsmith outlines, the
                    material <emph>is</emph> (also the) spiritual.</p>
                <p>So, is the spiritual also material in literature? That is to say, while the
                    spiritual may find a place in any text or critical apparatus (like the presence
                    of the void in any mathematical set, which is impossible to exclude since
                    “nothing” might always be added), does it count there; does it
                        <emph>matter</emph>? This question is becoming increasingly relevant in the
                    humanities, during an era when tightening university budgets tend to invite new
                    scrutiny of literary scholarship, with charges occasionally laid against it of
                    obscurantism, political homogeneity, and the sacrifice of “big questions” to
                    small stakes hobbyhorsery.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Louis Menand discusses this
                        development in <title level="m">The Marketplace of Ideas</title>.</note> The
                    spiritual is a kind of index for questions of meaning and value, and while never
                    shorn of politics (who decides what is meaningful?), it nevertheless carries
                    with it an aura of import for a vaguely imagined public sphere. This means that
                    to pose the question of the spiritual in literature is to jostle the lid on
                    Pandora’s box.</p>
                <p>Or, perhaps, it just means doing history. For the question of the spiritual in
                    literature is hardly new, and it is one chapter of that history, or one portion
                    of one chapter, that I wish to address here. The Scottish poet, essayist,
                    novelist, songwriter, collector, and shepherd James Hogg frequently invoked the
                    spiritual—more specifically in Hogg’s case, the presence of spirits—in his work,
                    and did so from under the aegis of both religion (whether fanatical or moderate)
                    and folk culture. For Hogg, the spiritual is a fact of existence, though it is
                    rarely, if ever, a straightforward fact for literature. This is most famously
                    the case in his brilliant and experimental narrative <title level="m">The
                        Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</title>, in which the
                    account of a murder is rehearsed twice, the second time from within the mind of
                    a religious zealot who has been deceived by an extended relationship with the
                    devil incarnate. The proximity to evil functions in the <title level="m"
                        >Confessions</title>, Ian Duncan argues, as “a powerful critique of the
                    Scottish philosophical account of sympathy as the foundation of moral sentiment,
                    the ethical system that regulates civil society” (“Fanaticism” 58). Robert
                    Wringhim’s sympathy for the devil, his destructive attachment to ideas and
                    narratives that distort the actual conditions of his existence, reveals
                    fanaticism to be “the dialectical product of objective historical processes of
                    modernization” (59), the uncanny obverse of progress that divulges, in place of
                    a “primitive moral force” (59), a state of disenfranchisement.</p>
                <p>But spirits take multiple forms in Hogg’s work. Accordingly, spirituality meets
                    with multiple uses. And here, in my essay, it is not the <title level="m"
                        >Confessions</title>, but rather two other Hogg texts under examination,
                    texts that take a more ecumenical approach to the problem of the spiritual. One
                    is Hogg’s long poem <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, which stages a
                    competition between bards from across sixteenth-century Scotland. The other is
                    the sprawling narrative <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title>, a text
                    initially conceived as a tale of chivalry (in subversive homage to Walter
                    Scott), but which devolves into a story about witchcraft and, crucially,
                    tale-telling (in which Hogg resuscitates the premise of a competition among
                    raconteurs, the conceit of <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>). Similarly
                    to <title level="m">Confessions</title>, a dialectic establishes itself in these
                    texts by way of a traffic with spirits, though here it is not civil society that
                    Hogg places on trial as much as literature itself, specifically the modern
                    concept of the literary as a species of imaginative writing set against a
                    normative sphere of everyday life. Anthony Jarrells presents a variation on this
                    point in his essay in this volume, remarking that Hogg adheres to “an idea of
                    experience thoroughly grounded in belief, including belief in ghosts, miracles,
                    divine intervention, and supernatural visitations, none of which”—and this is my
                    point—“are consistent with real life as represented in novels” (par. 15).
                    Offsetting my argument somewhat from Jarrells’s, what concerns Hogg is less the
                    status of literature per se than its dialectic with reality and the schism that
                    such a dialectic implies—something both <title level="m">The Queen’s
                        Wake</title> and <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title> undercut.
                    Each, then, exemplifies a kind of Bakhtinian heteroglossia, a condition
                    historically associated with the novel. Neither text, however, is a novel (even
                        <title level="m">Perils</title> presents itself more as a meandering tale,
                    an exercise in narrative bricolage), and the multitude of voices these texts

                        makes a similar point relative to Sydney Owensen in her essay in this

                    to the same. Call it an engagement with the <emph>spirit</emph> of the
                    novel.</p>
                <p>The title of my essay alludes to Wassily Kandinsky’s famous treatise <title
                        level="m">Concerning the Spiritual in Art</title>, published in 1912, a
                    century after Hogg composed <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> (which
                    appeared in January 1813). Kandinsky’s aim was to delineate the relationship
                    between the spirit of the age and the forms of art. “Every work of art is the
                    child of its time,” his treatise begins. And “[i]t follows that each period of
                    culture produces an art of its own” (23). The concept of the spiritual in
                    Kandinsky’s long essay is part Percy Shelley, part Hegel in that it consists in
                    a set of idealized abstractions that take shape in history. Similar elements
                    inform <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, where Hogg synthesizes
                    something like a “spirit of Scotland” from the diverse ballads, or “songs,” that
                    constitute it. Of particular interest here, with Kandinsky in mind, are Hogg’s
                    references to colors and shapes, and particularly to distorted perspectives—to
                    “silver curve[s]” in the water cut by the prows of boats (26, l. 140), or to
                    “lurid vapours” that “deform” the appearance of land and sky (55, ll. 3, 5).</p>
                <p>But such spirits are not sufficiently literal for Hogg. <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> is a work replete with fairies, witches, demons,
                    ghosts, visions, and other phenomena associated with the supernatural. “That
                    fairies <emph>were</emph>, was not disputed; / But <emph>what</emph> they were,
                    was greatly doubted,” one ballad declares (66, ll. 423–24). Of course, few
                    things simply <emph>are</emph> in the poem, including fairies, for that
                    particular ballad reveals its otherworldly beings to be a group of singing
                    maids. Nevertheless, both this particular bardic offering and the longer poem of
                    which it is part embrace an aesthetic of enchantment, returning repeatedly to
                    the existence of the otherworldly. The traditional Scottish ballads that serve
                    as Hogg’s templates are themselves rife with supernatural encounters, to be
                    sure, but <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> ups the ante by importing
                    ballad sensibilities into the narrative framework of the poem, as the narrator
                    himself speaks of spirits roaming the Scottish countryside. Such spirits, he
                    declares, “stretch imagination’s power” (149, l. 1583) making spiritual
                    experience one of the poem’s practical and even theoretical modes and
                    objects.</p>
                <p>By “spiritual experience” in this context I mean something like the classical
                    definition furnished by William James: “abnormal psychical variations” and
                    “exalted emotional sensibilit[ies]” (9). Perhaps better, it designates what
                    modern scholars of spiritual experience in psychology and philosophy identify as
                    “intense experiences[:] .&#160;.&#160;. liminal, profound, numinous, extreme,
                    transcendental, traumatic, sublime,” and so on. Such experiences entail a
                    “cognitive and emotional potency that focuses attention” and consist of a “rich
                    interconnection of ideas, memories, and emotions that weaves normally separated
                    parts of life into a single field of meaning” (Wildman, 104–05). <title
                        level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> exhibits such “weav[ing]” tendencies in
                    its imaginative premise, the wake hosted by Mary Queen of Scots that unifies
                    Scotland’s regional poetic traditions under a single national-literary aegis.
                    And the individual ballads certainly qualify as explorations of “intensity,”
                    whether narratively or in the complexity of their tone.</p>
                <p>Take, as one example, the ballad “The Witch of Fife,” which tells of “Quhat good
                    man never knew” (40, l. 626). A peasant’s wife and her companions are
                    transported one night to the top of Ben Lomond where they dance with the devil.
                    Then, a different night, they voyage to Lapland, where they are bathed by
                    “warlock men and weerd wemyng” in “witch-water” (44, ll. 733, 737). The
                    peasant’s/witch’s “gude-man” later accompanies her on a third excursion, this
                    time to the bishop’s vault in Carlisle, where he drinks himself silly before
                    being found by “five rough Englishmen” (47, l. 865), who “nickit the auld man,
                    and .&#160;.&#160;. prickit the auld man, / And .&#160;.&#160;. tyit him till
                    ane stone; / And they set ane bele-fire him about, / And they burnit him skin
                    and bone” (48, ll. 881–4).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Other ballads recount similarly
                        intense situations. In one, a bride sings about how her murdered father
                        harrows the bride’s “parricide lover” (36, l. 460); in another, a bard, we
                        are told, during “a night of dread [had] held convention with the dead” (75,
                        ll. 747–48); and across the countryside, the narrator informs us, “spirits
                        talk[] along the hill[s]” (106, l. 49).</note> The convergence of the
                    demonic with drunken revelry evokes Robert Burns’s well-known poem “Tam
                    O’Shanter,” but Hogg’s ballad intensifies the element of the grotesque in the
                    beating the “gude-man” receives. More pertinently, it stages a dramatic conflict
                    between the world of spirits (whether otherworldly or simply alcoholic) and the
                    lordship of vindictive Englishmen that introduces an interpretive crisis. Are we
                    supposed to believe the story we have read, or was it all a drunken
                    hallucination? The ballad does not answer this question, but it impresses as
                    real the <emph>effect</emph> of disgust even as it underscores the uncanny
                    narrative that conjures it.</p>
                <p>Many of the ballads in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> operate this
                    way, such that what draws us to them is less the explicability of their
                    spiritual dimensions on conventional interpretive grounds—the encounter with
                    spirits as nationalist allegories, say, or as some kind of libidinal
                    manifestation—than their sheer affect, the poetic faith or suspension of
                    disbelief these visitations elicit. Hogg, in other words, is as much a
                    literalist as Kandinsky, though in a different register. Kandinsky develops a
                    positive—that is, a positivist—theory about spiritual intensities (with color,
                    for example, producing “spiritual vibration[s]” as a kind of “psychological
                    effect”: yellow “is the typical earthly color,” whereas blue “is the typical
                    heavenly color” and so on [44, 58]).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Kandinsky appeals to the
                        analogy of music: “Generally speaking, color directly influences the soul.
                        Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with
                        many strings. The artist is the hand that plays” (45).</note> Hence, he
                    remarks: a “yellow triangle, a blue circle, a green square, or a green triangle,
                    a yellow circle, a blue square: all these are differently acting entities” (47).
                    Hogg, if anything, is more abstract than the arch-abstractionist Kandinsky
                    because Hogg’s menagerie of spiritual intensities is real without the figures
                    giving rise to it, the demons and witches, being quite believable. For Hogg,
                    that is, the spiritual is real, but not necessarily <emph>these</emph> spirits,
                    which might be mere figures, mere fictions. And the poet, therefore, is less a
                    prophet than the vehicle for the strangeness of what is numinous or sublime, or
                    for the illegibility of what we nevertheless experience. What is thus tangible
                    in reading <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> is the juxtaposition
                    between a quotidian experience with spirits (the everydayness of the uncanny)
                    and the simultaneous elevation and debasement of this experience to the mere
                    status of the literary.</p>
                <p>In introducing a rift between spiritual and literary experience, <title level="m"
                        >The Queen’s Wake</title> pre-emptively invalidates a principle that would
                    become associated with the modern concept of literature, a principle that Walter
                    Scott would animate the following year, 1814, with the publication of <title
                        level="m">Waverley</title>. This is the principle we understand today under
                    the rubric of cultural materialism, which explains not only how cultures emerge
                    but also how they inform the ways we think by differentiating, within
                    themselves, one domain of meaning from another—scientific fact, say, from folk
                    knowledge—along an axis of progress. As Scott famously explained at the
                    conclusion of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, “for the purpose of preserving
                    some idea of the ancient manners of which [he has] witnessed the almost total
                    extinction, [he has] embodied [them] in imaginary scenes .&#160;.&#160;..
                    Indeed, the most romantic parts of [<title level="m">Waverley</title>] are
                    precisely those which have a foundation in fact” (340). In essence, Scott
                    brackets as (mere) culture what a group of people experiences (or once
                    experienced) as vital. In <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, one sees
                    the rudiments of this principle articulated by the Lord of Mar, a character
                    based on the historical Earl of Mar who was a guardian of James V and,
                    afterwards, of Mary. At the conclusion of the poem, after the bards have all
                    sung their songs, a skirmish irrupts when no clear victor is named. “‘Twas party
                    all—not minstrel worth, / But honour of the south and north; / And nought was
                    heard throughout the court, / But taunt, and sneer, and keen retort” (165, ll.
                    82–85). So Mar takes the floor and explains that “taste, as sapient sages tell,
                    / Varies with climes in which we dwell” (165, ll. 106–07). So do the poems:
                    “Fair emblems of the Border dale, / Is cadence soft and simple tale; / While
                    stern romantic Highland clime, / Still nourishes the rude sublime” (165, ll.
                    108–11). Hence, so unlikely is it that the subjects of one region could enjoy
                    those of another, that Mar likens its prospect to an outbreak of supernatural or
                    even anti-natural incidents: “trow you may the tides adjourn, / And Nature from
                    her path-way turn; / The wild-duck drive to mountain tree, / The capperkayle [or
                    wood grouse] to swim the sea,” and so forth (166, ll. 120–23). So unnatural
                    would it be for a Highlander to approve of a Border poem that, as a solution,
                    Mar proposes that the three bards preferred by the majority of the auditors be
                    summoned to perform again, with the queen alone declaring the victor.</p>
                <p>It seems like a logical solution: inasmuch as each of us is encased, as Walter
                    Pater might say, within a thick wall of cultural personality (see Pater 60), let
                    the queen adjudicate poetic justice. (The situation anticipates the conclusion
                    of Scott’s 1827 story “The Two Drovers,” when a judge acknowledges the cultural
                    forces that motivated a Highlander to slay his English comrade before,
                    nevertheless, sentencing the unregenerate Highlander to death.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Scott, <title level="m">Chronicles</title> 124-46 (esp. 143–46).</note>)
                    Indeed, Mar’s proposal seems more nineteenth century, when <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> was composed, than sixteenth century, when it is set,
                    in that it grafts a classical aesthetic principle of unity amid variety onto an
                    Enlightenment-era world view held by stadial historians like Adam Smith and Lord
                    Kames, and onto the arguments of proto-anthropologists like Johann Gottfried
                    Herder, who crafted such histories into a theory of cultural relativity. In
                        <title level="m">Waverley</title>, of course, these dynamics yield diverse
                    “worlds”—Highland Jacobite, Lowland Jacobite, English, and so on—within an
                    encompassing modernity that operates as a reality principle differentiating the
                    durable stuff of history from the imaginary compensations, the merely spiritual
                    experiences, of romance.</p>
                <p>But think again about Mar’s assertion that an eclectic taste defies nature—the
                    kind of taste exhibited, incidentally, by Hogg’s imagined readers, who
                    supposedly have enjoyed all the ballads. Are Hogg’s readers unnatural? Perhaps
                    more to the point, do not virtually all the songs in <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> defy nature in some fashion, unless we call the traffic
                    with spirits, fairies, witches, and other supernatural forms natural? But if we
                    label such beings natural, at least in the <title level="m">Wake</title>, then
                    how do we account for the poetic charge, the aura of transport (of what is “more
                    than mortal,” as one song puts it [13, l. 244]) that attaches itself to these
                    episodes? If anything, the ballads articulate a conflicted relationship between
                    the natural and spiritual worlds, personified by the bard of Fife, who recounts
                    the song about the witches. This bard takes the stage bearing iconic hallmarks
                    of the medium: “Bushy his beard, and wild his eye,” with a “haggard cheek” and
                    thin, gray locks (39, l. 594). “He deemed that fays and spectres wan / Held
                    converse with the thoughts of man” (40, ll. 603–04). But, precisely because
                        <emph>he</emph> holds these attitudes, <emph>we</emph> do not. Or rather, we
                    believe such “converse” possible, but not as he does—or, if we do, as
                    exceptional rather than everyday occurrences, or as <emph>events</emph> rather
                    than <emph>customs</emph>. It is natural, the poem implies, to believe in
                    something other than what is superficially evident, especially to the degree
                    that we recognize differences between the worlds in which we live and the ones
                    in which we believe.</p>
                <p>In this way, <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> presents spiritual
                    experience as at once ubiquitous and romantic, as common and deeply strange. And
                    in that respect, predicating its poetic effects on a kind of fascinated
                    ambivalence, <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> seems utterly if also
                    uncannily modern—more so than Kandinsky’s concept of modern art as a conduit of
                    positive spiritual realities, but more so, too, than Scott’s delineation of a
                    literature as a reservoir of epistemic, ontological, and historical difference.
                        <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> at once drains this reservoir and
                    bursts the dam, voiding the spiritual of its literal status but insisting on a
                    constant flow of our experience with the unseen. In this way, the poem shrugs at
                    the prospects of difference as a literary value; and, with that gesture, it
                    renders literature in its modern guise an indifferent medium—an accessory to
                    life, but nothing essential.</p>
                <p>Hogg’s dialogue with Scott reaches an even higher pitch in <title level="m">The
                        Three Perils of Man</title>, published in 1822. In <title level="m"
                        >Perils</title>, the existential status of romance and the modern cultural
                    status of the literary are on particularly acute display. As Graham Tulloch
                    reveals, Hogg initially had a different title in mind—<title level="m">The
                        Perilous Castle: A Tale of Chivalry</title>—because he planned to write a
                    different kind of narrative, one directly responding to Scott. This “perilous
                    castle” and its corresponding “tale” referred to the Roxburgh fortress and to
                    the battle over it between lords of competing English and Scottish kingdoms, the
                    winner earning the hand of the princess of his realm. Scott had twice dealt with
                    this story, “once in a note to <title level="m">The Lord of the Isles</title> in
                    1815 and again in his essay ‘Chivalry,’ which appeared in February 1818”
                    (Tulloch 158). In visiting this territory himself, Hogg sought not only to draft
                    off Scott’s success, but also to reflect critically on “Scott’s first long
                    poetic romance, <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>, [which]
                    was explicitly a tale of ‘Border chivalry’” (161). However, in the version of
                    the novel he eventually published, Hogg devoted a greater share of attention to
                    a new castle, Aikwood, and to a story that deals not with chivalry, but rather
                    with witchcraft and the supernatural. This was, Tulloch remarks, “a much more
                    familiar ground” for Hogg (166), and the lengthy portion of the novel devoted to
                    it—despite Scott’s critique of it, and despite Hogg’s own lament, later, that he
                    had “retarded the main story” by indulging it—is much more assured than the
                    Roxburgh narrative. In this Aikwood section, references to the supernatural,
                    spirits, demons, and fairies abound, with Hogg “interpos[ing] no .&#160;.&#160;.
                    sceptical voice” to undercut the narrative (169).</p>
                <p>We are then, in this Aikwood section, once again squarely in the realm of
                    spirits. At its center, however, is an enigmatic and protracted tale-telling
                    contest that reproduces the conceit of the poetic competition in <title
                        level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>. A motley assemblage of characters—among
                    them Charlie Scott, a member of the Douglas clan seeking to recapture the castle
                    of Roxburgh; a friar; a homely laird; a gluttonous laborer; a fair damsel; and a
                    poet—makes its way to Aikwood to seek the prophetic wisdom of the wizard,
                    Michael Scott. Scott has no interest in granting the company’s wish, instead
                    imprisoning the group within the castle. After extended experiences with
                    “diablerie” of various kinds (like metamorphoses of humans into animals,
                    enchanted feasts in which degraded elements—“the joint of a frog’s leg, or that
                    of a rat” [<title level="m">Perils</title> 200]—take the form of sumptuous
                    meats, and so on), a skirmish breaks out between Scott’s demonic servants and
                    the castle’s human inhabitants, and Scott finds himself fighting alongside the
                    company he has imprisoned. He does not entirely become a comrade in arms,
                    however, and after staving off the supernatural turncoats he threatens to starve
                    the group by refusing to grant its release. However, Scott agrees to preserve
                    the life of Delany, the beautiful maid, by giving her to the member of the group
                    who can tell him the best tale. Thus resumes, in effect, the conceit of the
                    competition from <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>.</p>
                <p>And, provocatively, thus concludes our consort with spirits, at least
                    temporarily. For the tales mostly involve human circumstances. The friar, the
                    first raconteur, rehearses (in the Biblical language of chapter and verse) the
                    story of his love for a woman who falls, herself, for a soldier and then has a
                    child by him. This child, the party immediately discovers, is Delany. The laird
                    then tells a story about a meat-loving shepherd—a member of their party, Tam
                    Craik, it turns out—who, in a moment of weakness, slaughters a “fat ewe lamb”
                        (<title level="m">Perils</title> 258). Charlie Scott, the loyal clansman,
                    then takes a turn and tells a story about a battle with English forces, and
                    about his action in sparing the life of a small child—who proves to be the poet,
                    as the latter reveals to the others upon hearing Charlie’s story. At this
                    disclosure, “Charlie’s visage altered into lengthened amazement.&#160;.&#160;..
                    ‘Gude faith but we are a queer set that are prickit up on top o’ this tower
                    thegither’” (292–93), he exclaims. “Od,” echoes Tam, “we seem to ken mair about
                    ane anither than ony ane o’ us kens about ourselves” (293). More than merging
                    life and art, the tales bind the group to each other, interweaving a community
                    from the aleatory associations that initially brought the group together. In
                    this respect, the enchanted circumstances the party had witnessed in Aikwood
                    castle evolve from the encounter with demons to the bewitching effects of
                    narrative itself, and this despite the relative absence of supernatural events
                    within the individual tales.</p>
                <p>The magical quality of storytelling in this competition becomes more significant
                    in light of the critique in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> of
                    literature’s bifurcation from life. There, in that earlier work, Romantic
                    artifice effectively divides literary from quotidian experience, a space of
                    ontological difference from a more expansive existence in which actuality and
                    possibility commingle (instead of being relegated to different positions on the
                    grid of history). In <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title>, Romantic
                    artifice is again brought under scrutiny, though here it reconciles the binary
                    between the literary and the everyday as the tales presented in the competition
                    in Aikwood castle mediate the actual (and revealed) relationships subsisting
                    between the characters. In this respect, <title level="m">Perils</title>
                    “explores not just what stories <emph>are</emph>, but whom or what they are
                        <emph>for</emph> in a particular culture” (Fielding 70)—or rather, and more
                    ambitiously, I would say, what they are for <emph>generally</emph>, and not only
                    for a particular, Romanticized body of individuals or readers. <title level="m"
                        >Perils</title>, that is, does <emph>not</emph> encase narrative within a
                    particular cultural context. It thus revises “the Enlightenment allegory of
                    cultural progress as a disenchantment of the world” (Duncan, <title level="m"
                        >Scott’s Shadow</title> 194–95) wherein the transporting effects of
                    narrative are <foreign>a priori</foreign> contained as mere literature, or as
                    “real” only for the benighted sensibilities of older societies echoing from out
                    of the dustbin of history.</p>
                <p>In <title level="m">Perils</title>, as in <title level="m">The Queen’s
                        Wake</title>, the domain in which this revision occurs is that of (what I am
                    calling) the spiritual. I make this claim with an eye to the specific nature of
                    Hogg’s evocation in these texts of supernatural agents—fairies, ghosts, demons,
                        <emph>stories</emph>—and a correlative set of intense experiences as the
                    media of a unified relation between literature and life. In Hogg’s work, as in
                    the landscape outside Aikwood castle, “the heavens and the earth seem[] mingled
                    together” (199), as do diverse elements of society (from the Edinburgh elite to
                    the Border peasants whose traditional and bewitching literary forms attracted
                    wide attention). Such eclectic inclusivity is part of the history of the modern
                    novel, explained perhaps most memorably by Bakhtin as “a phenomenon multiform in
                    style and variform in speech and voice” (261). In early nineteenth-century
                    Scotland, however, the reputed heteroglossia of the novel form was at least
                    partly contained within a historicist framework that relegated peasant tales and
                    the <foreign>Völkisch</foreign> beliefs on which they were predicated to an
                    evocative, romantic past. This makes <title level="m">Perils</title> the emblem
                    of a different kind of literary history, one that scrambles the idea of
                    progress. More evocatively for us, it casts Hogg’s fiction as an important case
                    study for a post-secular age in which belief in the unseen seems at once
                    impossible and necessary. Amy Hungerford, for example, argues that literary
                    studies in the postmodern age is defined by a <emph>belief in
                        meaninglessness</emph>, which is to say, by a faith in fictive world-making
                    as the vehicle “of crucial cultural work in the age of literature’s waning
                    social prestige and its eclipse by other media” (xiv–xv). We believe, in other
                    words, in the power and importance of texts and narratives we know to be false,
                    or at least fictive. And yet, if literature is still to mean anything, Hogg
                    might tell us, it is by marshaling the kind of faith that converts belief into
                    something more empowering: it must oppose, that is, the logic of
                        <emph>mere</emph> belief, of a strictly <emph>literary</emph> authority or
                    purely <emph>poetic</emph> faith. Instead, literature must derive its power from
                    its continuity with life, from its concourse with the kind of meaning that
                    transcends the university, let alone genres, fields, and disciplines. Conceived
                    as a kind of spiritual experience, literary narratives may not be “fiction,”
                    after all. Copping to anything else just recapitulates the history of the novel,
                    of <title level="m">Waverley</title>.</p>
