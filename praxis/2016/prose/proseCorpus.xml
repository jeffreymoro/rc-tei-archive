               <p rend="noCount">The sense of an occasion is inseparable from the productivity that
                    characterizes Romantic prose. Carl Schmitt's account of the "subjective
                    occasionalism" of Romanticism offers us an analytical point of departure. But I
                    argue that Romantic prose tries to deepen, extend, or formalize this sense of
                    occasion. It tries to express, and sometimes embeds within itself, the social
                    conditions of acts of utterance.</p>

                  <p>Reading Carl Schmitt feels similar to reading Burke: they both seem so wrong, and
                    yet surprisingly right in some ways. <title level="m">Political
                        Romanticism</title> is the text that I think is worth returning to for a
                    closer look. Schmitt is better known these days as a theorist of sovereignty,
                    but this early work, published in Berlin the year following Lukaćs’s <title level="m">Theory of the Novel</title> (1918), offers a remarkable analysis
                    of Romanticism as a movement. Analysis may be too neutral a term: it is more of
                    an indictment. But the overall effect is bracing. Particularly at a moment when
                    Romanticism seems in danger of simply being forgotten or absorbed into the
                    greater nineteenth century, there is something invigorating in seeing it
                    attacked with so much energy. Schmitt’s account has a new relevance today in
                    light of our interest in affective experience. It also reveals the roots in
                    Romanticism of what Judith Shklar called “the liberalism of fear,” which rests
                    on the conviction that emotions are in no way “inferior to ideas and especially
                    to political causes” (32). (Indeed, Romanticism could be said to name the
                    intersection of affect and liberalism, a deeply compromised location in
                    Schmitt’s eyes.) But what I wish to examine here is the way that Schmitt’s
                    concept of political romanticism illuminates a peculiar feature of Romantic
                    prose: its constitutive awareness of its own occasion. </p>
                  <p>My challenge here is to find a way of discussing Romantic prose without reducing
                    it to any single genre and without collapsing it into medium. While the concept
                    of prose certainly predates media studies, I would like to think that it still
                    cannot be simply absorbed into the idea of mediation or mediality. I also want
                    to address questions of belief and aesthetics in a way that is different from
                    those who have linked Humean skepticism to the rise of fictionality in this
                        period.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Duncan’s powerful argument, in
                        particular pp. 116–44, as well as Gallagher’s account of fictionality, to
                        both of which I am indebted.</note> For these reasons, I will trace a rather
                    eclectic itinerary that begins with Schmitt, turns to Wordsworth, and then to
                    Jacques Rancière’s recent account of the “passage from <foreign>belles
                        lettres</foreign> to literature” (34) that seems to pick up speed toward the
                    end of the eighteenth century. These accounts offer a usefully capacious scale,
                    as well as a way to address the situated quality of prose in the world and its
                    varied relations to experience at this historical juncture.</p>
                  <p>I will start by summarizing Schmitt’s account of “the structure of romantic
                    spirit.” It doesn’t take long, since in a way Schmitt’s work is a miracle of
                    reductiveness. It aims to cut Romanticism down to size. With visible impatience,
                    Schmitt condemns the failure of the German Romantics to decide, to act, or even
                    to acknowledge the necessity of action and decision. We can discern in his
                    response to Novalis, the Schlegels, and Adam Müller in particular, the outlines
                    of Schmitt’s belief in sovereignty and his later concept of the political as
                    based on the distinction between enemy and friend. Burke and De Maistre earn his
                    respect, since they were men of action. Other Romantics, however, do nothing but
                    emit “a lyrical and discursive tremolo of ideas that sprang from the decision
                    and the responsibility of others” (159). One of the central features of
                    Romanticism, in Schmitt’s eyes, is its primary commitment to productivity of a
                    particular sort. It is a pure idea or practice of productivity as a state of
                    being, an end in itself rather than a means. This is what Schmitt seems to mean
                    by “aesthetic productivity.” Romantics do not produce actual works of art or
                    representations (or real theories or objects), but only pure affect or mood:
                    “intensity of subjective impression is all that matters” (97). Aesthetic
                    productivity can be thought of as the continual production of experience through
                    the negation of the external world. “The unbroken subjectivism of early
                    Romanticism saw an achievement even in the impressionistic experience. Affect as
                    a psychic fact was intrinsically interesting” (97). Changes in the intensity of
                    affective states were “both the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem” of
                    Romantic productivity (97). </p>
                  <p>Aesthetic productivity is conceivable because of a particular attitude toward the
                    world for which Schmitt invents the name “subjective occasionalism.” He draws a
                    parallel with the occasionalism elaborated by Malebranche and other early modern
                    philosophers who viewed God as the single true cause; events and actions,
                    including the coordination of mind and body, were simply occasions of a higher
                    power being exercised. What happens in Fichte and other German Romantics,
                    according to Schmitt, is that the subjective ego assumes that higher position
                    and power. Romantic occasionalism recognizes nothing higher than the subject’s
                    arbitrary whims, though these latter might be disguised as the workings of a
                    superindividual power such as history. Schmitt argues that Romantic writers
                    refuse to acknowledge any basis for events, “where basis . . .
                    signifies both causal explanation and normative justification or legitimation”
                    (81). Their cardinal sin in Schmitt’s eyes is the rejection of norms, of
                    causality, and even of any fixed context that could provide the ground of either
                    explanation or justification. Occasion replaces causality: “if anything provides
                    a complete definition of Romanticism, it is the lack of any relationship to a
                        <foreign>causa</foreign>.” Romanticism rejects the possibility of a
                    “calculable and adequate relationship of cause and effect . . . an
                    absolutely inadequate relationship obtains between <emph>occasio and
                        effect</emph>” (82–83, original emphasis).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a subtle
                        reading of Scott’s first novel, <title level="m">Waverley</title>, in
                        relation to Schmitt’s argument, see Jerome Christensen, 161 ff.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several further characteristics of Romanticism arise from its occasionalism. As
                    anything concrete is merely an occasion, “everything can be substituted for
                    everything else” (158). What ought to be fixed categories or consistent
                    relations disappear. “The Romantic subject can regard distinctly heterogeneous
                    and antithetical processes and configurations as the beginning of the Romantic
                    novel” (123). Schmitt frequently alludes to this latter phrase from Novalis’s
                    sixty-sixth fragment (“Anfang eines unendlichen Romans”) with inexhaustible
                    contempt. Finally, Schmitt suggests that Romantic occasionalism brings about a
                    radical shift of scale, though he does not use that term himself. Instead of
                    norms, concepts, and decisions—acts measurable on a political scale—Romantics
                    deal in “associations, colors, [and] sounds that are combined in an admixture,”
                    qualities and phenomena that might appear microscopically small, even
                    infra-subjective (107). Schmitt sees this tendency as an example not of humility
                    but of grandiosity. Turning his back on reality, the Romantic subject could
                    claim to discern in any fragment a “totality . . . a construct that
                    unfolds without any interest in empirical reality” (73). </p>
                  <p>What Schmitt describes may help us better understand the structure of Romantic
                    prose. This may seem an entirely counter-intuitive argument, given Hegel’s
                    well-circulated phrase, “the prose of the world.” There, prose is not just a
                    metaphor, but a historical condition characterized by the recalcitrant
                    objectivity that refuses to combine with the life of the spirit. This is the
                    very objectivity that Schmitt finds so completely lacking in Romantic writers.
                    But I’d like to set against Hegel’s phrase a different, perhaps equally
                    influential work that offers a different view of prose. Wordsworth’s 1800
                    Preface to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> reads almost like a
                    formalist’s carefully considered response to Schmitt’s criticism of Romanticism.
                    As we all know, Wordsworth argues on behalf of “the affinity betwixt metrical
                    and prose composition” (156). The best moments of poems make use of “strictly
                    the language of prose” (154). But if the distinction between poetry and prose
                    becomes blurry, the real target of criticism emerges in the form of what Schmitt
                    calls subjective occasionalism, with equal emphasis placed on subjectivity and
                    occasionalism. The scourge of poetic diction arises from an exaltation of the
                    ego, from “a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet’s character,”
                    fed by readerly “self-love” (188). Poets and writers of all genres are tempted
                    to “indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression, in order to
                    furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites” (144). Poetic diction is
                    particularly a threat, Wordsworth writes, because it is “arbitrary, and subject
                    to <emph>infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be
                    made</emph>” (171, my emphasis). Here is Schmitt, again:
                        “<foreign>occasio</foreign> . . . negates the concept of
                        <foreign>causa</foreign>, in other words, the force of a calculable
                    causality, and thus also every binding norm” (16–17). </p>
                  <p>What Wordsworth proposes as a remedy is exactly what Schmitt finds missing in
                    Romanticism: what the latter calls “nomological regularity” (57). Wordsworth’s
                    laws are of course twofold. Meter itself “obeys certain laws, to which the Poet
                    and Reader both willingly submit because they are certain” (170). But there are
                    the laws of second nature, too, which create a reliable regularity. Wordsworth
                    prescribes to the poet “repeated experience and regular feelings,” to be
                    followed by “repetition” of acts of reflection, until “such habits of mind will
                    be produced, that, by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those
                    habits, we shall describe objects, and utter sentiments, of such a nature, and
                    in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the Reader must
                    necessarily be in some degree enlightened, and his affections strengthened . .
                    .” (146). Necessity, as opposed to chance or occasion, pervades this process,
                    shaping every connection along the entire relay. Meter or regular rhythm
                    supplies, in the realm of form but also in that of psychology, the “purposive or
                    normative nexus” (17) whose absence in Romanticism Schmitt deplores.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wordsworth describes the effect of iambic pentameter as “small,
                        but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
                        arrangement” (459).</note> In his later preface of 1815, Wordsworth develops
                    the contrast of lawfulness and occasionalism through the imagination/fancy
                    antithesis: the imagination’s “processes of creation or of composition [are]
                    governed by certain fixed laws,” unlike those of fancy, which are “as capricious
                    as the accidents of things” (31, 36). The distinction between fixed laws and
                    accident or caprice, then, is fundamental to the organization of Romantic
                    aesthetic experience.</p>
                  <p>Prose by definition lacks an internal or formal principle of regularity, though
                    at least it has the negative advantage of being free of the “transitory and
                    accidental ornaments” that disfigure bad poetry. But Romantic prose has a
                    complex relation to occasionalism. It does not consider there to be, in
                    Schmitt’s words, “an absolutely inadequate relationship between occasio and
                    effect.” In fact, I would like to suggest the opposite: that Romantic prose
                        <emph>does</emph> acknowledge a purposive nexus, that it creates that nexus
                    out of its own occasion and is constituted by it. Wordsworth’s own prefaces
                    offer an example: the 1800 preface to the second edition of the Lyrical Ballads
                    is followed two years later by an appendix, both of which are then supplemented
                    by the 1815 essay, which Wordsworth then connected back to the 1800 preface
                    starting in 1836-37.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Owen and Smyser, vol. 1,
                        130–31.</note> It is not so much the productivity as the purposiveness that
                    is striking, as well as Wordsworth’s apparent inability to fully accomplish what
                    it is he wants to do through his critical prose. His writing does
                        <emph>not</emph> show, in Rancière’s words, “mind [that] has become
                    conscious of its own domain and has taken possession of a language that has
                    become a neutral instrument for the expression of thought” (82).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Rancière thus paraphrases Hegel’s account of the supersession
                        of poetry.</note> What we see, rather, is the repeated attempt to express
                    thought as a way both to acknowledge and to overcome an occasion—in Wordsworth’s
                    case, that of public judgment.</p>
                  <p>What does Romantic prose try to do and how? Does it imitate something or does it
                    express something? Is it transitive or intransitive, to borrow Rancière’s
                    metaphor? I want to consider Romantic prose, with a final allusion to
                    Wordsworth, as a non-spontaneous, purposive expression first and foremost,
                    rather than simply as a representation. The meanings of these last two terms I
                    adopt from Rancière’s account of the cultural shift that produced a modern
                    understanding of literature. Very briefly, a “representative poetics” concerns
                    itself with arranging and imitating, in certain prescribed ways, the actions of
                    humans; fiction-making is accepted and judged as a social activity among others,
                    carried out in a certain milieu. With the Romantic “absolutization of art” (35),
                    this mimetic or representational regime breaks apart. A quality that Rancière
                    calls “poeticity,” following Schlegel, is discovered in anything that seems to
                    speak, inadequately and incompletely, of the existence of a hidden power or
                    spirit within it. The new “regime of expressivity” (60) presupposes a concept of
                    language as material incarnation, as more expressive of its source than anything
                    it might indicate about a shared, external world of praxis that it might be
                    showing us. This focus on the phenomenon of expression as such comes to dominate
                    over the earlier notion of words as “instruments of a discourse of persuasion or
                    seduction” (55). Plots made by and about human subjects also become less
                    compelling than the apparently limitless capacity of language as style, as
                    writing, to go anywhere at all.</p>
                  <p> The primary interest of Romantic prose, I want to suggest, does not lie in
                    creating either a vivid or a decorous representation of people acting. It does
                    not or cannot offer a “determinate set of ideas about . . . what
                    causes make [subjects] act and what effects those causes produce” (Rancière
                    116). I will venture to say that this holds true even for the novels of the
                    period, as well as for the not-quite-novels, the more-than-novels, and the
                    not-at-all-novels that the essays in this volume consider. Rather, Romantic
                    prose of all genres seems to push dialectically at the boundaries of
                    inarticulateness. Sometimes the inarticulateness seems to function as a
                    rhetorical device, a sign of affect, and a response to the times, as in Burke.
                    The drama of expression seems to overwhelm the mimetic function, as language
                    attempts to incarnate spirit—whether the spirit(s) of the folk, as in Hogg, or
                    that of the literary absolute, in Lamb’s essays. </p>
                  <p>Yet in those writers and the others considered in this volume, this elevation of
                    expressivity does not seem to entail the subjective occasionalism that Schmitt
                    finds in Romanticism, the sense that everything is in the end merely an occasion
                    for the production of private affect. What seems to still operate in Romantic
                    prose is a sense of performative utterance, of speech as a social action that is
                    performed in a certain setting—even if it brings about ineffable private
                    effects. What prompts utterance as well as blocks it, what legitimates it, in
                    short, its own historical and social conditions are taken into and reflected in
                    the utterance itself. Romantic prose seems to strive to make its own
                    occasionalism appear less of a tenuous thing. The occasion is felt and
                    acknowledged as the ground of evaluating the speech-act. The transitive or
                    effective power of expression is emphasized. Speech acts are felt to embody, in
                    Cavell’s striking paraphrase of Emerson, “the promise that the private and the
                    social will be achieved together” (114). I have referred to speech and to speech
                    acts because the idea of the spoken seems to be surprisingly inseparable from
                    the prose of this period. As several of the essays here show in relation to
                    Hogg’s tales, Lamb’s essays, and in the discursive techniques of Austen’s
                    novels, prose engages the occasion of utterance. At the same time, it is not the
                    case that they simply show people speaking. Affects and sensations are generated
                    at levels that disrupt the usual scale of action and utterance. Caught between
                    the representative and the expressive, Romantic prose persuades, seduces,
                    embodies, entangles, as it tries to deepen and strengthen the many-sided
                    connections between its occasion and its effect.</p>
                  <p>The first two essays in this volume take up the sui generis writings of James
                    Hogg. Matthew Wickman opens the discussion with a rich consideration of the
                    place of the spirit—and of spirits—in two of Hogg’s works. Both of these place
                    at their center a competition carried on through speech: ballads in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, tales in <title level="m">The Three
                        Perils of Man</title>. Wickman shows how Hogg refutes the historicizing
                    framework of the modern novel that cordons off literature “as a reservoir of
                    epistemic, ontological, and historical difference.” Instead, Hogg summons
                    occasion and chance within his story to find spirit, and spirits, everywhere.
                    The diegetic mechanism of plot weaves disparate phenomena into a single, unified
                    field. Focusing on Hogg’s “The Mysterious Bride,” Anthony Jarrells offers a
                    suggestive examination of the complicity of ballad and tale as genres. The
                    often-overlooked genre of the tale emerges as a supremely Romantic one in Hogg’s
                    handling. It is built not only on conscious remediation, but also on the
                    negation of the social “fact” represented by traditional balladry. Jarrells
                    argues that tales occupy “a genuine middle position . . . between
                    orality and literacy.” They manage to balance two very different ideas of art:
                    the spoken representation of actions and their effects, and the mute display
                    through language of a vanishing culture.</p>
                  <p>The next two essays present striking defamiliarizations of the genre of the novel
                    and what we might call its ethical instrumentality. Instead of providing the
                    straightforward representation of a plot or action by means of a diegetic
                    apparatus, Sydney Owenson and Jane Austen are both shown to explore, in
                    Rancière’s words, “the power of unbound perceptions and affections, of
                    individuations in which individuals are lost” (118). Miranda Burgess brilliantly
                    situates Owenson in the context of Thomas Reid’s common-sense philosophy,
                    uncovering the novelist’s interest in questions of causality and experience.
                    Burgess draws our attention to the radically and purposefully formless
                    empiricism of Owenson’s prose. Owenson’s descriptions, she argues, “dwell
                    constantly in sensation” without attaching these experiences to fixed forms or
                    identities. But what’s significant about this maneuver are the ethical, even
                    normative implications it carries. Stuart Burrows offers a subtle reading of the
                    complexity of utterance within Austen’s diegetic world. Burrows finds in
                    Austen’s novels a curiously distributed type of expression in which “almost
                    every character speaks for, through, or on behalf of another.” Private thoughts
                    are often recognized only when uttered by another. <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, with its “remarkable lack of interest in specifying who
                    is speaking and when,” imagines an intensely personal, private speech that is
                    deliberately detached from any particular subjectivity. Rather, utterances become
                    almost free-floating events that re-envision the relation of private to social
                    experience. </p>
                  <p>De Quincey and Lamb are writers to whom Schmitt’s characterization of Romanticism
                    could perhaps best be applied: they both openly avow aesthetic productivity and
                    occasionalism. Timothy Milnes and Andrew Warren, however, show how deeply these
                    essayists depend on situating their own utterances as exemplary social actions.
                    The familiar essay in Lamb’s hands builds on the Humean practice of creating “a
                    shared community of opinion and belief” as the basis of experience. However, as
                    Milnes lucidly argues, Lamb foregrounds his own subjective occasionalism and
                    even allows it to open up the possibility that aesthetic productivity could
                    become a reliable, recognizable occasion for sympathy, albeit imperfect. De
                    Quincey, though speaking in a different register of “impassioned prose,” also
                    relies on perlocutionary effects, as Warren shows in the exuberant essay that
                    closes this collection. Most strikingly, De Quincey elaborates and puts into
                    practice a theory of expression that places contingent features of the occasion
                    at the heart of any attempt to capture experience. Language is material
                    entanglement, but that very entanglement forces us to try to decipher the
                    lasting, the binding, perhaps even the calculable within it. Romantic prose,
                    then, fixes its occasions into form. </p>

                    spiritual intensities to the status of cultural differences from everyday life.
                    Hogg did not divide up the world in quite that way, a point with implications

                  <p>Is there a place for the spiritual in literature? On its surface, the answer to
                    this question would seem to be yes, whether we respond with an eye to the
                    tradition of liberal humanism (where most comers are, if not welcome, at least
                    tolerated, even in an era of microaggressions) or to the present era of the
                    postsecular. Indeed, as Justine Murison and Jordan Alexander Stein remark, “the
                    ‘religious turn’ in literary studies—taking place since the late 1990s but
                    reimagined in more urgent terms following 9/11—has made a discipline-wide
                    fashion” of religion and hence, by extension, of a category like spirituality
                    (1). And yet, religion is hardly a self-evident category (are we talking about
                    sectarian institutions? about a militant organization like ISIS? about something
                    more broadly anthropological, like the connection between language and ritual?),
                    and neither, perforce, is the spiritual. Rosi Braidotti, for example, appeals to
                    “postsecular spirituality” (251) as a way of forging a materialist ethics that
                    is “resolutely atheistic” (256). Her reason for invoking a traditionally
                    religious category to make a patently non-religious argument is that postsecular
                    spirituality provides a nuanced matrix for a concept of subjectivity “linked to
                    affects, to the imagination,” and to notions of “transformative becoming”
                    (251).</p>
                  <p>And yet, none of this really answers the question of whether there is a place for
                    the spiritual in literature, or what that place might be (are we talking about a
                    thematic subject? a principle of form? allusive atmospherics?), if only because
                    we have not defined what we mean by <emph>the spiritual</emph>. But is an
                    adequate definition even possible? I ask because, as the young Derrida reminded
                    us in endless analyses of Hegel, the spiritual may not simply be one category in
                    a sea of others.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For matter to <emph>be</emph>, for it to have
                        something like an essence, it must also be spiritual. Hence, “to be opposed
                        to its own tendency, to itself, to matter, it must be spirit. And it if
                        yields to this tendency, it is still spirit. It is spirit in any case; its
                        essence is nothing but spiritual. There is no essence but spiritual”
                        (Derrida 22).</note> Consider Steven Goldsmith’s recent, and cogent,
                    observations concerning the status of the imagined dialectical opposite of the
                    spiritual, the material, in modern literary studies:<quote>
                        No doubt materialism is too multivalent to invoke so broadly, but it is
                            also a conceptual ground so pervasive as to operate virtually
                            uncontested. If materialism means “the explanation of the higher by the
                            lower,” as Bourdieu once suggested, it encompasses not only Marxist
                            tradition but our criticism’s tendency always to descend further (toward
                            whatever is smallest, neglected, and least elevated or heroic), with its
                            understanding that beneath the materialist floor as currently conceived
                            there is always a still lower condition awaiting discovery
                            . . .. Although we might challenge or promote one version or
                            another (historicist, economic, affective, dialectical, speculative,
                            ecological, thing theorized, object oriented, new empirical), no one
                            today would seriously argue <emph>against</emph> materialism—and that
                            consensus is enough to make me wonder about the work we want our
                            materialisms to perform. (416)</quote> While I concur with
                    Goldsmith’s conclusions, the “multivalent” status of materialism reintroduces
                    the notion of the spiritual through the back door. Consider what it means for
                    there to be, in Bourdieu’s words, a “higher” notion of materialism, a kind of
                    (divine or simply peer-review-sanctioned) canon under which we may group the
                    various orders of materiality (“historicist, economic, affective, dialectical,
                    speculative, ecological,” and so on). In the scenario Goldsmith outlines, the
                    material <emph>is</emph> (also the) spiritual.</p>
                  <p>So, is the spiritual also material in literature? That is to say, while the
                    spiritual may find a place in any text or critical apparatus (like the presence
                    of the void in any mathematical set, which is impossible to exclude since
                    “nothing” might always be added), does it count there; does it
                        <emph>matter</emph>? This question is becoming increasingly relevant in the
                    humanities, during an era when tightening university budgets tend to invite new
                    scrutiny of literary scholarship, with charges occasionally laid against it of
                    obscurantism, political homogeneity, and the sacrifice of “big questions” to
                    small stakes hobbyhorsery.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Louis Menand discusses this
                        development in <title level="m">The Marketplace of Ideas</title>.</note> The
                    spiritual is a kind of index for questions of meaning and value, and while never
                    shorn of politics (who decides what is meaningful?), it nevertheless carries
                    with it an aura of import for a vaguely imagined public sphere. This means that
                    to pose the question of the spiritual in literature is to jostle the lid on
                    Pandora’s box.</p>
                  <p>Or, perhaps, it just means doing history. For the question of the spiritual in
                    literature is hardly new, and it is one chapter of that history, or one portion
                    of one chapter, that I wish to address here. The Scottish poet, essayist,
                    novelist, songwriter, collector, and shepherd James Hogg frequently invoked the
                    spiritual—more specifically in Hogg’s case, the presence of spirits—in his work,
                    and did so from under the aegis of both religion (whether fanatical or moderate)
                    and folk culture. For Hogg, the spiritual is a fact of existence, though it is
                    rarely, if ever, a straightforward fact for literature. This is most famously
                    the case in his brilliant and experimental narrative <title level="m">The
                        Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</title>, in which the
                    account of a murder is rehearsed twice, the second time from within the mind of
                    a religious zealot who has been deceived by an extended relationship with the
                    devil incarnate. The proximity to evil functions in the <title level="m">Confessions</title>, Ian Duncan argues, as “a powerful critique of the
                    Scottish philosophical account of sympathy as the foundation of moral sentiment,
                    the ethical system that regulates civil society” (“Fanaticism” 58). Robert
                    Wringhim’s sympathy for the devil, his destructive attachment to ideas and
                    narratives that distort the actual conditions of his existence, reveals
                    fanaticism to be “the dialectical product of objective historical processes of
                    modernization” (59), the uncanny obverse of progress that divulges, in place of
                    a “primitive moral force” (59), a state of disenfranchisement.</p>
                  <p>But spirits take multiple forms in Hogg’s work. Accordingly, spirituality meets
                    with multiple uses. And here, in my essay, it is not the <title level="m">Confessions</title>, but rather two other Hogg texts under examination,
                    texts that take a more ecumenical approach to the problem of the spiritual. One
                    is Hogg’s long poem <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, which stages a
                    competition between bards from across sixteenth-century Scotland. The other is
                    the sprawling narrative <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title>, a text
                    initially conceived as a tale of chivalry (in subversive homage to Walter
                    Scott), but which devolves into a story about witchcraft and, crucially,
                    tale-telling (in which Hogg resuscitates the premise of a competition among
                    raconteurs, the conceit of <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>). Similarly
                    to <title level="m">Confessions</title>, a dialectic establishes itself in these
                    texts by way of a traffic with spirits, though here it is not civil society that
                    Hogg places on trial as much as literature itself, specifically the modern
                    concept of the literary as a species of imaginative writing set against a
                    normative sphere of everyday life. Anthony Jarrells presents a variation on this
                    point in his essay in this volume, remarking that Hogg adheres to “an idea of
                    experience thoroughly grounded in belief, including belief in ghosts, miracles,
                    divine intervention, and supernatural visitations, none of which”—and this is my
                    point—“are consistent with real life as represented in novels” (par. 15).
                    Offsetting my argument somewhat from Jarrells’s, what concerns Hogg is less the
                    status of literature per se than its dialectic with reality and the schism that
                    such a dialectic implies—something both <title level="m">The Queen’s
                        Wake</title> and <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title> undercut.
                    Each, then, exemplifies a kind of Bakhtinian heteroglossia, a condition
                    historically associated with the novel. Neither text, however, is a novel (even
                        <title level="m">Perils</title> presents itself more as a meandering tale,
                    an exercise in narrative bricolage), and the multitude of voices these texts
                    unleash militate less against particular literary forms (e.g., for Bakhtin, the
                    epic) than against “the literary” as such.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miranda Burgess
                        makes a similar point relative to Sydney Owensen in her essay in this
                        volume. She treats Owensen’s incongruities of style “as symptoms of a
                        historical conflict that refuses to be symbolically resolved” (par.
                        2).</note> Hogg’s work thus evokes and undercuts the modern novel, at least
                    as imagined as the <emph>modern</emph> narrative form (<foreign>pace</foreign>
                    Walter Benjamin<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See especially Benjamin’s essay “The
                        Storyteller.”</note>). Hogg thus makes a place for novelistic prose that, in
                    one fashion, at least (with Scott as its dialectical antithesis), is irreducible
                    to the same. Call it an engagement with the <emph>spirit</emph> of the
                    novel.</p>
                  <p>The title of my essay alludes to Wassily Kandinsky’s famous treatise <title level="m">Concerning the Spiritual in Art</title>, published in 1912, a
                    century after Hogg composed <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> (which
                    appeared in January 1813). Kandinsky’s aim was to delineate the relationship
                    between the spirit of the age and the forms of art. “Every work of art is the
                    child of its time,” his treatise begins. And “[i]t follows that each period of
                    culture produces an art of its own” (23). The concept of the spiritual in
                    Kandinsky’s long essay is part Percy Shelley, part Hegel in that it consists in
                    a set of idealized abstractions that take shape in history. Similar elements
                    inform <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, where Hogg synthesizes
                    something like a “spirit of Scotland” from the diverse ballads, or “songs,” that
                    constitute it. Of particular interest here, with Kandinsky in mind, are Hogg’s
                    references to colors and shapes, and particularly to distorted perspectives—to
                    “silver curve[s]” in the water cut by the prows of boats (26, l. 140), or to
                    “lurid vapours” that “deform” the appearance of land and sky (55, ll. 3, 5).</p>
                  <p>But such spirits are not sufficiently literal for Hogg. <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> is a work replete with fairies, witches, demons,
                    ghosts, visions, and other phenomena associated with the supernatural. “That
                    fairies <emph>were</emph>, was not disputed; / But <emph>what</emph> they were,
                    was greatly doubted,” one ballad declares (66, ll. 423–24). Of course, few
                    things simply <emph>are</emph> in the poem, including fairies, for that
                    particular ballad reveals its otherworldly beings to be a group of singing
                    maids. Nevertheless, both this particular bardic offering and the longer poem of
                    which it is part embrace an aesthetic of enchantment, returning repeatedly to
                    the existence of the otherworldly. The traditional Scottish ballads that serve
                    as Hogg’s templates are themselves rife with supernatural encounters, to be
                    sure, but <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> ups the ante by importing
                    ballad sensibilities into the narrative framework of the poem, as the narrator
                    himself speaks of spirits roaming the Scottish countryside. Such spirits, he
                    declares, “stretch imagination’s power” (149, l. 1583) making spiritual
                    experience one of the poem’s practical and even theoretical modes and
                    objects.</p>
                  <p>By “spiritual experience” in this context I mean something like the classical
                    definition furnished by William James: “abnormal psychical variations” and
                    “exalted emotional sensibilit[ies]” (9). Perhaps better, it designates what
                    modern scholars of spiritual experience in psychology and philosophy identify as
                    “intense experiences[:] . . . liminal, profound, numinous, extreme,
                    transcendental, traumatic, sublime,” and so on. Such experiences entail a
                    “cognitive and emotional potency that focuses attention” and consist of a “rich
                    interconnection of ideas, memories, and emotions that weaves normally separated
                    parts of life into a single field of meaning” (Wildman, 104–05). <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> exhibits such “weav[ing]” tendencies in
                    its imaginative premise, the wake hosted by Mary Queen of Scots that unifies
                    Scotland’s regional poetic traditions under a single national-literary aegis.
                    And the individual ballads certainly qualify as explorations of “intensity,”
                    whether narratively or in the complexity of their tone.</p>
                  <p>Take, as one example, the ballad “The Witch of Fife,” which tells of “Quhat good
                    man never knew” (40, l. 626). A peasant’s wife and her companions are
                    transported one night to the top of Ben Lomond where they dance with the devil.
                    Then, a different night, they voyage to Lapland, where they are bathed by
                    “warlock men and weerd wemyng” in “witch-water” (44, ll. 733, 737). The
                    peasant’s/witch’s “gude-man” later accompanies her on a third excursion, this
                    time to the bishop’s vault in Carlisle, where he drinks himself silly before
                    being found by “five rough Englishmen” (47, l. 865), who “nickit the auld man,
                    and . . . prickit the auld man, / And . . . tyit him till
                    ane stone; / And they set ane bele-fire him about, / And they burnit him skin
                    and bone” (48, ll. 881–4).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Other ballads recount similarly
                        intense situations. In one, a bride sings about how her murdered father
                        harrows the bride’s “parricide lover” (36, l. 460); in another, a bard, we
                        are told, during “a night of dread [had] held convention with the dead” (75,
                        ll. 747–48); and across the countryside, the narrator informs us, “spirits
                        talk[] along the hill[s]” (106, l. 49).</note> The convergence of the
                    demonic with drunken revelry evokes Robert Burns’s well-known poem “Tam
                    O’Shanter,” but Hogg’s ballad intensifies the element of the grotesque in the
                    beating the “gude-man” receives. More pertinently, it stages a dramatic conflict
                    between the world of spirits (whether otherworldly or simply alcoholic) and the
                    lordship of vindictive Englishmen that introduces an interpretive crisis. Are we
                    supposed to believe the story we have read, or was it all a drunken
                    hallucination? The ballad does not answer this question, but it impresses as
                    real the <emph>effect</emph> of disgust even as it underscores the uncanny
                    narrative that conjures it.</p>
                  <p>Many of the ballads in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> operate this
                    way, such that what draws us to them is less the explicability of their
                    spiritual dimensions on conventional interpretive grounds—the encounter with
                    spirits as nationalist allegories, say, or as some kind of libidinal
                    manifestation—than their sheer affect, the poetic faith or suspension of
                    disbelief these visitations elicit. Hogg, in other words, is as much a
                    literalist as Kandinsky, though in a different register. Kandinsky develops a
                    positive—that is, a positivist—theory about spiritual intensities (with color,
                    for example, producing “spiritual vibration[s]” as a kind of “psychological
                    effect”: yellow “is the typical earthly color,” whereas blue “is the typical
                    heavenly color” and so on [44, 58]).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Kandinsky appeals to the
                        analogy of music: “Generally speaking, color directly influences the soul.
                        Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with
                        many strings. The artist is the hand that plays” (45).</note> Hence, he
                    remarks: a “yellow triangle, a blue circle, a green square, or a green triangle,
                    a yellow circle, a blue square: all these are differently acting entities” (47).
                    Hogg, if anything, is more abstract than the arch-abstractionist Kandinsky
                    because Hogg’s menagerie of spiritual intensities is real without the figures
                    giving rise to it, the demons and witches, being quite believable. For Hogg,
                    that is, the spiritual is real, but not necessarily <emph>these</emph> spirits,
                    which might be mere figures, mere fictions. And the poet, therefore, is less a
                    prophet than the vehicle for the strangeness of what is numinous or sublime, or
                    for the illegibility of what we nevertheless experience. What is thus tangible
                    in reading <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> is the juxtaposition
                    between a quotidian experience with spirits (the everydayness of the uncanny)
                    and the simultaneous elevation and debasement of this experience to the mere
                    status of the literary.</p>
                  <p>In introducing a rift between spiritual and literary experience, <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> pre-emptively invalidates a principle that would
                    become associated with the modern concept of literature, a principle that Walter
                    Scott would animate the following year, 1814, with the publication of <title level="m">Waverley</title>. This is the principle we understand today under
                    the rubric of cultural materialism, which explains not only how cultures emerge
                    but also how they inform the ways we think by differentiating, within
                    themselves, one domain of meaning from another—scientific fact, say, from folk
                    knowledge—along an axis of progress. As Scott famously explained at the
                    conclusion of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, “for the purpose of preserving
                    some idea of the ancient manners of which [he has] witnessed the almost total
                    extinction, [he has] embodied [them] in imaginary scenes . . ..
                    Indeed, the most romantic parts of [<title level="m">Waverley</title>] are
                    precisely those which have a foundation in fact” (340). In essence, Scott
                    brackets as (mere) culture what a group of people experiences (or once
                    experienced) as vital. In <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, one sees
                    the rudiments of this principle articulated by the Lord of Mar, a character
                    based on the historical Earl of Mar who was a guardian of James V and,
                    afterwards, of Mary. At the conclusion of the poem, after the bards have all
                    sung their songs, a skirmish irrupts when no clear victor is named. “‘Twas party
                    all—not minstrel worth, / But honour of the south and north; / And nought was
                    heard throughout the court, / But taunt, and sneer, and keen retort” (165, ll.
                    82–85). So Mar takes the floor and explains that “taste, as sapient sages tell,
                    / Varies with climes in which we dwell” (165, ll. 106–07). So do the poems:
                    “Fair emblems of the Border dale, / Is cadence soft and simple tale; / While
                    stern romantic Highland clime, / Still nourishes the rude sublime” (165, ll.
                    108–11). Hence, so unlikely is it that the subjects of one region could enjoy
                    those of another, that Mar likens its prospect to an outbreak of supernatural or
                    even anti-natural incidents: “trow you may the tides adjourn, / And Nature from
                    her path-way turn; / The wild-duck drive to mountain tree, / The capperkayle [or
                    wood grouse] to swim the sea,” and so forth (166, ll. 120–23). So unnatural
                    would it be for a Highlander to approve of a Border poem that, as a solution,
                    Mar proposes that the three bards preferred by the majority of the auditors be
                    summoned to perform again, with the queen alone declaring the victor.</p>
                  <p>It seems like a logical solution: inasmuch as each of us is encased, as Walter
                    Pater might say, within a thick wall of cultural personality (see Pater 60), let
                    the queen adjudicate poetic justice. (The situation anticipates the conclusion
                    of Scott’s 1827 story “The Two Drovers,” when a judge acknowledges the cultural
                    forces that motivated a Highlander to slay his English comrade before,
                    nevertheless, sentencing the unregenerate Highlander to death.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Scott, <title level="m">Chronicles</title> 124-46 (esp. 143–46).</note>)
                    Indeed, Mar’s proposal seems more nineteenth century, when <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> was composed, than sixteenth century, when it is set,
                    in that it grafts a classical aesthetic principle of unity amid variety onto an
                    Enlightenment-era world view held by stadial historians like Adam Smith and Lord
                    Kames, and onto the arguments of proto-anthropologists like Johann Gottfried
                    Herder, who crafted such histories into a theory of cultural relativity. In
                        <title level="m">Waverley</title>, of course, these dynamics yield diverse
                    “worlds”—Highland Jacobite, Lowland Jacobite, English, and so on—within an
                    encompassing modernity that operates as a reality principle differentiating the
                    durable stuff of history from the imaginary compensations, the merely spiritual
                    experiences, of romance.</p>
                  <p>But think again about Mar’s assertion that an eclectic taste defies nature—the
                    kind of taste exhibited, incidentally, by Hogg’s imagined readers, who
                    supposedly have enjoyed all the ballads. Are Hogg’s readers unnatural? Perhaps
                    more to the point, do not virtually all the songs in <title level="m">The
                        Queen’s Wake</title> defy nature in some fashion, unless we call the traffic
                    with spirits, fairies, witches, and other supernatural forms natural? But if we
                    label such beings natural, at least in the <title level="m">Wake</title>, then
                    how do we account for the poetic charge, the aura of transport (of what is “more
                    than mortal,” as one song puts it [13, l. 244]) that attaches itself to these
                    episodes? If anything, the ballads articulate a conflicted relationship between
                    the natural and spiritual worlds, personified by the bard of Fife, who recounts
                    the song about the witches. This bard takes the stage bearing iconic hallmarks
                    of the medium: “Bushy his beard, and wild his eye,” with a “haggard cheek” and
                    thin, gray locks (39, l. 594). “He deemed that fays and spectres wan / Held
                    converse with the thoughts of man” (40, ll. 603–04). But, precisely because
                        <emph>he</emph> holds these attitudes, <emph>we</emph> do not. Or rather, we
                    believe such “converse” possible, but not as he does—or, if we do, as
                    exceptional rather than everyday occurrences, or as <emph>events</emph> rather
                    than <emph>customs</emph>. It is natural, the poem implies, to believe in
                    something other than what is superficially evident, especially to the degree
                    that we recognize differences between the worlds in which we live and the ones
                    in which we believe.</p>
                  <p>In this way, <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> presents spiritual
                    experience as at once ubiquitous and romantic, as common and deeply strange. And
                    in that respect, predicating its poetic effects on a kind of fascinated
                    ambivalence, <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> seems utterly if also
                    uncannily modern—more so than Kandinsky’s concept of modern art as a conduit of
                    positive spiritual realities, but more so, too, than Scott’s delineation of a
                    literature as a reservoir of epistemic, ontological, and historical difference.
                        <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> at once drains this reservoir and
                    bursts the dam, voiding the spiritual of its literal status but insisting on a
                    constant flow of our experience with the unseen. In this way, the poem shrugs at
                    the prospects of difference as a literary value; and, with that gesture, it
                    renders literature in its modern guise an indifferent medium—an accessory to
                    life, but nothing essential.</p>
                  <p>Hogg’s dialogue with Scott reaches an even higher pitch in <title level="m">The
                        Three Perils of Man</title>, published in 1822. In <title level="m">Perils</title>, the existential status of romance and the modern cultural
                    status of the literary are on particularly acute display. As Graham Tulloch
                    reveals, Hogg initially had a different title in mind—<title level="m">The
                        Perilous Castle: A Tale of Chivalry</title>—because he planned to write a
                    different kind of narrative, one directly responding to Scott. This “perilous
                    castle” and its corresponding “tale” referred to the Roxburgh fortress and to
                    the battle over it between lords of competing English and Scottish kingdoms, the
                    winner earning the hand of the princess of his realm. Scott had twice dealt with
                    this story, “once in a note to <title level="m">The Lord of the Isles</title> in
                    1815 and again in his essay ‘Chivalry,’ which appeared in February 1818”
                    (Tulloch 158). In visiting this territory himself, Hogg sought not only to draft
                    off Scott’s success, but also to reflect critically on “Scott’s first long
                    poetic romance, <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>, [which]
                    was explicitly a tale of ‘Border chivalry’” (161). However, in the version of
                    the novel he eventually published, Hogg devoted a greater share of attention to
                    a new castle, Aikwood, and to a story that deals not with chivalry, but rather
                    with witchcraft and the supernatural. This was, Tulloch remarks, “a much more
                    familiar ground” for Hogg (166), and the lengthy portion of the novel devoted to
                    it—despite Scott’s critique of it, and despite Hogg’s own lament, later, that he
                    had “retarded the main story” by indulging it—is much more assured than the
                    Roxburgh narrative. In this Aikwood section, references to the supernatural,
                    spirits, demons, and fairies abound, with Hogg “interpos[ing] no . . .
                    sceptical voice” to undercut the narrative (169).</p>
                  <p>We are then, in this Aikwood section, once again squarely in the realm of
                    spirits. At its center, however, is an enigmatic and protracted tale-telling
                    contest that reproduces the conceit of the poetic competition in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>. A motley assemblage of characters—among
                    them Charlie Scott, a member of the Douglas clan seeking to recapture the castle
                    of Roxburgh; a friar; a homely laird; a gluttonous laborer; a fair damsel; and a
                    poet—makes its way to Aikwood to seek the prophetic wisdom of the wizard,
                    Michael Scott. Scott has no interest in granting the company’s wish, instead
                    imprisoning the group within the castle. After extended experiences with
                    “diablerie” of various kinds (like metamorphoses of humans into animals,
                    enchanted feasts in which degraded elements—“the joint of a frog’s leg, or that
                    of a rat” [<title level="m">Perils</title> 200]—take the form of sumptuous
                    meats, and so on), a skirmish breaks out between Scott’s demonic servants and
                    the castle’s human inhabitants, and Scott finds himself fighting alongside the
                    company he has imprisoned. He does not entirely become a comrade in arms,
                    however, and after staving off the supernatural turncoats he threatens to starve
                    the group by refusing to grant its release. However, Scott agrees to preserve
                    the life of Delany, the beautiful maid, by giving her to the member of the group
                    who can tell him the best tale. Thus resumes, in effect, the conceit of the
                    competition from <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>.</p>
                  <p>And, provocatively, thus concludes our consort with spirits, at least
                    temporarily. For the tales mostly involve human circumstances. The friar, the
                    first raconteur, rehearses (in the Biblical language of chapter and verse) the
                    story of his love for a woman who falls, herself, for a soldier and then has a
                    child by him. This child, the party immediately discovers, is Delany. The laird
                    then tells a story about a meat-loving shepherd—a member of their party, Tam
                    Craik, it turns out—who, in a moment of weakness, slaughters a “fat ewe lamb”
                        (<title level="m">Perils</title> 258). Charlie Scott, the loyal clansman,
                    then takes a turn and tells a story about a battle with English forces, and
                    about his action in sparing the life of a small child—who proves to be the poet,
                    as the latter reveals to the others upon hearing Charlie’s story. At this
                    disclosure, “Charlie’s visage altered into lengthened amazement. . ..
                    ‘Gude faith but we are a queer set that are prickit up on top o’ this tower
                    thegither’” (292–93), he exclaims. “Od,” echoes Tam, “we seem to ken mair about
                    ane anither than ony ane o’ us kens about ourselves” (293). More than merging
                    life and art, the tales bind the group to each other, interweaving a community
                    from the aleatory associations that initially brought the group together. In
                    this respect, the enchanted circumstances the party had witnessed in Aikwood
                    castle evolve from the encounter with demons to the bewitching effects of
                    narrative itself, and this despite the relative absence of supernatural events
                    within the individual tales.</p>
                  <p>The magical quality of storytelling in this competition becomes more significant
                    in light of the critique in <title level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title> of
                    literature’s bifurcation from life. There, in that earlier work, Romantic
                    artifice effectively divides literary from quotidian experience, a space of
                    ontological difference from a more expansive existence in which actuality and
                    possibility commingle (instead of being relegated to different positions on the
                    grid of history). In <title level="m">The Three Perils of Man</title>, Romantic
                    artifice is again brought under scrutiny, though here it reconciles the binary
                    between the literary and the everyday as the tales presented in the competition
                    in Aikwood castle mediate the actual (and revealed) relationships subsisting
                    between the characters. In this respect, <title level="m">Perils</title>
                    “explores not just what stories <emph>are</emph>, but whom or what they are
                        <emph>for</emph> in a particular culture” (Fielding 70)—or rather, and more
                    ambitiously, I would say, what they are for <emph>generally</emph>, and not only
                    for a particular, Romanticized body of individuals or readers. <title level="m">Perils</title>, that is, does <emph>not</emph> encase narrative within a
                    particular cultural context. It thus revises “the Enlightenment allegory of
                    cultural progress as a disenchantment of the world” (Duncan, <title level="m">Scott’s Shadow</title> 194–95) wherein the transporting effects of
                    narrative are <foreign>a priori</foreign> contained as mere literature, or as
                    “real” only for the benighted sensibilities of older societies echoing from out
                    of the dustbin of history.</p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Perils</title>, as in <title level="m">The Queen’s
                        Wake</title>, the domain in which this revision occurs is that of (what I am
                    calling) the spiritual. I make this claim with an eye to the specific nature of
                    Hogg’s evocation in these texts of supernatural agents—fairies, ghosts, demons,
                        <emph>stories</emph>—and a correlative set of intense experiences as the
                    media of a unified relation between literature and life. In Hogg’s work, as in
                    the landscape outside Aikwood castle, “the heavens and the earth seem[] mingled
                    together” (199), as do diverse elements of society (from the Edinburgh elite to
                    the Border peasants whose traditional and bewitching literary forms attracted
                    wide attention). Such eclectic inclusivity is part of the history of the modern
                    novel, explained perhaps most memorably by Bakhtin as “a phenomenon multiform in
                    style and variform in speech and voice” (261). In early nineteenth-century
                    Scotland, however, the reputed heteroglossia of the novel form was at least
                    partly contained within a historicist framework that relegated peasant tales and
                    the <foreign>Völkisch</foreign> beliefs on which they were predicated to an
                    evocative, romantic past. This makes <title level="m">Perils</title> the emblem
                    of a different kind of literary history, one that scrambles the idea of
                    progress. More evocatively for us, it casts Hogg’s fiction as an important case
                    study for a post-secular age in which belief in the unseen seems at once
                    impossible and necessary. Amy Hungerford, for example, argues that literary
                    studies in the postmodern age is defined by a <emph>belief in
                        meaninglessness</emph>, which is to say, by a faith in fictive world-making
                    as the vehicle “of crucial cultural work in the age of literature’s waning
                    social prestige and its eclipse by other media” (xiv–xv). We believe, in other
                    words, in the power and importance of texts and narratives we know to be false,
                    or at least fictive. And yet, if literature is still to mean anything, Hogg
                    might tell us, it is by marshaling the kind of faith that converts belief into
                    something more empowering: it must oppose, that is, the logic of
                        <emph>mere</emph> belief, of a strictly <emph>literary</emph> authority or
                    purely <emph>poetic</emph> faith. Instead, literature must derive its power from
                    its continuity with life, from its concourse with the kind of meaning that
                    transcends the university, let alone genres, fields, and disciplines. Conceived
                    as a kind of spiritual experience, literary narratives may not be “fiction,”
                    after all. Copping to anything else just recapitulates the history of the novel,
                    of <title level="m">Waverley</title>.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">A recent media turn in Romantic studies has foregrounded the
                    ballad—and poetry more generally—as a privileged site for understanding how
                    questions about medium and mediality feature in the writing of the period. But
                    do such questions feature in the era’s prose genres, as well? And is it possible
                    to talk about a medium of Romantic prose as Celeste Langan and Maureen N. McLane
                    talk about a <emph>medium of Romantic poetry</emph>? In this essay, I suggest
                    that the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” and to show this I turn to
                    the prose tales of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who not only recognized
                    bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but also understood
                    ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of each other. Like
                    the ballad, I argue, the tale, too, can be understood as a “hybrid oral and
                    textual practice” (in Paula McDowell’s words), a prose form that exhibits a
                    subtle self-consciousness about its own medial status. </p>

                    affinity between metrical and prose composition” (<title level="m">Major
                        Works</title> 602)? One answer, surely, is in the lyrical ballads
                    themselves: in poems such as “Simon Lee,” “We are Seven,” and “The Thorn,” that
                    is, which adopt “language really used by men” (597) and dispense with “what is
                    usually called poetic diction” (600). Readers might have to “struggle with
                    feelings of strangeness and aukwardness” (596) before any such bonds can be
                    affirmed, as Wordsworth admitted in his revised Preface of 1802. Still, the poet
                    remained decided in his opinion that “there neither is, nor can be, any
                    essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition”
                    (602). </p>
                  <p>Another answer might be gleaned in the scores of titles published in the same
                    two-year period, 1800–02, in which the words “ballad” and “tale” seem to be used
                    interchangeably. Wishing to write “in the manner of” Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, for example, Mary Robinson published
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Tales</title> in 1800.<note place="foot"> Robinson

                    Lewis’s collection of ballad imitations appeared as <title level="m">Tales of

                        ballads and prose tales.</note> A year later, Anne Bannerman published
                        <title level="m">Tales of Superstition and Chivalry</title>, another
                    collection of ballads. 1802 also saw the first two volumes of Walter Scott’s
                        <title level="m">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</title>, a collection of
                    “tales” of “elder times” (as Scott described them in the dedication) that
                    recovered the rich ballad culture of the Scottish border country. William
                    Earle’s <title level="m">Welsh Legends: A Collection of Popular Oral
                        Tales</title> (1802) features both verse and prose compositions, including
                    prose tales on which, as Earle explains, the ballads “of this and other
                    countries” were “founded” (vi). </p>
                  <p>In certain respects, the conflation of “ballad” and “tale” is confusing in that
                    both were well-known forms at the turn of the century, the former as a verse
                    form, the latter, increasingly, as a prose form. The ballad had undergone a
                    revival in the latter half of the eighteenth century, thanks to the publication
                    of Thomas Percy’s <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title>
                    (1765) and to what Katie Trumpener calls the “new” genre of the ballad
                        <emph>collection</emph> (xi). And it was in these same years that the tale
                    emerged as its own, distinct generic category, with a first major peak in
                    popularity in the 1790s, followed by a second, even more dramatic rise in the
                    1820s, when “tale” surpassed both “novel” and “romance” to become the most
                    popular label for prose fiction in the decade.<note place="foot"> The tale has
                        two major associations that attach to it in these years of emergence: the
                        first is the moral or didactic (as in the work of Jean-Francois Marmontel,
                        Hannah More, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth), the second is the
                        regional and traditional (as in the work of Edgeworth (again), Walter Scott,
                        and James Hogg). The foregrounding of the moment of telling or teaching in
                        both might be said to link these two major associations. The present article
                        will focus on the tale’s strong regional and oral-traditional associations,
                        but for a general view that considers both major strands of the tale’s rise,
                        see Tim Killick, <title level="m">British Short Fiction in the Early
                            Nineteenth Century</title> (2008), and Anthony Jarrells, “Short
                        Fictional Forms and the Rise of the Tale,” in <title level="m">The Oxford
                            History of the Novel in English, vol. 2: English and British Fiction

                        2015), 478–94. On the word “tale” surpassing “romance” and “novel” in the
                        1820s, see Peter Garside, “The English Novel in the Romantic Era:

                    other respects, however, the conflation of ballads and tales is not so difficult
                    to account for. Both words had strong associations with what had come to be
                    understood as “oral tradition” and both reflected a general sense of
                    “nervousness” about the fate of songs and stories in a print-saturated age.<note place="foot"> Paula McDowell argues that in the latter half of the
                        eighteenth century, following a new interest in the ballad and in the
                        controversy surrounding James Macpherson’s Ossian poems, “we see an epochal
                        shift in attitudes toward ‘oral tradition,’ and the crystallization of the
                        modern secularized version of this concept” (McDowell, “Mediating Media,”
                        240). See also Nicholas Hudson, “Constructing Oral Tradition: the Origins of
                        the Concept in Enlightenment Intellectual Culture.” <title level="m">The
                            Spoken Word: Oral Culture in Britain, 1500–1850</title>, edited by Adam
                        Fox and Daniel Woolf (Manchester UP, 2002), pp. 240–55. On “nervousness”
                        about the spread of print in the eighteenth century, see McDowell, “The Art
                        of Printing was Fatal,” p. 56.</note> Indeed, the confusion already is
                    evident in the series of publications that got the whole ballad revival started:
                    I mean the proto-tales, or prose translations of Gaelic ballads, that James
                    Macpherson called <title level="m">The Poems of Ossian</title> (1760–65).
                    “Pleasant are the words of the song,” says Cuchullin in book three of <title level="m">Fingal</title>, “and lovely are the tales of other times” (73).
                    Or, in “Oina-Morul. a Poem”: “I seize the tales as they pass, and pour them
                    forth in song” (323). “Tale” and “ballad” refer generally to “story,”
                    “tradition,” “antiquity.” But what was new and distinctive about these two as
                    forms, especially compared with, say, the novel or the polite poetry of the
                    eighteenth century, was precisely the attention they drew to the act of
                    remediating traditional, oral stories in print. Both ballads and tales exhibit
                    what Jussi Parikka calls “the media-archaeological spirit of thinking the new
                    and the old in parallel lines” (2). As such, they bring to the fore the very
                    question of medium itself.</p>
                  <p>Yet of the two answers offered here to Wordsworth’s question about affinities
                    between metrical and prose composition, only one—the yoking together of lyric
                    and ballad—has received scholarly attention. The other—the conflation of ballad
                    and tale—has hardly been remarked upon at all, not even by those recent scholars
                    whose work constitutes an important media turn in the field and highlights the
                    significance of the ballad in particular for understanding the “medium” of
                    Romantic poetry.<note place="foot">In terms of the latter, I’m thinking
                        especially of the work of Maureen N. McLane (<title level="m">Balladeering,
                            Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry</title>). In terms
                        of a more general media turn in Romantic studies, see, in addition to
                        McLane, Celeste Langan (“Understanding Media in 1805”); Langan and McLane
                        (“The Medium of Romantic Poetry”); Paula McDowell, “Mediating Media Past and
                        Present”; Kevis Goodman, <title level="m">Georgic Modernity and British
                            Romanticism: Poetry and the Mediation of History</title> (Cambridge UP,
                        2008); and Clifford Siskin, “Mediated Enlightenment: the System of the
                        World,” in <title level="m">This is Enlightenment</title>, eds. Siskin and
                        William Warner (U of Chicago P, 2010), pp. 164–72.</note> There are, I
                    think, a couple of reasons for the silence. First, although the tale was a
                    recognized form in the Romantic period, distinguished from the novel by
                    booksellers, publishers, and readers, it has not been considered as such in our
                    own time, which tends to see it merely as one subgenre in a larger “system” of
                        novels.<note place="foot"> As in, for instance, Franco Moretti, <title level="m">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title>: “Both synchronically and
                        diachronically . . . the novel is <emph>the system of its
                            genres</emph>” (30). Clifford Siskin has used the term “novelism” to
                        describe the “habitual subordination of writing to the novel”
                        (172–3).</note> Second, the media turn in eighteenth-century and Romantic
                    studies has focused mostly on verse, finding in “the situation of British
                    poetry, 1760–1830,” as Maureen McLane writes, “a window onto the transhistorical
                    condition of poetic ‘mediality’” more generally—“mediality” being “the condition
                    of existing in media, whether oral, manuscript, print, or digital” (<title level="m">Balladeering</title> 6).<note place="foot"> McLane takes her
                        definition here from Friedrich A. Kittler’s <title level="m">Discourse
                            Networks, 1800/1900</title>, and specifically from David E. Wellbery’s
                        Forward to the book, in which the term “mediality” is introduced.</note>
                    Without necessarily intending to do so, such accounts sometimes collapse prose
                    into the larger category of print and ignore a genre such as the tale which,
                    like the ballad, can also be described—in Paula McDowell’s words—as a “hybrid
                    oral and textual practice” (“Mediating” 242).<note place="foot"> Celeste Langan
                        addresses the conflation of prose and print in her essay, “Understanding
                        Media in 1805,” pp. 53–54.</note> In what follows, I examine the ways that
                    the tale, too, exhibits a subtle self-consciousness about its own medial status
                    and I ask whether the features and history of this form open up possibilities
                    for talking about a medium of Romantic prose.<note place="foot">As Langan and
                        McLane do for verse in “The Medium of Romantic Poetry.”</note> To do this, I
                    turn to the work of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who not only recognized
                    bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but also understood
                    ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of one other. </p>
                  <p>Hogg’s 1830 tale, “The Mysterious Bride,” opens with references to two writers
                    who had a profound impact on his career. The first is Scott, a friend and
                    competitor whose wildly successful “school of chivalry” was always threatening
                    to edge out of the literary market Hogg’s own, more eccentric, “mountain and
                    fairy school” (Hogg <title level="m">Anecdotes</title> 9). Concerned about what
                    he saw as a recent turn away from belief in ghosts and spirits, and about
                    Scott’s comments on the subject in his <title level="m">Keepsake</title> tale of
                    1829, “My Aunt Margaret’s Mirror,” Hogg exclaims, “Even Sir Walter Scott is
                    turned renegade, and, with his stories made up of
                    half-and-half . . . is trying to throw cold water on the most
                    certain, though the most impalpable, phenomena of human nature” (“Mysterious
                    Bride” 155).<note place="foot"> “The Mysterious Bride” was published as a
                        continuation of Hogg’s “Shepherd’s Calendar” series, which started in <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> in 1819 and was later
                        published as a two-volume collection in 1829. I am aware of the pitfalls of
                        conflating narrator and author in Romantic works and understand, too, that
                        the shepherd-narrator that Hogg employs for his series is a creation based
                        on Hogg’s own experiences, on people he knew in Ettrick, and on the persona
                        of “the Shepherd” as it appeared in the pages of <title level="j">Blackwood’</title>s. Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience and to
                        more clearly position Hogg the writer in relation to the references and
                        sources he engages in his tale, I will refer to him throughout this essay as
                        “Hogg” rather than as the more awkward “Hogg’s narrator” or “Hogg’s
                        speaker.”</note> Hogg may have felt miffed by Scott’s turn, in 1827, to the
                    tale, a genre he saw as belonging to his own school and which he spent much of
                    the 1820s proving his mastery of.<note place="foot"> As Ian Duncan notes, it was
                        during these years that “Hogg and [John] Galt gave the tale its most
                        striking formal development” (<title level="m">Scott’s Shadow</title>
                        35).</note> That Scott would then use the form to question the tale’s great
                    topos of the supernatural only added fuel to the fire.</p>
                  <p>The second reference follows immediately from the first and expands the argument
                    about the supernatural to include another form associated with tradition: the
                    ballad. As a means of challenging the recent rejection of ghosts and spirits,
                    Hogg exclaims: “Before [naysayers like Scott] had ventured to assert such
                    things, I wish they had been where I have often been; or, in particular, where
                    the Laird of Birkendelly was on St Lawrence’s eve, in the year 1777, and sundry
                    times subsequent to that” (155). The place in question is the road from
                    Birkendelly, in the “great muckle village of Balmawhapple”; the Laird to whom
                    Hogg’s narrator almost silently gives way is casually riding along and “chanting
                    a song” by “a certain, or rather uncertain, bard ycleped Robert Burns, who made
                    a number of good songs” (155). This song, Hogg writes, “was an amorous song of
                    great antiquity, which, like all the said bard’s best songs, was sung one
                    hundred and fifty years before he was born” (155). “O let me in this ae night,”
                    the song referred to, was first taken up by Burns in 1792 when he modified it
                    for inclusion in James Johnson’s <title level="m">Scots Musical Museum</title>
                    (1787–1803). He returned to it again several times between 1793 and 1795
                    following a request from George Thomson to contribute to his <title level="m">A
                        Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs </title>(1793–1818). </p>
                  <p>“Oh let me in this ae night,” sings a lover standing outside a woman’s window:
                    he’s cold and wet and complains that “love has bound [him], hand and foot.” But
                    the woman is not persuaded: “Gae back the gate ye came again / I winna let you
                    in, jo—,” she responds (Kinsley 485). These lines are from Burns, the bard Hogg
                    mentions in his tale. However, the lines that Hogg actually provides are from
                    another, earlier version, much like the one published in <title level="m">The
                        Scots Musical Museum</title> and based on David Herd’s <title level="m">Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs</title> (1776). In this version, too, a
                    man pleads to be admitted to his lover’s house: <quote>

                    in Hogg’s tale, the two stanzas are presented in reversed order. Indeed, both
                    versions by Burns (in the <title level="m">Musical Museum</title> and in
                    Kinsley) follow Herd for the first eight lines. But the three versions are quite
                    different in their endings. The later Burns version is the most chaste of the
                    three: it was, after all, commissioned by Thomson, and the Burns whom Thomson
                    wanted for his collection was the pious, sentimental Burns of “The Cotter’s
                    Saturday Night,” not the bawdy Burns of such songs as would be printed a few
                    years later in <title level="m">The Merry Muses of Caledonia

                            “Wierd” here means “fate.” The version quoted in Hogg’s tale, based on Herd’s text, ends
                    quite differently.<note place="foot"> In the version printed in <title level="m">The Scots Musical Museum</title> she also lets him in. It concludes:

                    provide the actual lines, he hints at them when he writes, “[t]his song the
                    Laird was singing, while, at the same time, he was smudging and laughing at the
                    catastrophe, when, ere ever aware, he beheld, a short way before him, an
                    uncommonly elegant and beautiful girl walking in the same direction with him”
                    (155–56). The word “catastrophe” can mean “a conclusion generally unhappy,” as
                    Samuel Johnson defined it; “a sudden disaster, as in the <title level="m">OED</title>; or a “convulsion affecting the earth’s surface,” which was a
                    new usage in Hogg’s time derived from the emerging science of geology (also
                    listed in the <title level="m">OED</title>). Hogg’s use of the word might be
                    said to capitalize on all three meanings. Here are the concluding verses of
                    Herd’s version:<quote>

                     </quote> That Hogg’s laird is able to laugh at this catastrophe is
                    somewhat ironic—it’s “wierd,” we might say—as it foreshadows his own unhappy
                    conclusion: later in the tale, the laird’s “blackened corpse” is discovered at
                    the very spot where the elegant and beautiful girl first appeared to him, on the
                    day the two of them were to be married. “This woful catastrophe,” Hogg
                    writes, repeating the word he used earlier to describe the end of the ballad,
                    “struck the neighborhood with great consternation, so that nothing else was
                    talked of” (166). The elegant and beautiful girl is, of course, the mysterious
                    bride of the title—the ghost of one Jane Ogilvy, who, long ago, let a man in one
                    night, so to speak. After losing her “maidenhead” she is jilted by the man,
                    Allan Sandison, the grandfather of the laird singing the tune, who forsakes her
                    to wed “the great heiress of Birkendelly.” Ogilvy’s ghost takes its revenge on
                    Sandison’s heir, and we come to understand that a similar catastrophe befell the
                    previous generation of Sandisons, as well.</p>
                  <p>Hogg, then, refers to one version of a ballad—by Burns—and cites another, a
                    version “that is more direct in defining the ‘catastrophe’ that results from
                    admitting the laird ‘this ae night,’” as Hogg’s recent editor, Thomas C.
                    Richardson, puts it (<title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> 433, n. 155d). It’s a
                    clever bit of play, showing not only that Hogg knew a good deal about different
                    versions of ballads but also drawing attention to the process of transmission
                    itself: from the song “sung one hundred and fifty years” before Burns’s birth to
                    the different versions collected by Herd, Johnson, and Thomson, and on to Hogg’s
                    own tale. Indeed, Hogg seems to suggest that his tale is yet another instance in
                    this process, part of a living tradition comprised of individual memory (what
                    the narrator characterizes as “facts that happened in my own remembrance” [155])
                    and oral lore as collected in songs and stories. Hogg does not try to smooth
                    over the differences brought about in the process or to “conflate sources so as
                    to produce a single representative text”—as, for example, David Atkinson
                    suggests that Scott did in his <title level="m">Minstrelsy </title>and Percy did
                    before him in his <title level="m">Reliques</title> (Atkinson 120). Rather than
                    seeing the ballad as a “closed, original, and seminal utterance,” Hogg
                    understands it “as a constant and multiple production” (Atkinson 23). The
                    ballad’s “appropriate organizing principle,” as Atkinson argues, “is precisely
                    one of proliferation” (23). The laird in Hogg’s version of the story might be
                    singing the tune that Burns’s verses are set to while chanting the words printed
                    in Herd’s edition or combining elements from all of the versions. The tale thus
                    highlights the ballad’s “inherent” instability even as it becomes yet another
                    version (Atkinson 182). </p>
                  <p>My aim here is not to reduce “The Mysterious Bride” to an allegory about the
                    pitfalls of ballad editing. But I do want to suggest that it reveals an acute
                    awareness of how the ballad exists somewhere between orality and print and of
                    how the tale, though written in prose, can be understood to be part of the
                    “multiple production” of the ballad, either following from it, as in Hogg, or
                    preceding it, as in the Earle example cited above. The mysterious bride from
                    whom the tale takes its title is, in a sense, conjured into being from the
                    singing of the Burns song: so sudden is her appearance on the road that the
                    laird assumes that she must have “risen out of the earth” (156). And in a
                    description that sounds like it could be of the antiquarian ballad collection
                    itself, Hogg writes that when the body of the young Sandison was discovered,
                    “[e]very ancient tradition and modern incident were raked together, compared,
                    and combined” (166). To little effect, it might be said. Hogg’s tale would seem
                    to offer another instance of what Ian Duncan, writing about Hogg’s <title level="m">Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</title>
                    (1824), calls “a grisly parody of the late Enlightenment project of antiquarian
                    and literary ‘revival’—the attempt by scholars and poets to recover the remains
                    of national traditions, buried in a primitive countryside” (xi). Instead of
                    raking, comparing, and combining with the hope of arriving at an answer—or
                    text—the mystery is solved by an old woman named Marion Haw, who simply tells
                    another tale. This tale, Hogg notes, has more than a little in common with his
                    own attempts in the genre. “She gave the parishioners a history of the
                    Mysterious Bride, so plausibly correct, but withal so romantic,” he writes,
                    “that everybody said of it, (as is often said of my narratives, with the same
                    narrow-minded prejudice and injustice,) that it was a <emph>made story</emph>”
                    (166–67; emphasis in the original). </p>
                  <p>Given the stress in Hogg’s tale on the ballad and its multiple versions, the word
                    “made” as it is used here could be understood to refer to an
                        <emph>assembled</emph> story—that is, to the raking, comparing and
                    collecting that aims to produce a true or original text, something both
                    “correct” and “romantic,” like a ballad in an eighteenth-century collection. The
                    explicit comparison that Hogg makes, however, is to his “narratives,” a
                    comparison which suggests that a “made” story is something more like a
                        <emph>mere</emph> fiction or perhaps a story that is too seamless to be
                    true. Something like a novel, that is. This might very well be a dig at Scott
                    or, more generally, at what Matthew Wickman, in his contribution to this issue,
                    describes as “the modern concept of the literary as a species of imaginative
                    writing set against a normative sphere of everyday life.”<note place="foot"> See
                        Wickman’s essay in this issue, “Concerning the Spiritual in Hogg’s Art”:
                        link here.</note> But if Hogg means to draw a distinction between the tale
                    and the novel, the word “made” would seem to go against my own reading of the
                    former’s major difference from the latter: its self-consciousness about its own
                    medial status. Wouldn’t something that appears to be “made” be something more
                    likely to call attention to its made-ness, or its medium—as in “made of what” or
                    “made how”? This is a point that McLane and Celeste Langan make in their lucid
                    account of “The Medium of Romantic Poetry” (2008). Commenting on a 1799 review
                    of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, in which Charles Burney describes
                    Wordsworth and Coleridge’s project as an “ingenious forgery,” Langan and McLane
                    explain that it is precisely the “forged” aspect of the collection that makes
                    visible poetry’s status as medium. “[T]he ‘retrogradation,’ to use Burney’s
                    term, is intentional” (253), they write; Wordsworth and Coleridge,<quote> are
                        exploring the ‘medium of poetry’ in another sense [not, as in Burney, as
                        transition from one period to another]: neither its origin nor its end but
                        rather its <emph>middle</emph>—and by extension, perhaps, its
                            <emph>essence</emph>. For it may be that the question of a medium and
                        the question of an essence are always bound together: the very possibility
                        of multiple ‘mediations’ produces in turn the question, ‘mediations of what
                        [thing]?’ (254) </quote> Hogg understands the ballad’s essence similarly:
                    its multiple mediations not only open a space for the prose tale, but also allow
                    his own telling to become a new—although not a final—version. But then how is
                    the tale not also forged—or “made”? Wouldn’t a made story be more in keeping
                    with a forged poetry?</p>
                  <p>The difference comes down to the medium that fictional prose is so often
                    conflated with—print—and to the genre that has come to stand in for literature
                    more generally in an age of print: the novel.<note place="foot"> See note 6 on
                        Clifford Siskin’s term, “novelism.”</note> Unlike the ballad or the tale,
                    the novel is a born-print genre: as Walter Benjamin explains, what
                    “distinguishes” it from the latter is “its essential dependence on the book”
                    (87). Such a dependence on the newly naturalized medium of print suggests that
                    the “made” in Hogg’s description has a different character than the “forged” in
                    Langan and McLane’s example. “Made” stories in print are those in which there
                    appears to be no medium whatsoever, no work of forging, making, or mediation. As
                    Catherine Gallagher has shown, novels offer readers the kind of consistency and
                    depth of character which, though the product of fiction, appear consistent
                    with—indeed, coterminous with—real life. “The novel gives us explicit fiction,”
                    she writes, “and simultaneously seems to occlude it” (349). Such occlusion
                    constitutes a kind of immediacy, a new product of “an age in which the medium of
                    the book,” as Friedrich Kittler argues, “is first universal” (117), an age that
                    Kittler dates to 1800. Poetry, too, exhibited the effects of the change. Langan,
                    for instance, describes blank verse as “the redefinition of English poetry by
                    the medium of print,” explaining that a poem like “Tintern Abbey” “appears to
                    reject artifice” and thus to render its medium of communication “invisible”
                    (“Understanding” 53–54). When poetry becomes prose or prose-like, in other
                    words, medium becomes invisible because prose itself has become synonymous with
                    print. A forged poetry, to go back to the example above, brings medium back to
                    the fore by keeping the poetry part active: it resists the conflation of poetry
                    and print, in practice if not in theory, by highlighting the poetic process of
                    forging, or making, as distinct from something already made. </p>
                  <p>The novel, likewise, can be described as the redefinition of storytelling by the
                    medium of print. Plausibly correct and withal so romantic, it, too, appears to
                    reject its own artifice and to obscure the fact of medium. But what then can we
                    say about prose in the period? Is its case a hopeless one, always to be
                    collapsed into the larger category of print, a category that, having become
                    natural and universal, had it made, so to speak? Perhaps the ballad-tale
                    conflation highlighted at the start of this essay is somewhat akin to the
                    poetry-prose conflation Langan analyzes, though here it resists the additional
                    conflation of prose and print by highlighting the former’s continued affinities
                    with poetry, that medium that refused to give way in the face of massive medium
                    change? To say such is not to collapse prose into the larger category of medium.
                    Instead, it is to make medium itself part what Yoon Sun Lee, in her introduction
                    to this issue, describes as “the situated quality of prose,” and especially of
                    prose written in a modern, print-saturated, world.<note place="foot"> See Yoon

                  <p>The opposite of a made story, then, would be a tale—or ballad—“founded on fact,”
                    with fact referring not to that epistemological unit that Mary Poovey calls “the

                    rather to a “truth” attested to by “authentic testimony” (as one <title level="m">OED</title> entry defines it), and in particular to the telling

                    (1816): “and if thy tale be true,” he exclaims, alluding to the number of bodies
                    that perished on the field of Waterloo and to the story those numbers tell of
                    that decisive battle (l. 308). Hogg, too, brings to the fore the seemingly
                    contradictory registers of number and story—or tally and tale—in his repeated
                    claim that his tales are founded on incidents told again and again or, as in
                    “The Mysterious Bride,” that they are a “relation of facts.” On the one hand,
                    such stories traffic in a realm of experience that is thoroughly grounded in
                    belief, including belief in ghosts, miracles, spirits and all that is
                    inconsistent with real life as represented in novels.<note place="foot">As
                        Wickman explains, “[f]or Hogg, the spiritual is a fact of existence.” Link
                        to Wickman’s essay.</note> On the other hand, the truth of such experience
                    is both attested to and made, as in <emph>poiesis</emph>, or poetic making,
                    precisely out of multiple retellings. “Perhaps a tale you’ll make it,” says
                    Wordsworth’s speaker in “Simon Lee” (l. 80), making the reader both frustrated
                    and, as McLane shrewdly observes, “like the poet, a ‘maker,’” (<title level="m">Balladeering</title> 227). Tales are part of a process—and a community—in
                    which facts are made in and by the act of transmission. </p>
                  <p>Hogg’s knowledge of the rich history of ballad transmission is hardly surprising:
                    one of his first successes came with “Donald Macdonald” (1801), a patriotic song
                    that gained a popular following in Scotland; and Hogg and his mother, Margaret
                    Laidlaw Hogg, were what McLane describes as “informants” for Scott’s <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title> (<title level="m">Balladeerin</title>g 4). With
                    Scott’s encouragement Hogg published a collection of “ballads and songs founded
                    on facts and legendary tales,” <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>, in
                        1807.<note place="foot"> Title page, <title level="m">The Mountain
                            Bard</title>, 1807. Hogg published an expanded version of <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title> in 1821. The title of the 1821
                        edition was changed, slightly, to read, “The Mountain Bard; Consisting of
                        Legendary Ballads and Tales.”</note> But while he would continue to write
                    poetry and songs throughout his career, it was with the prose tale that Hogg
                    found his best point of entry into a crowded literary market and his most
                    distinctive literary voice. Many of his tales, like “The Mysterious Bride,”
                    engage, build upon, or indirectly comment on the ballad tradition that Hogg was
                    so familiar with.<note place="foot">As Douglas Gifford notes, “. . .
                        it cannot be stressed enough how much [Hogg’s] ballad background is the
                        basis of both content and form in the bulk and the best of his fiction”
                            (<title level="m">Development </title>10).</note> Others quite literally
                    emerge from the margins and surrounding materials of ballads—conjured, like the
                    mysterious bride herself, by song. In <title level="m">The Mountain
                    Bard</title>, for instance, Hogg includes a ballad imitation, “The Pedlar,” that
                    he published three years earlier in the <title level="j">Scots Magazine</title>.
                    The ballad tells the story of a murdered pedlar and of the discovery, following
                    a bizarre incident in which a recovered heel bone starts “streamin wi’ blood,”
                    of the murderer (<title level="m">Mountain</title>, l. 147). As Hogg’s editor,
                    Suzanne Gilbert, suggests, the “motif” of a part of a victim’s body bearing
                    witness to his fate is common in traditional ballads; it can be seen in “The
                    Cruel Sister,” collected in Scott, and the better known version, “The Twa
                    Sisters,” collected in Francis James Child’s <title level="m">The English and
                        Scottish Popular Ballads</title> (1882–98).<note place="foot">See Gilbert’s
                        note to “The Pedlar” (1807), pp. 405–06.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Like Scott’s version in the <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, Hogg’s “Pedlar”
                    has what appears to be a standard ballad-collection apparatus, including a
                    headnote and endnotes. But these spaces are used not to highlight excluded
                    variants or to justify one version over another, but instead to proliferate
                    multiple versions of the “fact” on which the ballad is “founded” (26). The
                    endnotes, for instance, stretch on for many pages and offer multiple instances
                    of the “superstitious awe” (<title level="m">Mountain Bard</title> 31) recorded
                    in the song. “This reminds me of a trifling anecdote, which I will here relate
                    as an instance” (33), Hogg writes. A few paragraphs later: “some, yet alive,
                    have heard John Corry, who was [Mr Boston’s] servant, tell the following story”
                    (34). “A similar story to this of Mr Boston and the pedlar, is told of a
                    contemporary of his, the Reverend Henry Davieson, of
                    Gallashiels . . .” (35). And off he goes again, with one account
                    suggesting another until a tale—indeed, a set of tales—has unfolded in the
                    margins to extend the story and to show it to be alive still, present “amongst
                    the wilds of the country to this day” (<title level="m">Mountain Bard</title>
                        32).<note place="foot">As Gilbert elsewhere argues, for Hogg “tradition” is
                        not “a fixed set of practices” located in the past, but rather something
                        that “continues into the present” (“Authority of Tradition” 101).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 1821 edition of <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>, Hogg added a
                    number of new ballads, including “The Wife of Crowle,” a version of the famous
                    “Wife of Usher’s Well,” from Scott’s <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, which
                    tells the story of three sons drowned at sea who return—as revenants—to feast
                    with their bereaved mother before departing in the morning to go to their
                    graves. Hogg’s version was originally published in his own, short-lived literary
                    periodical, <title level="j">The Spy</title>, in 1810, as “A Fragment.” And as
                    Hogg notes in the headnote to <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>
                    version, it is also “given more at large in ‘The Winter Evening Tales’” (312), a
                    collection of prose tales that Hogg published in 1820—his most successful work
                    of fiction. This more-at-large version appears in the first story of the
                    collection, “The Renowned Adventures of Basil Lee,” which was itself published
                    in two fragments earlier in <title level="j">The Spy</title> and tells of the
                    wanderings of the anti-heroic Basil, from a Berwickshire farm to Canada to
                    revolutionary-war America and back to Edinburgh. Along the way Basil encounters
                    the tale of “an old woman who lived in a lone sheiling, at the head of an arm of
                    the sea, called Loch Kios, to whom a ghost paid a visit every night” (<title level="m">Winter</title> 53). The account recorded in “The Wife of Crowle”
                    is here transplanted to the isle of Lewis and then extended in the form of a
                    prose tale.<note place="foot">nother example of this movement from ballad to
                        tale, one perhaps better known to today’s readers of Hogg, is the prose tale
                        version of the ballad, “The Twa Corbies,” collected in Scott’s <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, that is interpolated in <title level="m">The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</title>
                        (147–52). See also Duncan’s note in the text, p. 208, n. 149. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The movement back-and-forth between ballad and tale, and the interplay of both
                    within individual ballads or tales, is a striking feature of Hogg’s work. But as
                    noted at the start of this essay, his deployment of these two forms as versions
                    of one another, interchangeable, in a sense, is a product of the ballad-tale
                    conflation that marks the turn of the century more generally and that can be
                    linked back to Ossian, the ballad revival, and a general sense of anxiety about
                    the fate of old stories in new media. It is tempting to see in the examples
                    given from Hogg a progress of sorts: from the ballad (“Donald Macdonald”), to
                    the ballad and tale existing side by side (as in <title level="m">The Mountain
                        Bard</title> or <title level="j">The Spy</title>), and finally on to the
                    tale: “Basil Lee” or “The Mysterious Bride,” each one taking its starting point
                    from a ballad. That is perhaps a little too neat, though the progression is in
                    keeping with a larger cultural shift in these years, one that saw the tale first
                    confused with the ballad and then, for a time, rivaling it and even displacing
                    it as an object of collection (as in Earle’s <title level="m">Welsh
                        Legends</title> or the more famous example of the <title level="m">Children’s and Household Tales</title> of the Grimm brothers, first
                    published in 1812).<note place="foot">As Tim Killick notes, “[a]t some point
                        during the late 1810s, perhaps influenced by Scott’s shift from poetry to
                        the novel, the tale began to match the ballad as a subject worthy of study
                        by the antiquarian and the folk historian” (<title level="m">British Short
                            Fiction</title> 122).</note> Still, this is to emphasize the competition
                    between the forms, of which there was some, rather than the commonalities
                    between them, of which there were many. As Wordsworth might have said—or better,
                    as Albert B. Lord or Marshall McLuhan might have said—the more “philosophical”
                    distinction is not that between poetry and prose, or ballad and tale, but rather
                    between oral and written media.<note place="foot"> Wordsworth, Preface, 602.
                        Wordsworth actually says that the contradistinction is between poetry and
                        science. Lord’s book, <title level="m">The Singer of Tales</title> (2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> edition, Harvard UP, 2000), published in 1962,
                        examines the distinct manner in which oral epic singers compose and as such
                        contributes to discussions about Homer and his age that go back to the
                        eighteenth century. Marshall McLuhan described his 1962 book, <title level="m">The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</title> (U
                        of Toronto P, 1962) as “complementary” to <title level="m">The Singer of
                            Tales</title>, for the ways it understands one moment of medium change
                        (oral to print) in terms of another, later one (from print to the “electric
                        age”). </note> Like the ballad, the tale kept a foot in both camps, holding
                    on to the idea of a genuine middle position—in prose—between orality and
                    literacy for at least as long as it took for the short story to reorient such
                    fiction along the lines of the novel and to make a new age of prose synonymous
                    with an age of print. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay examines Sydney Owenson’s strange syntax—at once ornate
                    and truncated, full of floating modifiers and attributions that remain forever
                    unresolved—as a medium for her explorations of sensation and perception. Tracing
                    the form of her novels in conjunction with her meditations on empiricism, it
                    argues that Owenson’s syntax resists the ontic and formalizing claims of a
                    Common Sense philosophy of perception. Instead her early novels enact,
                    syntactically and therefore figurally, a conception of “life” as ceaseless,
                    formless motion and an ethics of interdependency embodied in what Thomas Reid
                    called “mere sensation.” </p>

                  <p>To read the novels of Sydney Owenson has always been to be made to think
                        strangely: that is, to encounter, and often to struggle with, anomalies of
                        style, figuration, and form. Percy Shelley’s preoccupation with <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, and his continuing engagement in
                        “Fancy” with what remain, to him, images inaccessible of resolution or
                        realization (or what he calls the capacity to “incorporate”) is at once the
                        best-known and most favorable contemporary response to such an experience of
                        Owenson’s novels (P.B. Shelley 1: 107).<note place="foot"> Most relevant to
                            this essay are the comments of Gelpi and Hogle, on sensation in
                            conjunction, respectively, form and philosophical implications. Gelpi
                            attributes to Owenson’s <title level="m">The Missionary</title> some
                            part of the origin of the “drifting atmosphere of reverie” produced by
                            the “associative and evocative image clusters” in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (170–71). Hogle makes <title level="m">The Missionary</title> one of the influences on <title level="m">Alastor</title> that pile up “in an astonishing, interweaving
                            transference” coupled with a “dim awareness that his own ‘variability’
                            may come from a movement, a Lucretian one at bottom, commanding the
                            verses [and, in Owenson’s case, the prose] of his older contemporaries
                            just as much as his own” (45–46). More recent criticism, by, for
                            example, Wilson and Goldstein, has not elaborated these brief mentions
                            of Owenson’s connection with Shelley’s formal practice or its relations
                            to sensation. A second well-known, and related, though less favorable
                            contemporary comment on Owenson’s anomalies of form and sensation is
                            Austen’s snarky remark to her sister in January 1809: “We have got
                                <title level="m">Ida of Athens</title> by Miss
                            Owenson. . . . We have only read the Preface yet; but her
                            Irish Girl does not make me expect much.—If the warmth of her Language
                            could affect the Body, it might be worth reading in this weather” (166).
                            See also Burgess, “Sydney Owenson’s Tropics” 283. </note> But his
                        coupling of preoccupation with the strangeness of fancy has close parallels
                        in several more public and more fully explicated reading histories, such as
                        William Gifford’s review of <title level="m">Woman: or, Ida of
                            Athens</title>, from 1809. Writing in the first number of the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, Gifford remarks that the effort of
                        reading the novel, “a hundred similar conundrums, in the compass of half as
                        many pages,” has left him “in despair; . . . turning the leaves of
                        the volume backward and forward.” He speculates that the printer must have
                        “fabricated the requisite number of lines, by shaking the types out of the
                        boxes at a venture,” making the novel “a kind of overgrown
                            <foreign>amphigouri</foreign>, a heterogeneous combination of events,
                        which, pretending to no meaning, may be innocently permitted to surprise for
                        a moment, and then dropt for ever” (Gifford 50). For John Wilson Croker, who
                        devoted a series of essays in the Dublin <title level="j">Freeman’s
                            Journal</title> to <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title> in
                        1806–7, reading Owenson is “a task of no small difficulty” that produces a
                        vertigo of “involvement and intricacy,” or focus and scale: “common
                        occurrences are decorated with importance, with mysterious dignity and
                        consequential remark—feebleness mimics strength, and trifles ape grandeur”
                        (3). Geraldine Jewsbury, to whom Owenson was at once a friend and patron,
                        similarly sums up the experience of reading her early works. Before writing
                        the <title level="m">The Missionary: An Indian Tale</title> in 1811,
                        Jewsbury writes, Owenson “read up a great deal for Indian customs, history
                        and antiquities,” but the details of her reading, “manners and customs,
                        races and countries,” become quickly “confounded together in the
                        rose-coloured mist of fine writing and high-flown sentiment. . . .
                        [T]he reader feels disposed to say as Sheridan said, when the servant threw
                        down a china plate with a great crash, without breaking, ‘You rascal! how
                        dare you make all that noise for nothing?’” (Jewsbury 1: 424–25). </p>
                  <p>Noise for nothing; heterogeneous events without meaning: in one sense, in the
                        emphasis on heterogeneity and clanging disunion, this reading persists in
                        more recent commentary. Terry Eagleton emphasizes, for example, the
                        “formally disheveled” quality of Owenson’s narratives. For Eagleton,
                        Owenson’s irresolutions of form are best understood as a failure of closure
                        and, in turn, as a consequence of Irish political history. He argues that
                        her novels embody a frustrated drive to reconcile the competing ideologies
                        of early nineteenth-century Ireland—“romantic” and “realist”; “domestic” and
                        “political”—and in this negative sense capture the historical “truth” of
                        Ireland’s colonized condition (Eagleton 182, 184). David Lloyd offers a
                        similar but widened perspective on this formal heterogeneity, so that
                        Owenson appears as just one among the group of nineteenth-century Irish
                        novelists whose fractious narratives invariably betray the “insufficiency”
                        of novel form to mediate the fragmentation and violence of Irish history
                        (Lloyd 141). Implicit in these more recent readings is an assumption about
                        narrative form that backreads what Lloyd has called the “laws of integration
                        or harmonization” characteristic of the later nineteenth-century realist
                        novel onto Romantic-period works (Lloyd 133). When such a drive toward
                        formal unity is construed, as Fredric Jameson posits about narrative in
                        general, as “an ideological—but formal and immanent—response to a historical
                        dilemma,” then such novels as Owenson’s most often appear as symptoms of a
                        historical conflict that refuses (for Eagleton and Lloyd, in the absence of
                        the structures of a nation-state) to be symbolically resolved (Jameson
                            139).<note place="foot">See also Jameson’s observation that “form is
                            immanently and intrinsically an ideology in its own right” (141).

                  </p>
                  <p>That the more hostile among Owenson’s earliest readers locate in the novels a
                        politics that is both consistent and readily identified—a mix of
                        “libertinism,” “disloyalty,” and “atheism” that stands as shorthand for a
                        specifically Irish version of English Jacobin ideology—suggests, however,
                        that the novels’ formal strangeness is something more, or other, than a
                        symptom of ideological ambivalence and historical fracture.<note place="foot"> For these specific terms, see Gifford (52); see also
                            Croker’s references to “qualities . . . highly esteemed
                            in the realms of gaiety, and the circles of intrigue” as well as to a
                            “striking system of morality” at odds with religious convention.</note>
                        Such a strangeness could not, of course, have been understood, circa 1810,
                        as a failure to conform to realist conventions. But the consistent and
                        specific bewilderment expressed by contemporary readers suggests that
                        something is taking place in Owenson’s works that is distinct not just from
                        Victorian realist novel form but also from what Franco Moretti has called
                        the “<emph>intrinsically contradictory</emph>” transitional form of the
                        Romantic <foreign>bildungsroman</foreign>, with its tensions between
                        “dynamism and limits, restlessness and the ‘sense of an ending,’” or its
                        more specific instantiation in the imperial quest romance described by Sara
                        Suleri (Moretti 6, emphasis in original; Suleri 10–11).<note place="foot">
                            See also Trumpener 146 and Wright 22–25. </note> It is not only, and not
                        primarily, formal irresolution that troubles Owenson’s earliest readers.
                        Rather, these readers place a greater emphasis on their surprise and
                        bewilderment at encountering an overwhelming yet at the same time
                        frustratingly insubstantial plenitude: Jewsbury’s noisy mist; Croker’s
                        vertigo of scale; Gifford’s turning of pages, at once compulsive and
                        unrequited. </p>
                  <p>How are we to understand this experience and these motions? This essay will
                        argue that both arise, equally and inseparably, from a gap that opens, for
                        contemporary readers, between Owenson’s descriptions and the readers’ own
                        capacity to conceive of what is described. The irritable reaction of
                        Owenson’s earliest readers to this tension between what Yoon Sun Lee, in her
                        introduction to the present volume, terms “non-spontaneous, purposive
                        expression” and the expectation of “representation” heralds Carl Schmitt’s
                        enraged encounters with what Lee, quoting Jacques Rancière, identifies as
                        the (definitively Romantic) “‘phenomenon of expression as such.’” The gap
                        between description and conception, or expression and representation, is
                        produced by the syntactic form and the lexical range of Owenson’s
                        invocations of sensation and its sources, or, in other words, as I will
                        show, by the play of figuration. </p>
                  <p>In what follows, I will explore the relationship of Owenson’s figural
                        practices to conceptual irresolution, readerly motion, and narrative form in
                        her early novels. Attending most closely to <title level="m">Woman: or, Ida
                            of Athens</title> and <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, and to
                        the philosophical essays Owenson, as Lady Morgan, published alongside
                        autobiographical anecdotes and opinions in <title level="m">The Book of the
                            Boudoir</title> in 1829, I will propose that this quartet of critical
                        concerns—conception, figuration, motility, and fractured form—is the
                        register, for readers, of what I would like to call an ethics of sensation
                        in Owenson’s works. As such, it demands that these works be read in relation
                        not only to the histories of national and narrative form but also to the
                        intersecting histories of empiricist and idealist philosophies of sensation
                        and what recent scholarship has begun to see as the closely related topic of
                        Romantic understandings of the relationship between organic form and the
                        sciences of life. </p>

                  <head>2. Reading Owenson with common sense: against perception</head>
                  <p>Owenson may seem a surprising candidate for a philosophical reading: her work
                        has not been addressed by any of the major recent scholarship on the history
                        of sensation, and, to the extent that her novels have been considered in
                        conjunction with empiricist thought, the readings have tended to concentrate
                        exclusively on her invocations of political sympathy.<note place="foot"> On
                            sensation, see especially Wang, Terada, Jackson, and Goodman. On Owenson
                            and the philosophical tradition of empiricism (read here in its
                            iteration as moral philosophy, particularly its emphasis on sentiment
                            and sympathy, here associated with “romance”), see Nersessian 110–41;
                            Connolly 85–124; Ferris 60–62.</note> Yet the essays she published in
                        later life speak suggestively—more suggestively than elaborately, but in a
                        context designed retrospectively to inform readings of her novels—about her
                        interest in contemporary philosophy, particularly questions of sensation and
                        of life. By her early teens, she writes, she had been broadly “influenced”
                        by “the value of philosophy and the importance of chemistry”: she took
                        “infinite delight” in Locke’s theories of sensation but found Kantian
                        idealism “vague and unsatisfactory” (though it is not clear that she ever
                        read Kant) (Morgan, “Raconteurs” 1: 32; “Richard Kirwan Esq.” 1: 60). In
                        middle age she enjoyed discussing philosophy with her husband, though on
                        occasion, when she forgot herself, “giving [her]self the air of talking
                        metaphysics . . . and throwing in a word on the <title level="m">Doctrine of Causation</title>” in front of male visitors, “a look” from
                        Sir Thomas Charles Morgan could quickly send her back to conventionally
                        feminine topics such as landscape, with which she “made ‘pure description
                        hold the place of sense’” (Morgan, “Doctrine of Causation” 1: 191–92).</p>
                  <p>Even when most absorbed in metaphysical discussion, however, Morgan remained
                        less interested in “sense” than in sensation. She is canonically Lockean on
                        the derivation from sensation of what she calls “natural causes,” but what
                        Locke identified as the relation between a “Cause” and what is “produced by”
                        it she redefines correlationally, as the observed “concurrence of certain
                        antecedents with certain consequences” (Locke 324, 2: 26 §1; Morgan,
                        “Doctrine of Causation” 1: 193). Elsewhere she seems to differ more
                        explicitly from Locke on the relationship of sensation to the metaphysics of
                        causality. What is for Locke evidence of “the Qualities, that are really in
                        things themselves” is for Morgan a thing in itself: she dispenses with
                        Locke’s view of “<emph>simple</emph> Ideas” as “the Marks, whereby we are to
                        know, and distinguish Things” and “<emph>complex</emph> Ideas <emph>of
                            Substances</emph>” as “Representations of Substances, as they really
                        are,” and with his distinction between “real” and “fantastical” ideas, or
                        those “with a Foundation in Nature” and those without (Locke, <title level="m">Essay</title> 372–74, 2: 30 §1–2, 5). For Morgan, in contrast,
                        “to prove a proposition means, to render it evident to the senses—nothing
                        more” (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158). This emphasis on sensation
                        allows her to remain agnostic on such questions as the nature and qualities
                        of the “external world” even as she distances herself from “the idealist”
                        who “has no ground for believing any other existence than his own mind”
                        (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158). </p>
                  <p>With such a statement, Morgan firmly separates her epistemological musings
                        not only from Locke’s representational and referential conception of
                        sensation but also from the major metaphysical schools of her own time:
                        Kantian idealism, with its positing of an extrasensory noumenal realm that
                        grounds all knowledge even while it remains inaccessible save to the
                        intuitions of reason, and Thomas Reid’s common sense philosophy, with its
                        establishment of a given though incompletely perceptible world as an arrest
                        to the skeptical implications of empiricism.<note place="foot"> As Ameriks
                            points out, contemporaries, not least Kant’s first interpreters and
                            expositors, tended to understand Reid and common sense as Kantian
                            precursors (21–22). </note> Unlike the phenomenophiles discussed by Rei
                        Terada, who retreat to “mere phenomenality” in retreat from or revolt
                        against the normative pressures of the given, Morgan seems, in her essays,
                        to bracket the very idea of givens (Terada 32).<note place="foot">Terada’s
                            model takes note that most if not all Romantic phenomenophiles are men,
                            commenting that some narrative genres of the period, notably the Gothic
                            novel, that were “next door to mere phenomenality” were more hospitable
                            to female writers.</note> Gifford complained that Owenson was an enemy
                        of, or perhaps merely allergic to, “revelation” (52). He may have been more
                        accurate when he wrote, with Gifford, of Owenson’s “inveterate obliquity” of
                        “mind, which prevents her from perceiving, or stating a fact as it really
                        exists”; certainly there is more evidence in her writings for such a claim
                        (Croker and Gifford 261). In <title level="m">The Missionary</title>,
                        Owenson comments that the “waking dream”-like experience that suffuses the
                        eponymous protagonist Hilarion on his arrival in “Cashmire” is “sensation”
                        that has “survived all power of perception” (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). And, as we will see, Owenson does turn away—not
                        glancingly, but persistently—from what Reid called “perception,” or the
                        cognitive assemblage of sensations into approximations (imperfect figurings)
                        of the things of the given world, the secular counterpart of “revelation,”
                        or at least of metaphysical doctrine (Reid 290).</p>
                  <p>Truncated as they are, Morgan’s philosophical comments in her essays can
                        serve as little more than hints. In her early novels, however, to which the
                        essays are a supplement, Owenson dwells constantly in sensation. Here, for
                        example, is a passage from the extended (eight-page) scene that introduces
                        Ida Rosemeli, the heroine of <title level="m">Woman</title>, a passage
                        characteristic enough to make one of Gifford’s three epigraphic examples of
                        “a hundred similar conundrums in half as many pages” (Gifford 50). In the
                        scene Ida is asleep and seen for the first time from a distance by an
                        “English traveller”: <quote> an air of vestal innocence, that modesty which
                            is of soul, seemed to diffuse itself over a form whose exquisite
                            symmetry was at once betrayed and concealed by the apparent tissue of
                            woven air which fell like a vapour around her. There was something so
                            delicate, so ideal in her form, that the very drapery that veiled it
                            seemed to partake of its aerial character; and her gently languid
                            respiration alone, spoke her not a thing which fancy only had
                            embodied. . . . <lb/> Changing her attitude from grace to
                            grace, as indulgence dictated, or ease impelled, the variety of her
                            gentle motions might have presented to the statuary the most beautiful,
                            the most difficult models for imitation; while the delicious indolence
                            of doubtful sleep seemed still to struggle with the renovating energy of
                            awaked intelligence. Happy state of indefinite existence! how perpetual
                            the formless but delicious visions which live and die with you!

                            forms, he had previously witnessed, could it be more than a dream!

                                ethereal spirit” but whose beauty is anchored in the “symmetrical

                     </quote> In this scene Owenson achieves
                        a strange plasticity of image by means of extended conceits and uncertain
                        pronoun reference (in the analogy between modesty and translucent veiling, a
                        comparison founded on the simile form of “seem[ing],” it is impossible to
                        determine whether the “apparent tissue of woven air” is a figural or
                        material garment, or, somehow, both), strings of adjectives whose
                        numerousness and abstraction confirms the stated pairing of “the most
                        beautiful” with “the most difficult,” and dangling participles that,
                        remaining unsutured to a subject, never attribute the actions they describe
                        (who exactly is “changing [Ida’s] attitude” as she sleeps, and whose
                        “indulgence,” “ease,” and “imitation” are at stake?) (Owenson, <title level="m">Woman</title> 1: 23, 26). By Owenson’s diction and syntax, as
                        in the narrator’s semantic claim, Ida’s presence is “at once betrayed and
                        concealed” (1: 23). Is Ida, as the novel’s title suggests, a “woman”? A
                        “form” (1: 28)? A “vision” (1: 28)? It is only certain, from Owenson’s
                        thickly worded but strangely vaporous and “vanish[ing]” description, that
                        she is “not a thing,” at least “not a thing which fancy only had embodied,”
                        even as the scene invites “the [whose?] fancy” to “wander . . .
                        through imagined worlds” (1: 23).</p>
                  <p>It is worthwhile, here, to compare Owenson’s scene with Reid’s pioneering
                        1764 distinction between sensation and perception, which worked, from within
                        empiricism, to arrest the skeptical impulse latent from the beginnings of
                        associationist theories of mind. It is indeed the case, Reid argues, that
                        sensation is autotelic, “can have no existence but in a sentient mind,” but
                        “perception . . . hath always an object . . . which may
                        exist whether it be perceived or not. . . . [T]he perception
                        of an object implies both a conception of its form, and a belief of its
                        present existence” (Reid 289–90). This common sense brake on skepticism
                        functions poetically as well as metaphysically: if for Locke, as Natania
                        Meeker and Helen Thompson have argued, “substance can only be apprehended as
                        figure,” then for Reid, in the process of perception, the figure takes fully
                        resolved shape with a stable referent in the things of nature (Thompson and
                        Meeker 185). “The signs by which objects are presented to us in perception,”
                        he proposes, “are the language of nature to man,” so that “there is
                        certainly a resemblance, and necessary connection, between the visible
                        figure and magnitude of a body, and its real figure and magnitude” (Reid
                        153, 296). Though the form of a “visible figure” may be more or less
                        complete according to the viewer’s perceptual capabilities, as in the case
                        of “a man born blind,” the thing perceived will always appear to a sighted
                        viewer with all the formal completeness of a reflection in a mirror (Reid
                        154). The figural range of perception, in short, is determined by poles of
                        incompleteness and completeness, or partially and fully apprehended form,
                        which is to say, synecdoche on the one hand and metaphor on the other. </p>
                  <p>The presence of the thing, and the referential bond between this “real
                        figure” and the “visible figures” that represent it in the mind, is never in
                        question in Reid’s philosophy, for it is warranted by what he calls “the
                        Author of [his] being” (Reid 294). In Owenson’s <title level="m">Woman</title>, in contrast, lexical range and plenitude and syntactical
                        restlessness and uncertainty mean that the figures of sensation are left
                        unresolved. They don’t fully take shape, and the glancing sensations they
                        capture are left unpinned to the assumption of a stable referent. Thus they
                        are best understood as a series of metonymies: shifting sensations, often
                        minute, impermanently as well as imperfectly established as a partial
                        reference to any fully formed or fixed “external thing.” Not for nothing did
                        Owenson’s contemporaries describe her early novels as “extravagant,” or
                        wandering, figuratively, outside the straight paths of representation marked
                        by metaphor, synecdoche, and common sense philosophy.<note place="foot">
                            According to a review of <title level="m">Woman</title> in the <title level="j">Dublin Satirist</title> of November 2009, quoted in
                            Belanger 119, Owenson’s “extravagant picture” would be “more creditable
                            to her head and heart” if she were “to keep within the bounds of
                            decency, probability, and common sense.” I rely here on Paul de Man’s
                            account of metonymy as “purely relational” and his account of metaphor
                            as associated with “an element of truth” in his reading of Proust, and
                            follow de Man’s association, in this reading, of synecdoche with
                            metaphor rather than metonymy (de Man 14). For a reading of sensation as
                            a figural event, which Reid, like de Man’s Proust, pursues, the
                            association is more convincing than what de Man acknowledges is the
                            synecdoche-metonymy pairing more common in “classical rhetoric” (de Man
                            63n).</note> The descriptive passages in her early novels typically
                        remain both formless and fluctuating. If they frustrate such readers as
                        Gifford by inciting them to fruitless motion, they engage another kind of
                        reader, such as, avowedly, Shelley, who enjoys the invitation to wander.</p>

                  <head>3. Form and the ethics of sensation: Owenson on “identity” and
                        “life”</head>
                  <p>In the series of philosophical essays included in the <title level="m">Book
                            of the Boudoir</title>, Owenson Morgan argues that the process of
                        wandering of, and in, sensation, is commensurate with “life.” “To measure
                        human action against time, and to overtake it,” she writes in the essay on
                        “Rapidity,” “is to double existence. To live fast (properly understood) is
                        not to wear out life briefly, but to multiply the sensations which extend
                        it” (Morgan, “Rapidity” 1: 95). Such a motile and formless life is, in turn,
                        in Morgan’s assessment, at odds with conventional notions of unified, stable
                        being—with such notions, equally, as applied to the sensing agent and to
                        what and how the agent senses. The constant train of sensation contributes
                        to what Morgan calls, in the opening essay of <title level="m">The Book of
                            the Boudoir</title>, “the great mystery of identity,” which she
                        describes with the observation that “even the hand which traced the first
                        line of this farrago, is not the same agent of the same volition, with that
                        which will write the last” (Morgan, “My Book” 1: 5). Her agnostic
                        apprehension of “identity” denies her readers even the consolatory “fiction
                        of continu’d existence” Hume proposed to account for the human “propension
                        to unite . . . broken appearances,” including proprioceptions
                        (205). In 1827, an assessment of <title level="m">The O’Briens and the
                            O’Flahertys</title> in <title level="j">The Monthly Review</title> had
                        complained that “Lady Morgan is still devoted to the tessellated style of
                        writing” (Review 518). <title level="m">The Book of the Boudoir</title>
                        responds to such references to her preferred prose form (from tessellation
                        to “farrago”) by associating her composite, mobile, and formless prose with
                        the mixing of sensations that comprises “life” and complicates
                        “identity.”</p>
                  <p>Defining Romanticism as “a wide-sweeping inquiry into the phenomena of life,”
                        Denise Gigante has argued for the prominence of epigenesist conceptions
                        (those focused on the “power” of self-actualizing formal potential and
                        self-organizing form) in the poetic as well as the biological thought of the
                        period (Gigante 26, 39). For her the key figure in Romantic debates about
                        life is Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who repurposed his key phrase “multëity in
                        Unity,” the definition of poetic beauty, to define life as “unity in
                        multëity” (Gigante 3).<note place="foot">In the late fragments collected as
                            the <title level="m">Opus Maximum</title>, Coleridge simply joined
                            “multeity” and “unity” with the coordinating conjunction “and”
                            (298).</note> Against the dominance of Coleridge, Amanda Jo Goldstein
                        has recently posited the Shelley of <title level="m">The Triumph of
                            Life</title>, who, Goldstein argues, pursues a “Lucretian poetics of
                        transience” wherein the relations between and mutual impacts of living,
                        not-quite-living, no-longer-living, and
                        more-conventionally-understood-as-inanimate beings and things come together
                        in an understanding of life as collective, contingent, historical and
                        therefore perpetually in flux (Goldstein 62–63). To make this argument, for
                        Goldstein, is also to take issue with Paul de Man’s reading of figuration
                        (understood both as troping generally and as face-giving, or prosopoeia) as
                        “a power radically alien to life, relation, and sense” and the dominant
                        force in Shelley’s poem (Goldstein 66).<note place="foot"> Goldstein is
                            commenting on de Man’s claims that “disfiguration”—“the repetitive
                            gestures by which language performs the erasure of its own positions”—is
                            a process internal to figuration and is figured by the measured treat of
                            the Shape All Light in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (de
                            Man, “Shelley Disfigured” 119).</note> Here her argument takes an
                        explicitly ethical turn: when the category “life” takes on a distinct
                        ontological status, “life” also becomes a comparative and implicitly
                        value-laden term (Goldstein 69). Or, as Goldstein puts it, “when science
                        affirms specific forms of life [those less organized; those less fully
                        formed] to be medically less alive already, it helps to render their deaths
                        less reprehensible—a logic familiar to twenty-first-century readers from its
                        realization in fascist thanatopolitics” (70). For her Lucretian Shelley, in
                        contrast, faces are everywhere together. In the final few words of this
                        essay, I would like to consider the implications of Goldstein’s rigorous and
                        important reading of Shelley for approaching the novelist whose poetics of
                        sensation helped make Shelley think so strangely. </p>
                  <p>Owenson’s motion-capture of the play of sensation that is tantamount to life
                        is at least as tropical as the face-giving <title level="m">Triumph of
                            Life</title> for which it provided Shelley with a model. Yet unlike
                        Shelley, or Lucretius, the Owenson of <title level="m">Woman</title> and
                            <title level="m">The Missionary</title> rarely, if ever, makes faces.
                        Her closest approach to prosopoeia might be the moment when the narrator
                        asserts that the scene of the protagonist’s “delightful and delighted
                        wanderings . . . seem[s] . . . to smile into a luxurious
                        garden” as the “English traveller” approaches Ida’s home (Owenson, <title level="m">Woman</title> 17–18). Here, though, the narrator’s figuring of
                        the traveller’s sensation yields a motion and a resemblance rather than a
                        face and an identity, however contingent, whether singular or composite. As
                        ever in Owenson’s early work, sensation, while figural (here, that most
                        mobile of tropes, the simile) is specifically not form-making.<note place="foot">Carlson’s account of Shelley’s similes is relevant here:
                            “Shelley’s similes work against entrenchment in linguistic and ethical
                            realms, perpetually un-building the object world, including its putative
                            opposition to the internal life of the subject, by showing objects to be
                            as ethereal and ever-changing subjects and the so-called subjective”
                            (Carlson 77).</note> If we compare Shelley’s Lucretian atomism with
                        Owenson’s descriptions of sensation, we will discern Owenson’s contrasting
                        emphasis on a perpetual motion of fleeting minutiae, atoms of sense that
                        elude formal resolution: a rigorous (and, with respect to Shelley’s
                        prosopoeia, proleptic) resistance to pareidolias of all kinds. </p>
                  <p>I have cited the passage in <title level="m">The Missionary</title> in which
                        Hilarion, transformed by his journey through Cashmire, is stripped of
                        “perception” while “sensation” survives (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). Let me now add that in <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> Owenson contrasts Hilarion’s “waking dream,” in which
                        feelings associated with the “enjoyment” of sensation “possess
                        . . . themselves of his whole being,” with the early, imperial
                        ambition he conceives on his arrival in India (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). On first seeing India’s “shores, which were
                        rather imagined than perceived in so great an interval,” his “spirit
                        . . . partook [sic], for a moment, the sublimity of the objects he
                        contemplated, the force of the characters he reflected on, and, expanding
                        with its elevation, mingled with the universe” (Owenson, <title level="m">The Missionary</title> 80–81). This is not just a formal but also an
                        explicitly ethical break with perception as a scene of self-making,
                        retroactively characterized, by contrast with the Cashmire passages, as
                        hubris and grandiloquence. </p>
                  <p>By emphasizing the unbridgeable gap between description and things, Owenson
                        prompts her readers to consider their own composite, mobile quality and
                        their suffusion in a world of sensation—an experience that, she reminds them
                        in <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, can also be understood as the
                        varied texture of love. What her contemporaries called decadent (but also
                        recognized as radical), and what subsequent readers have sometimes dismissed
                        as an effete leisured dalliance becomes an ethics of interdependency as
                        pleasure—lacking in determined outcomes, radically unproductive and,
                        therefore, in Owenson’s terms, “free.”<note place="foot"> The adjective
                            “free” is everywhere in <title level="m">Woman</title> and <title level="m">The Missionary</title>; it not only refers to republican
                            polities (the opposite of “slavery”) but also to “love” as an “intimacy”
                            of “mind” and “heart” (Owenson, <title level="m">Woman</title> 1: 202;
                            3: 161). Carlson writes illuminatingly about “freedom” and love in
                            Shelley; Jackson makes a compelling case for the ideological character
                            of Erasmus Darwin’s aesthetics of pleasure, which influenced Owenson
                            philosophically and formally (Jackson, “Erasmus Darwin’s Romanticism”
                            175–77, 187). See also Burgess, “On Being Moved” 314–18. For an
                            “effusive” and “aristocratic” Owenson, see for example Moore.</note>
                        Such an ethics stops short of what Tim Milnes, in his essay in this volume
                        on the essayistic and pragmatic character of empiricism between Hume and J.
                        S. Mill, identifies as the “possibility of a shared experience,” which,
                        Milnes argues, is the implicitly ethical as well as epistemological goal of
                        Romantic moral philosophy. Yet Owenson’s prose, like the philosophical
                        essays of Charles Lamb and others, both avowedly subscribes to and formally
                        enacts a conception of literary form and literary experience that is, like
                        the sensation it cultivates and describes, exuberantly autotelic. Such an
                        ethics of sensation emerges with inconceivable but especially insistent
                        liveliness when it is read amid the histories of Romantic form and life.

               <p rend="noCount">"The Privatization of Public Life: Free Direct Discourse in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>" argues for the importance of other narrative techniques
          beyond free indirect discourse in Jane Austen’s work, such the related but in many ways
          opposed form, free direct discourse. Paying particular attention to such techniques, I
          contend, allows us to see the ways in which public discourse in a novel such as <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is repeatedly converted into a medium for private feeling.
          The result is a strangely fractured view of public life, in which characters fail to share
          even something as fundamental as time itself. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>“With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body’s
          feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body’s destiny” (Austen,
            <title level="m">Emma</title> 339). Emma Woodhouse’s withering self-indictment offers a
          exemplary instance of free indirect discourse, so exemplary indeed that it is tempting to
          read her judgment as extending to its co-speaker, the narrator of <title level="m">Emma</title>, who really is privy to all secrets, arranger of all destinies. Suspicion
          of the authority granted by free indirect discourse to narrative, and in particular to
          Jane Austen, was widespread in the 1980s and 1990s, when critics saw it as the means by
          which, in D. A. Miller’s words, “the narration simultaneously subverts [the characters’]
          authority and secures its own” (<title level="m">The Novel and the Police</title> 25).
          Casey Finch and Peter Bowen, in an influential account of <title level="m">Emma</title>,
          followed Miller’s lead, contending that free indirect discourse functions as a form of
          “surveillance” (3), incessantly “mak[ing] public the private thoughts of characters” (5).
          Yet since, needless to say, we do not inhabit the same world as that occupied by the
          characters we read about, it is far from clear how their thoughts can be described as
          being made public. If novels can be said to involve the notion of publicity this surely
          belongs exclusively to the diegetic world, which often feels like much more of a
          panopticon than the novels themselves: few acts or remarks in the society Austen depicts
          go unnoticed, and without the protection of money or marriage individuals are pitifully
          vulnerable to the judgments of others. </p>
                  <p>This essay argues against the idea that free indirect discourse, at least in Austen’s
          hands, renders the realist novel a “stylistic Panopticon” (99) to quote from Franco
          Moretti’s recent study of the bourgeoisie. To characterize the technique as a means of
          making public what should ideally remain private misunderstands the relation between
          private and public within the novels themselves. For public and private life in Austen’s
          fiction are less easily opposed than the surveillance model of criticism suggests. Not
          only do Austen’s characters repeatedly discover what it is they think and want by seeing
          these thoughts and desires manifested by others, her protagonists are less on display in
          public than we might imagine, since they may be said to be under the protection of the
          narrative itself. Austen’s unfinished manuscript <title level="m">The Watsons</title>
          gives a sense of how cruel her world looks shorn of what Miller describes as the
          “anonymous, impersonal, universal” (<title level="m">Jane Austen</title> 27) voice of free
          indirect discourse; with no authorial consciousness to echo her thoughts, no matter how
          ironically, the text’s unmarried heroine feels terrifyingly exposed. The desire to protect
          her characters does not, however, explain Austen’s fascination with free indirect
          discourse. Rather, this fascination is a result, I will be contending, of a recognition
          that the structure of free indirect discourse, in which one voice speaks through or with
          another, shapes relations within the society upon which she reports. Austen’s
          popularization of the technique, that is, represents a formalization of a social practice.
          My focus will be on the Austen novel most indebted to free indirect discourse, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, whose heroine’s thoughts are expressed almost exclusively
          in the third person. The distance this imposes between Anne Elliot and a world which
          refuses to acknowledge her extends to every aspect of that world, inverting the
          relationship between public and private. So extensive is this reorientation that it ends
          up reordering relations even more primary—those involving time itself, a reordering which
          narrative is peculiarly well equipped to document.</p>
                  <p>According to Frances Ferguson, free indirect discourse represents “the novel’s one and
          only formal contribution to literature” (159). Leaving aside the truth of this claim, it
          is safe to say that free indirect discourse is limited <emph>to</emph> literature; for all
          that it mimics the structure of the social world depicted in Austen’s novels, the practice
          itself can only exist in the world of the novel. Austen’s development of the technique
          would thus seem to disqualify her work from consideration in a volume devoted to Romantic
          prose, a form Yoon Sun Lee’s introduction defines as inseparable from an “idea of the
          spoken.” Yet if free indirect discourse belongs to the domain of unspoken speech, the
          related device I examine in this essay, free <emph>direct</emph> discourse, aligns
          Austen’s work much closer with the genre of Romantic prose. In free direct discourse, a
          rare and critically neglected form, utterances go unattributed, leaving open the
          possibility that they have been said by more than one speaker. Austen’s deployment of the
          technique—a carryover from the eighteenth century novel’s looser sense of the boundaries
          between direct and indirect speech—is motivated in part by her fascination with the ways
          speech brings communities into being, a question explored in relation to philosophical
          discourse in Timothy Milnes’ essay for this volume, “Trusting Experiments.” I borrow the
          term, appropriately enough, from a reading of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. But
          unlike the author of that account, Norman Page, who characterizes free direct discourse as
          a means of summarizing lengthy conversations “without the loss of immediacy” (“Categories”
          735), I understand the device as generated by a unusual structural component of the novel.
            <title level="m">Persuasion</title> narrates the renewal after eight years of the
          romance between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth in the face not just of social barriers
          but of narrative ones too: the novel seemingly goes out of its way to bar its protagonists
          from speaking directly to one another. The result is a courtship conducted almost
          exclusively through the expressions, opinions, and judgments of others. Kept apart by
          their friends and family, Anne and Wentworth are able to renew relations only by turning
          public life into a medium for private feelings. Their second courtship, in other words,
          inverts the structure of free indirect discourse. </p>
                  <p>Whereas free indirect discourse is spoken by both narrator and character, free direct
          discourse is spoken by more than one character. The technique is thus concerned less with
          consciousness than with social interaction, with public rather than private life. Little
          penetration is required to discern who in <title level="m">Emma</title> remarks on “‘the
          handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston’” (17) or the identity of
          the “some” who wonder why gruel is not “taken every evening by every body” (85). In not
          attributing these remarks to a specific speaker at a specific moment, Austen not only
          underscores the recognizability and transferability of speech, she describes a society in
          which almost every character speaks for, through, or on behalf of another. Mr. Woodhouse
          is undoubtedly the source of the comment about the gruel, but his success in convincing
          his daughter Isabella to join him in eating it allows him to disappear into the plural
          subject “some.” The maneuver is characteristic. Mr. Woodhouse, who constantly validates
          his hypochondria by referring his own opinions to his doctor, happily voices the opinions
          of his younger daughter Emma, oblivious to her actual views. But then Austen’s heroine
          repeatedly speaks on behalf of her friend Harriet, dictating to her who she should and
          should not marry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Emma could even be said to
            ventriloquize Austen herself at one point, entertaining Mrs. Weston with a pitch-perfect
            imitation of Mrs. Bates.</note> Harriet is little more than a surrogate for Emma, which
          makes it almost inevitable that the one desire Emma’s friend gives voice to without
          prompting—her love for Mr. Knightley—should be “the means whereby [Emma] . . .
          comes to acknowledge her own” (Miller, <title level="m">Narrative</title> 12). This
          vicarious economy extends not just to relations between characters but to the subplot of
          the novel, the love affair between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill: one a surrogate
          daughter, the other a surrogate son. Their decision to keep their love secret leads to
          Frank ventriloquizing his own feelings—his fulsome praise for the unknown person who sends
          Jane a piano is eventually revealed as self-directed—and Emma ventriloquizing Jane’s—she
          imagines a scenario in which Jane falls in love by proxy.</p>
                  <p>In the end, the story told in <title level="m">Emma</title> is of characters finding
          their own voice: Frank admits his love for Jane; Mr. Knightley proposes to Emma; Harriet
          accepts the man she actually loves, Robert Martin. Things are quite different in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. Rather than characters recognizing their desire only when
          expressed by another, as in <title level="m">Emma</title>, they depend on others to
          articulate feelings that would otherwise not be able to find a voice; characters know what
          they want, but they cannot say what they want. As Miller’s reading of the novel details,
          the reason Anne’s feelings are inexpressible is because of her social status: a spinster
          lacks the social standing to give voice to her desires. The result is a use of free
          indirect discourse so extensive some critics have characterized <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as a radical departure from Austen’s other novels.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">The Economy of Character</title> Deidre Lynch offers
            a particularly helpful discussion of the workings of free indirect discourse in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>.</note> The novel features a number of scenes in which
          Anne refers the expressed thoughts and feelings of others to her own situation, as if she
          and the actual speaker were the twinned subjects of a first-person utterance. When Louisa
          Musgrove expresses to Wentworth her mistaken belief that Lady Russell “persuaded Anne to
          refuse” (80) Louisa’s brother Charles, before going on to dismiss the idea that she
          herself would be “so easily persuaded” (81), her words are also heard by Anne, hidden
          behind a hedgerow. The extraneous repetition of the term persuasion signals the work of
          delegation being performed here. In distinguishing her own feelings from ones Anne never
          possessed (Austen’s heroine never wanted to marry Charles) Louisa ventriloquizes feelings
          Anne has since come to possess (regret at having been persuaded by Lady Russell not to
          marry Wentworth). No wonder the listening Anne “could imagine what Louisa was feeling”
          (81), since what Louisa is feeling is exactly what Anne is feeling.</p>
                  <p>The odd thing about the conversation Anne overhears is that Louisa, despite being
          mistaken about Anne’s feelings for Charles and ignorant of Anne’s feelings for Wentworth,
          ends up speaking for Anne anyway, albeit without knowing this. Anne’s private feelings are
          made public, yet not by her, and not in a manner recognizable to anyone else, even the
          subject of those feelings. This leads to a strange situation which in many ways is the
          opposite of the ones depicted in <title level="m">Emma</title>: rather than discovering
          her feelings by hearing them voiced by another, Anne has to indulge these feelings
          vicariously, since she has no-one to share, sympathize, or even suspect her love for
          Wentworth. The delight Louisa and her sister Henrietta take in Wentworth’s stories of life
          at sea thus becomes for Anne, however painfully, the only means in which her own memories
          of hearing these tales could possibly find expression outside of her own thoughts: “their
          surprise at his accounts . . . drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which
          reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant” (60). Diegetic space is
          converted into the space of Anne’s consciousness; private life given public form, yet Anne
          (and the reader) is the only public in a position to recognize this. The conversations
          between Wentworth, Louisa, and Henrietta are mirror image of earlier ones between
          Wentworth Anne, yet because the narrator never describes this courtship—and because no
          character ever acknowledges it—they function as the novel’s only depiction of it. Anne and
          Wentworth’s second engagement functions, we might say, as a kind of proxy for the first.
          It seems no more than fitting then that this engagement should follow René Girard’s model
          of mediated desire so closely: Wentworth, observing the interested look Anne’s cousin Mr.
          Elliot casts on her at Lyme, “gave her a momentary glance . . . which seemed to
          say, ‘That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne
          Elliot again’” (97). Having been triggered by a third person, Wentworth’s feelings,
          appropriately enough, are only expressible within it. Castigating his friend Captain
          Benwick for having fallen in love with Louisa less than a year after the death of an
          adored wife, Wentworth counsels Anne that “A man does not recover from such a devotion
          . . . He ought not; he does not” (173). Speaking of his friend provides
          Wentworth with the opportunity to speak about himself, as if he were barred from directly
          expressing his feelings.</p>
                  <p>Anne and Wentworth’s eventual reconciliation follows the same pattern, offering a
          particularly literal instance of triangulated desire, in which an oblivious third speaker
          acts as a medium for Anne’s feelings in the presence of Wentworth. Faced with the prospect
          of having to go to a dinner in honor of Mr. Elliot, Charles Musgrove peevishly remarks
          “What is Mr. Elliot to me?” “The careless expression,” Austen’s narrator asserts, “was
          life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with
          his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to
          herself” (210). Both Anne and Wentworth, in the strangest of substitutions, refer the
          question to Anne rather than to Charles: ‘what is Mr. Elliot to me?’ Anne wants Wentworth
          to imagine her having said, dismissively; ‘what <emph>is</emph> Mr. Elliot to you?’
          Wentworth wants Anne to imagine him having said, anxiously. Anne is given an opportunity
          to answer this question the next day, again by proxy. This time the speaker is Mrs. Croft,
          arguing in favor of young people marrying quickly no matter their financial situation;
          Anne, we are told, “felt [the conversation’s] application to herself” (217). Austen’s
          heroine promptly enters into a passionate defense of women’s constancy in a conversation
          with a naval officer, speaking so as to be overheard by Wentworth. Inspired by Anne’s
          words, Wentworth abandons the letter he is writing and starts composing one to Anne
          instead, which she reads moments later. Wentworth’s decision to express himself in a
          letter ensures that the climatic moment of the novel, the moment in which the two lovers
          express their renewed feelings for one another, takes place out of the direct gaze of
          reader and narrator: “they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had
          once before seemed to secure everything” (225). </p>
                  <p>That the two lovers’ vows should remain unheard by the reader is fitting, since their
          relationship has been wrapped in silence from the very beginning. Anne’s father and her
          sister Elizabeth not only refuse to recognize Wentworth socially, they appear to have
          completely forgotten his existence. The first conversation in the novel concerns a former
          neighbor of Sir Walter whose name neither he nor Elizabeth nor their lawyer Mr. Shepherd
          can remember until prompted by Anne: “Wentworth was the very name! Mr. Wentworth was the
          very man” (24). The man in question turns out not to be Anne’s old lover but his brother,
          a former neighbor of the Elliots, though Sir Walter observes that “Mr. Wentworth was
          nobody, I remember” (24). The sliding of Captain Wentworth’s identity under that of the
          ‘nobody’ who is his brother continues through the opening chapters of the novel, in which
          Anne repeatedly mistakes which Wentworth brother is being discussed. Austen seems to want
          to affirm Sir Walter’s arch observation that “a Mr. (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the
          nation,) always needs a note of explanation” (24–25). Indeed the novel goes out of its way
          to provide Wentworth with just such a note, for when Anne reflects that soon
            “<emph>he</emph>, perhaps, may be walking here” (25), the next chapter opens by
          pedantically noting “<emph>He</emph> was not Mr. Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,
          however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother”
          (26). </p>
                  <p>What motive could Austen have for repeatedly confusing the hero of her novel with a man
          who never actually appears in it? The fussiness of Austen’s syntax—“<emph>He</emph> was
          not”—represents a curiously literal acknowledgement of the ambiguity of the third person,
          which, because it “does not specifically designate anything or anyone . . . can
          take any subject whatsoever or no subject” (Benveniste 199). The hesitation with which the
          novel introduces Wentworth mirrors the indifference with which he is regarded by the
          Elliots, whose monumental self-regard is signaled by their adoption of the third person in
          referring to themselves. The first thing we are told about Anne’s father is that “Sir
          Walter Elliot was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion” (6), an
          attitude adopted with equal zeal by Elizabeth and her obsequious friend Mrs. Clay, all of
          whom speak in one voice: “‘Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot. They did not know’”
          (131). The conflation of subjects results in a confusion of direct and indirect speech,
          most conspicuously in Sir Walter’s opening remarks, in which he responds to Lady Russell’s
          suggestion that he rein in his expenses: <quote>‘What! every comfort of life knocked off!
            Journeys, London, servants, horses, table—contractions and restrictions every where! To
            live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman! No, he would sooner quit
            Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.’ (14)</quote> The
          elimination of the distinction between direct and indirect speech makes conversation oddly
          permeable, allowing the narrative to take part in the very conversation it records: “‘Quit
          Kellynch Hall.’ The hint was immediately taken up by Mr. Shepherd . . . ‘Since
          the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,’
          he said, ‘in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side” (14). No one repeats
          Sir Walter’s utterance “Quit Kellynch Hall,” yet the words appear in quotation marks
          nonetheless. “‘he had no scruple,’ he said,” except that <emph>he</emph> didn’t say that;
          the narrator did. No wonder Mr. Shepherd refers to “the very quarter which ought to
          dictate.”</p>
                  <p>At times <title level="m">Persuasion</title> betrays a remarkable lack of interest in
          specifying who is speaking and when. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of this comes in
          another passage of free direct discourse, in which the panicked statements of a number of
          different characters in the aftermath of Louisa’s fall are contained within a single set
          of quotation marks: <quote>‘Uppercross,—the necessity of some one’s going to Uppercross,—
            the news to be conveyed—how it could be broken to Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove—the lateness of
            the morning,—an hour already gone since they ought to have been off,—the impossibility
            of being in tolerable time.’ (105)</quote> The only person whose voice is not part of
          this concord, Anne, is rarely granted the privilege of quotation marks, speaking almost
          always indirectly: “Anne quietly tried to convince her [sister] . . . Anne
          avoided a direct reply” (99). This does not mean, however, that Anne is silent through the
          course of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. Mary and her husband Charles value Anne as
          a house guest precisely because she is so adept at conveying their needs and desires to
          one another, while never giving voice to her own. Having been converted into a medium for
          the feelings of others, it seems only fitting that Anne needs a medium of her own in which
          to express her own feelings.</p>
                  <p>Her family’s reluctance directly to address Anne is not surprising given their belief
          that, like Wentworth’s brother, she is “nobody” (7). But then, this appears to be Anne’s
          view of herself: “her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way—she was
          only Anne” (7). For Miller, Anne’s sense of herself as ‘nobody’ represents such a thorough
          internalization of the position adopted by the narrative that <title level="m">Persuasion</title> gives the impression of having originated with Anne herself, as if
          it were “a diary written in the third person” (<title level="m">Jane Austen</title>
            72–73).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miller’s reading is based on an unpublished
            essay by David Kurnick: “Throwing Her Voice: <title level="m">Persuasion</title>’s
            Erotics of Indirection.”</note> The formulation is irresistible. I would only add that
          such a diary is the product of many hands. For just as Anne’s adoption of the third person
          to talk about herself represents “a thorough internalization” of the narrative, so the
          references to her in the third person that Anne overhears while playing the piano at a
          dance at the Musgroves represent a thorough externalization of it: “she has quite given up
          dancing. She had rather play. She is never tired of playing” (67). Anne is of such little
          consequence that she can be spoken of as if she were not present—as if, that is, she had
          no means of claiming the first person for herself.</p>
                  <p> Anne’s situation is not dissimilar to Fanny Crawford’s in <title level="m">Mansfield
            Park</title>. Like Anne, Fanny is constantly spoken for and about; like her, she is
          often privy to the intimate conversations of others. Page observes of the heroine of
            <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> that “perhaps no heroine of a great novel has
          quite such a fondness for silence” (<title level="m">Language</title> 36) but in fact
          Fanny, like Anne, speaks more than we might think—it is just that almost all her speech is
          indirect, whether or not it appears in quotation marks.<note place="foot" resp="editors">George Eliot adopts this technique near the end of <title level="m">The Mill on the
              Floss</title> for seemingly similar reasons. In response to Lucy Deane’s urging that
            he absolve his sister from her promise never to see Philip Wakem, Tom Tulliver replies
            that “of course Maggie could do as she liked. For Tom’s part, he held himself to be
            bound by his duty to his father’s memory” (456). Despite appearing within quotation
            marks Tom’s speech cannot be direct, underscoring how unapproachable, even inaccessible,
            he is on the subject of what he and his sister owe the past.</note> In this sense her
          first reported utterance—“‘William did not like she should come away’” (13)—parallels her
          last, on which Austen’s narrator refuses to report: “Let no one presume to give the
          feelings of a young woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which she has
          scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope” (370).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Roy
            Pascal, in his indispensable study of free indirect discourse, points to Fanny’s opening
            remark as evidence that she “can hardly arrogate the self-assertive ‘I’ for herself”
            (51–52).</note> Anne-Lise François notes that “Austen’s third-person narration
          . . . relieves Fanny from first-person assertions” (224). But Fanny is sheltered
          from the first person even in direct discourse. The episode detailing Miss Crawford’s gift
          of the necklace to Fanny, for example, records all of Mary’s remarks, but none of Fanny’s
          responses, restricting itself merely to noting that Fanny has responded: “Fanny still
          resisted . . . Fanny protested . . . Fanny dared not make any further
          opposition” (202–4). The effect of placing Fanny, like Anne, outside the moment of
          utterance is to insulate her from the world, indeed from the passing of time. If Tony
          Tanner is right to argues that <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> tells the story of
          “a girl who triumphs by doing nothing . . . she waits, she endures” (143) then
          we might say that removing her from direct discourse affords her a time in which to wait,
          just as the novel’s trick of exiling her to Portsmouth provides her with a place in which
          to do so. Thus Fanny preserves her defining characteristic: moral consistency; she remains
          where she is—in the right—while Edmund and Sir Thomas Bertram slowly move toward her. </p>
                  <p>Consistency is not exactly Anne Elliot’s defining trait, as Captain Wentworth knows to
          his cost. Yet, just like Fanny, Anne spends the novel of which she is the heroine standing
          still while others come round to her position. This results in a curious temporal
          dissimilarity between Anne’s consciousness of events, to which Austen’s free indirect
          discourse gives us unparalleled access, and that of those around her. Anne inhabits a time
          all her own. Consider, for example, the first, oddly delayed, words she speaks in the
          text. Introduced with the portentous line, “Here Anne spoke” (20), her opening remark is
          uttered in support of the idea that her improvident father should let his house to an
          admiral, but it can also read as a response, eight years too late, to Lady Russell’s
          objection to the idea of her marrying a sailor: “The navy, I think, who have done so much
          for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men” (20). Anne’s words do not
          possess a double meaning so much as occupy a double time. This time can best be glimpsed
          in two distinct yet similar moments in the text in which Wentworth saves Anne: first from
          the unwanted attentions of her young nephew—“some one was taking him from her
          . . . and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth
          had done it” (74)—second from a tiring walk—“he had done it. She was in the carriage, and
          felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it” (84). Both
          episodes are described from within Anne’s consciousness, a place where Wentworth, here
          “some one” rather than no-one, needs no introduction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
            a compelling reading of these twinned moments Adela Pinch observes that “Austen’s
            representation of Anne’s innerness takes the form of an <emph>inward</emph>ness that
            oddly seems only penetrated from the outside with difficulty” (106).</note> And both
          play strange tricks with time, the sign of which is the odd repetition of the phrase, “had
          done it.” </p>
                  <p>Anne’s delayed perception is signaled by the strangely impersonal syntax, which sticks
          resolutely and confusingly to the third person, whether describing Wentworth, Anne’s
          nephew, or Anne herself. The passages are written in the third person of free indirect
          discourse, yet the perceptions belong exclusively to Anne. They do however share a
          significant feature of free indirect discourse: they lift the speaker out of the time of
          the narrative. Austen anticipates in such passages the kind of atomistic temporality
          common to modernist novelists such as Virginia Woolf, whose commitment to representing
          individual consciousness estranges her characters from each other, as if they failed to
          inhabit the same temporal moment. One of the striking characteristics of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, for example, is how often characters fall into reveries
          while speaking to one another: “From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of
          some minutes by Willoughby . . . rousing himself from a reverie at least equally
          painful” (309). <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> could be said to personify such
          reveries in the still, silent presence of Fanny, which might explain its oddly playful
          attitude to time, which it bends to suit its own purposes: “exactly at the time when it
          was quite natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care
          about Miss Crawford, and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire”
          (369). </p>
                  <p>The same elasticity marks the passage of time in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>.
          Just a few moments elapse between Wentworth writing the letter to Anne and Anne reading
          it, and just a few moments more before they are reunited.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Rae Greiner provides a fascinating reading of this episode in her essay “The Art of
            Knowing One’s Own Nothingness.”</note> Although Anne and Wentworth have to endure an
          agonizing wait, their second courtship possesses a strangely accelerated tempo: “Before
          Mrs. Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw
          him” (164). After the pair finally reconcile, time speeds up to such an extent that it
          erases the distinctions between moments upon which the passing of time depends: “All the
          little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there
          could scarcely be an end” (226). The repeat engagement with which the novel ends abolishes
          the passing of time altogether. For not just Anne’s consciousness is out of step with
          those around her; the text as a whole could be said to be out of synch, beginning with the
          act of persuasion which gives Austen her title, which is not only never narrated but takes
          place, strictly speaking, outside the time of the novel. Indeed the title, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, suggests an ongoing action rather than the results of that
          action, confusing past and present in a way that sets the tempo for the entire novel.</p>
                  <p> What reason would Austen have for organizing her last novel around a temporal
          disjunction? The answer takes us back to the relation between private and public with
          which I began, a relation introduced as early as the first paragraph of the novel, which
          reproduces the page of the <title level="m">Baronetage</title> detailing the history of
          the Elliot family. Sir Walter reads this history “with an interest which never failed”
          (5), partly because he busies himself updating the entry to include events such as his
          wife’s death and his daughter’s marriage. The amendments put public and private life at
          odds in a way that could be said to determine the novel that follows. The trajectory of
            <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is thus the opposite of the one outlined in Bowen
          and Finch, in which an all-seeing narrative makes private thoughts public. Instead, we
          find a consciousness constantly translating public events into private experience: “it
          would soon be over. And it was soon over. . . . Her eye half met Captain
          Wentworth’s, a bow, a curtsey passed . . . the room seemed full, full of persons
          and voices, but a few minutes ended it” (56). Anne’s consciousness speeds up time and
          slows it down, separates voices from persons and speakers from subjects, renders public
          life so private that one cannot even say when, where, and to whom it is happening.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay briefly explores two developments that produced a
                    remarkable turn in the relationship between philosophy and literature between
                    the publication of Hume’s Treatise in 1740 and the heyday of the Romantic
                    familiar essay in the 1820s: the socialisation of experience by Scottish
                    Enlightenment thinkers and the impact of belletristic periodical culture upon
                    philosophical discourse. These changes were interconnected, jointly exhibiting a
                    swerve away from systematic epistemology and towards a form of essayism. As the
                    literary genre of trusting intersubjectivity <foreign>par excellence</foreign>,

                    Hume’s idea of an ‘easy,’ conversational philosophy grounded in social
                    correspondence increased the epistemological burden upon essayist beyond
                    anything envisaged by Addison or Steele. The Romantic familiar essay inherits
                    this burden while changing the stakes: thus, while the rewards of essaying for
                    Hume lay in the consolidation of consensus through philosophically indifferent
                    conversation, for Lamb and Hazlitt, they consisted in the promotion of a more
                    limited social solidarity through the production of modes of reading receptive
                    to the authenticity effects of singularity and transcendence.</p>

                  <p>The fate of empiricism in the period between middle of the
                        eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century (that is, between the
                        skeptical naturalism of David Hume and the inductivism of John Stuart Mill)
                        presents a curious episode that rarely attracts comment. Around a century
                        ago, Leslie Stephen and Élie Halévy depicted this period as merely a lull or
                        hiatus in British intellectual history, one in which the collective
                        attention of philosophers was directed towards thinking through the
                        consequences of the French Revolution. Halévy, for example, claimed that
                        between David Hartley and James Mill, English thought passed “through a
                        period of standstill” (434). Against this view, I will argue here that
                        English—or, more accurately, British thought—did not so much stand still as
                        switch paradigms, at least for a period. This change is evident in two
                        developments: the socialization of experience by Scottish Enlightenment
                        thinkers and the impact of belletristic periodical culture upon
                        philosophical discourse. These two factors were linked in ways that produced
                        a remarkable turn in the relationship between philosophy and literature
                        between the publication of Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise</title> in 1740
                        and the heyday of the Romantic familiar essay in the 1820s. Consequently, at
                        least part of what Halévy registered as an absence is, in effect, a swerve
                        away from systematic epistemology and towards a form of essayism, involving
                        a corresponding change in philosophical style and vocabulary. </p>
                  <p>In this essay, I explore these developments in more detail.
                        I briefly outline the ways in which, from the mid-eighteenth century
                        onwards, the idea of intersubjectivity emerged as a counterdiscourse to a
                        scientific empiricism based upon the epistemological binary of subject and
                        object and the correspondence theory of truth. Driven by a Scottish
                        insistence that society precedes rationality, and exemplified by Hume’s idea
                        of an “easy,” conversational philosophy, empiricism was regrounded in social
                        correspondence rather than epistemological correspondence; above all, it
                        based itself in the circulation of trust and the kinds of performances that
                        reinforced that trust. As economies of knowledge were increasingly linked to
                        the maintenance of certain (trustworthy) forms of social behavior, the
                        epistemological stakes were raised for communicative acts in general, and
                        for literary works in particular. </p>
                  <p>Since the days of <title level="m">The Spectator</title>, the
                        familiar essay had functioned as the literary genre of trusting
                        intersubjectivity <emph>par excellence</emph>, a vehicle for
                        philosophical experiments in communication. And yet, Hume’s treatment of
                        trust was more radical than that of his Augustan precursors, raising the
                        stakes for the essayistic performance. Only with Hume’s conventionalist
                        treatment of rationality did it become possible for empiricism to
                        accommodate the idea that truth <emph>presupposes</emph>
                        communication and that subjectivity itself is constructed relationally, via
                        interactions with others. In the final section of the essay, I will suggest
                        that, while Hume’s language game of proto-pragmatic essayism is continued in
                        the Romantic familiar essay, the <emph>strategy</emph> for
                        promoting intersubjectivity changed in the early nineteenth century. Where
                        the rewards of essaying for Hume lay in the consolidation of consensus
                        through philosophically indifferent conversation, for a Romantic essayist
                        such as Lamb, they consisted in the promotion of solidarity through the
                        production of transcendence and re-enchantment.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hume’s “easy” empiricism</head>
                  <p>The idea that Hume promoted a form of empiricism based upon
                        trust and intersubjective consensus will inevitably strike many as
                        counterintuitive. Some might even claim that Hume was the <emph>least</emph> trusting of all Enlightenment thinkers. It was Hume, after
                        all, who wrote in the <title level="m">Treatise of Human Nature</title> that
                        “[n]o weakness of human nature is more universal and conspicuous than what
                        we commonly call Credulity, or a too easy faith in the testimony of others . 
                        . .” (112)—a remark that foreshadowed his celebrated attack on testimonial
                        evidence in the “Essay on Miracles.” Certainly, the skeptical part of Hume’s
                        thought is not in dispute. By arguing that all our ideas are either “<emph>copy'd from our impressions</emph>” (72) or made up of
                        simple ideas that are themselves derived from impressions, Hume picks at a
                        loose thread in Locke’s account of cognition. By the time he has finished
                        pulling at this thread, he has completely unravelled the idea of causation,
                        since “from the mere repetition of any past impression, even to infinity,
                        there will never arise any new original idea, such as that of a necessary
                        connexion . . .” (88). Nor does this unwinding of knowledge end with
                        causation. Ultimately, belief itself is shown to rest upon nothing more
                        substantial than sentiment: the “force and vivacity” communicated by an
                        impression to an idea, which “super-adds nothing to the idea, but only
                        changes our manner of conceiving it . . .” (101). Nonetheless, as Hume
                        concedes later in <title level="m">An Enquiry Concerning Human
                            Understanding</title>, one cannot live one’s life as a skeptic: “Nature
                        will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract
                        reasoning whatsoever” (41). </p>
                  <p>It is because of this caveat that Hume’s arguments in the <title level="m">Treatise</title> have carried an air of paradox for many readers. As
                        Kenneth Richman notes, “Hume appears to do the following: (a) endorse
                        beliefs in objects and causes, (b) hold that we should not endorse beliefs
                        that do not have appropriate grounding in our impressions . . . and (c) hold
                        that the beliefs in objects and causes do not have appropriate grounding of
                        our impressions” (3). One result of this paradox is a split between what
                        Richman calls “Old” Humeans and “New” Humeans. Commentators of the former
                        persuasion, such as Stephen and Halévy, tend to downplay position (a) and
                        emphasise (b) and (c). Accordingly, such “skeptical” readings of Hume tend
                        to see his impressionism as exhaustively phenomenalistic. According to this
                        view, Hume’s skeptical attack on representationalism and the
                        “correspondence” model of truth signals the bankruptcy of an abstracted,
                        atomistic view of experience and meaning. Since the work of Norman Kemp
                        Smith, however, there has been a tendency to downplay positions (b) and (c)
                        and foreground (a). Following this line of interpretation, “New” Humeans
                        such as Annette Baier, Peter Jones and Donald Livingston see Hume’s
                        impressionism as a maneuver whereby Hume exploded the hypostatized
                        vocabulary of ideas and impressions in order to create a new language of
                        experience based upon non-epistemological principles of feeling, habit and
                        custom. From this perspective, Hume’s adoption and deconstruction of the
                        language of “ideas” is the first step in a process of redescription that
                        restored the social, dialogical and experimental dimensions to
                        “experience.”</p>
                  <p>One virtue of such readings (though not one previously noted) is that they
                        highlight the significance of the subtitle of the <title level="m">Treatise</title>: “An Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of
                        Reasoning into Moral Subjects.” Hume’s very specific use of the term
                        “experimental” here is easily overlooked. Since Locke, empirical philosophy
                        had entertained the idea of the mind as a forum for philosophical
                        experimentation. For Hume, however, the laboratory for empirical experiment
                        was not the mind as Locke’s <foreign>camera obscura</foreign> of
                        abstracted consciousness, but something closer to mind <emph>in
                            society</emph>. He makes this point quite explicitly in his Introduction
                        to the <title level="m">Treatise</title> when he cautions the reader that
                        “[w]e must . . . glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious
                        observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common course
                        of the world, by men’s behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their
                        pleasures” (xix). In this way, Hume effected a transition from a model of
                        thought based upon pure induction and <title level="m">objectivity</title>
                        (i.e. upon an epistemological binary of subject / object) to one that was
                        based upon sentiment and <title level="m">intersubjectivity</title>. By
                        downgrading “correspondence” theories of truth and meaning, which generally
                        viewed experience as a form of representation, he abandoned the Lockean
                        image of punctual subjectivity: that is, one constituted by a manifold of
                        atomized experiences (ideas and impressions), and underwritten by a
                        providential rationality. In its place, Hume developed a model of
                        “experience” based in trial and experiment within a constitutive framework
                        of social custom, sentiment, and most importantly, trust.<note place="foot">
                                    Significantly, until the eighteenth century, the words
                                    ‘experience” and “experiment” are so closely associated that
                                    they are used more or less synonymously to mean the act of
                                    practical, tentative trial. Johnson’s <title level="m">Dictionary</title> testifies to this continued intimacy,
                                    defining the noun “experience” as “1. Practice; frequent trial”
                                    and “2. Knowledge gained by trial and practice.” The latter
                                    notion of experience as <emph>practice</emph> rather
                                    than as <emph>phenomena</emph> was still current at
                                    the time and is in turn associated with a heightened awareness
                                    of the epistemic role of fictions in discourse. Once
                                    epistemological relations are redescribed in terms of social
                                    relationships, the most pressing questions that arise relate to
                                    the status of the norms and bonds that regulate the community of
                                    knowledge. This ultimately produces a concern with what might be
                                    considered as the social <foreign>a priori</foreign> of
                                    knowledge: rational accommodation, trust and testimony.
                                </note> Trust became vital to Hume’s thought precisely
                        because his skeptical approach left the human intellect with no other means
                        of support than the <emph>sentiment</emph> of belief, the <emph>manner</emph> in which the object is conceived. As Miriam
                        Solomon argues, the lesson Hume derives from skepticism is that “knowledge
                        requires more than reason and experience, not that knowledge is impossible”
                        (52). For Hume, radical skepticism led to social empiricism. </p>

                  <head>The familiar essay as philosophical
                            performance</head>
                  <p>Thanks to Hume then, literary form became a philosophical
                        issue. Interest in the regulation of trust by means of literary performances
                        that consolidated social and epistemological norms engendered, in turn, a
                        concern with the performative dimension of language as well as with the
                        status and function of philosophical writing. In particular, the essay, with
                        its amenability to tentative, unmethodical improvisation and friendly
                        conversation, appeared to fit an image of reason based on the very ideas of
                        custom, habit and sentiment presented in Hume’s picture of a decenterd,
                        constitutive intersubjectivity. Tellingly, as Hume abandoned
                        representational empiricism in favour of “easy” empiricism, he drew away
                        from the systematic treatise and moved towards the familiar essay as <emph>the</emph> genre of philosophy. </p>
                  <p>To an extent, Hume was walking a well-trodden path. Since the days of <title level="j">The Spectator</title> and <title level="j">The Tatler</title>,
                        the periodical essay had functioned as both medium and model for the open,
                        egalitarian and polite discursiveness of the public sphere. Addison and
                        Steele had exploited the essay’s potential to move amphibiously across
                        boundaries, between philosophical and literary modes of expression, as well
                        as between academic and informal writing. Most notably, in <title level="j">The Spectator</title> no. 10, Addison declared his intention to emulate
                        Socrates, who “brought Philosophy down from Heaven, to inhabit among Men,”
                        by bringing “Philosophy out of Closets and Libraries, Schools and Colleges,
                        to dwell in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea-tables, and in Coffee-houses” (44).
                        In this way, essaying as an activity eschewed the quest for certainty in
                        order to foster an idea of “experience” very close to that outlined in the
                        Introduction to Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise</title>: an experimental
                        activity in which the mind came to reshape itself through its engagement
                        with human life in “the common course of the world.”</p>
                  <p>And yet, there is a vital difference between the essayism
                        of Hume and that of Addison. For Addison, the Lockean subject remained
                        intellectually punctual and intact. Consequently, despite his claim that the
                        experimentalism of the familiar essay provided philosophy with a pathway
                        from the cloisters of learning into the bright thoroughfare of the public
                        sphere, Addison did not consider the possibility that the very customs,
                        habits and conventions depicted in the pages of <title level="j">The
                            Tatler</title> and <title level="m">The Spectator</title> might themselves be
                        epistemologically constitutive. The correspondence between “trust” and
                        “truth” ran in one direction only: the former could, at most, only ever
                        count as limited evidence for the latter. For Hume, however, truth <emph>itself</emph> could not be separated from “common life and
                        Conversation.” Consequently, what one finds in the essays of Hume is a more
                        radical socialization of empiricism in the face of an intolerable but
                        incorrigible epistemological skepticism. By replacing Locke’s providential,
                        private, and pictorial conception of human reason with a conventional,
                        public, and grammatical one, Hume implied that the truth of any empirical
                        statement ultimately depended upon the <emph>manner</emph> of its
                        performance and upon the “sentiment” attached to its conception. In
                        foregrounding the performative function of philosophical language, Hume
                        dramatically raised the stakes for the essayist as stylist. Put simply,
                        manner became everything.</p>
                  <p>It is this consciousness of the fundamentally <emph>performative</emph> nature of the philosophical writer’s
                        task that distinguishes mid-century essayists such as Hume and Johnson from
                        their Augustan predecessors. After Hume, the problem of empiricism’s
                        relation to public discourse was no longer simply one of how philosophical
                        thoughts might be curated and transmitted to the reading public, it was also
                        one of how an empirical concept of “experience” might itself be shaped by
                        the conventions and practices of communication. In effect, Hume’s insistence
                        that conversation forms a constitutive part of experience radicalised
                        Addison’s project to socialize philosophy by placing intersubjectivity at
                        the very core of human thought: while Addison and Steele brought philosophy
                        to the “coffee-house,” Hume endeavoured to bring the “coffee-house” to
                        philosophy.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, Hume’s own essays attempted to police polite
                        culture through performances of moderate skepticism. He developed an “easy,”
                        conversable empiricism that endeavored to reinforce solidarity rather than
                        demonstrate logical certainty. And yet, the very need to “reinforce” trust
                        indicated that trust had its limits. Hume’s technique as a writer
                        incorporated the thought that these limits are not defined rationally, but
                        through human second nature: through emotion, custom, and habit. In this
                        respect, Hume is the disciple of Cicero rather than Newton, deploying
                        measured prose that asserts epistemic authority through its rhetoric of
                        reasonableness and moderation, through its commanding <emph>exhibition</emph> of communicability. Nowhere is this more evident than
                        in the exemplary act of polite self-fashioning exhibited by his suitably
                        brief autobiographical essay, “My Own Life,” in which the reader encounters
                        the persona of the philosophically indifferent man of letters: <quote>
                    To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or
                        rather was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself,
                        which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of
                        mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful
                        humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of
                        great moderation in all my passions. (<title level="m">Essays</title> xl)</quote>
                    Here, the cardinal virtues of Hume’s Academic skepticism,
                        of “mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and
                        cheerful humour,” are revealed to be those of the author himself. Above all,
                        the “moderation” of the philosopher’s passions, which is itself reflected in
                        the modesty of the self-representation Hume offers, typifies the
                        philosophical attribute of <foreign>ataraxia</foreign> (detachment)
                        required to live a civilized and enlightened life without epistemic grounds
                        or foundations. This philosophical moderation lay at the heart of Hume’s
                        essayism, insofar as the essay genre provided him with a literary analogue
                        for the conversable world and an antidote to the philosophical enthusiasm of
                        systematic, rationalist philosophy. In this way, Hume used the familiar
                        discourse of the essay to reposition epistemology, moving it away from what
                        he saw as the ineffectual domains of truth and reason and into the active
                        territory of public discourse, custom, and opinion. By doing so, he
                        relocated the philosophical authority of the man of letters from the
                        foundations of truth to the circulation of trust.</p>
                  <p>This meant that the essayist took on the role of a diplomat
                        between the worlds of learning and polite conversation, or as Hume puts it
                        in his unpublished essay “Of Essay-Writing,” as “a Kind of Resident or
                        Ambassador from the Dominions of Learning to those of Conversation . . 
                        .”:

                    Once again, as Hume makes clear in this passage, experience
                        cannot be separated from “common life and Conversation.” The essayist,
                        unlike the solitary scholar, adapts the “the higher and more difficult
                        Operations of the Mind” to “the easier and more gentle Exercises of the
                        Understanding” (<title level="m">Essays</title> 533) not because (or not
                        solely because) this helps him to communicate truth, but because it is <emph>only</emph> in such communication that truth ultimately

                  <head>Sociability through re-enchantment: The
                            Romantic familiar essay.</head>
                  <p>What does the familiar essay’s shifting epistemological
                        significance in the eighteenth century tell us about the development of the
                        genre in the early nineteenth century? Essayists such as Lamb and Hazlitt
                        inherited from Hume and Johnson a readiness to draw upon the performative
                        resources of the familiar essay in order to imagine a shared community of
                        opinion and belief. What distinguishes Romantic essayists from their
                        predecessors, however, is the issue of what was at <emph>stake</emph> in the performance of essaying. For the latter, the language
                        game engaged by the familiar essay necessitated that certain normative
                        structures were <emph>presupposed</emph>. For Hume in particular,
                        such structures were determined by custom and reinforced by the exhibition
                        of courteous manners. In such cases, it was assumed that the reader could
                        not fully appreciate the performance of the author without already sharing a
                        great deal of their “common” background of beliefs. In other words, what was
                        epistemologically at stake for the Neoclassical familiar essayist was the
                        status of a truth whose verifiability is fundamentally a practical and
                        intersubjective affair.</p>
                  <p>For the essayist of the early nineteenth century, however,
                        the fiction of familiarity was beginning to wear thin. Indeed, perceptions
                        of what was at stake in the literary performance of the essay had already
                        begun to shift significantly by the end of the eighteenth century. Most
                        notably, the political upheavals of the 1790s made the consolidation of
                        imagined solidarity envisaged by Hume appear more nakedly politicized,
                        recast by Burke as a call for national unity around feelings of familial
                        partiality and prejudice. Moreover, the essayist now wrote for a marketplace
                        that had expanded and diversified: as Jon Klancher and William St. Clair
                        have documented, patronage and subscription had given way to contracts with
                        booksellers, the periodical essay had been replaced by the magazine and the
                        newspaper, and an increasingly productive printing press was undergoing its
                        industrial revolution. This environment presented the essayist with new
                        challenges: it was difficult to consolidate ways of understanding the world
                        when the common ground of good sense and precedent presupposed by Hume and
                        Johnson had fragmented, polarized, or been discredited. Hume’s Ciceronian
                        idea of literature as the domain of polite letters, courtly virtues and easy
                        philosophizing was overtaken by the Romantic notion of literature as, in
                        Wordsworth’s phrase, “the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge . . .”
                        (141). As social harmonies were exchanged for transcendental sublimities,
                        the Romantic enactment of familiar conversation sought to establish a
                        different relationship with readers, one based in the idealized grounds of
                        singularity and enchantment. </p>
                  <p>Consequently, the Romantic essayist’s primary task became
                        one of establishing social and epistemological norms through the exercise of
                        imaginative power. As writers sought new grounds for literary “truth,” the
                        experimental maintenance and consolidation of intersubjective consensus were
                        replaced by the experimental <emph>production</emph> and
                        exploration of new intellectual territory. This shift is reflected in the
                        changing persona of the essayist. While the individual figured in the prose
                        identity of Hume presupposed an intersubjective conception of the speaking
                        subject—one whose unity is held together by pragmatic, rather than by
                        metaphysical, principles—in philosophical Romanticism, the unification of
                        style and substance was underpinned by an <emph>ideal</emph>
                        presence. Rather than seeking to reinforce consensuality, the subject
                        invoked by the Romantic familiar essay was one who searches, however
                        unsuccessfully, for transcendental authentication. The persona of Lamb’s
                        essayist, for instance, is constructed around the ironic and partial
                        recuperation of a lost wholeness, often figured as a borderline, twilight
                        territory of enchanted consciousness. “Imperfect Sympathies,” with its digs
                        at the moral philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment, exemplifies this
                        condition while explicitly opposing it to a “Scottish” tradition of
                        intellectualized intersubjectivity:

                        sort of faculties I allude to, have minds rather suggestive than
                        comprehensive. They have no pretences to much clearness or precision in
                        their ideas, or in their manner of expressing them. Their intellectual
                        wardrobe (to confess freely) has few whole pieces in it. They are content
                        with fragments and scattered pieces of Truth. . . . The light that lights
                        them is not steady and polar, but mutable and shifting: waxing, and again

                    Whether or not Lamb had Hume in mind as his model of the
                        “Caledonian” intellect, the “systematizer” label is one that the latter
                        would have rejected, belying as it does his concern with folding the
                        <foreign>episteme </foreign>of scientific knowledge
                        into the <foreign>doxa</foreign> of social
                        communication. Indeed, for Hume, as long as the credit supply of trust
                        underpinning intersubjective consensus could be maintained, the metaphysical
                        status of human belief need not be a pressing concern, still less one that
                        called for systematization. The task of the essayist as an epistemological
                        diplomat was to keep conversation going, and above all to keep such
                        conversation polite and civilized. In “Imperfect Sympathies,” however,
                        epistemological doubt itself becomes aestheticized into an ideal presence
                        that can only be approached through imagination. Instead of seeking to
                        consolidate assumed intersubjective consensus <foreign>à la</foreign>
                        the “Caledonian” constitution, Lamb’s “Elia” essays endeavor to <emph>produce</emph> affective connections through a kind of
                        exemplary performance of individuality. Elia offers to engage his reader in
                        a language game based upon the celebration of whim, prejudice and
                        singularity. The state of mind required for this game is precisely what the
                        “brain of a true Caledonian” lacks, i.e., “misgivings, half-intuitions,
                        semi-consciousnesses, partial illuminations, dim instincts, embryo
                        conceptions.” In this way, the aporia that caused Hume to abandon
                        epistemology altogether is reified in Lamb as a borderline territory of
                        re-enchantment: what Elia refers to as “[t]he twilight of dubiety” (60).
                        Whereas in Hume the protean nature of the familiar essay is utilized in the
                        service of dialogue, in Lamb the essay’s shapelessness is <emph>itself</emph> aestheticized, offering to charm the reader rather than
                        draw them into an imaginary conversation. Rather than being dedicated to the
                        maintenance of everyday experience in the common course of the world, the
                        essay’s liminality is redirected towards the recovery and transcendence of
                        the ordinary through the thoroughly extraordinary performance of the
                        essayist. </p>
                  <p>The differences between the two essayists should not be
                        overstated. Like Hume, Lamb uses the conversational character of the
                        familiar essay in order to conduct experiments in trust with his readers.
                        What the persona of Elia offers in return for such trust, however, is not so
                        much reassuring sociability as the possibility of the reader’s
                        re-enchantment with the world. Indeed, in his essay “The Old Margate Hoy”
                        (1823), Elia introduces a figure who uncannily resembles the essayist
                        himself. Recounting a sea trip upon the eponymous vessel during a miserable
                        holiday to the south coast of England, Lamb describes one of his fellow
                        passengers as “the greatest liar I had met with then, or since,” one who
                        “plunged at once into the depths of your credulity.” This “Spanish
                        complexioned young man” tells tall tales of how he had served as
                        aide-de-camp to a Persian prince, seen a phoenix in Egypt and sailed through
                        the legs of the Colossus at Rhode. And yet, rather than inciting irritated
                        incredulity, these stories offer a welcome respite from the tedium of the
                        boat trip. More specifically, Elia recounts, “[h]is dreaming fancies had
                        transported us beyond the ‘ignorant present.’” Like the reader, the
                        passengers on the boat are placed temporarily “in a new world, with
                        everything unfamiliar about us, and the time and place disposed us to the
                        reception of any prodigious marvel whatsoever” (178–79). In a similar way,
                        Lamb’s method as an essayist is to play a delicate game with the trust of
                        his reader. Like the liar that his very name evokes, “Elia” dives straight
                        into his reader’s confidence. By doing so, however, he does not forfeit
                        trust: in the essay, as on the deck of the boat, there is an implicit
                        recognition that the normal rules of social intercourse are suspended. </p>
                  <p>One might take this further, and suggest that the familiar
                        essay as a genre internalizes and experiments with the thought that such a
                        “leap of faith,” or act of trust is fundamental to all human communication,
                        and not just in the conspicuously groundless conditions of a boat
                        expedition, where the subject is all at sea. Hume’s essays in “easy”
                        empiricism and Lamb’s “Old Margate Hoy” reject the idea that language is a
                        medium for expressing what we have already thought. In reality, they
                        suggest, we never get to construct our thoughts in a kind of empirical dry
                        dock; instead, like the essayist, we must first dive into conversation and
                        build our vessel out of port. For Hume, the essayist’s task is to steady
                        this vessel, to keep it afloat through the polite performance of certain
                        virtues and manners. Lamb’s Elia, on the other hand, is more concerned with
                        cultivating a sense of wonder in the spontaneity of the dialogue that
                        floated thought in the first place, at the very possibility of a shared
                        experience, amid surmises and semi-consciousness, that might count as
                        “truth.” Despite their many differences, however, the writings of Hume and
                        Lamb share an awareness of the way that the performance of the familiar
                        essayist’s experiments can promote or imperil the communication upon which
                        social knowledge depends. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>It follows from the foregoing that the title of Lamb’s
                        self-consciously unsympathetic essay should be treated with caution. Lamb’s
                        essayism does not signal a radical departure from the language of trust and
                        intersubjectivity developed by Hume and the thinkers of the Scottish
                        Enlightenment, an edging out of social empiricism by Romantic idealism.
                        Instead, what both Hume and Lamb’s prose writings exhibit is a profound
                        ambivalence towards systematic philosophy itself. It is this ambivalence
                        that lends the familiar essay in this period its shape and its fundamental
                        purpose, creating a space in which formal understanding, aesthetic
                        appreciation and social communication overlapped. Seen from this
                        perspective, the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Hume and
                        the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Lamb had a surprising
                        amount in common, not least in the ways that both defied
                        contemporary philosophical taxonomies. </p>
                  <p>Nonetheless, in its idealization of incompleteness, Lamb’s
                        sympathetically unsympathetic broadside against philosophy approximates a
                        concept of aesthetic irony in ways that Hume’s does not. At the heart of
                        this irony, as formulated two decades earlier in the Romanticism of the Jena
                        circle, is transcendental philosophy’s concern with thought’s presupposition
                        of the incomprehensible. This concern is expressed most distinctly by
                        Friedrich Schlegel’s warning, in his essay “On Incomprehensibility,” against
                        rationalism:
                    <quote>Yes, even man’s most precious possession, his own inner
                        happiness, depends in the last analysis, as anybody can easily verify, on
                        some such point of strength that must be left in the dark, but that
                        nonetheless shores up and supports the whole burden and would crumble the
                        moment you subjected it to rational analysis. Verily, it would fare badly
                        for you if, as you demand, the whole world were ever to become fully
                        comprehensible in earnest. (Simpson 185) </quote>
                    In a similar way, the twilight half-knowledge contained in
                        the signature gesture of Lamb’s familiar essay is ultimately underwritten by
                        the aestheticization of the incomprehensible, by what Philippe
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy have described as the “Literary
                        Absolute,” a transcendentally postulated but unattainable unification of
                        subject and object, form and content. In theoretical terms, this entailed
                        the idea that literature <foreign>qua</foreign> “Literature” might, as
                        pure “generativity,” compensate for, or even redeem philosophy’s failure to
                        complete itself by figuring the absolute <emph>productively</emph>. In this way, as they put it, “[R]omantic thought
                        involves not only the absolute of literature, but literature as the
                        absolute. Romanticism is the inauguration of the <emph>literary
                            absolute</emph>” (12). Such a position, however, as Schlegel himself
                        acknowledged, involved setting out from (while by no means remaining in) a
                        fundamentally Kantian understanding of the dependence of phenomenal
                        experience upon strictly noumenal modes of thought. </p>
                  <p>The catch here, of course, is that in Lamb’s writing (as in
                        that of most of his British Romantic contemporaries), the labors and rewards
                        of visionary imagination are invoked in the absence of transcendental
                        apparatuses and thus a fully theorized account of the work of art itself as
                        autotelic. Consequently, while <emph>transcendence</emph> of
                        empirical, quotidian reality (Elia’s “ignorant present”) remains tacitly
                        embedded in his writing as a proleptic ideal, the <emph>transcendental</emph> conditions of this goal remain untheorized. In this
                        way, Lamb’s essays may be said to be both culturally and philosophically liminal:
                        not only do they occupy an indeterminate status between “high” and “low”
                        literature, they also offer an image of the self that brings together an
                        inherited discourse of sociability and pragmatic intersubjectivity with a
                        transcendentally idealist conception of aesthetic capability that itself
                        remains incomplete. Thus, while for Hume and his Neoclassical literary
                        milieu the problem of writing the familiar essay was one of how to ground
                        authority and consolidate knowledge in the “conversable” world in the
                        absence of apodictic certainties, the challenge facing Lamb and his
                        contemporaries was that of how to privilege the discursive space of the
                        essay as ideal and aesthetic <emph>without</emph> collapsing its
                        numinous aura of enchantment into the bathos of everyday exchange.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article makes the case that perlocution, a notoriously tricky
                    species of speech act, opens up news ways of thinking about De Quincey’s
                    autobiographical writings, particularly <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title>. Because its
                    effects are indirect, uncertain and unpredictable, perlocution helps us
                    understand language’s ability to entangle: readers, writers, memories,
                    experience, events, other texts. That uncanny ability to entangle things—and our
                    inability to ever fully disentangle them—is one of De Quincey’s abiding
                    preoccupations. Its readiest models are the famous involute and the palimpsest,
                    but examples of it exist throughout his oeuvre. De Quincey’s thinking on these
                    and related matters anticipates later theoretical concepts such as Freud’s
                    “tangle of dream thoughts," Benjamin’s <foreign>verschränkte Zeit</foreign> (entangled time), and
                    Derrida’s double bind, “which can only be endured in passion.”</p>

                     <quote> There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream
                        which has to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the
                        work of interpretation that at that point there is a tangle of
                        dream-thoughts which cannot be unraveled and which moreover adds nothing to
                        our knowledge of the content of the dream (Freud 525 / 564). </quote>

                        originally a mere reflex of my inner nature . . . What he says,
                        generally, is but that which I have said in daylight, and in meditation deep
                        enough to sculpture itself on my heart. But sometimes, as his face alters,
                        his words alter; and they do not always seem such as I have used,
                            or <emph>could</emph> use. No man can account for all things that occur
                        in dreams (De Quincey, <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title> 147).

                  <head>I. Perplexed Combinations &amp; Entangled Time</head>
                  <p>Language has long been associated with the dangers of getting entangled in
                        it. Hobbes, for instance, warns that someone who does not use language
                        carefully and consciously “will find himself entangled in words, as a bird
                        in lime-twigs; the more he struggles, the more belimed” (28). Or, in the
                        opening of his first <title level="m">Enquiry</title>, Hume says that
                        abstruse philosophers and religious fanatics alike, “unable to defend
                        themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling brambles [words] to cover
                        and protect their weakness” (1.11, 7). It is the same tack taken in Locke’s
                        “On the Abuse of Words,” where power can be grasped by “employing the
                        ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms, and
                        holding them perpetually entangled in that labyrinth” (3.10.9, 495). Hume
                        likely gets the image from Locke, and Locke from a chapter in Bacon called
                        “The Intellect’s Ladder, or the Thread of the Labyrinth.” Bacon, in turn,
                        inherits these tropes from the Italian humanist Cardano’s <title level="m">De Subtilitate</title>, which talks of “things which through
                        impropriety of language rather than intention are unintelligible and
                        entangled like knots which chance to twist upon themselves” (qtd. Wilson
                        40).</p>
                  <p>What interests me in these accounts is language’s apparent agency, its
                        ability to ensnare without anyone’s direct “intention,” as Cardano puts it.
                        The tradition of British empiricism rarely uses terms such as
                            <emph>entangle</emph>, but when it appears it often describes language’s
                        material-like power, a force that can “hold” you “perpetually entangled in
                        that labyrinth”: i.e., language itself. There is, of course, also a more
                        positive, and more literary, account of language’s entangling activity, one
                        that goes at least back to Petrarch. That counter to language’s undead
                        materialism is perhaps best articulated by Sterne’s Yorick who describes his
                            <title level="m">Sentimental Journey</title> thus: “’Tis going, I own,
                        like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy adventures.
                        But I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the
                        existence of a soul within me, as when I am entangled in them” (95). Here
                        language (“adventures,” or rather the temptingly melancholy narratives of
                        them that Yorick hears, reads and relates) might be material, but its
                        entangling activity uncovers something seemingly immaterial—the “soul within
                        me” and, perhaps, within it. For Sterne, the eighteenth century’s
                        arch-thinker of entanglement, getting “entangled in telling a plain story”
                            (<title level="m">TS</title>, 263) and in the relationships that telling
                        precipitates, is active proof of language’s divinity.</p>
                  <p>More than half a century later, having imbibed critiques of that empiricist
                        tradition by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, and also
                        having imbibed tremendous quantities of a very different kind of riposte to
                        empiricism (viz., <emph>opium</emph>), De Quincey arrives at a Sternian
                        conclusion, at once speculative and devastating: <quote>And, recollecting it
                            [his sister’s death], often I have been struck with the important
                            truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts and feelings pass to us
                            through perplexed combinations of <emph>concrete</emph> objects, pass to
                            us as <emph>involutes</emph> (if I may coin that word) in compound
                            experiences incapable of being disentangled, than ever reach us
                                <emph>directly</emph>, and in their own abstract shapes (<title level="m">Suspiria</title>, 97).<note place="foot">For De Quincey’s

                        we may—and <title level="m">Suspiria</title> is a record of De Quincey’s
                        trying—we cannot “disentangle” or “abstract” (separate, isolate, pull away)
                        certain “compound experiences” or “perplexed combinations” of our
                        memories.</p>
                  <p>Our deepest thoughts’ and feelings’ “concreteness” (their having grown
                        together), it would seem, happens in a Proustian <title level="m">verschränkte Zeit</title>, an “entangled” or “intertwined” time where
                        experiences only become legible when properly constellated in memory and
                        lived time (<title level="m">SW2.1</title> 244). For Benjamin, “The eternity
                        which Proust opens to view is intertwined time, not boundless time. His true
                        interest is in the passage of time in its most real—that is,
                        intertwined—form”; “the heart of Proust’s world” is “this universe of
                        intertwining” where “<title level="m">correspondances</title> rule” (<title level="m">SW2.1</title> 244). This is a fair description of De Quincey’s
                        involutes, where past artifacts and events become legible only when properly
                        constellated with lived reality. But De Quincey’s eternity yawns deeper, and
                        his “true interest” is harder to locate, much less his conception of truth.
                        “The world,” as Benjamin says elsewhere, “is knowable <title level="m">now</title>,” which is precisely where to find “truth” (<title level="m">SW1</title> 277). In that <title level="m">now</title> that
                        exceeds subjective intention, “truth is charged to the bursting point” by
                        the historical images that happen, at that moment, to become synchronic with
                        it. A <title level="m">now</title> worthy of the name draws aspects of the
                        past into alignment with it and in a flash knowledge is produced—“the text
                        [and the possibility of reading it] is the long roll of thunder that
                        follows” (<title level="m">Arcades</title> 462 N2a,3). De Quincey’s oeuvre
                        and personal mythology are also premised on a model of reading: the brain as

                            receptive to impressions; they typically remain hidden and
                            recorded-over, to be brought into sudden constellation with other
                            experiences and memories. John describes an involute as “an intricately
                            coiled or interwoven manifold.” In reading De Quincey’s entire corpus as
                            tied to master-involute, the death of his sister, I think Barrell
                            sometimes condenses or oversimplifies this figure of the tangled
                            manifold; for him, involutes seem far more capable of being
                            disentangled. See <title level="m">The Infection of Thomas De Quincey: a

                            “reflex” of De Quincey’s own “inner nature,” someone he encounters in
                            (opium) dreams. His function is therapeutic: “in uttering your secret
                            feelings to <title level="m">him</title>, you make this phantom the dark
                            symbolic mirror for reflecting to the daylight what else must be hidden
                            forever.” But he is like a “Greek Chorus,” and sometimes “swerves out of
                            [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien natures” so that De Quincey
                            “does not always know him . . . as [his] own parahelion”
                                (<title level="m">S</title> 147). In <title level="m">Dark

                            whispers” (19.69), a fact he connects to “<emph>involutes</emph> of
                            human sensibility”: “combinations in which the materials of future
                            thought or feeling are carried as imperceptibly into the mind as
                            vegetable seeds are carried variously combined” into the world (19.73).
                            His model for this involution is the scene from the <title level="m">Arabian Nights</title> where a magician places his ear to the earth
                            and picks out Aladdin’s footsteps six thousand miles away from among

                        withering effects of the death of De Quincey’s sister. I will also return to
                        Freud’s un-unravellable “tangle of dream thoughts”—that is, to
                        psychoanalysis, and resistances to it. But I will first linger on a nexus of
                        concepts that structures my argument. Entanglement (or intertwining, or
                        involution, or twisting) clearly is one, and it is related—or so I argue—to
                        De Quincey’s articulation of truth (§3)<note place="foot">Following Markus
                            Gabriel’s persuasive reading of Schelling’s <title level="m">Freedom
                                Essay</title>, we might posit a theory of performative predication
                            here. “Schelling thinks of freedom in terms of performances: freedom is
                            our capacity to produce objects by so much as stating their existence,
                            as when we assert that we just asserted something, which produces an
                            assertion as an object of investigation.” What allows us to do this is
                            “the Unground,” the universal undetermined X that is identity in
                            difference. It has no content itself, but “is maximally topic-neutral:
                            it stands for whatever can be the case and make a statement about it
                            true” (97). De Quincey’s “abstract shapes” are like this
                            identity-in-difference, but all that “pass[es] to us” of it are
                            “concrete objects” and “perplexed combinations.” The “important truth”
                            that strikes De Quincey is, perhaps, disjunction or identity, a truth he
                            futilely tries to comprehend via entanglement, what Schelling might call
                            “interconnected resistants” (<foreign>zusammenhängende

                        passion (§3 &amp; §4), and performative utterance (§2). De Quincey is
                        sincerely interested in receiving and communicating truths.<note place="foot"> De Quincey’s sincerity is by no means opposed to irony. He

                            that “it is so painful to a lover of openhearted sincerity, that any

                            records of profound passion” (88). And yet, if language is necessarily
                            “infirm” (147) and truths can never pass to us “directly,” then ironic
                            distance and reinterpretation are necessary.</note> Reading and

                        time and language whose (perlocutionary) effects can be profound, but also
                        oblique and unpredictable. He is a confessed “self-dialogist . . .
                        perhaps the earliest that has existed,” because at a young age he “caught
                        too early and too profound a glimpse of certain dread realities” (10.11–12),
                        or truths. At a certain pitch, however, even De Quincey’s self-dialogism
                        sometimes “swerves out of [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien
                        natures,” as when the Dark Interpreter’s “words alter” (<title level="m">S</title> 147). Like the Sorrows, that haunting figure also whispers
                        “truths” to De Quincey in his sleeps (<title level="m">S</title> 245). But
                        to become intelligible those truths must—presumably—later be recollected
                        (gathered) and disentangled from his other experiences and interpretations.
                        Their reinterpretation can only happen via an entangling (an involution) and
                        a resistant disentangling (an analysis, an untying), which is itself another
                        kind of entangling. This endless and sincere process of receiving and
                        reinterpreting the truths that pass to us is what I think De Quincey means
                        by “impassioned prose,” his confessions’ signature “mode” (238). In this
                        piece I suggest that perlocutionary speech acts, whose effects are
                        entangling and incalculable, are a worthwhile model for interpreting—or
                        rather, reinterpreting—De Quincey’s impassioned prose.</p>

                  <head>II. Perlocution &amp; Entanglement</head>
                  <p>But what exactly are speech acts in general, and perlocution in particular?
                        Speech acts do not, or do not merely, describe; they act, they produce
                        effects in the world. In J.L. Austin’s terms, speech acts are thereby
                        “performative” rather than “constative” utterances. But realizing the
                        difficulty of distinguishing performative and constative utterances, Austin
                        moved on to a tripartite categorization of locutionary, illocutionary and
                        perlocutionary speech acts. Let me give you Cavell's quick checklist from
                        “Performative and Passionate Utterance”: “the locutionary act (saying
                        something meaningful), the illocutionary act (what is done <emph>in</emph>
                        saying something), and the perlocutionary act (what is done <emph>by</emph>
                        saying something)” (169). Austin himself defines a perlocutionary act as one
                        which produces “certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts or
                        actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may
                        be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them” (101). You
                        can see why perlocution is the trickiest of the three types—all those
                            <emph>ors</emph> and <emph>mays</emph> (thoughts, feelings
                            <emph>or</emph> actions; audience, speaker, or other persons; it
                            <emph>may</emph> be done by design, or intention, or purpose—or not)
                        spread the concept out into who knows what, or where, or how. Austin
                        repeatedly tries to contrast this diffusion with what he takes to be a more
                        stable target, illocutionary acts’ <emph>specific</emph> force to get
                        something done. If in an illocutionary act the effect must be contained in
                        what is said, in a perlocutionary act the effect <emph>cannot</emph> be
                        contained in it; if for an illocutionary act to succeed there must be a
                        communally agreed upon set of rules to judge its success, for a perlocution
                        to work the speaker is on his own—he must use whatever imagination,
                        subtlety, or flair that he has at his disposal. Weirdly, one can perform a
                        perlocutionary act via a locution—that is, by simply stating a meaningful
                        fact. For example, I might prevent you from reading or liking a novel by
                        saying “Byron hated that novel”—or, that might make you reread it and like
                        it even more. Again, you can see why perlocution exasperated Austin, and why
                        Cavell and Miller see it as the place where his system breaks down. It gives
                        reign to “parasitic,” “not serious” and “not full normal” uses of language
                        (104). If what Austin calls “the doctrine ‘of illocutionary forces’” (100)
                        seems predictably Newtonian, perlocution is more like quantum mechanics,
                        where God plays dice and disparate elements are mysteriously entangled.</p>
                  <p>In Miller’s reading, “Austin is haunted by poetry . . .” (38);
                        jokes and poetry are “etiolated,” whitened, and have “no force”; although
                        Austin “uses tropes brilliantly and commands a powerful rhetoric, but he
                        does not generally reflect on the implications of the way his use of tropes
                        is necessary to get said what he wants to say” (39). Put another way, Austin
                        wants to say it “straight,” but uses tropes and turns to do so; he
                            <emph>must</emph> use them. Indeed, for Miller <title level="m">How To
                            Do Things with Words</title> is haunted by a “lurid under text of
                        violence and catastrophe” (49), perhaps because it cannot grasp its own
                        tropological foundation. Tracing Austin's growing stable of terms—from
                            <emph>performative</emph> and <emph>constative</emph>, to
                            <emph>locutionary, illocutionary</emph> and<emph> perlocutionary</emph>,
                            to<emph> behabitives, expositives, commissives</emph>, and<emph>
                            verdictives</emph>—Miller concludes: “the project frays out into
                        increasingly unmanageable complexity, the complexity of everyday usage in
                        ordinary language” (13). That's the process of getting “bog[ged], by logical
                        stages, down,” a phrase Miller borrows from Austin and uses repeatedly.
                        Miller's point, I think, is that Austin was all too aware of ordinary
                        language's resistance to theorization, the way it lures you in and entangles
                        you. The figure of the fray and the bog connote entanglement in the term’s
                        traditional sense—Thomas Browne, for instance, wonders how the viscosity of
                        a chameleon’s tongue “inviscates and intangleth” insects. For Austin, the
                        entangling tongue is human speech itself.</p>
                  <p>Or, as Miller puts it, “words are not pictures of reality. They are part of
                        the thing, tangled inextricably with the event they describe” (<title level="m">Tropes</title> 43). In <title level="m">Ariadne’s
                            Thread</title>, he extends this into a claim about literature’s
                        resistance to interpretation: “The critic may fancy himself safely and
                        rationally outside the contradictory language of the text, but he is already
                        entangled in its web” (23). That happens, for Miller, because it’s
                        impossible to isolate any given portion of a text from the whole: a critical
                        problem or “knot may be in one region untied, made unperplexed, but only at
                        the expense of making a tangle of knotted crossings at some other point on
                        the loop” (22)—a double bind. This does not mean that criticism is futile,
                        but merely that works of literature also interpret themselves. Describing
                        Joseph Conrad’s “self-interpretive elements” in <title level="m">Fiction and
                            Repetition</title>, Miller declares that “No literary text has a
                        manifest pattern, like the design of a rug, which the eye of the critic can
                        survey from the outside” (23). Here we see what will later become Miller's
                        claims about the critic's performative utterances and the impossibility of
                        purely constative criticism.</p>
                  <p>Of course, the model of reading here is deconstructive, but also
                        psychoanalytic, as much work on De Quincey is. Joel Faflak has suggested
                        that De Quincey’s readers become inscribed within “the text’s transferential
                        field of reading.” In a Miller-like vein, Faflak says that “Our inability to
                        master the text’s meaning . . . mirrors uncannily the text’s call
                        for knowledge and interpretation that is built into its very structure”
                        (25). What interests me is the text’s “call” to read it, know it, interpret
                        it, perform it. In <title level="m">Theory of the Lyric</title>, Jonathan
                        Culler has recently warned of the dangers of “celebrat[ing] the performative
                        character of literature, as a simple consequence of the conventions of
                        literary discourse” because it distracts us from its real perlocutionary
                        work. “The most important acts a poem performs,” he suggests, “are likely to
                        be those not entailed by it” (130).<note place="foot"> Culler goes on to
                            cite Barbara Cassin’s recommendation that we subsume illocution and
                            perlocution under the rubric of <emph>performance</emph> rather than
                                <emph>performativity</emph>; in a footnote, he pairs her work with
                            Gadamer’s, which speaks about how literature tasks us with performing it
                            so that a truth might emerge—a literary work is “an event [<title level="m">Ereignis</title>] that appropriates us into itself”
                            (367n35).</note> Here literature, and linguistic entanglement, becomes a

                            dialectical pirouettes one thought oneself supple enough to carry out”
                            (77).</note> By this I simply mean language’s power to produce effects

                        itself in the connections it makes between different things, particularly
                        when those connections cannot be conceptually mapped. If such relations are
                        increasingly problematized across the latter half of the Enlightenment,
                        which I think they are, De Quincey’s oeuvre—as both theory and
                        palimpsest of inexplicable connections—marks this trend’s <foreign>ne plus

                  <p>De Quincey, in his “Letters to a Young Man,” had much to say about the
                        definition of literature and its relationship to <emph>knowledge</emph> and
                            <emph>power</emph>, which we might roughly associate with constative and
                        performative utterances—a kind of “mixed discursive mode,” to borrow Ian
                        Balfour’s phrase.<note place="foot"> Balfour on Coleridge’s <title level="m">Statesman’s Manual</title>: “The prophetic is, in De Quincey’s

                            has the ephemerality of a topical discourse of persuasion and, ideally,
                            the timelessness of the most fundamental truths. This tension can be
                            ascribed in part to its mixed discursive mode, both performative and
                            constative . . . Coleridge seems perfectly aware of the
                            uncertain or mixed mode of prophetic speech-acts . . . The
                            dual character of topicality and permanence . . . is precisely
                            what he tries to achieve in his own text.” See <title level="m">The

                            257+.</note> In his reading of those letters, Brian McGrath has
                        persuasively argued that De Quincey marshaled his redefinition of
                            <emph>literature</emph> (and hence <emph>power</emph>) to selectively
                        manage the mushrooming list of texts one had to read (847–48). Yes,
                            <emph>had to read</emph>—that is, I think, literature's call, or at
                        least the call of the literary marketplace. Literature’s proper call is
                        slightly different—“all literature seeks,” in De Quincey’s words, “to
                        communicate power” (3.71) where other texts only communicate knowledge. Real
                        literature is a stronger <emph>actant</emph> inasmuch as it calls more
                        powerfully on us to read it. But <emph>where</emph> do we locate this call,
                        this seeking to communicate? Here is where the diffuseness of effects,
                        persons and intentions of perlocution’s model is useful for thinking with De
                        Quincey, and frustrating. As Cavell says, the problem in part is that “in
                        perlocutionary acts, the ‘you’ comes essentially into the picture”
                            (180).<note place="foot">Ellen Burt ties the <title level="m">Confessions’</title> representations of performative language to
                            the problem of hospitality, to an “other” such as the Malay or the
                            Welsh, and thus to the other as such: “The iterability of language means
                            that the masterful, staged performative that unsays the said and allows
                            one to enter into inaugural, heartfelt dialogue with the human other,
                            may not be distinguishable from repetition. Or, to put it another way,
                            the house of language is always open to visitation by a poetic spirit,
                            which spirit allows consideration of the potential meaning of patterns
                            that language has as a written language. Those patterns don't just
                            gainsay the said; they also gainsay saying, and with it the scene of
                            ethical relation and dialogue as implicating only humans” (139). I will
                            only add that De Quincey explicitly theorizes this ethical and
                            linguistic relation, and that he often does so through the trope of
                            entanglement.</note>

                  <head>III. Truth-Telling &amp; Impassioned Prose</head>
                  <p>Robert Morrison has connected De Quincey’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> to what Foucault in 1975 called “the production of
                        truth,” modernity’s social demand to confess what one truly is (x). Several
                        years later, in <title level="m">Wrong-Doing and Truth-Telling</title>,
                        Foucault discusses truth-telling as a “speech act” (14). “Avowal is,”
                        according to Foucault, “a verbal act through which the subject affirms who
                        he is, binds himself to truth, places himself in a relationship of
                        dependence with regard to another, and modifies at the same time his
                        relationship to himself” (17). Foucault’s more general strategy is to
                        examine how a subject constitutes himself as an object—that is, to look at
                        both “the formation of procedures by which the subject is led to observe
                        himself, analyze himself, interpret himself, recognize himself as a domain
                        of possible knowledge” and “the way in which the subject experiences himself
                        in a game of truth where he relates to himself” (461).<note place="foot">See

                  <p>Clearly, Foucault’s thinking here is tied to the practice and genre of
                        confession, as his as-yet unpublished book on Saint Augustine and early

                            Stuart Elden cites the importance of confession in Foucault’s late
                            thought: “Foucault’s interest in confession might move from power
                            relations to the production of truths [in the late 1970’s], but it
                            remained at the center of his concern . . . Confession is the
                            crucial element in both the abandoned [the modern genealogies of power

                                Decade</title> (Polity, 2016), pp. 132–33.</note> On this front
                        Jean-Luc Marion’s work is salutary. For him, Augustine’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> merely “orient” the reader towards God. They are
                        “written neither to describe nor to demonstrate nor to instruct, but to
                        provoke confession”; they “tend only to produce an effect, or rather an
                            <emph>affect</emph>, upon the interlocutor, understood as each reader.
                        This intention is defined exactly as a perlocutionary act" (46–47)—that is,
                        a speech act whose consequences are inexplicit, incalculable and perhaps
                        even untraceable. Every word of Augustine’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> strains to accomplish, not represent, something; it
                        cannot even represent to itself what it seeks to accomplish. Thus “the truth
                        of this perlocutionary word does not rest on the truth (at least in the
                        sense of adequation of mind to thing, <foreign>Wahrheit</foreign>) but on
                        the will to say the truth (veracity or sincerity,

                  <p>De Quincey’s confessional mode consists in playing truth as adequation off of
                        the will to speak the truth (to perform it, produce it, elicit it), even as
                        his will is overwrought by doubts and complications and broken open by other
                        voices. That is, he tries to represent and reproduce a truth that he himself
                        doesn’t fully grasp or believe he can ever communicate directly, to himself
                        or a reader; he is never sure where his writing comes from or where it is
                            going.<note place="foot">Eric Lindstrom gives a wonderful reading of De
                            Quincey’s uncanny experience of being woken by his own voice while in a
                            “dog sleep”: “Far from a pleasurable exteriorizing of expressive
                            identity, agency, and intent, this voice is exterior to De Quincey in
                            the radically alternate sense of originating as though from outside of
                            him. Yet the source of the disruptive noise is the somatic body most
                            deeply contained inside . . . Such a source of interiority and
                            inward sensation takes us too far inside the body of the writer”
                            (399).</note> To borrow Yoon Sun Lee’s more general description of
                        Romantic prose, De Quincey’s styles continually try to map their past,
                        present and future occasions to communicate that truth more fully; his form
                        unfolds through the endless unfixing and revising of its occasions. “You
                        understand now, reader, what I am” (54), De Quincey tells us, but
                        nevertheless his <title level="m">Confessions</title>’ moral “is addressed
                        to the opium-eater”: “If he is taught to fear and tremble, enough has been
                        effected” (78). But that education can only happen through the <title level="m">Confessions</title>’ “true object”—“those parasitical
                        thoughts, feelings, digressions” (88) and the (perlocutionary) “effects”
                        they incite.<note place="foot"> David Clark has suggested that Kant himself
                            sometimes operates in a second gear, where he is no longer a seeker
                            after truth, but a “practician” of it (265). That is something De
                            Quincey in fact accuses Kant of doing unwittingly, so that he (De
                            Quincey) can attend “once more to the intricacies that lie at the heart
                            of the confessional speech-act, the secret communications that obtain
                            necessarily there between self-aggrandizement and self-debasement,
                            dissimulation and truth-telling, avowal and disavowal” (263).</note>
                        This is also the “important truth” of involution: “no complex or very
                        important truth was ever yet transferred in full development from one mind
                        to another” (3.97). Hence <title level="m">Suspiria</title>’s worries about
                        the earlier <title level="m">Confessions’</title> “true object” (88).<note place="foot">De Quincey’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> claims:

                            the Opium-eater, but the opium, is the true hero of the tale, and the

                        Quincey doubts whether a style couched in “the simplicity of truth” that
                        “moves truly and faithfully” through circumstances can determine what the
                        reader “attaches” to it (88–89); he also openly wonders about the “true
                        interpretation” of his addiction’s “final symptoms,” the later ones
                        addressed in <title level="m">Suspiria</title> which “differ in something

                        (85). No complex or very important truth, it seems, can ever be transferred
                        in full development within the same person, much less “from one mind to
                        another”; they must make the perilous journey through language and its
                        unpredictable effects. Even our own truths must “pass through the several

                            “where ruin is understood to be absolute” (85); her question is what

                        ruin?</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Speaking of Augustine, De Quincey defines his own <title level="m">Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Suspiria</title> as “modes of
                        impassioned prose” (238).<note place="foot">Joel Faflak argues that De
                            Quincey’s impassioned prose collapses genre (poetry and prose,
                            metaphysics and psychology) into a “transitional psychoanalysis,” which
                            in turn collapses other distinctions: “Autobiography, understanding, and
                            impassioned prose are thus separate signifiers of the subject’s
                            identity, and yet collapse into one another by force of the unconscious”
                            (158, 276n16).</note> He means by this “the very idea of breathing a
                        record of human passion, not into the ear of the random crowd, but of the
                        saintly confessional. . . . Impassioned, therefore, should be
                        the tenor of the composition” (238). Its only examples are “those of St.
                        Austin”—miraculous abbreviation!—and, on a lesser scale, Rousseau. Across
                        his autobiographical works De Quincey stresses this enamoring. We see
                        “impassioned minds” (112), “impassioned memory” (169), impassioned themes,
                        interests and passages (237–38). The lesson of the <title level="m">Suspiria</title> thereby mirrors what he calls “the education of
                        Levana,” the Roman goddess of childbirth who “lifts” infants from the earth
                        into “the atmosphere of our troubled planet,” who “present[s] its forehead
                        to the stars, saying, perhaps, in his heart—‘Behold what is greater than
                        yourselves!’” (<title level="m">S</title> 138). Paradoxically Levana’s
                        lifting happens by opening up the labor of our hidden depths: “that mighty
                        system of central forces hidden in the deep bosom of human life, which by
                        passion, by strife, by temptation, by the energies of resistance, works for
                        ever upon children” (139). One of De Quincey’s problems is to instantiate
                        this system of forces—of lift and descent, of expansion and contraction, of
                        passion, strife, temptation and resistance—in his own writing. Citing
                        Wordsworth, De Quincey asserts that true style is the “incarnation of
                        thought.” And yet language as “counter-spirit” threatens to reopen the
                        original fracture between thinking and expressing that conditions language’s
                        actual use. That counter-spirit is, says Wordsworth, “unremittingly and
                        noiselessly at work to derange, to subvert, to lay waste, to vitiate, and to
                            dissolve.”<note place="foot">Alexander Regier helpfully reads, via
                            Benjamin, De Quincey’s complex citing of Wordsworth here (151-52).
                            Regier also suggests that Benjamin’s is a performative theory of
                            language: “. . . to cite a word is to call it by its name
                            . . .. It performs a fracturing process that involves breaking
                            a word out of Language” (146).</note> Separate but inseparable, De
                        Quincey could say that language and thought are <emph>entangled</emph>, or
                        “incapable of being disentangled.” Indeed, I hope to have shown that he
                        often does say this.</p>

                  <head>IV. Resistances to Analysis: De Quincey’s Double Binds</head>
                  <p>De Quincey devoted a great deal of energy to the topic of style. He asserts,
                        for instance, that the “periodic style of writing” practiced by newspapers
                        tires one out not for its “length… the paralytic flux of words,” nor “even
                        the cumbrous involution of parts within parts.” Rather, “It is the suspense,
                        the holding-on, of the mind until . . . the sentence
                        commences—this it is which wears out the faculty of attention” (12.21).
                        Imagine an age where <emph>that</emph>’s newspapers’ problem, that they’re
                        too reflective! But look how easily De Quincey moves between claims about
                        style and its effect on the act of reading. Style’s “organic aspect”
                        expresses “all possible relations that can arise between thoughts and
                        words—the total effect of a writer”; the emphasis here is on the “use of
                        words,” style’s so-called “commerce with thought” (12.24–25). I am not sure
                        whether this commerce is exactly the same thing as the call literature makes
                        upon us, but it’s close. What wears us out in reading the “periodic style”
                        is its periodicity, the way that it turns back upon its point.<note place="foot"> This is perhaps the same as the turn of mind he finds in
                            Malthus’s twisted mind: “Mr. Malthus has the most perplexed
                            understanding. He is not only confused himself, but is the cause that
                            confusion is in other men. Logical perplexity is shockingly contagious,
                            and he who takes Mr. Malthus for his guide through any tangled question,
                            ought to be able to box the compass very well; or before he has read ten
                            pages he will find himself (as the Westmoreland guides express it)
                            ‘maffled’.” (3.285-86).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>De Qunicey’s own style, meanwhile, attempts to get at truth, but through a
                        different sort of turning or twisting, one that resembles the tangling of a
                        vine. Permit me to return to De Quincey’s “true object”: <quote>The true
                            object in my “Opium Confessions” is not the naked physiological theme
                            [of opium addiction] . . . but those wandering musical
                            variations upon the theme—those parasitical thoughts, feelings,
                            digressions, which climb up with bells and blossoms round about the arid
                            stock; ramble away from it at times with perhaps too rank a luxuriance;
                            but at the same time, by the eternal interest attached to the <title level="m">subjects </title>of these digressions, no matter what were
                            the execution, spread a glory over incidents that for themselves would
                            be—less than nothing. (88)</quote> This oddly twinned discourse of truth
                        and the entangling parasite marks this section of <title level="m">Suspiria</title>, which ends with a double crescendo—one intellectual,
                        one emotional—that I will cite again: <quote>I have been struck with the
                            important truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts and feelings pass
                            to us through perplexed combinations of concrete objects, pass to us as
                                <title level="m">involutes</title> (if I may coin that word) in
                            compound experiences incapable of being disentangled, than ever reach us
                            directly, and in their own abstract shapes. (97) </quote>That
                        intellectual crescendo sets up his real goal of communicating the “burden of
                        the incommunicable,” the awe he feels at his sister’s death. “Out of this
                        digression [the involute], which was almost necessary for the purpose of
                        showing how inextricably my feelings and images of death were entangled with
                        those of summer, I return to the bedchamber of my sister. From the gorgeous
                        sunlight I turned round to the corpse . . .” (98). He describes
                        his sister’s “marble lips, the stiffening hands, laid palm to palm, as if
                        repeating the supplications of closing anguish,” and asks: “could these be
                        mistaken for life?” (99). </p>
                  <p>De Quincey’s inability to communicate directly how summer and death became
                        associated in his mind is somehow powerful. Before the digressive account of
                        the involutes, he articulates his crisis with extreme economy: “the glory is
                        around us, the darkness is within us” (97). Summer’s glory evokes, almost as
                        a conceit, the death we carry within us. But the association is not complex
                        enough; he feels compelled to describe an even “subtler reason why the
                        summer had this intense power of vivifying the spectacle or the thoughts of
                        death.” For me, the most devastating detail is how the passage invisibly
                        links the Bible’s depiction of palm trees, which young De Quincey associated
                        with summer and Oriental climes, with his sister’s “stiffening hands, laid
                        palm to palm, as if repeating the supplications of closing anguish.”<note place="foot"> “Palm to palm” resonates too with the priest’s
                                “<emph>earth to earth . . . ashes to ashes
                                . . .dust to dust . .  .</emph> the farewell
                            volley announces that the grave—the coffin—the face are sealed up for
                            ever and ever” (103). Those same words were announced at his father’s
                            funeral (De Quincey’s first, he claims): “Then first it was that solemn
                            farewell of the English burial-service, “Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,’
                            and the great eloquence of St. Paul in that matchless chapter of his
                            epistle to the Corinthians, fell upon my ear; and, concurring with my
                            whole previous feelings, for ever fixed that vast subject upon my mind”
                            (10.13). Barrell gives a compelling, though somewhat different, reading
                            of the “palms” passages (33).</note> “’Palms!’—what were they?
                            <emph>That</emph> was an equivocal word… palms, as a product of nature,
                        expressed the pomps of summer” (97). But what about these palms had
                        “haunted” him, and when? It was not merely their association with “the
                        peace” and “the summer . . . the deep sound of rest below all
                        rest, and of ascending glory.” But there are always further connections,
                            <foreign>in esse</foreign> or <foreign>in posse</foreign>. What haunts
                        him, in part, is the sheer number of connections he can make, or have made,
                        across the tangled register of his knowledge and experience. </p>
                  <p>We should ask with him: “could these [his sister’s hands] be mistaken for
                        life?” Or for a “vivifying spectacle”? Could his memories, or dreams, or
                        writing—his progressive compounding of experience—be mistaken for life or
                        vivifying spectacle? The passage’s true power and devastation seems to come
                        from our inability to “disentangle” these “compound experiences,” even
                        trifling ones. Just as we can never fix those experiences’ full or proper
                        occasions, we can never experience something in its singularity or “abstract
                        shape.” To return to Benjamin’s phrase, there is no disentangled time,
                        simply better or worse constellations of it. Pulling apart our perplexed
                        thoughts and feelings (ab-stracting or analyzing them) only layers in more
                        connections—(with Hobbes, again, “the more he struggles, the more belimed”).
                        The depths momentarily opened within compounded experience can be
                        expressed—or sounded—only by sighs: “One profound sigh ascended from my
                        heart, and I was silent for days” (<title level="m">S</title> 85).</p>
                  <p> For Sterne, these details, twists, connections, overlappings and involutions
                        were ultimately a boon to life and literature—“Digressions, incontestably,
                        are the sunshine;—they are the life, the soul of reading;—take them out of
                        this book for instance,—you might as well take the book along with them”
                            (<title level="m">Tristram</title> 54). But for De Quincey they express
                        anxiety, or even ruin. De Quincey begins the <title level="m">Confessions</title> by stating that he is “bound to confess” his
                        excessive indulgence in opium, but that he has “untwisted almost to its
                        final links, the accursed chain which fettered” him (4). The <title level="m">Suspiria</title>’s involutes shows how there is always
                        something that resists untwisting, perhaps even the “true interpretation of
                        these final symptoms” (85)—the chain of interpretation and the inevitability
                        of new links. Rei Terada has compared De Quincey’s psychic model to early
                        Freud, where it is not the <emph>order</emph> of one’s thoughts, but rather
                        their <emph>density</emph> that signals a healthy psychic economy. Within
                        the brain, stimuli from within and without can become “unbound” in such a
                        way that they catastrophically “destabilize one’s energy system”—what is
                        sought is an “ego that is neither straightjacketed by its own bindings nor
                        overwhelmed by stimuli inconveniently becoming unbound” (221).</p>
                  <p> I will conclude by thinking with Derrida’s “Resistances of Psychoanalysis”
                        about a slightly later, but related Freudian model. That work draws chiefly
                        upon a few passages from the <title level="m">Interpretation of
                            Dreams</title>, specifically those places—and those patients—which
                        “resist analysis.” There Freud gives his famous, Shandyean analogy of the
                        “navel of the dream,” a passage excerpted in my epigraph. Here it is in
                        full: <quote>There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly
                            interpreted dream which has to be left obscure; this is because we
                            become aware during the work of interpretation that at that point there
                            is a tangle of dream-thoughts which cannot be unraveled [<foreign>ein
                                Knäuel von Traumgedanken anhebt, der sich nicht entwirren
                                will</foreign>] and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of
                            the content of the dream. This is the dream’s navel, the spot where it
                            reaches down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts to which we are led by
                            interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have any definite
                            endings; they are bound to branch out in every direction into the
                            intricate network [<foreign>in die netzartige Verstrickung</foreign>] of
                            our world of thought. It is at some point where this network is
                            particularly close that the dream-wish grows up, like a mushroom out of
                            its mycelium (525 / 564).</quote> For Freud the mushroom (the
                        dream-wish) merely marks the knotty ground that gives rise to it. That set
                        of tangles is unanalyzable both because the links are too numerous and
                        because it reaches into the “unplummable” depths; it is, in the language of
                        the note, its “point of contact with the unknown” (143n2) and in the body of
                        the text the threads of dream-thoughts “have no definite endings” (564).</p>
                  <p>A version of this passage originally occurs, as Derrida points out, in a note
                        a couple hundred pages earlier in <title level="m">The Interpretation of
                            Dreams</title>. It comes as a kind of “confession” given by Freud for
                        his inability to decipher his dream about Irma’s injection—that is, the one
                        where he begins to feel that <emph>he</emph> might be responsible for
                            <emph>her</emph> refusal to accept his interpretation of her condition.
                        It is thus a case of the responsibility or the ethics of interpretation.
                        It’s an imperative that extends even into the analyst’s own dream life
                        despite his once believing that it was the patient’s sole responsibility to
                        accept or decline interpretations. But with the dream her and his psychic
                        lives become, as it were, entangled. In Greek analysis simply means untying,
                        disentangling, “solving” and “dissolving”; analysis should therefore solve
                        that problem. But for Derrida the unweaving of any psychic phenomenon is
                        always tied to a twinned, resistant weaving. Analysis resists itself as much
                        as patients resist an interpretation imposed on them by a psychoanalyst; all
                        analysis, all interpretation is haunted by that imperative to resist. </p>
                  <p>But: <foreign>Faudrait-il résister? Et d’abord à l’analyse?</foreign> So
                        begins <title level="m">Resistances</title>’ first essay. Its seven words
                        ask at least six questions: Must one resist? Must one resist, first,
                        psychoanalysis? Or analysis? But also: Must one <emph>endure</emph> or
                            <emph>withstand</emph> (<foreign>résister</foreign>) psychoanalysis, or
                        analysis? But the problem is even worse: “If it were necessary to resist
                        analysis,” Derrida continues, “one would still have to know whence comes
                        this ‘one must’ and what it means. One would have to analyze it.” These
                        increasingly tangled questions, all beneath an ambiguous title: <title level="m">Résistances de la psychonalyse—</title>resistances of / from /
                        by psychoanalysis. <foreign>Faudrait-il résister</foreign>? What does it
                        mean to resist if one must do it? The question feeds back on itself, like
                        the liar’s paradox. Derrida eventually names the problem a <foreign>double
                            bind</foreign>, concluding that “a double bind cannot fully be analyzed:
                        one can only unbind one of its knots by pulling on the other to make it
                        tighter”—it “cannot be assumed; one can only endure
                            [<foreign>souffrir</foreign>] it in <foreign>passion</foreign>”
                        (36).</p>
                  <p>In De Quincey’s impassioned prose we see an entangled and entangling system
                        whose effects—on readers, on himself, on Austin’s “other people”—seem
                        incalculable, but nevertheless calls to be endured.<note place="foot"> This
                            is perhaps the dark obverse of what Miranda Burgess, in her piece,
                            defines as Owenson’s “varied texture of love”: “an ethics of
                            interdependency as pleasure—lacking in determined outcomes, radically
                            unproductive and, therefore, in Owenson’s terms, “free”—when it is read
                            amid the histories of Romantic form and life.”</note> In a kind of
                        Foucauldian avowal that binds him to the sad truths that will unfold his
                        spirit, De Quincey places a demand upon us: “view me, as one
                            <foreign>viridantem fioribus hastas</foreign>—making verdant, and gay
                        with the life of flowers, murderous spears and halberts—things that express
                        death in their origin, (being made from dead substances that once had lived
                        in forests,) things that express ruin in their use” (88). Or, to paraphrase,
                            <emph>watch me do things</emph>, or <emph>do</emph> things,<emph> with
                            words</emph>.</p>
