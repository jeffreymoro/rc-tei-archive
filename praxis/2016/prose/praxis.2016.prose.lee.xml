                <p rend="noCount">The sense of an occasion is inseparable from the productivity that
                    characterizes Romantic prose. Carl Schmitt's account of the "subjective
                    occasionalism" of Romanticism offers us an analytical point of departure. But I
                    argue that Romantic prose tries to deepen, extend, or formalize this sense of
                    occasion. It tries to express, and sometimes embeds within itself, the social
                    conditions of acts of utterance.</p>

<div type="section">
                <p>Reading Carl Schmitt feels similar to reading Burke: they both seem so wrong, and
                    yet surprisingly right in some ways. <title level="m">Political
                        Romanticism</title> is the text that I think is worth returning to for a
                    closer look. Schmitt is better known these days as a theorist of sovereignty,
                    but this early work, published in Berlin the year following Lukaćs’s <title
                        level="m">Theory of the Novel</title> (1918), offers a remarkable analysis
                    of Romanticism as a movement. Analysis may be too neutral a term: it is more of
                    an indictment. But the overall effect is bracing. Particularly at a moment when
                    Romanticism seems in danger of simply being forgotten or absorbed into the
                    greater nineteenth century, there is something invigorating in seeing it
                    attacked with so much energy. Schmitt’s account has a new relevance today in
                    light of our interest in affective experience. It also reveals the roots in
                    Romanticism of what Judith Shklar called “the liberalism of fear,” which rests
                    on the conviction that emotions are in no way “inferior to ideas and especially
                    to political causes” (32). (Indeed, Romanticism could be said to name the
                    intersection of affect and liberalism, a deeply compromised location in
                    Schmitt’s eyes.) But what I wish to examine here is the way that Schmitt’s
                    concept of political romanticism illuminates a peculiar feature of Romantic
                    prose: its constitutive awareness of its own occasion. </p>
                <p>My challenge here is to find a way of discussing Romantic prose without reducing
                    it to any single genre and without collapsing it into medium. While the concept
                    of prose certainly predates media studies, I would like to think that it still
                    cannot be simply absorbed into the idea of mediation or mediality. I also want
                    to address questions of belief and aesthetics in a way that is different from
                    those who have linked Humean skepticism to the rise of fictionality in this
                        period.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Duncan’s powerful argument, in
                        particular pp. 116–44, as well as Gallagher’s account of fictionality, to
                        both of which I am indebted.</note> For these reasons, I will trace a rather
                    eclectic itinerary that begins with Schmitt, turns to Wordsworth, and then to
                    Jacques Rancière’s recent account of the “passage from <foreign>belles
                        lettres</foreign> to literature” (34) that seems to pick up speed toward the
                    end of the eighteenth century. These accounts offer a usefully capacious scale,
                    as well as a way to address the situated quality of prose in the world and its
                    varied relations to experience at this historical juncture.</p>
                <p>I will start by summarizing Schmitt’s account of “the structure of romantic
                    spirit.” It doesn’t take long, since in a way Schmitt’s work is a miracle of
                    reductiveness. It aims to cut Romanticism down to size. With visible impatience,
                    Schmitt condemns the failure of the German Romantics to decide, to act, or even
                    to acknowledge the necessity of action and decision. We can discern in his
                    response to Novalis, the Schlegels, and Adam Müller in particular, the outlines
                    of Schmitt’s belief in sovereignty and his later concept of the political as
                    based on the distinction between enemy and friend. Burke and De Maistre earn his
                    respect, since they were men of action. Other Romantics, however, do nothing but
                    emit “a lyrical and discursive tremolo of ideas that sprang from the decision
                    and the responsibility of others” (159). One of the central features of
                    Romanticism, in Schmitt’s eyes, is its primary commitment to productivity of a
                    particular sort. It is a pure idea or practice of productivity as a state of
                    being, an end in itself rather than a means. This is what Schmitt seems to mean
                    by “aesthetic productivity.” Romantics do not produce actual works of art or
                    representations (or real theories or objects), but only pure affect or mood:
                    “intensity of subjective impression is all that matters” (97). Aesthetic
                    productivity can be thought of as the continual production of experience through
                    the negation of the external world. “The unbroken subjectivism of early
                    Romanticism saw an achievement even in the impressionistic experience. Affect as
                    a psychic fact was intrinsically interesting” (97). Changes in the intensity of
                    affective states were “both the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem” of
                    Romantic productivity (97). </p>
                <p>Aesthetic productivity is conceivable because of a particular attitude toward the
                    world for which Schmitt invents the name “subjective occasionalism.” He draws a
                    parallel with the occasionalism elaborated by Malebranche and other early modern
                    philosophers who viewed God as the single true cause; events and actions,
                    including the coordination of mind and body, were simply occasions of a higher
                    power being exercised. What happens in Fichte and other German Romantics,
                    according to Schmitt, is that the subjective ego assumes that higher position
                    and power. Romantic occasionalism recognizes nothing higher than the subject’s
                    arbitrary whims, though these latter might be disguised as the workings of a
                    superindividual power such as history. Schmitt argues that Romantic writers
                    refuse to acknowledge any basis for events, “where basis .&#160;.&#160;.
                    signifies both causal explanation and normative justification or legitimation”
                    (81). Their cardinal sin in Schmitt’s eyes is the rejection of norms, of
                    causality, and even of any fixed context that could provide the ground of either
                    explanation or justification. Occasion replaces causality: “if anything provides
                    a complete definition of Romanticism, it is the lack of any relationship to a
                        <foreign>causa</foreign>.” Romanticism rejects the possibility of a
                    “calculable and adequate relationship of cause and effect .&#160;.&#160;. an
                    absolutely inadequate relationship obtains between <emph>occasio and
                        effect</emph>” (82–83, original emphasis).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a subtle
                        reading of Scott’s first novel, <title level="m">Waverley</title>, in
                        relation to Schmitt’s argument, see Jerome Christensen, 161 ff.</note></p>
                <p>Several further characteristics of Romanticism arise from its occasionalism. As
                    anything concrete is merely an occasion, “everything can be substituted for
                    everything else” (158). What ought to be fixed categories or consistent
                    relations disappear. “The Romantic subject can regard distinctly heterogeneous
                    and antithetical processes and configurations as the beginning of the Romantic
                    novel” (123). Schmitt frequently alludes to this latter phrase from Novalis’s
                    sixty-sixth fragment (“Anfang eines unendlichen Romans”) with inexhaustible
                    contempt. Finally, Schmitt suggests that Romantic occasionalism brings about a
                    radical shift of scale, though he does not use that term himself. Instead of
                    norms, concepts, and decisions—acts measurable on a political scale—Romantics
                    deal in “associations, colors, [and] sounds that are combined in an admixture,”
                    qualities and phenomena that might appear microscopically small, even
                    infra-subjective (107). Schmitt sees this tendency as an example not of humility
                    but of grandiosity. Turning his back on reality, the Romantic subject could
                    claim to discern in any fragment a “totality .&#160;.&#160;. a construct that
                    unfolds without any interest in empirical reality” (73). </p>
                <p>What Schmitt describes may help us better understand the structure of Romantic
                    prose. This may seem an entirely counter-intuitive argument, given Hegel’s
                    well-circulated phrase, “the prose of the world.” There, prose is not just a
                    metaphor, but a historical condition characterized by the recalcitrant
                    objectivity that refuses to combine with the life of the spirit. This is the
                    very objectivity that Schmitt finds so completely lacking in Romantic writers.
                    But I’d like to set against Hegel’s phrase a different, perhaps equally
                    influential work that offers a different view of prose. Wordsworth’s 1800
                    Preface to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> reads almost like a
                    formalist’s carefully considered response to Schmitt’s criticism of Romanticism.
                    As we all know, Wordsworth argues on behalf of “the affinity betwixt metrical
                    and prose composition” (156). The best moments of poems make use of “strictly
                    the language of prose” (154). But if the distinction between poetry and prose
                    becomes blurry, the real target of criticism emerges in the form of what Schmitt
                    calls subjective occasionalism, with equal emphasis placed on subjectivity and
                    occasionalism. The scourge of poetic diction arises from an exaltation of the
                    ego, from “a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet’s character,”
                    fed by readerly “self-love” (188). Poets and writers of all genres are tempted
                    to “indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression, in order to
                    furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites” (144). Poetic diction is
                    particularly a threat, Wordsworth writes, because it is “arbitrary, and subject
                    to <emph>infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be
                    made</emph>” (171, my emphasis). Here is Schmitt, again:
                        “<foreign>occasio</foreign> .&#160;.&#160;. negates the concept of
                        <foreign>causa</foreign>, in other words, the force of a calculable
                    causality, and thus also every binding norm” (16–17). </p>
                <p>What Wordsworth proposes as a remedy is exactly what Schmitt finds missing in
                    Romanticism: what the latter calls “nomological regularity” (57). Wordsworth’s
                    laws are of course twofold. Meter itself “obeys certain laws, to which the Poet
                    and Reader both willingly submit because they are certain” (170). But there are
                    the laws of second nature, too, which create a reliable regularity. Wordsworth
                    prescribes to the poet “repeated experience and regular feelings,” to be
                    followed by “repetition” of acts of reflection, until “such habits of mind will
                    be produced, that, by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those
                    habits, we shall describe objects, and utter sentiments, of such a nature, and
                    in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the Reader must
                    necessarily be in some degree enlightened, and his affections strengthened . .
                    .” (146). Necessity, as opposed to chance or occasion, pervades this process,
                    shaping every connection along the entire relay. Meter or regular rhythm
                    supplies, in the realm of form but also in that of psychology, the “purposive or
                    normative nexus” (17) whose absence in Romanticism Schmitt deplores.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> Wordsworth describes the effect of iambic pentameter as “small,
                        but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
                        arrangement” (459).</note> In his later preface of 1815, Wordsworth develops
                    the contrast of lawfulness and occasionalism through the imagination/fancy
                    antithesis: the imagination’s “processes of creation or of composition [are]
                    governed by certain fixed laws,” unlike those of fancy, which are “as capricious
                    as the accidents of things” (31, 36). The distinction between fixed laws and
                    accident or caprice, then, is fundamental to the organization of Romantic
                    aesthetic experience.</p>
                <p>Prose by definition lacks an internal or formal principle of regularity, though
                    at least it has the negative advantage of being free of the “transitory and
                    accidental ornaments” that disfigure bad poetry. But Romantic prose has a
                    complex relation to occasionalism. It does not consider there to be, in
                    Schmitt’s words, “an absolutely inadequate relationship between occasio and
                    effect.” In fact, I would like to suggest the opposite: that Romantic prose
                        <emph>does</emph> acknowledge a purposive nexus, that it creates that nexus
                    out of its own occasion and is constituted by it. Wordsworth’s own prefaces
                    offer an example: the 1800 preface to the second edition of the Lyrical Ballads
                    is followed two years later by an appendix, both of which are then supplemented
                    by the 1815 essay, which Wordsworth then connected back to the 1800 preface
                    starting in 1836-37.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Owen and Smyser, vol. 1,
                        130–31.</note> It is not so much the productivity as the purposiveness that
                    is striking, as well as Wordsworth’s apparent inability to fully accomplish what
                    it is he wants to do through his critical prose. His writing does
                        <emph>not</emph> show, in Rancière’s words, “mind [that] has become
                    conscious of its own domain and has taken possession of a language that has
                    become a neutral instrument for the expression of thought” (82).<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> Rancière thus paraphrases Hegel’s account of the supersession
                        of poetry.</note> What we see, rather, is the repeated attempt to express
                    thought as a way both to acknowledge and to overcome an occasion—in Wordsworth’s
                    case, that of public judgment.</p>
                <p>What does Romantic prose try to do and how? Does it imitate something or does it
                    express something? Is it transitive or intransitive, to borrow Rancière’s
                    metaphor? I want to consider Romantic prose, with a final allusion to
                    Wordsworth, as a non-spontaneous, purposive expression first and foremost,
                    rather than simply as a representation. The meanings of these last two terms I
                    adopt from Rancière’s account of the cultural shift that produced a modern
                    understanding of literature. Very briefly, a “representative poetics” concerns
                    itself with arranging and imitating, in certain prescribed ways, the actions of
                    humans; fiction-making is accepted and judged as a social activity among others,
                    carried out in a certain milieu. With the Romantic “absolutization of art” (35),
                    this mimetic or representational regime breaks apart. A quality that Rancière
                    calls “poeticity,” following Schlegel, is discovered in anything that seems to
                    speak, inadequately and incompletely, of the existence of a hidden power or
                    spirit within it. The new “regime of expressivity” (60) presupposes a concept of
                    language as material incarnation, as more expressive of its source than anything
                    it might indicate about a shared, external world of praxis that it might be
                    showing us. This focus on the phenomenon of expression as such comes to dominate
                    over the earlier notion of words as “instruments of a discourse of persuasion or
                    seduction” (55). Plots made by and about human subjects also become less
                    compelling than the apparently limitless capacity of language as style, as
                    writing, to go anywhere at all.</p>
                <p> The primary interest of Romantic prose, I want to suggest, does not lie in
                    creating either a vivid or a decorous representation of people acting. It does
                    not or cannot offer a “determinate set of ideas about .&#160;.&#160;. what
                    causes make [subjects] act and what effects those causes produce” (Rancière
                    116). I will venture to say that this holds true even for the novels of the
                    period, as well as for the not-quite-novels, the more-than-novels, and the
                    not-at-all-novels that the essays in this volume consider. Rather, Romantic
                    prose of all genres seems to push dialectically at the boundaries of
                    inarticulateness. Sometimes the inarticulateness seems to function as a
                    rhetorical device, a sign of affect, and a response to the times, as in Burke.
                    The drama of expression seems to overwhelm the mimetic function, as language
                    attempts to incarnate spirit—whether the spirit(s) of the folk, as in Hogg, or
                    that of the literary absolute, in Lamb’s essays. </p>
                <p>Yet in those writers and the others considered in this volume, this elevation of
                    expressivity does not seem to entail the subjective occasionalism that Schmitt
                    finds in Romanticism, the sense that everything is in the end merely an occasion
                    for the production of private affect. What seems to still operate in Romantic
                    prose is a sense of performative utterance, of speech as a social action that is
                    performed in a certain setting—even if it brings about ineffable private
                    effects. What prompts utterance as well as blocks it, what legitimates it, in
                    short, its own historical and social conditions are taken into and reflected in
                    the utterance itself. Romantic prose seems to strive to make its own
                    occasionalism appear less of a tenuous thing. The occasion is felt and
                    acknowledged as the ground of evaluating the speech-act. The transitive or
                    effective power of expression is emphasized. Speech acts are felt to embody, in
                    Cavell’s striking paraphrase of Emerson, “the promise that the private and the
                    social will be achieved together” (114). I have referred to speech and to speech
                    acts because the idea of the spoken seems to be surprisingly inseparable from
                    the prose of this period. As several of the essays here show in relation to
                    Hogg’s tales, Lamb’s essays, and in the discursive techniques of Austen’s
                    novels, prose engages the occasion of utterance. At the same time, it is not the
                    case that they simply show people speaking. Affects and sensations are generated
                    at levels that disrupt the usual scale of action and utterance. Caught between
                    the representative and the expressive, Romantic prose persuades, seduces,
                    embodies, entangles, as it tries to deepen and strengthen the many-sided
                    connections between its occasion and its effect.</p>
                <p>The first two essays in this volume take up the sui generis writings of James
                    Hogg. Matthew Wickman opens the discussion with a rich consideration of the
                    place of the spirit—and of spirits—in two of Hogg’s works. Both of these place
                    at their center a competition carried on through speech: ballads in <title
                        level="m">The Queen’s Wake</title>, tales in <title level="m">The Three
                        Perils of Man</title>. Wickman shows how Hogg refutes the historicizing
                    framework of the modern novel that cordons off literature “as a reservoir of
                    epistemic, ontological, and historical difference.” Instead, Hogg summons
                    occasion and chance within his story to find spirit, and spirits, everywhere.
                    The diegetic mechanism of plot weaves disparate phenomena into a single, unified
                    field. Focusing on Hogg’s “The Mysterious Bride,” Anthony Jarrells offers a
                    suggestive examination of the complicity of ballad and tale as genres. The
                    often-overlooked genre of the tale emerges as a supremely Romantic one in Hogg’s
                    handling. It is built not only on conscious remediation, but also on the
                    negation of the social “fact” represented by traditional balladry. Jarrells
                    argues that tales occupy “a genuine middle position .&#160;.&#160;. between
                    orality and literacy.” They manage to balance two very different ideas of art:
                    the spoken representation of actions and their effects, and the mute display
                    through language of a vanishing culture.</p>
                <p>The next two essays present striking defamiliarizations of the genre of the novel
                    and what we might call its ethical instrumentality. Instead of providing the
                    straightforward representation of a plot or action by means of a diegetic
                    apparatus, Sydney Owenson and Jane Austen are both shown to explore, in
                    Rancière’s words, “the power of unbound perceptions and affections, of
                    individuations in which individuals are lost” (118). Miranda Burgess brilliantly
                    situates Owenson in the context of Thomas Reid’s common-sense philosophy,
                    uncovering the novelist’s interest in questions of causality and experience.
                    Burgess draws our attention to the radically and purposefully formless
                    empiricism of Owenson’s prose. Owenson’s descriptions, she argues, “dwell
                    constantly in sensation” without attaching these experiences to fixed forms or
                    identities. But what’s significant about this maneuver are the ethical, even
                    normative implications it carries. Stuart Burrows offers a subtle reading of the
                    complexity of utterance within Austen’s diegetic world. Burrows finds in
                    Austen’s novels a curiously distributed type of expression in which “almost
                    every character speaks for, through, or on behalf of another.” Private thoughts
                    are often recognized only when uttered by another. <title level="m"
                        >Persuasion</title>, with its “remarkable lack of interest in specifying who
                    is speaking and when,” imagines an intensely personal, private speech that is
                    deliberately detached from any particular subjectivity. Rather, utterances become
                    almost free-floating events that re-envision the relation of private to social
                    experience. </p>
                <p>De Quincey and Lamb are writers to whom Schmitt’s characterization of Romanticism
                    could perhaps best be applied: they both openly avow aesthetic productivity and
                    occasionalism. Timothy Milnes and Andrew Warren, however, show how deeply these
                    essayists depend on situating their own utterances as exemplary social actions.
                    The familiar essay in Lamb’s hands builds on the Humean practice of creating “a
                    shared community of opinion and belief” as the basis of experience. However, as
                    Milnes lucidly argues, Lamb foregrounds his own subjective occasionalism and
                    even allows it to open up the possibility that aesthetic productivity could
                    become a reliable, recognizable occasion for sympathy, albeit imperfect. De
                    Quincey, though speaking in a different register of “impassioned prose,” also
                    relies on perlocutionary effects, as Warren shows in the exuberant essay that
                    closes this collection. Most strikingly, De Quincey elaborates and puts into
                    practice a theory of expression that places contingent features of the occasion
                    at the heart of any attempt to capture experience. Language is material
                    entanglement, but that very entanglement forces us to try to decipher the
                    lasting, the binding, perhaps even the calculable within it. Romantic prose,
                    then, fixes its occasions into form. </p>
