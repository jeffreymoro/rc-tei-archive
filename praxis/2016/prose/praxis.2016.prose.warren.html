            <p class="noCount">This article makes the case that perlocution, a notoriously tricky species of speech
               act, opens up news ways of thinking about De Quincey’s autobiographical writings,
               particularly <em>Suspiria de Profundis</em>. Because its effects are indirect, uncertain and unpredictable, perlocution helps
               us understand language’s ability to entangle: readers, writers, memories, experience,
               events, other texts. That uncanny ability to entangle things—and our inability to
               ever fully disentangle them—is one of De Quincey’s abiding preoccupations. Its readiest
               models are the famous involute and the palimpsest, but examples of it exist throughout
               his oeuvre. De Quincey’s thinking on these and related matters anticipates later theoretical
               concepts such as Freud’s “tangle of dream thoughts," Benjamin’s <span class="foreign">verschränkte Zeit</span> (entangled time), and Derrida’s double bind, “which can only be endured in passion.”</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I. Perplexed Combinations &amp; Entangled Time</span></h2>
               <p>Language has long been associated with the dangers of getting entangled in it. Hobbes,
                  for instance, warns that someone who does not use language carefully and consciously
                  “will find himself entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twigs; the more he struggles,
                  the more belimed” (28). Or, in the opening of his first <em>Enquiry</em>, Hume says that abstruse philosophers and religious fanatics alike, “unable to defend
                  themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling brambles [words] to cover and protect
                  their weakness” (1.11, 7). It is the same tack taken in Locke’s “On the Abuse of Words,”
                  where power can be grasped by “employing the ingenious and idle in intricate disputes
                  about unintelligible terms, and holding them perpetually entangled in that labyrinth”
                  (3.10.9, 495). Hume likely gets the image from Locke, and Locke from a chapter in
                  Bacon called “The Intellect’s Ladder, or the Thread of the Labyrinth.” Bacon, in turn,
                  inherits these tropes from the Italian humanist Cardano’s <em>De Subtilitate</em>, which talks of “things which through impropriety of language rather than intention
                  are unintelligible and entangled like knots which chance to twist upon themselves”
                  (qtd. Wilson 40).</p>
               <p>What interests me in these accounts is language’s apparent agency, its ability to
                  ensnare without anyone’s direct “intention,” as Cardano puts it. The tradition of
                  British empiricism rarely uses terms such as <em>entangle</em>, but when it appears it often describes language’s material-like power, a force that
                  can “hold” you “perpetually entangled in that labyrinth”: i.e., language itself. There
                  is, of course, also a more positive, and more literary, account of language’s entangling
                  activity, one that goes at least back to Petrarch. That counter to language’s undead
                  materialism is perhaps best articulated by Sterne’s Yorick who describes his <em>Sentimental Journey</em> thus: “’Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy
                  adventures. But I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the
                  existence of a soul within me, as when I am entangled in them” (95). Here language
                  (“adventures,” or rather the temptingly melancholy narratives of them that Yorick
                  hears, reads and relates) might be material, but its entangling activity uncovers
                  something seemingly immaterial—the “soul within me” and, perhaps, within it. For Sterne,
                  the eighteenth century’s arch-thinker of entanglement, getting “entangled in telling
                  a plain story” (<em>TS</em>, 263) and in the relationships that telling precipitates, is active proof of language’s
                  divinity.</p>

                  <p>More than half a century later, having imbibed critiques of that empiricist tradition
                     by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, and also having imbibed tremendous
                     quantities of a very different kind of riposte to empiricism (viz., <em>opium</em>), De Quincey arrives at a Sternian conclusion, at once speculative and devastating: <span class="quote">‘And, recollecting it [his sister’s death], often I have been struck with the important
                        truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts and feelings pass to us through perplexed
                        combinations of <em>concrete</em> objects, pass to us as <em>involutes</em> (if I may coin that word) in compound experiences incapable of being disentangled,
                        than ever reach us <em>directly</em>, and in their own abstract shapes (<em>Suspiria</em>, 97).

                     isolate, pull away) certain “compound experiences” or “perplexed combinations” of
                     our memories.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Our deepest thoughts’ and feelings’ “concreteness” (their having grown together),
                     it would seem, happens in a Proustian <em>verschränkte Zeit</em>, an “entangled” or “intertwined” time where experiences only become legible when
                     properly constellated in memory and lived time (<em>SW2.1</em> 244). For Benjamin, “The eternity which Proust opens to view is intertwined time,
                     not boundless time. His true interest is in the passage of time in its most real—that
                     is, intertwined—form”; “the heart of Proust’s world” is “this universe of intertwining”
                     where “<em>correspondances</em> rule” (<em>SW2.1</em> 244). This is a fair description of De Quincey’s involutes, where past artifacts and
                     events become legible only when properly constellated with lived reality. But De Quincey’s
                     eternity yawns deeper, and his “true interest” is harder to locate, much less his
                     conception of truth. “The world,” as Benjamin says elsewhere, “is knowable <em>now</em>,” which is precisely where to find “truth” (<em>SW1</em> 277). In that <em>now</em> that exceeds subjective intention, “truth is charged to the bursting point” by the
                     historical images that happen, at that moment, to become synchronic with it. A <em>now</em> worthy of the name draws aspects of the past into alignment with it and in a flash
                     knowledge is produced—“the text [and the possibility of reading it] is the long roll
                     of thunder that follows” (<em>Arcades</em> 462 N2a,3). De Quincey’s oeuvre and personal mythology are also premised on a model
                     of reading: the brain as palimpsest,

                              135). The brain is receptive to impressions; they typically remain hidden and recorded-over,
                              to be brought into sudden constellation with other experiences and memories. John

                              posit a theory of performative predication here. “Schelling thinks of freedom in terms
                              of performances: freedom is our capacity to produce objects by so much as stating
                              their existence, as when we assert that we just asserted something, which produces
                              an assertion as an object of investigation.” What allows us to do this is “the Unground,”
                              the universal undetermined X that is identity in difference. It has no content itself,

                     effects can be profound, but also oblique and unpredictable. He is a confessed “self-dialogist
                     . . . perhaps the earliest that has existed,” because at a young age he “caught too
                     early and too profound a glimpse of certain dread realities” (10.11–12), or truths.
                     At a certain pitch, however, even De Quincey’s self-dialogism sometimes “swerves out
                     of [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien natures,” as when the Dark Interpreter’s
                     “words alter” (<em>S</em> 147). Like the Sorrows, that haunting figure also whispers “truths” to De Quincey
                     in his sleeps (<em>S</em> 245). But to become intelligible those truths must—presumably—later be recollected
                     (gathered) and disentangled from his other experiences and interpretations. Their
                     reinterpretation can only happen via an entangling (an involution) and a resistant
                     disentangling (an analysis, an untying), which is itself another kind of entangling.
                     This endless and sincere process of receiving and reinterpreting the truths that pass
                     to us is what I think De Quincey means by “impassioned prose,” his confessions’ signature
                     “mode” (238). In this piece I suggest that perlocutionary speech acts, whose effects
                     are entangling and incalculable, are a worthwhile model for interpreting—or rather,
                     reinterpreting—De Quincey’s impassioned prose.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Perlocution &amp; Entanglement</span></h2>
               <p>But what exactly are speech acts in general, and perlocution in particular? Speech
                  acts do not, or do not merely, describe; they act, they produce effects in the world.
                  In J.L. Austin’s terms, speech acts are thereby “performative” rather than “constative”
                  utterances. But realizing the difficulty of distinguishing performative and constative
                  utterances, Austin moved on to a tripartite categorization of locutionary, illocutionary
                  and perlocutionary speech acts. Let me give you Cavell's quick checklist from “Performative
                  and Passionate Utterance”: “the locutionary act (saying something meaningful), the
                  illocutionary act (what is done <em>in</em> saying something), and the perlocutionary act (what is done <em>by</em> saying something)” (169). Austin himself defines a perlocutionary act as one which
                  produces “certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts or actions of
                  the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may be done with the
                  design, intention, or purpose of producing them” (101). You can see why perlocution
                  is the trickiest of the three types—all those <em>ors</em> and <em>mays</em> (thoughts, feelings <em>or</em> actions; audience, speaker, or other persons; it <em>may</em> be done by design, or intention, or purpose—or not) spread the concept out into who
                  knows what, or where, or how. Austin repeatedly tries to contrast this diffusion with
                  what he takes to be a more stable target, illocutionary acts’ <em>specific</em> force to get something done. If in an illocutionary act the effect must be contained
                  in what is said, in a perlocutionary act the effect <em>cannot</em> be contained in it; if for an illocutionary act to succeed there must be a communally
                  agreed upon set of rules to judge its success, for a perlocution to work the speaker
                  is on his own—he must use whatever imagination, subtlety, or flair that he has at
                  his disposal. Weirdly, one can perform a perlocutionary act via a locution—that is,
                  by simply stating a meaningful fact. For example, I might prevent you from reading
                  or liking a novel by saying “Byron hated that novel”—or, that might make you reread
                  it and like it even more. Again, you can see why perlocution exasperated Austin, and
                  why Cavell and Miller see it as the place where his system breaks down. It gives reign
                  to “parasitic,” “not serious” and “not full normal” uses of language (104). If what
                  Austin calls “the doctrine ‘of illocutionary forces’” (100) seems predictably Newtonian,
                  perlocution is more like quantum mechanics, where God plays dice and disparate elements
                  are mysteriously entangled.</p>
               <p>In Miller’s reading, “Austin is haunted by poetry . . .” (38); jokes and poetry are
                  “etiolated,” whitened, and have “no force”; although Austin “uses tropes brilliantly
                  and commands a powerful rhetoric, but he does not generally reflect on the implications
                  of the way his use of tropes is necessary to get said what he wants to say” (39).
                  Put another way, Austin wants to say it “straight,” but uses tropes and turns to do
                  so; he <em>must</em> use them. Indeed, for Miller <em>How To Do Things with Words</em> is haunted by a “lurid under text of violence and catastrophe” (49), perhaps because
                  it cannot grasp its own tropological foundation. Tracing Austin's growing stable of
                  terms—from <em>performative</em> and <em>constative</em>, to <em>locutionary, illocutionary</em> and<em>perlocutionary</em>, to<em>behabitives, expositives, commissives</em>, and<em>verdictives</em>—Miller concludes: “the project frays out into increasingly unmanageable complexity,
                  the complexity of everyday usage in ordinary language” (13). That's the process of
                  getting “bog[ged], by logical stages, down,” a phrase Miller borrows from Austin and
                  uses repeatedly. Miller's point, I think, is that Austin was all too aware of ordinary
                  language's resistance to theorization, the way it lures you in and entangles you.
                  The figure of the fray and the bog connote entanglement in the term’s traditional
                  sense—Thomas Browne, for instance, wonders how the viscosity of a chameleon’s tongue
                  “inviscates and intangleth” insects. For Austin, the entangling tongue is human speech
                  itself.</p>
               <p>Or, as Miller puts it, “words are not pictures of reality. They are part of the thing,
                  tangled inextricably with the event they describe” (<em>Tropes</em> 43). In <em>Ariadne’s Thread</em>, he extends this into a claim about literature’s resistance to interpretation: “The
                  critic may fancy himself safely and rationally outside the contradictory language
                  of the text, but he is already entangled in its web” (23). That happens, for Miller,
                  because it’s impossible to isolate any given portion of a text from the whole: a critical
                  problem or “knot may be in one region untied, made unperplexed, but only at the expense
                  of making a tangle of knotted crossings at some other point on the loop” (22)—a double
                  bind. This does not mean that criticism is futile, but merely that works of literature
                  also interpret themselves. Describing Joseph Conrad’s “self-interpretive elements”
                  in <em>Fiction and Repetition</em>, Miller declares that “No literary text has a manifest pattern, like the design of
                  a rug, which the eye of the critic can survey from the outside” (23). Here we see
                  what will later become Miller's claims about the critic's performative utterances
                  and the impossibility of purely constative criticism.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, the model of reading here is deconstructive, but also psychoanalytic, as
                     much work on De Quincey is. Joel Faflak has suggested that De Quincey’s readers become
                     inscribed within “the text’s transferential field of reading.” In a Miller-like vein,
                     Faflak says that “Our inability to master the text’s meaning . . . mirrors uncannily
                     the text’s call for knowledge and interpretation that is built into its very structure”
                     (25). What interests me is the text’s “call” to read it, know it, interpret it, perform
                     it. In <em>Theory of the Lyric</em>, Jonathan Culler has recently warned of the dangers of “celebrat[ing] the performative
                     character of literature, as a simple consequence of the conventions of literary discourse”
                     because it distracts us from its real perlocutionary work. “The most important acts
                     a poem performs,” he suggests, “are likely to be those not entailed by it” (130).

Even worse, <em>entanglement</em> is itself a stubborn kind of <em>speech actant</em>. To coin yet another term, entanglement often becomes an “undead metaphor”—one which
                     renews itself in the connections it makes between different things, particularly when
                     those connections cannot be conceptually mapped. If such relations are increasingly
                     problematized across the latter half of the Enlightenment, which I think they are,

                     </div> In his reading of those letters, Brian McGrath has persuasively argued that De Quincey
                     marshaled his redefinition of <em>literature</em> (and hence <em>power</em>) to selectively manage the mushrooming list of texts one had to read (847–48). Yes, <em>had to read</em>—that is, I think, literature's call, or at least the call of the literary marketplace.
                     Literature’s proper call is slightly different—“all literature seeks,” in De Quincey’s
                     words, “to communicate power” (3.71) where other texts only communicate knowledge.
                     Real literature is a stronger <em>actant</em> inasmuch as it calls more powerfully on us to read it. But <em>where</em> do we locate this call, this seeking to communicate? Here is where the diffuseness
                     of effects, persons and intentions of perlocution’s model is useful for thinking with
                     De Quincey, and frustrating. As Cavell says, the problem in part is that “in perlocutionary
                     acts, the ‘you’ comes essentially into the picture” (180).

                  <p>Robert Morrison has connected De Quincey’s <em>Confessions</em> to what Foucault in 1975 called “the production of truth,” modernity’s social demand
                     to confess what one truly is (x). Several years later, in <em>Wrong-Doing and Truth-Telling</em>, Foucault discusses truth-telling as a “speech act” (14). “Avowal is,” according
                     to Foucault, “a verbal act through which the subject affirms who he is, binds himself
                     to truth, places himself in a relationship of dependence with regard to another, and
                     modifies at the same time his relationship to himself” (17). Foucault’s more general
                     strategy is to examine how a subject constitutes himself as an object—that is, to
                     look at both “the formation of procedures by which the subject is led to observe himself,
                     analyze himself, interpret himself, recognize himself as a domain of possible knowledge”
                     and “the way in which the subject experiences himself in a game of truth where he
                     relates to himself” (461).

                     </div> On this front Jean-Luc Marion’s work is salutary. For him, Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> merely “orient” the reader towards God. They are “written neither to describe nor
                     to demonstrate nor to instruct, but to provoke confession”; they “tend only to produce
                     an effect, or rather an <em>affect</em>, upon the interlocutor, understood as each reader. This intention is defined exactly
                     as a perlocutionary act" (46–47)—that is, a speech act whose consequences are inexplicit,
                     incalculable and perhaps even untraceable. Every word of Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> strains to accomplish, not represent, something; it cannot even represent to itself
                     what it seeks to accomplish. Thus “the truth of this perlocutionary word does not
                     rest on the truth (at least in the sense of adequation of mind to thing, <span class="foreign">Wahrheit</span>) but on the will to say the truth (veracity or sincerity, <span class="foreign">Wahrhaftigkeit</span>)” (46).</p>

                     of its occasions. “You understand now, reader, what I am” (54), De Quincey tells us,
                     but nevertheless his <em>Confessions</em>’ moral “is addressed to the opium-eater”: “If he is taught to fear and tremble, enough
                     has been effected” (78). But that education can only happen through the <em>Confessions</em>’ “true object”—“those parasitical thoughts, feelings, digressions” (88) and the (perlocutionary)
                     “effects” they incite.

                              turn collapses other distinctions: “Autobiography, understanding, and impassioned
                              prose are thus separate signifiers of the subject’s identity, and yet collapse into
                              one another by force of the unconscious” (158, 276n16).</span></div>
                     </div> He means by this “the very idea of breathing a record of human passion, not into the
                     ear of the random crowd, but of the saintly confessional. . . . Impassioned, therefore,
                     should be the tenor of the composition” (238). Its only examples are “those of St.
                     Austin”—miraculous abbreviation!—and, on a lesser scale, Rousseau. Across his autobiographical
                     works De Quincey stresses this enamoring. We see “impassioned minds” (112), “impassioned
                     memory” (169), impassioned themes, interests and passages (237–38). The lesson of
                     the <em>Suspiria</em> thereby mirrors what he calls “the education of Levana,” the Roman goddess of childbirth
                     who “lifts” infants from the earth into “the atmosphere of our troubled planet,” who
                     “present[s] its forehead to the stars, saying, perhaps, in his heart—‘Behold what
                     is greater than yourselves!’” (<em>S</em> 138). Paradoxically Levana’s lifting happens by opening up the labor of our hidden
                     depths: “that mighty system of central forces hidden in the deep bosom of human life,
                     which by passion, by strife, by temptation, by the energies of resistance, works for
                     ever upon children” (139). One of De Quincey’s problems is to instantiate this system
                     of forces—of lift and descent, of expansion and contraction, of passion, strife, temptation
                     and resistance—in his own writing. Citing Wordsworth, De Quincey asserts that true
                     style is the “incarnation of thought.” And yet language as “counter-spirit” threatens
                     to reopen the original fracture between thinking and expressing that conditions language’s
                     actual use. That counter-spirit is, says Wordsworth, “unremittingly and noiselessly
                     at work to derange, to subvert, to lay waste, to vitiate, and to dissolve.”

                  <p>De Quincey devoted a great deal of energy to the topic of style. He asserts, for instance,
                     that the “periodic style of writing” practiced by newspapers tires one out not for
                     its “length… the paralytic flux of words,” nor “even the cumbrous involution of parts
                     within parts.” Rather, “It is the suspense, the holding-on, of the mind until . . .
                     the sentence commences—this it is which wears out the faculty of attention” (12.21).
                     Imagine an age where <em>that</em>’s newspapers’ problem, that they’re too reflective! But look how easily De Quincey
                     moves between claims about style and its effect on the act of reading. Style’s “organic
                     aspect” expresses “all possible relations that can arise between thoughts and words—the
                     total effect of a writer”; the emphasis here is on the “use of words,” style’s so-called
                     “commerce with thought” (12.24–25). I am not sure whether this commerce is exactly
                     the same thing as the call literature makes upon us, but it’s close. What wears us
                     out in reading the “periodic style” is its periodicity, the way that it turns back
                     upon its point.

                     but at the same time, by the eternal interest attached to the <em>subjects </em>of these digressions, no matter what were the execution, spread a glory over incidents

                  of <em>Suspiria</em>, which ends with a double crescendo—one intellectual, one emotional—that I will cite
                  again: <span class="quote">‘I have been struck with the important truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts
                     and feelings pass to us through perplexed combinations of concrete objects, pass to

                  the incommunicable,” the awe he feels at his sister’s death. “Out of this digression
                  [the involute], which was almost necessary for the purpose of showing how inextricably
                  my feelings and images of death were entangled with those of summer, I return to the
                  bedchamber of my sister. From the gorgeous sunlight I turned round to the corpse . . .”
                  (98). He describes his sister’s “marble lips, the stiffening hands, laid palm to palm,
                  as if repeating the supplications of closing anguish,” and asks: “could these be mistaken
                  for life?” (99).</p>

                  <p>De Quincey’s inability to communicate directly how summer and death became associated
                     in his mind is somehow powerful. Before the digressive account of the involutes, he
                     articulates his crisis with extreme economy: “the glory is around us, the darkness
                     is within us” (97). Summer’s glory evokes, almost as a conceit, the death we carry
                     within us. But the association is not complex enough; he feels compelled to describe
                     an even “subtler reason why the summer had this intense power of vivifying the spectacle
                     or the thoughts of death.” For me, the most devastating detail is how the passage
                     invisibly links the Bible’s depiction of palm trees, which young De Quincey associated
                     with summer and Oriental climes, with his sister’s “stiffening hands, laid palm to
                     palm, as if repeating the supplications of closing anguish.”

                  “compound experiences,” even trifling ones. Just as we can never fix those experiences’
                  full or proper occasions, we can never experience something in its singularity or
                  “abstract shape.” To return to Benjamin’s phrase, there is no disentangled time, simply
                  better or worse constellations of it. Pulling apart our perplexed thoughts and feelings
                  (ab-stracting or analyzing them) only layers in more connections—(with Hobbes, again,
                  “the more he struggles, the more belimed”). The depths momentarily opened within compounded
                  experience can be expressed—or sounded—only by sighs: “One profound sigh ascended
                  from my heart, and I was silent for days” (<em>S</em> 85).</p>
               <p>For Sterne, these details, twists, connections, overlappings and involutions were
                  ultimately a boon to life and literature—“Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;—they
                  are the life, the soul of reading;—take them out of this book for instance,—you might
                  as well take the book along with them” (<em>Tristram</em> 54). But for De Quincey they express anxiety, or even ruin. De Quincey begins the
                  <em>Confessions</em> by stating that he is “bound to confess” his excessive indulgence in opium, but that
                  he has “untwisted almost to its final links, the accursed chain which fettered” him
                  (4). The <em>Suspiria</em>’s involutes shows how there is always something that resists untwisting, perhaps
                  even the “true interpretation of these final symptoms” (85)—the chain of interpretation
                  and the inevitability of new links. Rei Terada has compared De Quincey’s psychic model
                  to early Freud, where it is not the <em>order</em> of one’s thoughts, but rather their <em>density</em> that signals a healthy psychic economy. Within the brain, stimuli from within and
                  without can become “unbound” in such a way that they catastrophically “destabilize
                  one’s energy system”—what is sought is an “ego that is neither straightjacketed by
                  its own bindings nor overwhelmed by stimuli inconveniently becoming unbound” (221).</p>
               <p>I will conclude by thinking with Derrida’s “Resistances of Psychoanalysis” about a
                  slightly later, but related Freudian model. That work draws chiefly upon a few passages
                  from the <em>Interpretation of Dreams</em>, specifically those places—and those patients—which “resist analysis.” There Freud
                  gives his famous, Shandyean analogy of the “navel of the dream,” a passage excerpted
                  in my epigraph. Here it is in full: <span class="quote">‘There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream which has
                     to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the work of interpretation
                     that at that point there is a tangle of dream-thoughts which cannot be unraveled [<span class="foreign">ein Knäuel von Traumgedanken anhebt, der sich nicht entwirren will</span>] and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of the content of the dream. This
                     is the dream’s navel, the spot where it reaches down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts
                     to which we are led by interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have any
                     definite endings; they are bound to branch out in every direction into the intricate
                     network [<span class="foreign">in die netzartige Verstrickung</span>] of our world of thought. It is at some point where this network is particularly
                     close that the dream-wish grows up, like a mushroom out of its mycelium (525 / 564).’</span> For Freud the mushroom (the dream-wish) merely marks the knotty ground that gives
                  rise to it. That set of tangles is unanalyzable both because the links are too numerous
                  and because it reaches into the “unplummable” depths; it is, in the language of the
                  note, its “point of contact with the unknown” (143n2) and in the body of the text
                  the threads of dream-thoughts “have no definite endings” (564).</p>
               <p>A version of this passage originally occurs, as Derrida points out, in a note a couple
                  hundred pages earlier in <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>. It comes as a kind of “confession” given by Freud for his inability to decipher
                  his dream about Irma’s injection—that is, the one where he begins to feel that <em>he</em> might be responsible for <em>her</em> refusal to accept his interpretation of her condition. It is thus a case of the responsibility
                  or the ethics of interpretation. It’s an imperative that extends even into the analyst’s
                  own dream life despite his once believing that it was the patient’s sole responsibility
                  to accept or decline interpretations. But with the dream her and his psychic lives
                  become, as it were, entangled. In Greek analysis simply means untying, disentangling,
                  “solving” and “dissolving”; analysis should therefore solve that problem. But for
                  Derrida the unweaving of any psychic phenomenon is always tied to a twinned, resistant
                  weaving. Analysis resists itself as much as patients resist an interpretation imposed
                  on them by a psychoanalyst; all analysis, all interpretation is haunted by that imperative
                  to resist.</p>
               <p>But: <span class="foreign">Faudrait-il résister? Et d’abord à l’analyse?</span> So begins <em>Resistances</em>’ first essay. Its seven words ask at least six questions: Must one resist? Must one
                  resist, first, psychoanalysis? Or analysis? But also: Must one <em>endure</em> or <em>withstand</em> (<span class="foreign">résister</span>) psychoanalysis, or analysis? But the problem is even worse: “If it were necessary
                  to resist analysis,” Derrida continues, “one would still have to know whence comes
                  this ‘one must’ and what it means. One would have to analyze it.” These increasingly
                  tangled questions, all beneath an ambiguous title: <em>Résistances de la psychonalyse—</em>resistances of / from / by psychoanalysis. <span class="foreign">Faudrait-il résister</span>? What does it mean to resist if one must do it? The question feeds back on itself,
                  like the liar’s paradox. Derrida eventually names the problem a <span class="foreign">double bind</span>, concluding that “a double bind cannot fully be analyzed: one can only unbind one
                  of its knots by pulling on the other to make it tighter”—it “cannot be assumed; one
                  can only endure [<span class="foreign">souffrir</span>] it in <span class="foreign">passion</span>” (36).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In De Quincey’s impassioned prose we see an entangled and entangling system whose
                     effects—on readers, on himself, on Austin’s “other people”—seem incalculable, but
                     nevertheless calls to be endured.

                              Owenson’s “varied texture of love”: “an ethics of interdependency as pleasure—lacking
                              in determined outcomes, radically unproductive and, therefore, in Owenson’s terms,

                     his spirit, De Quincey places a demand upon us: “view me, as one <span class="foreign">viridantem fioribus hastas</span>—making verdant, and gay with the life of flowers, murderous spears and halberts—things
                     that express death in their origin, (being made from dead substances that once had
                     lived in forests,) things that express ruin in their use” (88). Or, to paraphrase, <em>watch me do things</em>, or <em>do</em> things,<em>with words</em>.</p>

               other references are to the Pickering and Chatto edition, indicated by volume and
               page. I would like to thank Eric Lindstrom and the “Ordinary Language and Romantic

               reading of an early draft, and Elizabeth Fay for her insightful suggestions for the

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">“What else than a natural and mighty palimpsest is the human brain? Such a palimpsest
               is my brain; such a palimpsest, O reader! is yours. Everlasting layers of ideas, images,
               feelings, have fallen upon your brain softly as light. Each succession has seemed
               to bury all that went before. And yet in reality not one has been extinguished” (<em>S</em> 135). The brain is receptive to impressions; they typically remain hidden and recorded-over,
               to be brought into sudden constellation with other experiences and memories. John
               describes an involute as “an intricately coiled or interwoven manifold.” In reading
               De Quincey’s entire corpus as tied to master-involute, the death of his sister, I
               think Barrell sometimes condenses or oversimplifies this figure of the tangled manifold;
               for him, involutes seem far more capable of being disentangled. See <em>The Infection of Thomas De Quincey: a Psychopathology of Empire</em> (Yale UP, 1991), 32.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The Dark Interpreter begins as a “reflex” of De Quincey’s own “inner nature,” someone
               he encounters in (opium) dreams. His function is therapeutic: “in uttering your secret
               feelings to <em>him</em>, you make this phantom the dark symbolic mirror for reflecting to the daylight what
               else must be hidden forever.” But he is like a “Greek Chorus,” and sometimes “swerves
               out of [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien natures” so that De Quincey “does
               not always know him . . . as [his] own parahelion” (<em>S</em> 147). In <em>Dark Interpreter: the Discourse of Romanticism</em> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980), Tilottama Rajan describes De Quincey’s
               Dark Interpreter as constituting a “doubled and split” “perceiving self . . . both
               passive and active, both the contemplator and sufferer of what occurs” (198).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">See “Infant Literature,” where De Quincey describes childhood’s “special power for
               listening to the tones of truth” (19.68) and truth’s “authentic whispers” (19.69),
               a fact he connects to “<em>involutes</em> of human sensibility”: “combinations in which the materials of future thought or
               feeling are carried as imperceptibly into the mind as vegetable seeds are carried
               variously combined” into the world (19.73). His model for this involution is the scene
               from the <em>Arabian Nights</em> where a magician places his ear to the earth and picks out Aladdin’s footsteps six
               thousand miles away from among “the mighty labyrinth of sounds which [even] Archimedes
               . . . could not sum or disentangle” (19.74).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">The Sorrows are three sisters (fates, really) who, disdaining “the infirmities of
               language” (<em>S</em> 140), communicate to De Quincey through pure symbols.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Following Markus Gabriel’s persuasive reading of Schelling’s <em>Freedom Essay</em>, we might posit a theory of performative predication here. “Schelling thinks of freedom
               in terms of performances: freedom is our capacity to produce objects by so much as
               stating their existence, as when we assert that we just asserted something, which
               produces an assertion as an object of investigation.” What allows us to do this is
               “the Unground,” the universal undetermined X that is identity in difference. It has
               no content itself, but “is maximally topic-neutral: it stands for whatever can be
               the case and make a statement about it true” (97). De Quincey’s “abstract shapes”
               are like this identity-in-difference, but all that “pass[es] to us” of it are “concrete
               objects” and “perplexed combinations.” The “important truth” that strikes De Quincey
               is, perhaps, disjunction or identity, a truth he futilely tries to comprehend via
               entanglement, what Schelling might call “interconnected resistants” (<span class="foreign">zusammenhängende Gegenstände</span>). See also Iain Hamilton Grant, “Everything Is a Primal Germ or Nothing Is: the Deep
               Field Logic of Nature,” <em>Symposium: Canadian Journal of Continental Philosophy</em>, 19.1, 106-24.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <em>Suspiria</em> by declaring that “it is so painful to a lover of openhearted sincerity, that any
               indirect traits of vanity should even <em>seem</em> to creep into records of profound passion” (88). And yet, if language is necessarily
               “infirm” (147) and truths can never pass to us “directly,” then ironic distance and

               such as the Malay or the Welsh, and thus to the other as such: “The iterability of
               language means that the masterful, staged performative that unsays the said and allows
               one to enter into inaugural, heartfelt dialogue with the human other, may not be distinguishable
               from repetition. Or, to put it another way, the house of language is always open to
               visitation by a poetic spirit, which spirit allows consideration of the potential
               meaning of patterns that language has as a written language. Those patterns don't
               just gainsay the said; they also gainsay saying, and with it the scene of ethical
               relation and dialogue as implicating only humans” (139). I will only add that De Quincey
               explicitly theorizes this ethical and linguistic relation, and that he often does
