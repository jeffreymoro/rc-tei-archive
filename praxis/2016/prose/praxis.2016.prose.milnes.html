               <h2><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>
               <p>The fate of empiricism in the period between middle of the eighteenth century and
                  the early nineteenth century (that is, between the skeptical naturalism of David Hume
                  and the inductivism of John Stuart Mill) presents a curious episode that rarely attracts
                  comment. Around a century ago, Leslie Stephen and Élie Halévy depicted this period
                  as merely a lull or hiatus in British intellectual history, one in which the collective
                  attention of philosophers was directed towards thinking through the consequences of
                  the French Revolution. Halévy, for example, claimed that between David Hartley and
                  James Mill, English thought passed “through a period of standstill” (434). Against
                  this view, I will argue here that English—or, more accurately, British thought—did
                  not so much stand still as switch paradigms, at least for a period. This change is
                  evident in two developments: the socialization of experience by Scottish Enlightenment
                  thinkers and the impact of belletristic periodical culture upon philosophical discourse.
                  These two factors were linked in ways that produced a remarkable turn in the relationship
                  between philosophy and literature between the publication of Hume’s <em>Treatise</em> in 1740 and the heyday of the Romantic familiar essay in the 1820s. Consequently,
                  at least part of what Halévy registered as an absence is, in effect, a swerve away
                  from systematic epistemology and towards a form of essayism, involving a corresponding
                  change in philosophical style and vocabulary.</p>
               <p>In this essay, I explore these developments in more detail. I briefly outline the
                  ways in which, from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, the idea of intersubjectivity
                  emerged as a counterdiscourse to a scientific empiricism based upon the epistemological
                  binary of subject and object and the correspondence theory of truth. Driven by a Scottish
                  insistence that society precedes rationality, and exemplified by Hume’s idea of an
                  “easy,” conversational philosophy, empiricism was regrounded in social correspondence
                  rather than epistemological correspondence; above all, it based itself in the circulation
                  of trust and the kinds of performances that reinforced that trust. As economies of
                  knowledge were increasingly linked to the maintenance of certain (trustworthy) forms
                  of social behavior, the epistemological stakes were raised for communicative acts
                  in general, and for literary works in particular. </p>
               <p>Since the days of <em>The Spectator</em>, the familiar essay had functioned as the literary genre of trusting intersubjectivity
                  <em>par excellence</em>, a vehicle for philosophical experiments in communication. And yet, Hume’s treatment
                  of trust was more radical than that of his Augustan precursors, raising the stakes
                  for the essayistic performance. Only with Hume’s conventionalist treatment of rationality
                  did it become possible for empiricism to accommodate the idea that truth <em>presupposes</em> communication and that subjectivity itself is constructed relationally, via interactions
                  with others. In the final section of the essay, I will suggest that, while Hume’s
                  language game of proto-pragmatic essayism is continued in the Romantic familiar essay,
                  the <em>strategy</em> for promoting intersubjectivity changed in the early nineteenth century. Where the
                  rewards of essaying for Hume lay in the consolidation of consensus through philosophically
                  indifferent conversation, for a Romantic essayist such as Lamb, they consisted in
                  the promotion of solidarity through the production of transcendence and re-enchantment.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Hume’s “easy” empiricism</span></h2>
               <p>The idea that Hume promoted a form of empiricism based upon trust and intersubjective
                  consensus will inevitably strike many as counterintuitive. Some might even claim that
                  Hume was the <em>least</em> trusting of all Enlightenment thinkers. It was Hume, after all, who wrote in the
                  <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em> that “[n]o weakness of human nature is more universal and conspicuous than what we
                  commonly call Credulity, or a too easy faith in the testimony of others .  . .” (112)—a
                  remark that foreshadowed his celebrated attack on testimonial evidence in the “Essay
                  on Miracles.” Certainly, the skeptical part of Hume’s thought is not in dispute. By
                  arguing that all our ideas are either “<em>copy'd from our impressions</em>” (72) or made up of simple ideas that are themselves derived from impressions, Hume
                  picks at a loose thread in Locke’s account of cognition. By the time he has finished
                  pulling at this thread, he has completely unravelled the idea of causation, since
                  “from the mere repetition of any past impression, even to infinity, there will never
                  arise any new original idea, such as that of a necessary connexion . . .” (88). Nor
                  does this unwinding of knowledge end with causation. Ultimately, belief itself is
                  shown to rest upon nothing more substantial than sentiment: the “force and vivacity”
                  communicated by an impression to an idea, which “super-adds nothing to the idea, but
                  only changes our manner of conceiving it . . .” (101). Nonetheless, as Hume concedes
                  later in <em>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>, one cannot live one’s life as a skeptic: “Nature will always maintain her rights,
                  and prevail in the end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever” (41).</p>
               <p>It is because of this caveat that Hume’s arguments in the <em>Treatise</em> have carried an air of paradox for many readers. As Kenneth Richman notes, “Hume
                  appears to do the following: (a) endorse beliefs in objects and causes, (b) hold that
                  we should not endorse beliefs that do not have appropriate grounding in our impressions
                  . . . and (c) hold that the beliefs in objects and causes do not have appropriate
                  grounding of our impressions” (3). One result of this paradox is a split between what
                  Richman calls “Old” Humeans and “New” Humeans. Commentators of the former persuasion,
                  such as Stephen and Halévy, tend to downplay position (a) and emphasise (b) and (c).
                  Accordingly, such “skeptical” readings of Hume tend to see his impressionism as exhaustively
                  phenomenalistic. According to this view, Hume’s skeptical attack on representationalism
                  and the “correspondence” model of truth signals the bankruptcy of an abstracted, atomistic
                  view of experience and meaning. Since the work of Norman Kemp Smith, however, there
                  has been a tendency to downplay positions (b) and (c) and foreground (a). Following
                  this line of interpretation, “New” Humeans such as Annette Baier, Peter Jones and
                  Donald Livingston see Hume’s impressionism as a maneuver whereby Hume exploded the
                  hypostatized vocabulary of ideas and impressions in order to create a new language
                  of experience based upon non-epistemological principles of feeling, habit and custom.
                  From this perspective, Hume’s adoption and deconstruction of the language of “ideas”
                  is the first step in a process of redescription that restored the social, dialogical
                  and experimental dimensions to “experience.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One virtue of such readings (though not one previously noted) is that they highlight
                     the significance of the subtitle of the <em>Treatise</em>: “An Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects.”
                     Hume’s very specific use of the term “experimental” here is easily overlooked. Since
                     Locke, empirical philosophy had entertained the idea of the mind as a forum for philosophical
                     experimentation. For Hume, however, the laboratory for empirical experiment was not
                     the mind as Locke’s <span class="foreign">camera obscura</span> of abstracted consciousness, but something closer to mind <em>in society</em>. He makes this point quite explicitly in his Introduction to the <em>Treatise</em> when he cautions the reader that “[w]e must . . . glean up our experiments in this
                     science from a cautious observation of human life, and take them as they appear in
                     the common course of the world, by men’s behaviour in company, in affairs, and in
                     their pleasures” (xix). In this way, Hume effected a transition from a model of thought
                     based upon pure induction and <em>objectivity</em> (i.e. upon an epistemological binary of subject / object) to one that was based upon
                     sentiment and <em>intersubjectivity</em>. By downgrading “correspondence” theories of truth and meaning, which generally viewed
                     experience as a form of representation, he abandoned the Lockean image of punctual
                     subjectivity: that is, one constituted by a manifold of atomized experiences (ideas
                     and impressions), and underwritten by a providential rationality. In its place, Hume
                     developed a model of “experience” based in trial and experiment within a constitutive
                     framework of social custom, sentiment, and most importantly, trust.

                              are so closely associated that they are used more or less synonymously to mean the
                              act of practical, tentative trial. Johnson’s Dictionary testifies to this continued
                              intimacy, defining the noun “experience” as “1. Practice; frequent trial” and “2.
                              Knowledge gained by trial and practice.” The latter notion of experience as practice
                              rather than as phenomena was still current at the time and is in turn associated with
                              a heightened awareness of the epistemic role of fictions in discourse. Once epistemological

                     </div> Trust became vital to Hume’s thought precisely because his skeptical approach left
                     the human intellect with no other means of support than the <em>sentiment</em> of belief, the <em>manner</em> in which the object is conceived. As Miriam Solomon argues, the lesson Hume derives
                     from skepticism is that “knowledge requires more than reason and experience, not that
                     knowledge is impossible” (52). For Hume, radical skepticism led to social empiricism.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The familiar essay as philosophical performance</span></h2>
               <p>Thanks to Hume then, literary form became a philosophical issue. Interest in the regulation
                  of trust by means of literary performances that consolidated social and epistemological
                  norms engendered, in turn, a concern with the performative dimension of language as
                  well as with the status and function of philosophical writing. In particular, the
                  essay, with its amenability to tentative, unmethodical improvisation and friendly
                  conversation, appeared to fit an image of reason based on the very ideas of custom,
                  habit and sentiment presented in Hume’s picture of a decenterd, constitutive intersubjectivity.
                  Tellingly, as Hume abandoned representational empiricism in favour of “easy” empiricism,
                  he drew away from the systematic treatise and moved towards the familiar essay as
                  <em>the</em> genre of philosophy.</p>
               <p>To an extent, Hume was walking a well-trodden path. Since the days of <em>The Spectator</em> and <em>The Tatler</em>, the periodical essay had functioned as both medium and model for the open, egalitarian
                  and polite discursiveness of the public sphere. Addison and Steele had exploited the
                  essay’s potential to move amphibiously across boundaries, between philosophical and
                  literary modes of expression, as well as between academic and informal writing. Most
                  notably, in <em>The Spectator</em> no. 10, Addison declared his intention to emulate Socrates, who “brought Philosophy
                  down from Heaven, to inhabit among Men,” by bringing “Philosophy out of Closets and
                  Libraries, Schools and Colleges, to dwell in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea-tables,
                  and in Coffee-houses” (44). In this way, essaying as an activity eschewed the quest
                  for certainty in order to foster an idea of “experience” very close to that outlined
                  in the Introduction to Hume’s <em>Treatise</em>: an experimental activity in which the mind came to reshape itself through its engagement
                  with human life in “the common course of the world.”</p>
               <p>And yet, there is a vital difference between the essayism of Hume and that of Addison.
                  For Addison, the Lockean subject remained intellectually punctual and intact. Consequently,
                  despite his claim that the experimentalism of the familiar essay provided philosophy
                  with a pathway from the cloisters of learning into the bright thoroughfare of the
                  public sphere, Addison did not consider the possibility that the very customs, habits
                  and conventions depicted in the pages of <em>The Tatler</em> and <em>The Spectator</em> might themselves be epistemologically constitutive. The correspondence between “trust”
                  and “truth” ran in one direction only: the former could, at most, only ever count
                  as limited evidence for the latter. For Hume, however, truth <em>itself</em> could not be separated from “common life and Conversation.” Consequently, what one
                  finds in the essays of Hume is a more radical socialization of empiricism in the face
                  of an intolerable but incorrigible epistemological skepticism. By replacing Locke’s
                  providential, private, and pictorial conception of human reason with a conventional,
                  public, and grammatical one, Hume implied that the truth of any empirical statement
                  ultimately depended upon the <em>manner</em> of its performance and upon the “sentiment” attached to its conception. In foregrounding
                  the performative function of philosophical language, Hume dramatically raised the
                  stakes for the essayist as stylist. Put simply, manner became everything.</p>
               <p>It is this consciousness of the fundamentally <em>performative</em> nature of the philosophical writer’s task that distinguishes mid-century essayists
                  such as Hume and Johnson from their Augustan predecessors. After Hume, the problem
                  of empiricism’s relation to public discourse was no longer simply one of how philosophical
                  thoughts might be curated and transmitted to the reading public, it was also one of
                  how an empirical concept of “experience” might itself be shaped by the conventions
                  and practices of communication. In effect, Hume’s insistence that conversation forms
                  a constitutive part of experience radicalised Addison’s project to socialize philosophy
                  by placing intersubjectivity at the very core of human thought: while Addison and
                  Steele brought philosophy to the “coffee-house,” Hume endeavoured to bring the “coffee-house”
                  to philosophy.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Hume’s own essays attempted to police polite culture through performances
                  of moderate skepticism. He developed an “easy,” conversable empiricism that endeavored
                  to reinforce solidarity rather than demonstrate logical certainty. And yet, the very
                  need to “reinforce” trust indicated that trust had its limits. Hume’s technique as
                  a writer incorporated the thought that these limits are not defined rationally, but
                  through human second nature: through emotion, custom, and habit. In this respect,
                  Hume is the disciple of Cicero rather than Newton, deploying measured prose that asserts
                  epistemic authority through its rhetoric of reasonableness and moderation, through
                  its commanding <em>exhibition</em> of communicability. Nowhere is this more evident than in the exemplary act of polite
                  self-fashioning exhibited by his suitably brief autobiographical essay, “My Own Life,”

                     an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible
                     of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions. (<em>Essays</em> xl)’</span> Here, the cardinal virtues of Hume’s Academic skepticism, of “mild dispositions,
                  of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour,” are revealed to be
                  those of the author himself. Above all, the “moderation” of the philosopher’s passions,
                  which is itself reflected in the modesty of the self-representation Hume offers, typifies
                  the philosophical attribute of <span class="foreign">ataraxia</span> (detachment) required to live a civilized and enlightened life without epistemic
                  grounds or foundations. This philosophical moderation lay at the heart of Hume’s essayism,
                  insofar as the essay genre provided him with a literary analogue for the conversable
                  world and an antidote to the philosophical enthusiasm of systematic, rationalist philosophy.
                  In this way, Hume used the familiar discourse of the essay to reposition epistemology,
                  moving it away from what he saw as the ineffectual domains of truth and reason and
                  into the active territory of public discourse, custom, and opinion. By doing so, he
                  relocated the philosophical authority of the man of letters from the foundations of
                  truth to the circulation of trust.</p>
               <p>This meant that the essayist took on the role of a diplomat between the worlds of
                  learning and polite conversation, or as Hume puts it in his unpublished essay “Of
                  Essay-Writing,” as “a Kind of Resident or Ambassador from the Dominions of Learning
                  to those of Conversation . .  .”: <span class="quote">‘Learning has been as great a Loser by being shut up in Colleges and Cells, and secluded

                     and without that Liberty and Facility of Thought and Expression, which can only be
                     acquir’d by Conversation. Even Philosophy went to Wrack by this moaping recluse Method

                     never consulted Experience in any of their Reasonings, or who never search’d for that

                  “common life and Conversation.” The essayist, unlike the solitary scholar, adapts
                  the “the higher and more difficult Operations of the Mind” to “the easier and more
                  gentle Exercises of the Understanding” (<em>Essays</em> 533) not because (or not solely because) this helps him to communicate truth, but
                  because it is <em>only</em> in such communication that truth ultimately lies.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Sociability through re-enchantment: The Romantic familiar essay.</span></h2>
               <p>What does the familiar essay’s shifting epistemological significance in the eighteenth
                  century tell us about the development of the genre in the early nineteenth century?
                  Essayists such as Lamb and Hazlitt inherited from Hume and Johnson a readiness to
                  draw upon the performative resources of the familiar essay in order to imagine a shared
                  community of opinion and belief. What distinguishes Romantic essayists from their
                  predecessors, however, is the issue of what was at <em>stake</em> in the performance of essaying. For the latter, the language game engaged by the
                  familiar essay necessitated that certain normative structures were <em>presupposed</em>. For Hume in particular, such structures were determined by custom and reinforced
                  by the exhibition of courteous manners. In such cases, it was assumed that the reader
                  could not fully appreciate the performance of the author without already sharing a
                  great deal of their “common” background of beliefs. In other words, what was epistemologically
                  at stake for the Neoclassical familiar essayist was the status of a truth whose verifiability
                  is fundamentally a practical and intersubjective affair.</p>
               <p>For the essayist of the early nineteenth century, however, the fiction of familiarity
                  was beginning to wear thin. Indeed, perceptions of what was at stake in the literary
                  performance of the essay had already begun to shift significantly by the end of the
                  eighteenth century. Most notably, the political upheavals of the 1790s made the consolidation
                  of imagined solidarity envisaged by Hume appear more nakedly politicized, recast by
                  Burke as a call for national unity around feelings of familial partiality and prejudice.
                  Moreover, the essayist now wrote for a marketplace that had expanded and diversified:
                  as Jon Klancher and William St. Clair have documented, patronage and subscription
                  had given way to contracts with booksellers, the periodical essay had been replaced
                  by the magazine and the newspaper, and an increasingly productive printing press was
                  undergoing its industrial revolution. This environment presented the essayist with
                  new challenges: it was difficult to consolidate ways of understanding the world when
                  the common ground of good sense and precedent presupposed by Hume and Johnson had
                  fragmented, polarized, or been discredited. Hume’s Ciceronian idea of literature as
                  the domain of polite letters, courtly virtues and easy philosophizing was overtaken
                  by the Romantic notion of literature as, in Wordsworth’s phrase, “the breath and finer
                  spirit of all knowledge . . .” (141). As social harmonies were exchanged for transcendental
                  sublimities, the Romantic enactment of familiar conversation sought to establish a
                  different relationship with readers, one based in the idealized grounds of singularity
                  and enchantment. </p>
               <p>Consequently, the Romantic essayist’s primary task became one of establishing social
                  and epistemological norms through the exercise of imaginative power. As writers sought
                  new grounds for literary “truth,” the experimental maintenance and consolidation of
                  intersubjective consensus were replaced by the experimental <em>production</em> and exploration of new intellectual territory. This shift is reflected in the changing
                  persona of the essayist. While the individual figured in the prose identity of Hume
                  presupposed an intersubjective conception of the speaking subject—one whose unity
                  is held together by pragmatic, rather than by metaphysical, principles—in philosophical
                  Romanticism, the unification of style and substance was underpinned by an <em>ideal</em> presence. Rather than seeking to reinforce consensuality, the subject invoked by
                  the Romantic familiar essay was one who searches, however unsuccessfully, for transcendental
                  authentication. The persona of Lamb’s essayist, for instance, is constructed around
                  the ironic and partial recuperation of a lost wholeness, often figured as a borderline,
                  twilight territory of enchanted consciousness. “Imperfect Sympathies,” with its digs
                  at the moral philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment, exemplifies this condition
                  while explicitly opposing it to a “Scottish” tradition of intellectualized intersubjectivity:
                  <span class="quote">‘I can look with no indifferent eye upon things or persons. . . . I am, in plainer
                     words, a bundle of prejudices. . . . There is an order of imperfect intellects (under
                     which mine must be content to rank) which in its constitution is essentially anti-Caledonian.
                     The owners of the sort of faculties I allude to, have minds rather suggestive than
                     comprehensive. They have no pretences to much clearness or precision in their ideas,
                     or in their manner of expressing them. Their intellectual wardrobe (to confess freely)
                     has few whole pieces in it. They are content with fragments and scattered pieces of
                     Truth. . . . The light that lights them is not steady and polar, but mutable and shifting:
                     waxing, and again waning. . . . They are no systematizers, and would but err more
                     by attempting it. (58–59) ’</span> Whether or not Lamb had Hume in mind as his model of the “Caledonian” intellect,
                  the “systematizer” label is one that the latter would have rejected, belying as it
                  does his concern with folding the <span class="foreign">episteme </span>of scientific knowledge into the <span class="foreign">doxa</span> of social communication. Indeed, for Hume, as long as the credit supply of trust
                  underpinning intersubjective consensus could be maintained, the metaphysical status
                  of human belief need not be a pressing concern, still less one that called for systematization.
                  The task of the essayist as an epistemological diplomat was to keep conversation going,
                  and above all to keep such conversation polite and civilized. In “Imperfect Sympathies,”
                  however, epistemological doubt itself becomes aestheticized into an ideal presence
                  that can only be approached through imagination. Instead of seeking to consolidate
                  assumed intersubjective consensus <span class="foreign">à la</span> the “Caledonian” constitution, Lamb’s “Elia” essays endeavor to <em>produce</em> affective connections through a kind of exemplary performance of individuality. Elia
                  offers to engage his reader in a language game based upon the celebration of whim,
                  prejudice and singularity. The state of mind required for this game is precisely what
                  the “brain of a true Caledonian” lacks, i.e., “misgivings, half-intuitions, semi-consciousnesses,
                  partial illuminations, dim instincts, embryo conceptions.” In this way, the aporia
                  that caused Hume to abandon epistemology altogether is reified in Lamb as a borderline
                  territory of re-enchantment: what Elia refers to as “[t]he twilight of dubiety” (60).
                  Whereas in Hume the protean nature of the familiar essay is utilized in the service
                  of dialogue, in Lamb the essay’s shapelessness is <em>itself</em> aestheticized, offering to charm the reader rather than draw them into an imaginary
                  conversation. Rather than being dedicated to the maintenance of everyday experience
                  in the common course of the world, the essay’s liminality is redirected towards the
                  recovery and transcendence of the ordinary through the thoroughly extraordinary performance
                  of the essayist.</p>
               <p>The differences between the two essayists should not be overstated. Like Hume, Lamb
                  uses the conversational character of the familiar essay in order to conduct experiments
                  in trust with his readers. What the persona of Elia offers in return for such trust,
                  however, is not so much reassuring sociability as the possibility of the reader’s
                  re-enchantment with the world. Indeed, in his essay “The Old Margate Hoy” (1823),
                  Elia introduces a figure who uncannily resembles the essayist himself. Recounting
                  a sea trip upon the eponymous vessel during a miserable holiday to the south coast
                  of England, Lamb describes one of his fellow passengers as “the greatest liar I had
                  met with then, or since,” one who “plunged at once into the depths of your credulity.”
                  This “Spanish complexioned young man” tells tall tales of how he had served as aide-de-camp
                  to a Persian prince, seen a phoenix in Egypt and sailed through the legs of the Colossus
                  at Rhode. And yet, rather than inciting irritated incredulity, these stories offer
                  a welcome respite from the tedium of the boat trip. More specifically, Elia recounts,
                  “[h]is dreaming fancies had transported us beyond the ‘ignorant present.’” Like the
                  reader, the passengers on the boat are placed temporarily “in a new world, with everything
                  unfamiliar about us, and the time and place disposed us to the reception of any prodigious
                  marvel whatsoever” (178–79). In a similar way, Lamb’s method as an essayist is to
                  play a delicate game with the trust of his reader. Like the liar that his very name
                  evokes, “Elia” dives straight into his reader’s confidence. By doing so, however,
                  he does not forfeit trust: in the essay, as on the deck of the boat, there is an implicit
                  recognition that the normal rules of social intercourse are suspended. </p>
               <p>One might take this further, and suggest that the familiar essay as a genre internalizes
                  and experiments with the thought that such a “leap of faith,” or act of trust is fundamental
                  to all human communication, and not just in the conspicuously groundless conditions
                  of a boat expedition, where the subject is all at sea. Hume’s essays in “easy” empiricism
                  and Lamb’s “Old Margate Hoy” reject the idea that language is a medium for expressing
                  what we have already thought. In reality, they suggest, we never get to construct
                  our thoughts in a kind of empirical dry dock; instead, like the essayist, we must
                  first dive into conversation and build our vessel out of port. For Hume, the essayist’s
                  task is to steady this vessel, to keep it afloat through the polite performance of
                  certain virtues and manners. Lamb’s Elia, on the other hand, is more concerned with
                  cultivating a sense of wonder in the spontaneity of the dialogue that floated thought
                  in the first place, at the very possibility of a shared experience, amid surmises
                  and semi-consciousness, that might count as “truth.” Despite their many differences,
                  however, the writings of Hume and Lamb share an awareness of the way that the performance
                  of the familiar essayist’s experiments can promote or imperil the communication upon
                  which social knowledge depends. </p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5">
               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>It follows from the foregoing that the title of Lamb’s self-consciously unsympathetic
                  essay should be treated with caution. Lamb’s essayism does not signal a radical departure
                  from the language of trust and intersubjectivity developed by Hume and the thinkers
                  of the Scottish Enlightenment, an edging out of social empiricism by Romantic idealism.
                  Instead, what both Hume and Lamb’s prose writings exhibit is a profound ambivalence
                  towards systematic philosophy itself. It is this ambivalence that lends the familiar
                  essay in this period its shape and its fundamental purpose, creating a space in which
                  formal understanding, aesthetic appreciation and social communication overlapped.
                  Seen from this perspective, the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Hume
                  and the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Lamb had a surprising amount
                  in common, not least in the ways that both defied contemporary philosophical taxonomies.
                  </p>
               <p>Nonetheless, in its idealization of incompleteness, Lamb’s sympathetically unsympathetic
                  broadside against philosophy approximates a concept of aesthetic irony in ways that
                  Hume’s does not. At the heart of this irony, as formulated two decades earlier in
                  the Romanticism of the Jena circle, is transcendental philosophy’s concern with thought’s
                  presupposition of the incomprehensible. This concern is expressed most distinctly
                  by Friedrich Schlegel’s warning, in his essay “On Incomprehensibility,” against rationalism:
                  <span class="quote">‘Yes, even man’s most precious possession, his own inner happiness, depends in the
                     last analysis, as anybody can easily verify, on some such point of strength that must
                     be left in the dark, but that nonetheless shores up and supports the whole burden
                     and would crumble the moment you subjected it to rational analysis. Verily, it would
                     fare badly for you if, as you demand, the whole world were ever to become fully comprehensible
                     in earnest. (Simpson 185) ’</span> In a similar way, the twilight half-knowledge contained in the signature gesture
                  of Lamb’s familiar essay is ultimately underwritten by the aestheticization of the
                  incomprehensible, by what Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy have described
                  as the “Literary Absolute,” a transcendentally postulated but unattainable unification
                  of subject and object, form and content. In theoretical terms, this entailed the idea
                  that literature <span class="foreign">qua</span> “Literature” might, as pure “generativity,” compensate for, or even redeem philosophy’s
                  failure to complete itself by figuring the absolute <em>productively</em>. In this way, as they put it, “[R]omantic thought involves not only the absolute
                  of literature, but literature as the absolute. Romanticism is the inauguration of
                  the <em>literary absolute</em>” (12). Such a position, however, as Schlegel himself acknowledged, involved setting
                  out from (while by no means remaining in) a fundamentally Kantian understanding of
                  the dependence of phenomenal experience upon strictly noumenal modes of thought.</p>
               <p>The catch here, of course, is that in Lamb’s writing (as in that of most of his British
                  Romantic contemporaries), the labors and rewards of visionary imagination are invoked
                  in the absence of transcendental apparatuses and thus a fully theorized account of
                  the work of art itself as autotelic. Consequently, while <em>transcendence</em> of empirical, quotidian reality (Elia’s “ignorant present”) remains tacitly embedded
                  in his writing as a proleptic ideal, the <em>transcendental</em> conditions of this goal remain untheorized. In this way, Lamb’s essays may be said
                  to be both culturally and philosophically liminal: not only do they occupy an indeterminate
                  status between “high” and “low” literature, they also offer an image of the self that
                  brings together an inherited discourse of sociability and pragmatic intersubjectivity
                  with a transcendentally idealist conception of aesthetic capability that itself remains
                  incomplete. Thus, while for Hume and his Neoclassical literary milieu the problem
                  of writing the familiar essay was one of how to ground authority and consolidate knowledge
                  in the “conversable” world in the absence of apodictic certainties, the challenge
                  facing Lamb and his contemporaries was that of how to privilege the discursive space
                  of the essay as ideal and aesthetic <em>without</em> collapsing its numinous aura of enchantment into the bathos of everyday exchange.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Significantly, until the eighteenth century, the words ‘experience” and “experiment”
               are so closely associated that they are used more or less synonymously to mean the
               act of practical, tentative trial. Johnson’s <em>Dictionary</em> testifies to this continued intimacy, defining the noun “experience” as “1. Practice;
               frequent trial” and “2. Knowledge gained by trial and practice.” The latter notion
               of experience as <em>practice</em> rather than as <em>phenomena</em> was still current at the time and is in turn associated with a heightened awareness
               of the epistemic role of fictions in discourse. Once epistemological relations are
               redescribed in terms of social relationships, the most pressing questions that arise
               relate to the status of the norms and bonds that regulate the community of knowledge.
               This ultimately produces a concern with what might be considered as the social <span class="foreign">a priori</span> of knowledge: rational accommodation, trust and testimony.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
