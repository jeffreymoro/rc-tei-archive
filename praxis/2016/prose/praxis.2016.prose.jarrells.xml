            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">A recent media turn in Romantic studies has foregrounded the
                    ballad—and poetry more generally—as a privileged site for understanding how
                    questions about medium and mediality feature in the writing of the period. But
                    do such questions feature in the era’s prose genres, as well? And is it possible
                    to talk about a medium of Romantic prose as Celeste Langan and Maureen N. McLane
                    talk about a <emph>medium of Romantic poetry</emph>? In this essay, I suggest
                    that the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” and to show this I turn to
                    the prose tales of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who not only recognized
                    bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but also understood
                    ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of each other. Like
                    the ballad, I argue, the tale, too, can be understood as a “hybrid oral and
                    textual practice” (in Paula McDowell’s words), a prose form that exhibits a
                    subtle self-consciousness about its own medial status. </p>

<div type="section">
                <p>In his 1800 Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, Wordsworth asks,
                    “where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to typify the
                    affinity between metrical and prose composition” (<title level="m">Major
                        Works</title> 602)? One answer, surely, is in the lyrical ballads
                    themselves: in poems such as “Simon Lee,” “We are Seven,” and “The Thorn,” that
                    is, which adopt “language really used by men” (597) and dispense with “what is
                    usually called poetic diction” (600). Readers might have to “struggle with
                    feelings of strangeness and aukwardness” (596) before any such bonds can be
                    affirmed, as Wordsworth admitted in his revised Preface of 1802. Still, the poet
                    remained decided in his opinion that “there neither is, nor can be, any
                    essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition”
                    (602). </p>
                <p>Another answer might be gleaned in the scores of titles published in the same
                    two-year period, 1800–02, in which the words “ballad” and “tale” seem to be used
                    interchangeably. Wishing to write “in the manner of” Wordsworth’s <title
                        level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, for example, Mary Robinson published
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Tales</title> in 1800.<note place="foot"> Robinson
                        writes this in a June 17<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, 1800, letter to a
                        publisher (qtd. in Pascoe, Introduction, 54).</note> In 1801, Matthew
                    Lewis’s collection of ballad imitations appeared as <title level="m">Tales of
                        Wonder</title>.<note place="foot">In 1808, Lewis would publish <title
                            level="m">Romantic Tales</title>, a four-volume work that includes
                        ballads and prose tales.</note> A year later, Anne Bannerman published
                        <title level="m">Tales of Superstition and Chivalry</title>, another
                    collection of ballads. 1802 also saw the first two volumes of Walter Scott’s
                        <title level="m">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</title>, a collection of
                    “tales” of “elder times” (as Scott described them in the dedication) that
                    recovered the rich ballad culture of the Scottish border country. William
                    Earle’s <title level="m">Welsh Legends: A Collection of Popular Oral
                        Tales</title> (1802) features both verse and prose compositions, including
                    prose tales on which, as Earle explains, the ballads “of this and other
                    countries” were “founded” (vi). </p>
                <p>In certain respects, the conflation of “ballad” and “tale” is confusing in that
                    both were well-known forms at the turn of the century, the former as a verse
                    form, the latter, increasingly, as a prose form. The ballad had undergone a
                    revival in the latter half of the eighteenth century, thanks to the publication
                    of Thomas Percy’s <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title>
                    (1765) and to what Katie Trumpener calls the “new” genre of the ballad
                        <emph>collection</emph> (xi). And it was in these same years that the tale
                    emerged as its own, distinct generic category, with a first major peak in
                    popularity in the 1790s, followed by a second, even more dramatic rise in the
                    1820s, when “tale” surpassed both “novel” and “romance” to become the most
                    popular label for prose fiction in the decade.<note place="foot"> The tale has
                        two major associations that attach to it in these years of emergence: the
                        first is the moral or didactic (as in the work of Jean-Francois Marmontel,
                        Hannah More, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth), the second is the
                        regional and traditional (as in the work of Edgeworth (again), Walter Scott,
                        and James Hogg). The foregrounding of the moment of telling or teaching in
                        both might be said to link these two major associations. The present article
                        will focus on the tale’s strong regional and oral-traditional associations,
                        but for a general view that considers both major strands of the tale’s rise,
                        see Tim Killick, <title level="m">British Short Fiction in the Early
                            Nineteenth Century</title> (2008), and Anthony Jarrells, “Short
                        Fictional Forms and the Rise of the Tale,” in <title level="m">The Oxford
                            History of the Novel in English, vol. 2: English and British Fiction
                            1750–1820</title>, edited by Karen O’Brien and Peter Garside (Oxford UP,
                        2015), 478–94. On the word “tale” surpassing “romance” and “novel” in the
                        1820s, see Peter Garside, “The English Novel in the Romantic Era:
                        Consolidation and Dispersal,” in <title level="m">The English Novel,
                            1770–1829: A Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction Published in the
                            British Isles</title>, edited by Peter Garside, James Raven, Rainer
                        Schöwerling (Oxford University Press, 2000), 15–103: pp. 50–51.</note> In
                    other respects, however, the conflation of ballads and tales is not so difficult
                    to account for. Both words had strong associations with what had come to be
                    understood as “oral tradition” and both reflected a general sense of
                    “nervousness” about the fate of songs and stories in a print-saturated age.<note
                        place="foot"> Paula McDowell argues that in the latter half of the
                        eighteenth century, following a new interest in the ballad and in the
                        controversy surrounding James Macpherson’s Ossian poems, “we see an epochal
                        shift in attitudes toward ‘oral tradition,’ and the crystallization of the
                        modern secularized version of this concept” (McDowell, “Mediating Media,”
                        240). See also Nicholas Hudson, “Constructing Oral Tradition: the Origins of
                        the Concept in Enlightenment Intellectual Culture.” <title level="m">The
                            Spoken Word: Oral Culture in Britain, 1500–1850</title>, edited by Adam
                        Fox and Daniel Woolf (Manchester UP, 2002), pp. 240–55. On “nervousness”
                        about the spread of print in the eighteenth century, see McDowell, “The Art
                        of Printing was Fatal,” p. 56.</note> Indeed, the confusion already is
                    evident in the series of publications that got the whole ballad revival started:
                    I mean the proto-tales, or prose translations of Gaelic ballads, that James
                    Macpherson called <title level="m">The Poems of Ossian</title> (1760–65).
                    “Pleasant are the words of the song,” says Cuchullin in book three of <title
                        level="m">Fingal</title>, “and lovely are the tales of other times” (73).
                    Or, in “Oina-Morul. a Poem”: “I seize the tales as they pass, and pour them
                    forth in song” (323). “Tale” and “ballad” refer generally to “story,”
                    “tradition,” “antiquity.” But what was new and distinctive about these two as
                    forms, especially compared with, say, the novel or the polite poetry of the
                    eighteenth century, was precisely the attention they drew to the act of
                    remediating traditional, oral stories in print. Both ballads and tales exhibit
                    what Jussi Parikka calls “the media-archaeological spirit of thinking the new
                    and the old in parallel lines” (2). As such, they bring to the fore the very
                    question of medium itself.</p>
                <p>Yet of the two answers offered here to Wordsworth’s question about affinities
                    between metrical and prose composition, only one—the yoking together of lyric
                    and ballad—has received scholarly attention. The other—the conflation of ballad
                    and tale—has hardly been remarked upon at all, not even by those recent scholars
                    whose work constitutes an important media turn in the field and highlights the
                    significance of the ballad in particular for understanding the “medium” of
                    Romantic poetry.<note place="foot">In terms of the latter, I’m thinking
                        especially of the work of Maureen N. McLane (<title level="m">Balladeering,
                            Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry</title>). In terms
                        of a more general media turn in Romantic studies, see, in addition to
                        McLane, Celeste Langan (“Understanding Media in 1805”); Langan and McLane
                        (“The Medium of Romantic Poetry”); Paula McDowell, “Mediating Media Past and

                    think, a couple of reasons for the silence. First, although the tale was a
                    recognized form in the Romantic period, distinguished from the novel by
                    booksellers, publishers, and readers, it has not been considered as such in our
                    own time, which tends to see it merely as one subgenre in a larger “system” of
                        novels.<note place="foot"> As in, for instance, Franco Moretti, <title
                            level="m">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title>: “Both synchronically and
                        diachronically&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. the novel is <emph>the system of its
                            genres</emph>” (30). Clifford Siskin has used the term “novelism” to
                        describe the “habitual subordination of writing to the novel”
                        (172–3).</note> Second, the media turn in eighteenth-century and Romantic
                    studies has focused mostly on verse, finding in “the situation of British
                    poetry, 1760–1830,” as Maureen McLane writes, “a window onto the transhistorical
                    condition of poetic ‘mediality’” more generally—“mediality” being “the condition
                    of existing in media, whether oral, manuscript, print, or digital” (<title
                        level="m">Balladeering</title> 6).<note place="foot"> McLane takes her
                        definition here from Friedrich A. Kittler’s <title level="m">Discourse
                            Networks, 1800/1900</title>, and specifically from David E. Wellbery’s
                        Forward to the book, in which the term “mediality” is introduced.</note>
                    Without necessarily intending to do so, such accounts sometimes collapse prose
                    into the larger category of print and ignore a genre such as the tale which,
                    like the ballad, can also be described—in Paula McDowell’s words—as a “hybrid
                    oral and textual practice” (“Mediating” 242).<note place="foot"> Celeste Langan
                        addresses the conflation of prose and print in her essay, “Understanding
                        Media in 1805,” pp. 53–54.</note> In what follows, I examine the ways that
                    the tale, too, exhibits a subtle self-consciousness about its own medial status
                    and I ask whether the features and history of this form open up possibilities
                    for talking about a medium of Romantic prose.<note place="foot">As Langan and
                        McLane do for verse in “The Medium of Romantic Poetry.”</note> To do this, I
                    turn to the work of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who not only recognized
                    bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but also understood
                    ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of one other. </p>
                <p>Hogg’s 1830 tale, “The Mysterious Bride,” opens with references to two writers
                    who had a profound impact on his career. The first is Scott, a friend and
                    competitor whose wildly successful “school of chivalry” was always threatening
                    to edge out of the literary market Hogg’s own, more eccentric, “mountain and
                    fairy school” (Hogg <title level="m">Anecdotes</title> 9). Concerned about what
                    he saw as a recent turn away from belief in ghosts and spirits, and about
                    Scott’s comments on the subject in his <title level="m">Keepsake</title> tale of
                    1829, “My Aunt Margaret’s Mirror,” Hogg exclaims, “Even Sir Walter Scott is
                    turned renegade, and, with his stories made up of
                    half-and-half&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. is trying to throw cold water on the most
                    certain, though the most impalpable, phenomena of human nature” (“Mysterious
                    Bride” 155).<note place="foot"> “The Mysterious Bride” was published as a
                        continuation of Hogg’s “Shepherd’s Calendar” series, which started in <title
                            level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> in 1819 and was later
                        published as a two-volume collection in 1829. I am aware of the pitfalls of
                        conflating narrator and author in Romantic works and understand, too, that
                        the shepherd-narrator that Hogg employs for his series is a creation based
                        on Hogg’s own experiences, on people he knew in Ettrick, and on the persona
                        of “the Shepherd” as it appeared in the pages of <title level="j"
                            >Blackwood’</title>s. Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience and to
                        more clearly position Hogg the writer in relation to the references and
                        sources he engages in his tale, I will refer to him throughout this essay as
                        “Hogg” rather than as the more awkward “Hogg’s narrator” or “Hogg’s
                        speaker.”</note> Hogg may have felt miffed by Scott’s turn, in 1827, to the
                    tale, a genre he saw as belonging to his own school and which he spent much of
                    the 1820s proving his mastery of.<note place="foot"> As Ian Duncan notes, it was
                        during these years that “Hogg and [John] Galt gave the tale its most
                        striking formal development” (<title level="m">Scott’s Shadow</title>
                        35).</note> That Scott would then use the form to question the tale’s great
                    topos of the supernatural only added fuel to the fire.</p>
                <p>The second reference follows immediately from the first and expands the argument
                    about the supernatural to include another form associated with tradition: the
                    ballad. As a means of challenging the recent rejection of ghosts and spirits,
                    Hogg exclaims: “Before [naysayers like Scott] had ventured to assert such
                    things, I wish they had been where I have often been; or, in particular, where
                    the Laird of Birkendelly was on St Lawrence’s eve, in the year 1777, and sundry
                    times subsequent to that” (155). The place in question is the road from
                    Birkendelly, in the “great muckle village of Balmawhapple”; the Laird to whom
                    Hogg’s narrator almost silently gives way is casually riding along and “chanting
                    a song” by “a certain, or rather uncertain, bard ycleped Robert Burns, who made
                    a number of good songs” (155). This song, Hogg writes, “was an amorous song of
                    great antiquity, which, like all the said bard’s best songs, was sung one
                    hundred and fifty years before he was born” (155). “O let me in this ae night,”
                    the song referred to, was first taken up by Burns in 1792 when he modified it
                    for inclusion in James Johnson’s <title level="m">Scots Musical Museum</title>
                    (1787–1803). He returned to it again several times between 1793 and 1795
                    following a request from George Thomson to contribute to his <title level="m">A
                        Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs </title>(1793–1818). </p>
                <p>“Oh let me in this ae night,” sings a lover standing outside a woman’s window:
                    he’s cold and wet and complains that “love has bound [him], hand and foot.” But
                    the woman is not persuaded: “Gae back the gate ye came again / I winna let you
                    in, jo—,” she responds (Kinsley 485). These lines are from Burns, the bard Hogg
                    mentions in his tale. However, the lines that Hogg actually provides are from
                    another, earlier version, much like the one published in <title level="m">The
                        Scots Musical Museum</title> and based on David Herd’s <title level="m"
                        >Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs</title> (1776). In this version, too, a
                    man pleads to be admitted to his lover’s house: <quote><lg>

                        </lg></quote> The lines quoted are similar to the Herd version, though here,
                    in Hogg’s tale, the two stanzas are presented in reversed order. Indeed, both
                    versions by Burns (in the <title level="m">Musical Museum</title> and in
                    Kinsley) follow Herd for the first eight lines. But the three versions are quite
                    different in their endings. The later Burns version is the most chaste of the
                    three: it was, after all, commissioned by Thomson, and the Burns whom Thomson
                    wanted for his collection was the pious, sentimental Burns of “The Cotter’s
                    Saturday Night,” not the bawdy Burns of such songs as would be printed a few
                    years later in <title level="m">The Merry Muses of Caledonia
                        </title>(1799).<note place="foot"> On Thomson’s request see Kinsley’s note

                            “Wierd” here means “fate.” The version quoted in Hogg’s tale, based on Herd’s text, ends
                    quite differently.<note place="foot"> In the version printed in <title level="m"
                            >The Scots Musical Museum</title> she also lets him in. It concludes:
                        “the joys we’ve had this ae night / your chamber was within, jo” (<title
                            level="m">Musical Museum </title>#311).</note> Although Hogg does not
                    provide the actual lines, he hints at them when he writes, “[t]his song the
                    Laird was singing, while, at the same time, he was smudging and laughing at the
                    catastrophe, when, ere ever aware, he beheld, a short way before him, an
                    uncommonly elegant and beautiful girl walking in the same direction with him”
                    (155–56). The word “catastrophe” can mean “a conclusion generally unhappy,” as
                    Samuel Johnson defined it; “a sudden disaster, as in the <title level="m"
                        >OED</title>; or a “convulsion affecting the earth’s surface,” which was a
                    new usage in Hogg’s time derived from the emerging science of geology (also
                    listed in the <title level="m">OED</title>). Hogg’s use of the word might be
                    said to capitalize on all three meanings. Here are the concluding verses of
                    Herd’s version:<quote><lg>
                            <l>She let him in sae cannily,</l>
                            <l>She let him in sae privily,</l>
                            <l>She let him in sae cannily,</l>
                            <l>To do the thing you ken, jo.</l>
                            <l> Bur ere a’ was done, and a’ was said,</l>

                            <l>The lassie lost her maidenhead,</l>
                            <l>And her mither heard the din, jo. (Herd 167–69) </l>
                        </lg></quote> That Hogg’s laird is able to laugh at this catastrophe is
                    somewhat ironic—it’s “wierd,” we might say—as it foreshadows his own unhappy
                    conclusion: later in the tale, the laird’s “blackened corpse” is discovered at
                    the very spot where the elegant and beautiful girl first appeared to him, on the
                    day the two of them were to be married. “This woful catastrophe,” Hogg
                    writes, repeating the word he used earlier to describe the end of the ballad,
                    “struck the neighborhood with great consternation, so that nothing else was
                    talked of” (166). The elegant and beautiful girl is, of course, the mysterious
                    bride of the title—the ghost of one Jane Ogilvy, who, long ago, let a man in one
                    night, so to speak. After losing her “maidenhead” she is jilted by the man,
                    Allan Sandison, the grandfather of the laird singing the tune, who forsakes her
                    to wed “the great heiress of Birkendelly.” Ogilvy’s ghost takes its revenge on
                    Sandison’s heir, and we come to understand that a similar catastrophe befell the
                    previous generation of Sandisons, as well.</p>
                <p>Hogg, then, refers to one version of a ballad—by Burns—and cites another, a
                    version “that is more direct in defining the ‘catastrophe’ that results from
                    admitting the laird ‘this ae night,’” as Hogg’s recent editor, Thomas C.
                    Richardson, puts it (<title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> 433, n. 155d). It’s a
                    clever bit of play, showing not only that Hogg knew a good deal about different
                    versions of ballads but also drawing attention to the process of transmission
                    itself: from the song “sung one hundred and fifty years” before Burns’s birth to
                    the different versions collected by Herd, Johnson, and Thomson, and on to Hogg’s
                    own tale. Indeed, Hogg seems to suggest that his tale is yet another instance in
                    this process, part of a living tradition comprised of individual memory (what
                    the narrator characterizes as “facts that happened in my own remembrance” [155])
                    and oral lore as collected in songs and stories. Hogg does not try to smooth
                    over the differences brought about in the process or to “conflate sources so as
                    to produce a single representative text”—as, for example, David Atkinson
                    suggests that Scott did in his <title level="m">Minstrelsy </title>and Percy did
                    before him in his <title level="m">Reliques</title> (Atkinson 120). Rather than
                    seeing the ballad as a “closed, original, and seminal utterance,” Hogg
                    understands it “as a constant and multiple production” (Atkinson 23). The
                    ballad’s “appropriate organizing principle,” as Atkinson argues, “is precisely
                    one of proliferation” (23). The laird in Hogg’s version of the story might be
                    singing the tune that Burns’s verses are set to while chanting the words printed
                    in Herd’s edition or combining elements from all of the versions. The tale thus
                    highlights the ballad’s “inherent” instability even as it becomes yet another
                    version (Atkinson 182). </p>
                <p>My aim here is not to reduce “The Mysterious Bride” to an allegory about the
                    pitfalls of ballad editing. But I do want to suggest that it reveals an acute
                    awareness of how the ballad exists somewhere between orality and print and of
                    how the tale, though written in prose, can be understood to be part of the
                    “multiple production” of the ballad, either following from it, as in Hogg, or
                    preceding it, as in the Earle example cited above. The mysterious bride from
                    whom the tale takes its title is, in a sense, conjured into being from the
                    singing of the Burns song: so sudden is her appearance on the road that the
                    laird assumes that she must have “risen out of the earth” (156). And in a
                    description that sounds like it could be of the antiquarian ballad collection
                    itself, Hogg writes that when the body of the young Sandison was discovered,
                    “[e]very ancient tradition and modern incident were raked together, compared,
                    and combined” (166). To little effect, it might be said. Hogg’s tale would seem
                    to offer another instance of what Ian Duncan, writing about Hogg’s <title

                    (1824), calls “a grisly parody of the late Enlightenment project of antiquarian
                    and literary ‘revival’—the attempt by scholars and poets to recover the remains
                    of national traditions, buried in a primitive countryside” (xi). Instead of
                    raking, comparing, and combining with the hope of arriving at an answer—or
                    text—the mystery is solved by an old woman named Marion Haw, who simply tells
                    another tale. This tale, Hogg notes, has more than a little in common with his
                    own attempts in the genre. “She gave the parishioners a history of the
                    Mysterious Bride, so plausibly correct, but withal so romantic,” he writes,
                    “that everybody said of it, (as is often said of my narratives, with the same
                    narrow-minded prejudice and injustice,) that it was a <emph>made story</emph>”
                    (166–67; emphasis in the original). </p>
                <p>Given the stress in Hogg’s tale on the ballad and its multiple versions, the word
                    “made” as it is used here could be understood to refer to an
                        <emph>assembled</emph> story—that is, to the raking, comparing and
                    collecting that aims to produce a true or original text, something both
                    “correct” and “romantic,” like a ballad in an eighteenth-century collection. The
                    explicit comparison that Hogg makes, however, is to his “narratives,” a
                    comparison which suggests that a “made” story is something more like a
                        <emph>mere</emph> fiction or perhaps a story that is too seamless to be
                    true. Something like a novel, that is. This might very well be a dig at Scott
                    or, more generally, at what Matthew Wickman, in his contribution to this issue,
                    describes as “the modern concept of the literary as a species of imaginative
                    writing set against a normative sphere of everyday life.”<note place="foot"> See
                        Wickman’s essay in this issue, “Concerning the Spiritual in Hogg’s Art”:
                        link here.</note> But if Hogg means to draw a distinction between the tale
                    and the novel, the word “made” would seem to go against my own reading of the
                    former’s major difference from the latter: its self-consciousness about its own
                    medial status. Wouldn’t something that appears to be “made” be something more
                    likely to call attention to its made-ness, or its medium—as in “made of what” or
                    “made how”? This is a point that McLane and Celeste Langan make in their lucid
                    account of “The Medium of Romantic Poetry” (2008). Commenting on a 1799 review
                    of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, in which Charles Burney describes
                    Wordsworth and Coleridge’s project as an “ingenious forgery,” Langan and McLane
                    explain that it is precisely the “forged” aspect of the collection that makes
                    visible poetry’s status as medium. “[T]he ‘retrogradation,’ to use Burney’s
                    term, is intentional” (253), they write; Wordsworth and Coleridge,<quote> are
                        exploring the ‘medium of poetry’ in another sense [not, as in Burney, as
                        transition from one period to another]: neither its origin nor its end but
                        rather its <emph>middle</emph>—and by extension, perhaps, its
                            <emph>essence</emph>. For it may be that the question of a medium and
                        the question of an essence are always bound together: the very possibility
                        of multiple ‘mediations’ produces in turn the question, ‘mediations of what
                        [thing]?’ (254) </quote> Hogg understands the ballad’s essence similarly:
                    its multiple mediations not only open a space for the prose tale, but also allow
                    his own telling to become a new—although not a final—version. But then how is
                    the tale not also forged—or “made”? Wouldn’t a made story be more in keeping
                    with a forged poetry?</p>
                <p>The difference comes down to the medium that fictional prose is so often
                    conflated with—print—and to the genre that has come to stand in for literature
                    more generally in an age of print: the novel.<note place="foot"> See note 6 on
                        Clifford Siskin’s term, “novelism.”</note> Unlike the ballad or the tale,
                    the novel is a born-print genre: as Walter Benjamin explains, what
                    “distinguishes” it from the latter is “its essential dependence on the book”
                    (87). Such a dependence on the newly naturalized medium of print suggests that
                    the “made” in Hogg’s description has a different character than the “forged” in
                    Langan and McLane’s example. “Made” stories in print are those in which there
                    appears to be no medium whatsoever, no work of forging, making, or mediation. As
                    Catherine Gallagher has shown, novels offer readers the kind of consistency and
                    depth of character which, though the product of fiction, appear consistent
                    with—indeed, coterminous with—real life. “The novel gives us explicit fiction,”
                    she writes, “and simultaneously seems to occlude it” (349). Such occlusion
                    constitutes a kind of immediacy, a new product of “an age in which the medium of
                    the book,” as Friedrich Kittler argues, “is first universal” (117), an age that
                    Kittler dates to 1800. Poetry, too, exhibited the effects of the change. Langan,
                    for instance, describes blank verse as “the redefinition of English poetry by
                    the medium of print,” explaining that a poem like “Tintern Abbey” “appears to
                    reject artifice” and thus to render its medium of communication “invisible”
                    (“Understanding” 53–54). When poetry becomes prose or prose-like, in other
                    words, medium becomes invisible because prose itself has become synonymous with
                    print. A forged poetry, to go back to the example above, brings medium back to
                    the fore by keeping the poetry part active: it resists the conflation of poetry
                    and print, in practice if not in theory, by highlighting the poetic process of
                    forging, or making, as distinct from something already made. </p>
                <p>The novel, likewise, can be described as the redefinition of storytelling by the
                    medium of print. Plausibly correct and withal so romantic, it, too, appears to
                    reject its own artifice and to obscure the fact of medium. But what then can we
                    say about prose in the period? Is its case a hopeless one, always to be
                    collapsed into the larger category of print, a category that, having become
                    natural and universal, had it made, so to speak? Perhaps the ballad-tale
                    conflation highlighted at the start of this essay is somewhat akin to the
                    poetry-prose conflation Langan analyzes, though here it resists the additional
                    conflation of prose and print by highlighting the former’s continued affinities
                    with poetry, that medium that refused to give way in the face of massive medium
                    change? To say such is not to collapse prose into the larger category of medium.
                    Instead, it is to make medium itself part what Yoon Sun Lee, in her introduction
                    to this issue, describes as “the situated quality of prose,” and especially of
                    prose written in a modern, print-saturated, world.<note place="foot"> See Yoon

                <p>The opposite of a made story, then, would be a tale—or ballad—“founded on fact,”
                    with fact referring not to that epistemological unit that Mary Poovey calls “the
                    modern fact,” a unit that came to be represented by numbers (Poovey 5), but
                    rather to a “truth” attested to by “authentic testimony” (as one <title
                        level="m">OED</title> entry defines it), and in particular to the telling
                    and retelling of stories over time.<note place="foot"> As a reviewer of Mary
                        Margaret Busk’s <title level="m">Tales of Fault and Feeling</title> (1825)
                        put it, “[t]ales are in the first place facts, which, from being in some
                        degree out of the common course of things, attract attention, are
                        remembered, and handed down from father to son, with all that incorrectness
                        which must attend what relies on memory only&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.” <title
                            level="j">The Literary Gazette</title> (26 March 1825). Quoted in
                        Killick, <title level="m">British Short Fiction</title>, p. 17. </note> It
                    is interesting to note that the word “tale” can mean both “number” and “story.”
                    Hogg’s friend, Lord Byron, highlights the overlapping registers when he puns on
                    the word in Canto III of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>
                    (1816): “and if thy tale be true,” he exclaims, alluding to the number of bodies
                    that perished on the field of Waterloo and to the story those numbers tell of
                    that decisive battle (l. 308). Hogg, too, brings to the fore the seemingly
                    contradictory registers of number and story—or tally and tale—in his repeated
                    claim that his tales are founded on incidents told again and again or, as in
                    “The Mysterious Bride,” that they are a “relation of facts.” On the one hand,
                    such stories traffic in a realm of experience that is thoroughly grounded in
                    belief, including belief in ghosts, miracles, spirits and all that is
                    inconsistent with real life as represented in novels.<note place="foot">As
                        Wickman explains, “[f]or Hogg, the spiritual is a fact of existence.” Link
                        to Wickman’s essay.</note> On the other hand, the truth of such experience
                    is both attested to and made, as in <emph>poiesis</emph>, or poetic making,
                    precisely out of multiple retellings. “Perhaps a tale you’ll make it,” says
                    Wordsworth’s speaker in “Simon Lee” (l. 80), making the reader both frustrated
                    and, as McLane shrewdly observes, “like the poet, a ‘maker,’” (<title level="m"
                        >Balladeering</title> 227). Tales are part of a process—and a community—in
                    which facts are made in and by the act of transmission. </p>
                <p>Hogg’s knowledge of the rich history of ballad transmission is hardly surprising:
                    one of his first successes came with “Donald Macdonald” (1801), a patriotic song
                    that gained a popular following in Scotland; and Hogg and his mother, Margaret
                    Laidlaw Hogg, were what McLane describes as “informants” for Scott’s <title
                        level="m">Minstrelsy</title> (<title level="m">Balladeerin</title>g 4). With
                    Scott’s encouragement Hogg published a collection of “ballads and songs founded
                    on facts and legendary tales,” <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>, in
                        1807.<note place="foot"> Title page, <title level="m">The Mountain
                            Bard</title>, 1807. Hogg published an expanded version of <title
                            level="m">The Mountain Bard</title> in 1821. The title of the 1821
                        edition was changed, slightly, to read, “The Mountain Bard; Consisting of
                        Legendary Ballads and Tales.”</note> But while he would continue to write
                    poetry and songs throughout his career, it was with the prose tale that Hogg
                    found his best point of entry into a crowded literary market and his most
                    distinctive literary voice. Many of his tales, like “The Mysterious Bride,”
                    engage, build upon, or indirectly comment on the ballad tradition that Hogg was
                    so familiar with.<note place="foot">As Douglas Gifford notes, “.&#160;.&#160;.
                        it cannot be stressed enough how much [Hogg’s] ballad background is the
                        basis of both content and form in the bulk and the best of his fiction”
                            (<title level="m">Development </title>10).</note> Others quite literally
                    emerge from the margins and surrounding materials of ballads—conjured, like the
                    mysterious bride herself, by song. In <title level="m">The Mountain
                    Bard</title>, for instance, Hogg includes a ballad imitation, “The Pedlar,” that
                    he published three years earlier in the <title level="j">Scots Magazine</title>.
                    The ballad tells the story of a murdered pedlar and of the discovery, following
                    a bizarre incident in which a recovered heel bone starts “streamin wi’ blood,”
                    of the murderer (<title level="m">Mountain</title>, l. 147). As Hogg’s editor,
                    Suzanne Gilbert, suggests, the “motif” of a part of a victim’s body bearing
                    witness to his fate is common in traditional ballads; it can be seen in “The
                    Cruel Sister,” collected in Scott, and the better known version, “The Twa
                    Sisters,” collected in Francis James Child’s <title level="m">The English and
                        Scottish Popular Ballads</title> (1882–98).<note place="foot">See Gilbert’s
                        note to “The Pedlar” (1807), pp. 405–06.</note>
                </p>
                <p>Like Scott’s version in the <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, Hogg’s “Pedlar”
                    has what appears to be a standard ballad-collection apparatus, including a
                    headnote and endnotes. But these spaces are used not to highlight excluded
                    variants or to justify one version over another, but instead to proliferate
                    multiple versions of the “fact” on which the ballad is “founded” (26). The
                    endnotes, for instance, stretch on for many pages and offer multiple instances
                    of the “superstitious awe” (<title level="m">Mountain Bard</title> 31) recorded
                    in the song. “This reminds me of a trifling anecdote, which I will here relate
                    as an instance” (33), Hogg writes. A few paragraphs later: “some, yet alive,
                    have heard John Corry, who was [Mr Boston’s] servant, tell the following story”
                    (34). “A similar story to this of Mr Boston and the pedlar, is told of a
                    contemporary of his, the Reverend Henry Davieson, of
                    Gallashiels&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.” (35). And off he goes again, with one account
                    suggesting another until a tale—indeed, a set of tales—has unfolded in the
                    margins to extend the story and to show it to be alive still, present “amongst
                    the wilds of the country to this day” (<title level="m">Mountain Bard</title>
                        32).<note place="foot">As Gilbert elsewhere argues, for Hogg “tradition” is
                        not “a fixed set of practices” located in the past, but rather something
                        that “continues into the present” (“Authority of Tradition” 101).</note>
                </p>
                <p>In the 1821 edition of <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>, Hogg added a
                    number of new ballads, including “The Wife of Crowle,” a version of the famous
                    “Wife of Usher’s Well,” from Scott’s <title level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, which
                    tells the story of three sons drowned at sea who return—as revenants—to feast
                    with their bereaved mother before departing in the morning to go to their
                    graves. Hogg’s version was originally published in his own, short-lived literary
                    periodical, <title level="j">The Spy</title>, in 1810, as “A Fragment.” And as
                    Hogg notes in the headnote to <title level="m">The Mountain Bard</title>
                    version, it is also “given more at large in ‘The Winter Evening Tales’” (312), a
                    collection of prose tales that Hogg published in 1820—his most successful work
                    of fiction. This more-at-large version appears in the first story of the
                    collection, “The Renowned Adventures of Basil Lee,” which was itself published
                    in two fragments earlier in <title level="j">The Spy</title> and tells of the
                    wanderings of the anti-heroic Basil, from a Berwickshire farm to Canada to
                    revolutionary-war America and back to Edinburgh. Along the way Basil encounters
                    the tale of “an old woman who lived in a lone sheiling, at the head of an arm of
                    the sea, called Loch Kios, to whom a ghost paid a visit every night” (<title
                        level="m">Winter</title> 53). The account recorded in “The Wife of Crowle”
                    is here transplanted to the isle of Lewis and then extended in the form of a
                    prose tale.<note place="foot">nother example of this movement from ballad to
                        tale, one perhaps better known to today’s readers of Hogg, is the prose tale
                        version of the ballad, “The Twa Corbies,” collected in Scott’s <title
                            level="m">Minstrelsy</title>, that is interpolated in <title level="m"

                <p>The movement back-and-forth between ballad and tale, and the interplay of both
                    within individual ballads or tales, is a striking feature of Hogg’s work. But as
                    noted at the start of this essay, his deployment of these two forms as versions
                    of one another, interchangeable, in a sense, is a product of the ballad-tale
                    conflation that marks the turn of the century more generally and that can be
                    linked back to Ossian, the ballad revival, and a general sense of anxiety about
                    the fate of old stories in new media. It is tempting to see in the examples
                    given from Hogg a progress of sorts: from the ballad (“Donald Macdonald”), to
                    the ballad and tale existing side by side (as in <title level="m">The Mountain
                        Bard</title> or <title level="j">The Spy</title>), and finally on to the
                    tale: “Basil Lee” or “The Mysterious Bride,” each one taking its starting point
                    from a ballad. That is perhaps a little too neat, though the progression is in
                    keeping with a larger cultural shift in these years, one that saw the tale first
                    confused with the ballad and then, for a time, rivaling it and even displacing
                    it as an object of collection (as in Earle’s <title level="m">Welsh
                        Legends</title> or the more famous example of the <title level="m"
                        >Children’s and Household Tales</title> of the Grimm brothers, first
                    published in 1812).<note place="foot">As Tim Killick notes, “[a]t some point
                        during the late 1810s, perhaps influenced by Scott’s shift from poetry to
                        the novel, the tale began to match the ballad as a subject worthy of study
                        by the antiquarian and the folk historian” (<title level="m">British Short
                            Fiction</title> 122).</note> Still, this is to emphasize the competition
                    between the forms, of which there was some, rather than the commonalities
                    between them, of which there were many. As Wordsworth might have said—or better,
                    as Albert B. Lord or Marshall McLuhan might have said—the more “philosophical”
                    distinction is not that between poetry and prose, or ballad and tale, but rather
                    between oral and written media.<note place="foot"> Wordsworth, Preface, 602.
                        Wordsworth actually says that the contradistinction is between poetry and
                        science. Lord’s book, <title level="m">The Singer of Tales</title> (2<hi
                            rendition="#sup">nd</hi> edition, Harvard UP, 2000), published in 1962,
                        examines the distinct manner in which oral epic singers compose and as such
                        contributes to discussions about Homer and his age that go back to the
                        eighteenth century. Marshall McLuhan described his 1962 book, <title
                            level="m">The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</title> (U
                        of Toronto P, 1962) as “complementary” to <title level="m">The Singer of
                            Tales</title>, for the ways it understands one moment of medium change
                        (oral to print) in terms of another, later one (from print to the “electric
                        age”). </note> Like the ballad, the tale kept a foot in both camps, holding
                    on to the idea of a genuine middle position—in prose—between orality and
                    literacy for at least as long as it took for the short story to reorient such
                    fiction along the lines of the novel and to make a new age of prose synonymous
                    with an age of print. </p>
