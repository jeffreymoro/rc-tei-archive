                <p rend="noCount">This essay briefly explores two developments that produced a
                    remarkable turn in the relationship between philosophy and literature between
                    the publication of Hume’s Treatise in 1740 and the heyday of the Romantic
                    familiar essay in the 1820s: the socialisation of experience by Scottish
                    Enlightenment thinkers and the impact of belletristic periodical culture upon
                    philosophical discourse. These changes were interconnected, jointly exhibiting a
                    swerve away from systematic epistemology and towards a form of essayism. As the
                    literary genre of trusting intersubjectivity <foreign>par excellence</foreign>,
                    the familiar essay had functioned as a vehicle for philosophical experiments in
                    communication since the days of <title level="m">The Spectator</title>. And yet,
                    Hume’s idea of an ‘easy,’ conversational philosophy grounded in social
                    correspondence increased the epistemological burden upon essayist beyond
                    anything envisaged by Addison or Steele. The Romantic familiar essay inherits
                    this burden while changing the stakes: thus, while the rewards of essaying for
                    Hume lay in the consolidation of consensus through philosophically indifferent
                    conversation, for Lamb and Hazlitt, they consisted in the promotion of a more
                    limited social solidarity through the production of modes of reading receptive
                    to the authenticity effects of singularity and transcendence.</p>

                    <p>The fate of empiricism in the period between middle of the
                        eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century (that is, between the
                        skeptical naturalism of David Hume and the inductivism of John Stuart Mill)
                        presents a curious episode that rarely attracts comment. Around a century
                        ago, Leslie Stephen and Élie Halévy depicted this period as merely a lull or
                        hiatus in British intellectual history, one in which the collective
                        attention of philosophers was directed towards thinking through the
                        consequences of the French Revolution. Halévy, for example, claimed that
                        between David Hartley and James Mill, English thought passed “through a
                        period of standstill” (434). Against this view, I will argue here that
                        English—or, more accurately, British thought—did not so much stand still as
                        switch paradigms, at least for a period. This change is evident in two
                        developments: the socialization of experience by Scottish Enlightenment
                        thinkers and the impact of belletristic periodical culture upon
                        philosophical discourse. These two factors were linked in ways that produced
                        a remarkable turn in the relationship between philosophy and literature
                        between the publication of Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise</title> in 1740
                        and the heyday of the Romantic familiar essay in the 1820s. Consequently, at
                        least part of what Halévy registered as an absence is, in effect, a swerve
                        away from systematic epistemology and towards a form of essayism, involving
                        a corresponding change in philosophical style and vocabulary. </p>
                    <p>In this essay, I explore these developments in more detail.
                        I briefly outline the ways in which, from the mid-eighteenth century
                        onwards, the idea of intersubjectivity emerged as a counterdiscourse to a
                        scientific empiricism based upon the epistemological binary of subject and
                        object and the correspondence theory of truth. Driven by a Scottish
                        insistence that society precedes rationality, and exemplified by Hume’s idea
                        of an “easy,” conversational philosophy, empiricism was regrounded in social
                        correspondence rather than epistemological correspondence; above all, it
                        based itself in the circulation of trust and the kinds of performances that
                        reinforced that trust. As economies of knowledge were increasingly linked to
                        the maintenance of certain (trustworthy) forms of social behavior, the
                        epistemological stakes were raised for communicative acts in general, and
                        for literary works in particular. </p>
                    <p>Since the days of <title level="m">The Spectator</title>, the
                        familiar essay had functioned as the literary genre of trusting
                        intersubjectivity <emph>par excellence</emph>, a vehicle for
                        philosophical experiments in communication. And yet, Hume’s treatment of
                        trust was more radical than that of his Augustan precursors, raising the
                        stakes for the essayistic performance. Only with Hume’s conventionalist
                        treatment of rationality did it become possible for empiricism to
                        accommodate the idea that truth <emph>presupposes</emph>
                        communication and that subjectivity itself is constructed relationally, via
                        interactions with others. In the final section of the essay, I will suggest
                        that, while Hume’s language game of proto-pragmatic essayism is continued in
                        the Romantic familiar essay, the <emph>strategy</emph> for
                        promoting intersubjectivity changed in the early nineteenth century. Where
                        the rewards of essaying for Hume lay in the consolidation of consensus
                        through philosophically indifferent conversation, for a Romantic essayist
                        such as Lamb, they consisted in the promotion of solidarity through the
                        production of transcendence and re-enchantment.</p></div>
                    
                    <div type="section">
                    <head>Hume’s “easy” empiricism</head>
                    <p>The idea that Hume promoted a form of empiricism based upon
                        trust and intersubjective consensus will inevitably strike many as
                        counterintuitive. Some might even claim that Hume was the <emph
                            >least</emph> trusting of all Enlightenment thinkers. It was Hume, after
                        all, who wrote in the <title level="m">Treatise of Human Nature</title> that
                        “[n]o weakness of human nature is more universal and conspicuous than what
                        we commonly call Credulity, or a too easy faith in the testimony of others .&#160;
                        .&#160;.” (112)—a remark that foreshadowed his celebrated attack on testimonial
                        evidence in the “Essay on Miracles.” Certainly, the skeptical part of Hume’s
                        thought is not in dispute. By arguing that all our ideas are either “<emph>copy'd from our impressions</emph>” (72) or made up of
                        simple ideas that are themselves derived from impressions, Hume picks at a
                        loose thread in Locke’s account of cognition. By the time he has finished
                        pulling at this thread, he has completely unravelled the idea of causation,
                        since “from the mere repetition of any past impression, even to infinity,
                        there will never arise any new original idea, such as that of a necessary
                        connexion .&#160;.&#160;.” (88). Nor does this unwinding of knowledge end with
                        causation. Ultimately, belief itself is shown to rest upon nothing more
                        substantial than sentiment: the “force and vivacity” communicated by an
                        impression to an idea, which “super-adds nothing to the idea, but only
                        changes our manner of conceiving it .&#160;.&#160;.” (101). Nonetheless, as Hume
                        concedes later in <title level="m">An Enquiry Concerning Human
                            Understanding</title>, one cannot live one’s life as a skeptic: “Nature
                        will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract
                        reasoning whatsoever” (41). </p>
                    <p>It is because of this caveat that Hume’s arguments in the <title level="m"
                            >Treatise</title> have carried an air of paradox for many readers. As
                        Kenneth Richman notes, “Hume appears to do the following: (a) endorse
                        beliefs in objects and causes, (b) hold that we should not endorse beliefs
                        that do not have appropriate grounding in our impressions .&#160;.&#160;. and (c) hold
                        that the beliefs in objects and causes do not have appropriate grounding of
                        our impressions” (3). One result of this paradox is a split between what
                        Richman calls “Old” Humeans and “New” Humeans. Commentators of the former
                        persuasion, such as Stephen and Halévy, tend to downplay position (a) and
                        emphasise (b) and (c). Accordingly, such “skeptical” readings of Hume tend
                        to see his impressionism as exhaustively phenomenalistic. According to this
                        view, Hume’s skeptical attack on representationalism and the
                        “correspondence” model of truth signals the bankruptcy of an abstracted,
                        atomistic view of experience and meaning. Since the work of Norman Kemp
                        Smith, however, there has been a tendency to downplay positions (b) and (c)
                        and foreground (a). Following this line of interpretation, “New” Humeans
                        such as Annette Baier, Peter Jones and Donald Livingston see Hume’s
                        impressionism as a maneuver whereby Hume exploded the hypostatized
                        vocabulary of ideas and impressions in order to create a new language of
                        experience based upon non-epistemological principles of feeling, habit and
                        custom. From this perspective, Hume’s adoption and deconstruction of the
                        language of “ideas” is the first step in a process of redescription that
                        restored the social, dialogical and experimental dimensions to
                        “experience.”</p>
                    <p>One virtue of such readings (though not one previously noted) is that they
                        highlight the significance of the subtitle of the <title level="m"

                        Reasoning into Moral Subjects.” Hume’s very specific use of the term
                        “experimental” here is easily overlooked. Since Locke, empirical philosophy
                        had entertained the idea of the mind as a forum for philosophical
                        experimentation. For Hume, however, the laboratory for empirical experiment
                        was not the mind as Locke’s <foreign>camera obscura</foreign> of
                        abstracted consciousness, but something closer to mind <emph>in
                            society</emph>. He makes this point quite explicitly in his Introduction
                        to the <title level="m">Treatise</title> when he cautions the reader that
                        “[w]e must .&#160;.&#160;. glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious
                        observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common course
                        of the world, by men’s behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their
                        pleasures” (xix). In this way, Hume effected a transition from a model of
                        thought based upon pure induction and <title level="m">objectivity</title>
                        (i.e. upon an epistemological binary of subject / object) to one that was
                        based upon sentiment and <title level="m">intersubjectivity</title>. By
                        downgrading “correspondence” theories of truth and meaning, which generally
                        viewed experience as a form of representation, he abandoned the Lockean
                        image of punctual subjectivity: that is, one constituted by a manifold of
                        atomized experiences (ideas and impressions), and underwritten by a
                        providential rationality. In its place, Hume developed a model of
                        “experience” based in trial and experiment within a constitutive framework
                        of social custom, sentiment, and most importantly, trust.<note place="foot">
                                    Significantly, until the eighteenth century, the words
                                    ‘experience” and “experiment” are so closely associated that
                                    they are used more or less synonymously to mean the act of
                                    practical, tentative trial. Johnson’s <title level="m"
                                        >Dictionary</title> testifies to this continued intimacy,
                                    defining the noun “experience” as “1. Practice; frequent trial”
                                    and “2. Knowledge gained by trial and practice.” The latter
                                    notion of experience as <emph>practice</emph> rather
                                    than as <emph>phenomena</emph> was still current at
                                    the time and is in turn associated with a heightened awareness
                                    of the epistemic role of fictions in discourse. Once
                                    epistemological relations are redescribed in terms of social
                                    relationships, the most pressing questions that arise relate to
                                    the status of the norms and bonds that regulate the community of
                                    knowledge. This ultimately produces a concern with what might be
                                    considered as the social <foreign>a priori</foreign> of
                                    knowledge: rational accommodation, trust and testimony.
                                </note> Trust became vital to Hume’s thought precisely
                        because his skeptical approach left the human intellect with no other means
                        of support than the <emph>sentiment</emph> of belief, the <emph>manner</emph> in which the object is conceived. As Miriam
                        Solomon argues, the lesson Hume derives from skepticism is that “knowledge
                        requires more than reason and experience, not that knowledge is impossible”
                        (52). For Hume, radical skepticism led to social empiricism. </p>

                    <head>The familiar essay as philosophical
                            performance</head>
                    <p>Thanks to Hume then, literary form became a philosophical
                        issue. Interest in the regulation of trust by means of literary performances
                        that consolidated social and epistemological norms engendered, in turn, a
                        concern with the performative dimension of language as well as with the
                        status and function of philosophical writing. In particular, the essay, with
                        its amenability to tentative, unmethodical improvisation and friendly
                        conversation, appeared to fit an image of reason based on the very ideas of
                        custom, habit and sentiment presented in Hume’s picture of a decenterd,
                        constitutive intersubjectivity. Tellingly, as Hume abandoned
                        representational empiricism in favour of “easy” empiricism, he drew away
                        from the systematic treatise and moved towards the familiar essay as <emph>the</emph> genre of philosophy. </p>
                    <p>To an extent, Hume was walking a well-trodden path. Since the days of <title
                            level="j">The Spectator</title> and <title level="j">The Tatler</title>,
                        the periodical essay had functioned as both medium and model for the open,
                        egalitarian and polite discursiveness of the public sphere. Addison and
                        Steele had exploited the essay’s potential to move amphibiously across
                        boundaries, between philosophical and literary modes of expression, as well
                        as between academic and informal writing. Most notably, in <title level="j"
                            >The Spectator</title> no. 10, Addison declared his intention to emulate
                        Socrates, who “brought Philosophy down from Heaven, to inhabit among Men,”
                        by bringing “Philosophy out of Closets and Libraries, Schools and Colleges,
                        to dwell in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea-tables, and in Coffee-houses” (44).
                        In this way, essaying as an activity eschewed the quest for certainty in
                        order to foster an idea of “experience” very close to that outlined in the
                        Introduction to Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise</title>: an experimental
                        activity in which the mind came to reshape itself through its engagement
                        with human life in “the common course of the world.”</p>
                    <p>And yet, there is a vital difference between the essayism
                        of Hume and that of Addison. For Addison, the Lockean subject remained
                        intellectually punctual and intact. Consequently, despite his claim that the
                        experimentalism of the familiar essay provided philosophy with a pathway
                        from the cloisters of learning into the bright thoroughfare of the public
                        sphere, Addison did not consider the possibility that the very customs,
                        habits and conventions depicted in the pages of <title level="j">The
                            Tatler</title> and <title level="m">The Spectator</title> might themselves be
                        epistemologically constitutive. The correspondence between “trust” and
                        “truth” ran in one direction only: the former could, at most, only ever
                        count as limited evidence for the latter. For Hume, however, truth <emph>itself</emph> could not be separated from “common life and
                        Conversation.” Consequently, what one finds in the essays of Hume is a more
                        radical socialization of empiricism in the face of an intolerable but
                        incorrigible epistemological skepticism. By replacing Locke’s providential,
                        private, and pictorial conception of human reason with a conventional,
                        public, and grammatical one, Hume implied that the truth of any empirical
                        statement ultimately depended upon the <emph>manner</emph> of its
                        performance and upon the “sentiment” attached to its conception. In
                        foregrounding the performative function of philosophical language, Hume
                        dramatically raised the stakes for the essayist as stylist. Put simply,
                        manner became everything.</p>
                    <p>It is this consciousness of the fundamentally <emph>performative</emph> nature of the philosophical writer’s
                        task that distinguishes mid-century essayists such as Hume and Johnson from
                        their Augustan predecessors. After Hume, the problem of empiricism’s
                        relation to public discourse was no longer simply one of how philosophical
                        thoughts might be curated and transmitted to the reading public, it was also
                        one of how an empirical concept of “experience” might itself be shaped by
                        the conventions and practices of communication. In effect, Hume’s insistence
                        that conversation forms a constitutive part of experience radicalised
                        Addison’s project to socialize philosophy by placing intersubjectivity at
                        the very core of human thought: while Addison and Steele brought philosophy
                        to the “coffee-house,” Hume endeavoured to bring the “coffee-house” to
                        philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, Hume’s own essays attempted to police polite
                        culture through performances of moderate skepticism. He developed an “easy,”
                        conversable empiricism that endeavored to reinforce solidarity rather than
                        demonstrate logical certainty. And yet, the very need to “reinforce” trust
                        indicated that trust had its limits. Hume’s technique as a writer
                        incorporated the thought that these limits are not defined rationally, but
                        through human second nature: through emotion, custom, and habit. In this
                        respect, Hume is the disciple of Cicero rather than Newton, deploying
                        measured prose that asserts epistemic authority through its rhetoric of
                        reasonableness and moderation, through its commanding <emph
                            >exhibition</emph> of communicability. Nowhere is this more evident than
                        in the exemplary act of polite self-fashioning exhibited by his suitably
                        brief autobiographical essay, “My Own Life,” in which the reader encounters
                        the persona of the philosophically indifferent man of letters: <quote>
                    To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or
                        rather was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself,
                        which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of
                        mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful
                        humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of
                        great moderation in all my passions. (<title level="m">Essays</title> xl)</quote>
                    Here, the cardinal virtues of Hume’s Academic skepticism,
                        of “mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and
                        cheerful humour,” are revealed to be those of the author himself. Above all,
                        the “moderation” of the philosopher’s passions, which is itself reflected in
                        the modesty of the self-representation Hume offers, typifies the
                        philosophical attribute of <foreign>ataraxia</foreign> (detachment)
                        required to live a civilized and enlightened life without epistemic grounds
                        or foundations. This philosophical moderation lay at the heart of Hume’s
                        essayism, insofar as the essay genre provided him with a literary analogue
                        for the conversable world and an antidote to the philosophical enthusiasm of
                        systematic, rationalist philosophy. In this way, Hume used the familiar
                        discourse of the essay to reposition epistemology, moving it away from what
                        he saw as the ineffectual domains of truth and reason and into the active
                        territory of public discourse, custom, and opinion. By doing so, he
                        relocated the philosophical authority of the man of letters from the
                        foundations of truth to the circulation of trust.</p>
                    <p>This meant that the essayist took on the role of a diplomat
                        between the worlds of learning and polite conversation, or as Hume puts it
                        in his unpublished essay “Of Essay-Writing,” as “a Kind of Resident or
                        Ambassador from the Dominions of Learning to those of Conversation .&#160;.&#160;
                        .”:

                    Once again, as Hume makes clear in this passage, experience
                        cannot be separated from “common life and Conversation.” The essayist,
                        unlike the solitary scholar, adapts the “the higher and more difficult
                        Operations of the Mind” to “the easier and more gentle Exercises of the
                        Understanding” (<title level="m">Essays</title> 533) not because (or not
                        solely because) this helps him to communicate truth, but because it is <emph>only</emph> in such communication that truth ultimately

                            Romantic familiar essay.</head>
                    <p>What does the familiar essay’s shifting epistemological
                        significance in the eighteenth century tell us about the development of the
                        genre in the early nineteenth century? Essayists such as Lamb and Hazlitt
                        inherited from Hume and Johnson a readiness to draw upon the performative
                        resources of the familiar essay in order to imagine a shared community of
                        opinion and belief. What distinguishes Romantic essayists from their
                        predecessors, however, is the issue of what was at <emph
                            >stake</emph> in the performance of essaying. For the latter, the language
                        game engaged by the familiar essay necessitated that certain normative
                        structures were <emph>presupposed</emph>. For Hume in particular,
                        such structures were determined by custom and reinforced by the exhibition
                        of courteous manners. In such cases, it was assumed that the reader could
                        not fully appreciate the performance of the author without already sharing a
                        great deal of their “common” background of beliefs. In other words, what was
                        epistemologically at stake for the Neoclassical familiar essayist was the
                        status of a truth whose verifiability is fundamentally a practical and
                        intersubjective affair.</p>
                    <p>For the essayist of the early nineteenth century, however,
                        the fiction of familiarity was beginning to wear thin. Indeed, perceptions
                        of what was at stake in the literary performance of the essay had already
                        begun to shift significantly by the end of the eighteenth century. Most
                        notably, the political upheavals of the 1790s made the consolidation of
                        imagined solidarity envisaged by Hume appear more nakedly politicized,
                        recast by Burke as a call for national unity around feelings of familial
                        partiality and prejudice. Moreover, the essayist now wrote for a marketplace
                        that had expanded and diversified: as Jon Klancher and William St. Clair
                        have documented, patronage and subscription had given way to contracts with
                        booksellers, the periodical essay had been replaced by the magazine and the
                        newspaper, and an increasingly productive printing press was undergoing its
                        industrial revolution. This environment presented the essayist with new
                        challenges: it was difficult to consolidate ways of understanding the world
                        when the common ground of good sense and precedent presupposed by Hume and
                        Johnson had fragmented, polarized, or been discredited. Hume’s Ciceronian
                        idea of literature as the domain of polite letters, courtly virtues and easy
                        philosophizing was overtaken by the Romantic notion of literature as, in
                        Wordsworth’s phrase, “the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge .&#160;.&#160;.”
                        (141). As social harmonies were exchanged for transcendental sublimities,
                        the Romantic enactment of familiar conversation sought to establish a
                        different relationship with readers, one based in the idealized grounds of
                        singularity and enchantment. </p>
                    <p>Consequently, the Romantic essayist’s primary task became
                        one of establishing social and epistemological norms through the exercise of
                        imaginative power. As writers sought new grounds for literary “truth,” the
                        experimental maintenance and consolidation of intersubjective consensus were
                        replaced by the experimental <emph>production</emph> and
                        exploration of new intellectual territory. This shift is reflected in the
                        changing persona of the essayist. While the individual figured in the prose
                        identity of Hume presupposed an intersubjective conception of the speaking
                        subject—one whose unity is held together by pragmatic, rather than by
                        metaphysical, principles—in philosophical Romanticism, the unification of
                        style and substance was underpinned by an <emph>ideal</emph>
                        presence. Rather than seeking to reinforce consensuality, the subject
                        invoked by the Romantic familiar essay was one who searches, however
                        unsuccessfully, for transcendental authentication. The persona of Lamb’s
                        essayist, for instance, is constructed around the ironic and partial
                        recuperation of a lost wholeness, often figured as a borderline, twilight
                        territory of enchanted consciousness. “Imperfect Sympathies,” with its digs
                        at the moral philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment, exemplifies this
                        condition while explicitly opposing it to a “Scottish” tradition of
                        intellectualized intersubjectivity:
                    <quote>I can look with no indifferent eye upon things or persons.
                        .&#160;.&#160;. I am, in plainer words, a bundle of prejudices.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. There is an
                        order of imperfect intellects (under which mine must be content to rank)
                        which in its constitution is essentially anti-Caledonian. The owners of the
                        sort of faculties I allude to, have minds rather suggestive than
                        comprehensive. They have no pretences to much clearness or precision in
                        their ideas, or in their manner of expressing them. Their intellectual
                        wardrobe (to confess freely) has few whole pieces in it. They are content
                        with fragments and scattered pieces of Truth.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The light that lights
                        them is not steady and polar, but mutable and shifting: waxing, and again
                        waning.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. They are no systematizers, and would but err more by
                        attempting it. (58–59) </quote>
                    Whether or not Lamb had Hume in mind as his model of the
                        “Caledonian” intellect, the “systematizer” label is one that the latter
                        would have rejected, belying as it does his concern with folding the
                        <foreign>episteme </foreign>of scientific knowledge
                        into the <foreign>doxa</foreign> of social
                        communication. Indeed, for Hume, as long as the credit supply of trust
                        underpinning intersubjective consensus could be maintained, the metaphysical
                        status of human belief need not be a pressing concern, still less one that
                        called for systematization. The task of the essayist as an epistemological
                        diplomat was to keep conversation going, and above all to keep such
                        conversation polite and civilized. In “Imperfect Sympathies,” however,
                        epistemological doubt itself becomes aestheticized into an ideal presence
                        that can only be approached through imagination. Instead of seeking to
                        consolidate assumed intersubjective consensus <foreign>à la</foreign>
                        the “Caledonian” constitution, Lamb’s “Elia” essays endeavor to <emph>produce</emph> affective connections through a kind of
                        exemplary performance of individuality. Elia offers to engage his reader in
                        a language game based upon the celebration of whim, prejudice and
                        singularity. The state of mind required for this game is precisely what the
                        “brain of a true Caledonian” lacks, i.e., “misgivings, half-intuitions,
                        semi-consciousnesses, partial illuminations, dim instincts, embryo
                        conceptions.” In this way, the aporia that caused Hume to abandon
                        epistemology altogether is reified in Lamb as a borderline territory of
                        re-enchantment: what Elia refers to as “[t]he twilight of dubiety” (60).
                        Whereas in Hume the protean nature of the familiar essay is utilized in the
                        service of dialogue, in Lamb the essay’s shapelessness is <emph
                            >itself</emph> aestheticized, offering to charm the reader rather than
                        draw them into an imaginary conversation. Rather than being dedicated to the
                        maintenance of everyday experience in the common course of the world, the
                        essay’s liminality is redirected towards the recovery and transcendence of
                        the ordinary through the thoroughly extraordinary performance of the
                        essayist. </p>
                    <p>The differences between the two essayists should not be
                        overstated. Like Hume, Lamb uses the conversational character of the
                        familiar essay in order to conduct experiments in trust with his readers.
                        What the persona of Elia offers in return for such trust, however, is not so
                        much reassuring sociability as the possibility of the reader’s
                        re-enchantment with the world. Indeed, in his essay “The Old Margate Hoy”
                        (1823), Elia introduces a figure who uncannily resembles the essayist
                        himself. Recounting a sea trip upon the eponymous vessel during a miserable
                        holiday to the south coast of England, Lamb describes one of his fellow
                        passengers as “the greatest liar I had met with then, or since,” one who
                        “plunged at once into the depths of your credulity.” This “Spanish
                        complexioned young man” tells tall tales of how he had served as
                        aide-de-camp to a Persian prince, seen a phoenix in Egypt and sailed through
                        the legs of the Colossus at Rhode. And yet, rather than inciting irritated
                        incredulity, these stories offer a welcome respite from the tedium of the
                        boat trip. More specifically, Elia recounts, “[h]is dreaming fancies had
                        transported us beyond the ‘ignorant present.’” Like the reader, the
                        passengers on the boat are placed temporarily “in a new world, with
                        everything unfamiliar about us, and the time and place disposed us to the
                        reception of any prodigious marvel whatsoever” (178–79). In a similar way,
                        Lamb’s method as an essayist is to play a delicate game with the trust of
                        his reader. Like the liar that his very name evokes, “Elia” dives straight
                        into his reader’s confidence. By doing so, however, he does not forfeit
                        trust: in the essay, as on the deck of the boat, there is an implicit
                        recognition that the normal rules of social intercourse are suspended. </p>
                    <p>One might take this further, and suggest that the familiar
                        essay as a genre internalizes and experiments with the thought that such a
                        “leap of faith,” or act of trust is fundamental to all human communication,
                        and not just in the conspicuously groundless conditions of a boat
                        expedition, where the subject is all at sea. Hume’s essays in “easy”
                        empiricism and Lamb’s “Old Margate Hoy” reject the idea that language is a
                        medium for expressing what we have already thought. In reality, they
                        suggest, we never get to construct our thoughts in a kind of empirical dry
                        dock; instead, like the essayist, we must first dive into conversation and
                        build our vessel out of port. For Hume, the essayist’s task is to steady
                        this vessel, to keep it afloat through the polite performance of certain
                        virtues and manners. Lamb’s Elia, on the other hand, is more concerned with
                        cultivating a sense of wonder in the spontaneity of the dialogue that
                        floated thought in the first place, at the very possibility of a shared
                        experience, amid surmises and semi-consciousness, that might count as
                        “truth.” Despite their many differences, however, the writings of Hume and
                        Lamb share an awareness of the way that the performance of the familiar
                        essayist’s experiments can promote or imperil the communication upon which
                        social knowledge depends. </p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>It follows from the foregoing that the title of Lamb’s
                        self-consciously unsympathetic essay should be treated with caution. Lamb’s
                        essayism does not signal a radical departure from the language of trust and
                        intersubjectivity developed by Hume and the thinkers of the Scottish
                        Enlightenment, an edging out of social empiricism by Romantic idealism.
                        Instead, what both Hume and Lamb’s prose writings exhibit is a profound
                        ambivalence towards systematic philosophy itself. It is this ambivalence
                        that lends the familiar essay in this period its shape and its fundamental
                        purpose, creating a space in which formal understanding, aesthetic
                        appreciation and social communication overlapped. Seen from this
                        perspective, the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Hume and
                        the conversational, ironic, and philosophy-deflating Lamb had a surprising
                        amount in common, not least in the ways that both defied
                        contemporary philosophical taxonomies. </p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, in its idealization of incompleteness, Lamb’s
                        sympathetically unsympathetic broadside against philosophy approximates a
                        concept of aesthetic irony in ways that Hume’s does not. At the heart of
                        this irony, as formulated two decades earlier in the Romanticism of the Jena
                        circle, is transcendental philosophy’s concern with thought’s presupposition
                        of the incomprehensible. This concern is expressed most distinctly by
                        Friedrich Schlegel’s warning, in his essay “On Incomprehensibility,” against
                        rationalism:
                    <quote>Yes, even man’s most precious possession, his own inner
                        happiness, depends in the last analysis, as anybody can easily verify, on
                        some such point of strength that must be left in the dark, but that
                        nonetheless shores up and supports the whole burden and would crumble the
                        moment you subjected it to rational analysis. Verily, it would fare badly
                        for you if, as you demand, the whole world were ever to become fully
                        comprehensible in earnest. (Simpson 185) </quote>
                    In a similar way, the twilight half-knowledge contained in
                        the signature gesture of Lamb’s familiar essay is ultimately underwritten by
                        the aestheticization of the incomprehensible, by what Philippe
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy have described as the “Literary
                        Absolute,” a transcendentally postulated but unattainable unification of
                        subject and object, form and content. In theoretical terms, this entailed
                        the idea that literature <foreign>qua</foreign> “Literature” might, as
                        pure “generativity,” compensate for, or even redeem philosophy’s failure to
                        complete itself by figuring the absolute <emph
                        >productively</emph>. In this way, as they put it, “[R]omantic thought
                        involves not only the absolute of literature, but literature as the
                        absolute. Romanticism is the inauguration of the <emph>literary
                            absolute</emph>” (12). Such a position, however, as Schlegel himself
                        acknowledged, involved setting out from (while by no means remaining in) a
                        fundamentally Kantian understanding of the dependence of phenomenal
                        experience upon strictly noumenal modes of thought. </p>
                    <p>The catch here, of course, is that in Lamb’s writing (as in
                        that of most of his British Romantic contemporaries), the labors and rewards
                        of visionary imagination are invoked in the absence of transcendental
                        apparatuses and thus a fully theorized account of the work of art itself as
                        autotelic. Consequently, while <emph>transcendence</emph> of
                        empirical, quotidian reality (Elia’s “ignorant present”) remains tacitly
                        embedded in his writing as a proleptic ideal, the <emph
                            >transcendental</emph> conditions of this goal remain untheorized. In this
                        way, Lamb’s essays may be said to be both culturally and philosophically liminal:
                        not only do they occupy an indeterminate status between “high” and “low”
                        literature, they also offer an image of the self that brings together an
                        inherited discourse of sociability and pragmatic intersubjectivity with a
                        transcendentally idealist conception of aesthetic capability that itself
                        remains incomplete. Thus, while for Hume and his Neoclassical literary
                        milieu the problem of writing the familiar essay was one of how to ground
                        authority and consolidate knowledge in the “conversable” world in the
                        absence of apodictic certainties, the challenge facing Lamb and his
                        contemporaries was that of how to privilege the discursive space of the
                        essay as ideal and aesthetic <emph>without</emph> collapsing its
                        numinous aura of enchantment into the bathos of everyday exchange.</p>
