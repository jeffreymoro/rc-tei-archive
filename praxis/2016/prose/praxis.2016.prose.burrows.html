            <p class="noCount">"The Privatization of Public Life: Free Direct Discourse in <em>Persuasion</em>" argues for the importance of other narrative techniques beyond free indirect discourse
               in Jane Austen’s work, such the related but in many ways opposed form, free direct
               discourse. Paying particular attention to such techniques, I contend, allows us to
               see the ways in which public discourse in a novel such as <em>Persuasion</em> is repeatedly converted into a medium for private feeling. The result is a strangely
               fractured view of public life, in which characters fail to share even something as
               fundamental as time itself.</p>

               <p>“With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body’s feelings;
                  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body’s destiny” (Austen, <em>Emma</em> 339). Emma Woodhouse’s withering self-indictment offers a exemplary instance of free
                  indirect discourse, so exemplary indeed that it is tempting to read her judgment as
                  extending to its co-speaker, the narrator of <em>Emma</em>, who really is privy to all secrets, arranger of all destinies. Suspicion of the
                  authority granted by free indirect discourse to narrative, and in particular to Jane
                  Austen, was widespread in the 1980s and 1990s, when critics saw it as the means by
                  which, in D. A. Miller’s words, “the narration simultaneously subverts [the characters’]
                  authority and secures its own” (<em>The Novel and the Police</em> 25). Casey Finch and Peter Bowen, in an influential account of <em>Emma</em>, followed Miller’s lead, contending that free indirect discourse functions as a form
                  of “surveillance” (3), incessantly “mak[ing] public the private thoughts of characters”
                  (5). Yet since, needless to say, we do not inhabit the same world as that occupied
                  by the characters we read about, it is far from clear how their thoughts can be described
                  as being made public. If novels can be said to involve the notion of publicity this
                  surely belongs exclusively to the diegetic world, which often feels like much more
                  of a panopticon than the novels themselves: few acts or remarks in the society Austen
                  depicts go unnoticed, and without the protection of money or marriage individuals
                  are pitifully vulnerable to the judgments of others.</p>
               <p>This essay argues against the idea that free indirect discourse, at least in Austen’s
                  hands, renders the realist novel a “stylistic Panopticon” (99) to quote from Franco
                  Moretti’s recent study of the bourgeoisie. To characterize the technique as a means
                  of making public what should ideally remain private misunderstands the relation between
                  private and public within the novels themselves. For public and private life in Austen’s
                  fiction are less easily opposed than the surveillance model of criticism suggests.
                  Not only do Austen’s characters repeatedly discover what it is they think and want
                  by seeing these thoughts and desires manifested by others, her protagonists are less
                  on display in public than we might imagine, since they may be said to be under the
                  protection of the narrative itself. Austen’s unfinished manuscript <em>The Watsons</em> gives a sense of how cruel her world looks shorn of what Miller describes as the
                  “anonymous, impersonal, universal” (<em>Jane Austen</em> 27) voice of free indirect discourse; with no authorial consciousness to echo her
                  thoughts, no matter how ironically, the text’s unmarried heroine feels terrifyingly
                  exposed. The desire to protect her characters does not, however, explain Austen’s
                  fascination with free indirect discourse. Rather, this fascination is a result, I
                  will be contending, of a recognition that the structure of free indirect discourse,
                  in which one voice speaks through or with another, shapes relations within the society
                  upon which she reports. Austen’s popularization of the technique, that is, represents
                  a formalization of a social practice. My focus will be on the Austen novel most indebted
                  to free indirect discourse, <em>Persuasion</em>, whose heroine’s thoughts are expressed almost exclusively in the third person. The
                  distance this imposes between Anne Elliot and a world which refuses to acknowledge
                  her extends to every aspect of that world, inverting the relationship between public
                  and private. So extensive is this reorientation that it ends up reordering relations
                  even more primary—those involving time itself, a reordering which narrative is peculiarly
                  well equipped to document.</p>
               <p>According to Frances Ferguson, free indirect discourse represents “the novel’s one
                  and only formal contribution to literature” (159). Leaving aside the truth of this
                  claim, it is safe to say that free indirect discourse is limited <em>to</em> literature; for all that it mimics the structure of the social world depicted in
                  Austen’s novels, the practice itself can only exist in the world of the novel. Austen’s
                  development of the technique would thus seem to disqualify her work from consideration
                  in a volume devoted to Romantic prose, a form Yoon Sun Lee’s introduction defines
                  as inseparable from an “idea of the spoken.” Yet if free indirect discourse belongs
                  to the domain of unspoken speech, the related device I examine in this essay, free
                  <em>direct</em> discourse, aligns Austen’s work much closer with the genre of Romantic prose. In
                  free direct discourse, a rare and critically neglected form, utterances go unattributed,
                  leaving open the possibility that they have been said by more than one speaker. Austen’s
                  deployment of the technique—a carryover from the eighteenth century novel’s looser
                  sense of the boundaries between direct and indirect speech—is motivated in part by
                  her fascination with the ways speech brings communities into being, a question explored
                  in relation to philosophical discourse in Timothy Milnes’ essay for this volume, “Trusting
                  Experiments.” I borrow the term, appropriately enough, from a reading of <em>Persuasion</em>. But unlike the author of that account, Norman Page, who characterizes free direct
                  discourse as a means of summarizing lengthy conversations “without the loss of immediacy”
                  (“Categories” 735), I understand the device as generated by a unusual structural component
                  of the novel. <em>Persuasion</em> narrates the renewal after eight years of the romance between Anne Elliot and Captain
                  Wentworth in the face not just of social barriers but of narrative ones too: the novel
                  seemingly goes out of its way to bar its protagonists from speaking directly to one
                  another. The result is a courtship conducted almost exclusively through the expressions,
                  opinions, and judgments of others. Kept apart by their friends and family, Anne and
                  Wentworth are able to renew relations only by turning public life into a medium for
                  private feelings. Their second courtship, in other words, inverts the structure of
                  free indirect discourse.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Whereas free indirect discourse is spoken by both narrator and character, free direct
                     discourse is spoken by more than one character. The technique is thus concerned less
                     with consciousness than with social interaction, with public rather than private life.
                     Little penetration is required to discern who in <em>Emma</em> remarks on “‘the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston’”
                     (17) or the identity of the “some” who wonder why gruel is not “taken every evening
                     by every body” (85). In not attributing these remarks to a specific speaker at a specific
                     moment, Austen not only underscores the recognizability and transferability of speech,
                     she describes a society in which almost every character speaks for, through, or on
                     behalf of another. Mr. Woodhouse is undoubtedly the source of the comment about the
                     gruel, but his success in convincing his daughter Isabella to join him in eating it
                     allows him to disappear into the plural subject “some.” The maneuver is characteristic.
                     Mr. Woodhouse, who constantly validates his hypochondria by referring his own opinions
                     to his doctor, happily voices the opinions of his younger daughter Emma, oblivious
                     to her actual views. But then Austen’s heroine repeatedly speaks on behalf of her
                     friend Harriet, dictating to her who she should and should not marry.

                     </div> Harriet is little more than a surrogate for Emma, which makes it almost inevitable
                     that the one desire Emma’s friend gives voice to without prompting—her love for Mr.
                     Knightley—should be “the means whereby [Emma] . . . comes to acknowledge her own”
                     (Miller, <em>Narrative</em> 12). This vicarious economy extends not just to relations between characters but to
                     the subplot of the novel, the love affair between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill:
                     one a surrogate daughter, the other a surrogate son. Their decision to keep their
                     love secret leads to Frank ventriloquizing his own feelings—his fulsome praise for
                     the unknown person who sends Jane a piano is eventually revealed as self-directed—and
                     Emma ventriloquizing Jane’s—she imagines a scenario in which Jane falls in love by
                     proxy.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the end, the story told in <em>Emma</em> is of characters finding their own voice: Frank admits his love for Jane; Mr. Knightley
                     proposes to Emma; Harriet accepts the man she actually loves, Robert Martin. Things
                     are quite different in <em>Persuasion</em>. Rather than characters recognizing their desire only when expressed by another,
                     as in <em>Emma</em>, they depend on others to articulate feelings that would otherwise not be able to
                     find a voice; characters know what they want, but they cannot say what they want.
                     As Miller’s reading of the novel details, the reason Anne’s feelings are inexpressible
                     is because of her social status: a spinster lacks the social standing to give voice
                     to her desires. The result is a use of free indirect discourse so extensive some critics
                     have characterized <em>Persuasion</em> as a radical departure from Austen’s other novels.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In The Economy of Character Deidre Lynch offers a particularly helpful discussion
                              of the workings of free indirect discourse in Persuasion.</span></div>
                     </div> The novel features a number of scenes in which Anne refers the expressed thoughts
                     and feelings of others to her own situation, as if she and the actual speaker were
                     the twinned subjects of a first-person utterance. When Louisa Musgrove expresses to
                     Wentworth her mistaken belief that Lady Russell “persuaded Anne to refuse” (80) Louisa’s
                     brother Charles, before going on to dismiss the idea that she herself would be “so
                     easily persuaded” (81), her words are also heard by Anne, hidden behind a hedgerow.
                     The extraneous repetition of the term persuasion signals the work of delegation being
                     performed here. In distinguishing her own feelings from ones Anne never possessed
                     (Austen’s heroine never wanted to marry Charles) Louisa ventriloquizes feelings Anne
                     has since come to possess (regret at having been persuaded by Lady Russell not to
                     marry Wentworth). No wonder the listening Anne “could imagine what Louisa was feeling”
                     (81), since what Louisa is feeling is exactly what Anne is feeling.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The odd thing about the conversation Anne overhears is that Louisa, despite being
                  mistaken about Anne’s feelings for Charles and ignorant of Anne’s feelings for Wentworth,
                  ends up speaking for Anne anyway, albeit without knowing this. Anne’s private feelings
                  are made public, yet not by her, and not in a manner recognizable to anyone else,
                  even the subject of those feelings. This leads to a strange situation which in many
                  ways is the opposite of the ones depicted in <em>Emma</em>: rather than discovering her feelings by hearing them voiced by another, Anne has
                  to indulge these feelings vicariously, since she has no-one to share, sympathize,
                  or even suspect her love for Wentworth. The delight Louisa and her sister Henrietta
                  take in Wentworth’s stories of life at sea thus becomes for Anne, however painfully,
                  the only means in which her own memories of hearing these tales could possibly find
                  expression outside of her own thoughts: “their surprise at his accounts . . . drew
                  from him some pleasant ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too
                  had been ignorant” (60). Diegetic space is converted into the space of Anne’s consciousness;
                  private life given public form, yet Anne (and the reader) is the only public in a
                  position to recognize this. The conversations between Wentworth, Louisa, and Henrietta
                  are mirror image of earlier ones between Wentworth Anne, yet because the narrator
                  never describes this courtship—and because no character ever acknowledges it—they
                  function as the novel’s only depiction of it. Anne and Wentworth’s second engagement
                  functions, we might say, as a kind of proxy for the first. It seems no more than fitting
                  then that this engagement should follow René Girard’s model of mediated desire so
                  closely: Wentworth, observing the interested look Anne’s cousin Mr. Elliot casts on
                  her at Lyme, “gave her a momentary glance . . . which seemed to say, ‘That man is
                  struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again’”
                  (97). Having been triggered by a third person, Wentworth’s feelings, appropriately
                  enough, are only expressible within it. Castigating his friend Captain Benwick for
                  having fallen in love with Louisa less than a year after the death of an adored wife,
                  Wentworth counsels Anne that “A man does not recover from such a devotion . . . He
                  ought not; he does not” (173). Speaking of his friend provides Wentworth with the
                  opportunity to speak about himself, as if he were barred from directly expressing
                  his feelings.</p>
               <p>Anne and Wentworth’s eventual reconciliation follows the same pattern, offering a
                  particularly literal instance of triangulated desire, in which an oblivious third
                  speaker acts as a medium for Anne’s feelings in the presence of Wentworth. Faced with
                  the prospect of having to go to a dinner in honor of Mr. Elliot, Charles Musgrove
                  peevishly remarks “What is Mr. Elliot to me?” “The careless expression,” Austen’s
                  narrator asserts, “was life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention,
                  looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring
                  eyes from Charles to herself” (210). Both Anne and Wentworth, in the strangest of
                  substitutions, refer the question to Anne rather than to Charles: ‘what is Mr. Elliot
                  to me?’ Anne wants Wentworth to imagine her having said, dismissively; ‘what <em>is</em> Mr. Elliot to you?’ Wentworth wants Anne to imagine him having said, anxiously. Anne
                  is given an opportunity to answer this question the next day, again by proxy. This
                  time the speaker is Mrs. Croft, arguing in favor of young people marrying quickly
                  no matter their financial situation; Anne, we are told, “felt [the conversation’s]
                  application to herself” (217). Austen’s heroine promptly enters into a passionate
                  defense of women’s constancy in a conversation with a naval officer, speaking so as
                  to be overheard by Wentworth. Inspired by Anne’s words, Wentworth abandons the letter
                  he is writing and starts composing one to Anne instead, which she reads moments later.
                  Wentworth’s decision to express himself in a letter ensures that the climatic moment
                  of the novel, the moment in which the two lovers express their renewed feelings for
                  one another, takes place out of the direct gaze of reader and narrator: “they exchanged
                  again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything”
                  (225).</p>
               <p>That the two lovers’ vows should remain unheard by the reader is fitting, since their
                  relationship has been wrapped in silence from the very beginning. Anne’s father and
                  her sister Elizabeth not only refuse to recognize Wentworth socially, they appear
                  to have completely forgotten his existence. The first conversation in the novel concerns
                  a former neighbor of Sir Walter whose name neither he nor Elizabeth nor their lawyer
                  Mr. Shepherd can remember until prompted by Anne: “Wentworth was the very name! Mr.
                  Wentworth was the very man” (24). The man in question turns out not to be Anne’s old
                  lover but his brother, a former neighbor of the Elliots, though Sir Walter observes
                  that “Mr. Wentworth was nobody, I remember” (24). The sliding of Captain Wentworth’s
                  identity under that of the ‘nobody’ who is his brother continues through the opening
                  chapters of the novel, in which Anne repeatedly mistakes which Wentworth brother is
                  being discussed. Austen seems to want to affirm Sir Walter’s arch observation that
                  “a Mr. (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of explanation”
                  (24–25). Indeed the novel goes out of its way to provide Wentworth with just such
                  a note, for when Anne reflects that soon “<em>he</em>, perhaps, may be walking here” (25), the next chapter opens by pedantically noting
                  “<em>He</em> was not Mr. Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however suspicious appearances
                  may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother” (26).</p>
               <p>What motive could Austen have for repeatedly confusing the hero of her novel with
                  a man who never actually appears in it? The fussiness of Austen’s syntax—“<em>He</em> was not”—represents a curiously literal acknowledgement of the ambiguity of the third
                  person, which, because it “does not specifically designate anything or anyone . . .
                  can take any subject whatsoever or no subject” (Benveniste 199). The hesitation with
                  which the novel introduces Wentworth mirrors the indifference with which he is regarded
                  by the Elliots, whose monumental self-regard is signaled by their adoption of the
                  third person in referring to themselves. The first thing we are told about Anne’s
                  father is that “Sir Walter Elliot was the constant object of his warmest respect and
                  devotion” (6), an attitude adopted with equal zeal by Elizabeth and her obsequious
                  friend Mrs. Clay, all of whom speak in one voice: “‘Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been
                  Mr Elliot. They did not know’” (131). The conflation of subjects results in a confusion
                  of direct and indirect speech, most conspicuously in Sir Walter’s opening remarks,
                  in which he responds to Lady Russell’s suggestion that he rein in his expenses: <span class="quote">‘‘What! every comfort of life knocked off! Journeys, London, servants, horses, table—contractions
                     and restrictions every where! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private
                     gentleman! No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such
                     disgraceful terms.’ (14)’</span> The elimination of the distinction between direct and indirect speech makes conversation
                  oddly permeable, allowing the narrative to take part in the very conversation it records:
                  “‘Quit Kellynch Hall.’ The hint was immediately taken up by Mr. Shepherd . . . ‘Since
                  the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,’
                  he said, ‘in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side” (14). No one repeats
                  Sir Walter’s utterance “Quit Kellynch Hall,” yet the words appear in quotation marks
                  nonetheless. “‘he had no scruple,’ he said,” except that <em>he</em> didn’t say that; the narrator did. No wonder Mr. Shepherd refers to “the very quarter
                  which ought to dictate.”</p>
               <p>At times <em>Persuasion</em> betrays a remarkable lack of interest in specifying who is speaking and when. Perhaps
                  the most remarkable instance of this comes in another passage of free direct discourse,
                  in which the panicked statements of a number of different characters in the aftermath
                  of Louisa’s fall are contained within a single set of quotation marks: <span class="quote">‘‘Uppercross,—the necessity of some one’s going to Uppercross,— the news to be conveyed—how
                     it could be broken to Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove—the lateness of the morning,—an hour already
                     gone since they ought to have been off,—the impossibility of being in tolerable time.’
                     (105)’</span> The only person whose voice is not part of this concord, Anne, is rarely granted
                  the privilege of quotation marks, speaking almost always indirectly: “Anne quietly
                  tried to convince her [sister] . . . Anne avoided a direct reply” (99). This does
                  not mean, however, that Anne is silent through the course of <em>Persuasion</em>. Mary and her husband Charles value Anne as a house guest precisely because she is
                  so adept at conveying their needs and desires to one another, while never giving voice
                  to her own. Having been converted into a medium for the feelings of others, it seems
                  only fitting that Anne needs a medium of her own in which to express her own feelings.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Her family’s reluctance directly to address Anne is not surprising given their belief
                     that, like Wentworth’s brother, she is “nobody” (7). But then, this appears to be
                     Anne’s view of herself: “her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give
                     way—she was only Anne” (7). For Miller, Anne’s sense of herself as ‘nobody’ represents
                     such a thorough internalization of the position adopted by the narrative that <em>Persuasion</em> gives the impression of having originated with Anne herself, as if it were “a diary
                     written in the third person” (<em>Jane Austen</em> 72–73).

                     </div> The formulation is irresistible. I would only add that such a diary is the product
                     of many hands. For just as Anne’s adoption of the third person to talk about herself
                     represents “a thorough internalization” of the narrative, so the references to her
                     in the third person that Anne overhears while playing the piano at a dance at the
                     Musgroves represent a thorough externalization of it: “she has quite given up dancing.
                     She had rather play. She is never tired of playing” (67). Anne is of such little consequence
                     that she can be spoken of as if she were not present—as if, that is, she had no means
                     of claiming the first person for herself.</p>

                  <p>Anne’s situation is not dissimilar to Fanny Crawford’s in <em>Mansfield Park</em>. Like Anne, Fanny is constantly spoken for and about; like her, she is often privy
                     to the intimate conversations of others. Page observes of the heroine of <em>Mansfield Park</em> that “perhaps no heroine of a great novel has quite such a fondness for silence” (<em>Language</em> 36) but in fact Fanny, like Anne, speaks more than we might think—it is just that
                     almost all her speech is indirect, whether or not it appears in quotation marks.

                              similar reasons. In response to Lucy Deane’s urging that he absolve his sister from
                              her promise never to see Philip Wakem, Tom Tulliver replies that “of course Maggie
                              could do as she liked. For Tom’s part, he held himself to be bound by his duty to
                              his father’s memory” (456). Despite appearing within quotation marks Tom’s speech
                              cannot be direct, underscoring how unapproachable, even inaccessible, he is on the
                              subject of what he and his sister owe the past.</span></div>
                     </div> In this sense her first reported utterance—“‘William did not like she should come
                     away’” (13)—parallels her last, on which Austen’s narrator refuses to report: “Let
                     no one presume to give the feelings of a young woman on receiving the assurance of
                     that affection of which she has scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope” (370).

                              opening remark as evidence that she “can hardly arrogate the self-assertive ‘I’ for
                              herself” (51–52).</span></div>
                     </div> Anne-Lise François notes that “Austen’s third-person narration . . . relieves Fanny
                     from first-person assertions” (224). But Fanny is sheltered from the first person
                     even in direct discourse. The episode detailing Miss Crawford’s gift of the necklace
                     to Fanny, for example, records all of Mary’s remarks, but none of Fanny’s responses,
                     restricting itself merely to noting that Fanny has responded: “Fanny still resisted
                     . . . Fanny protested . . . Fanny dared not make any further opposition” (202–4).
                     The effect of placing Fanny, like Anne, outside the moment of utterance is to insulate
                     her from the world, indeed from the passing of time. If Tony Tanner is right to argues
                     that <em>Mansfield Park</em> tells the story of “a girl who triumphs by doing nothing . . . she waits, she endures”
                     (143) then we might say that removing her from direct discourse affords her a time
                     in which to wait, just as the novel’s trick of exiling her to Portsmouth provides
                     her with a place in which to do so. Thus Fanny preserves her defining characteristic:
                     moral consistency; she remains where she is—in the right—while Edmund and Sir Thomas
                     Bertram slowly move toward her.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Consistency is not exactly Anne Elliot’s defining trait, as Captain Wentworth knows
                     to his cost. Yet, just like Fanny, Anne spends the novel of which she is the heroine
                     standing still while others come round to her position. This results in a curious
                     temporal dissimilarity between Anne’s consciousness of events, to which Austen’s free
                     indirect discourse gives us unparalleled access, and that of those around her. Anne
                     inhabits a time all her own. Consider, for example, the first, oddly delayed, words
                     she speaks in the text. Introduced with the portentous line, “Here Anne spoke” (20),
                     her opening remark is uttered in support of the idea that her improvident father should
                     let his house to an admiral, but it can also read as a response, eight years too late,
                     to Lady Russell’s objection to the idea of her marrying a sailor: “The navy, I think,
                     who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men”
                     (20). Anne’s words do not possess a double meaning so much as occupy a double time.
                     This time can best be glimpsed in two distinct yet similar moments in the text in
                     which Wentworth saves Anne: first from the unwanted attentions of her young nephew—“some
                     one was taking him from her . . . and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew
                     that Captain Wentworth had done it” (74)—second from a tiring walk—“he had done it.
                     She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and
                     his hands had done it” (84). Both episodes are described from within Anne’s consciousness,
                     a place where Wentworth, here “some one” rather than no-one, needs no introduction.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In a compelling reading of these twinned moments Adela Pinch observes that “Austen’s
                              representation of Anne’s innerness takes the form of an inwardness that oddly seems
                              only penetrated from the outside with difficulty” (106).</span></div>
                     </div> And both play strange tricks with time, the sign of which is the odd repetition of
                     the phrase, “had done it.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Anne’s delayed perception is signaled by the strangely impersonal syntax, which sticks
                  resolutely and confusingly to the third person, whether describing Wentworth, Anne’s
                  nephew, or Anne herself. The passages are written in the third person of free indirect
                  discourse, yet the perceptions belong exclusively to Anne. They do however share a
                  significant feature of free indirect discourse: they lift the speaker out of the time
                  of the narrative. Austen anticipates in such passages the kind of atomistic temporality
                  common to modernist novelists such as Virginia Woolf, whose commitment to representing
                  individual consciousness estranges her characters from each other, as if they failed
                  to inhabit the same temporal moment. One of the striking characteristics of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, for example, is how often characters fall into reveries while speaking to one another:
                  “From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby
                  . . . rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful” (309). <em>Mansfield Park</em> could be said to personify such reveries in the still, silent presence of Fanny,
                  which might explain its oddly playful attitude to time, which it bends to suit its
                  own purposes: “exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so,
                  and not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became as
                  anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire” (369).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The same elasticity marks the passage of time in <em>Persuasion</em>. Just a few moments elapse between Wentworth writing the letter to Anne and Anne
                     reading it, and just a few moments more before they are reunited.

                     </div> Although Anne and Wentworth have to endure an agonizing wait, their second courtship
                     possesses a strangely accelerated tempo: “Before Mrs. Croft had written, he was arrived,
                     and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him” (164). After the pair finally
                     reconcile, time speeds up to such an extent that it erases the distinctions between
                     moments upon which the passing of time depends: “All the little variations of the
                     last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an
                     end” (226). The repeat engagement with which the novel ends abolishes the passing
                     of time altogether. For not just Anne’s consciousness is out of step with those around
                     her; the text as a whole could be said to be out of synch, beginning with the act
                     of persuasion which gives Austen her title, which is not only never narrated but takes
                     place, strictly speaking, outside the time of the novel. Indeed the title, <em>Persuasion</em>, suggests an ongoing action rather than the results of that action, confusing past
                     and present in a way that sets the tempo for the entire novel.</p>
               </div>
               <p>What reason would Austen have for organizing her last novel around a temporal disjunction?
                  The answer takes us back to the relation between private and public with which I began,
                  a relation introduced as early as the first paragraph of the novel, which reproduces
                  the page of the <em>Baronetage</em> detailing the history of the Elliot family. Sir Walter reads this history “with an
                  interest which never failed” (5), partly because he busies himself updating the entry
                  to include events such as his wife’s death and his daughter’s marriage. The amendments
                  put public and private life at odds in a way that could be said to determine the novel
                  that follows. The trajectory of <em>Persuasion</em> is thus the opposite of the one outlined in Bowen and Finch, in which an all-seeing
                  narrative makes private thoughts public. Instead, we find a consciousness constantly
                  translating public events into private experience: “it would soon be over. And it
                  was soon over. . . . Her eye half met Captain Wentworth’s, a bow, a curtsey passed
                  . . . the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it”
                  (56). Anne’s consciousness speeds up time and slows it down, separates voices from
                  persons and speakers from subjects, renders public life so private that one cannot
                  even say when, where, and to whom it is happening.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Emma could even be said to ventriloquize Austen herself at one point, entertaining
               Mrs. Weston with a pitch-perfect imitation of Mrs. Bates.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>The Economy of Character</em> Deidre Lynch offers a particularly helpful discussion of the workings of free indirect
               discourse in <em>Persuasion</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Miller’s reading is based on an unpublished essay by David Kurnick: “Throwing Her
               Voice: <em>Persuasion</em>’s Erotics of Indirection.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">George Eliot adopts this technique near the end of <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> for seemingly similar reasons. In response to Lucy Deane’s urging that he absolve
               his sister from her promise never to see Philip Wakem, Tom Tulliver replies that “of
               course Maggie could do as she liked. For Tom’s part, he held himself to be bound by
               his duty to his father’s memory” (456). Despite appearing within quotation marks Tom’s
               speech cannot be direct, underscoring how unapproachable, even inaccessible, he is
               on the subject of what he and his sister owe the past.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Roy Pascal, in his indispensable study of free indirect discourse, points to Fanny’s
               opening remark as evidence that she “can hardly arrogate the self-assertive ‘I’ for
               herself” (51–52).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In a compelling reading of these twinned moments Adela Pinch observes that “Austen’s
               representation of Anne’s innerness takes the form of an <em>inward</em>ness that oddly seems only penetrated from the outside with difficulty” (106).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Rae Greiner provides a fascinating reading of this episode in her essay “The Art of
               Knowing One’s Own Nothingness.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
