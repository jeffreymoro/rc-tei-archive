            <p class="noCount">Is there a place for the spiritual in literature? James Hogg's long poem <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> and his sprawling prose narrative <em>The Three Perils of Man</em> appear to literalize an affirmative response by giving play to spirits and other
               supernatural phenomena. And yet, Hogg’s answer may actually be no, if only because
               “literature” as imagined by his friend and rival, Walter Scott, downgrades spiritual
               intensities to the status of cultural differences from everyday life. Hogg did not
               divide up the world in quite that way, a point with implications not only for the
               idea of the spiritual, but also, and especially, for literature.</p>

               <p>Is there a place for the spiritual in literature? On its surface, the answer to this
                  question would seem to be yes, whether we respond with an eye to the tradition of
                  liberal humanism (where most comers are, if not welcome, at least tolerated, even
                  in an era of microaggressions) or to the present era of the postsecular. Indeed, as
                  Justine Murison and Jordan Alexander Stein remark, “the ‘religious turn’ in literary
                  studies—taking place since the late 1990s but reimagined in more urgent terms following
                  9/11—has made a discipline-wide fashion” of religion and hence, by extension, of a
                  category like spirituality (1). And yet, religion is hardly a self-evident category
                  (are we talking about sectarian institutions? about a militant organization like ISIS?
                  about something more broadly anthropological, like the connection between language
                  and ritual?), and neither, perforce, is the spiritual. Rosi Braidotti, for example,
                  appeals to “postsecular spirituality” (251) as a way of forging a materialist ethics
                  that is “resolutely atheistic” (256). Her reason for invoking a traditionally religious
                  category to make a patently non-religious argument is that postsecular spirituality
                  provides a nuanced matrix for a concept of subjectivity “linked to affects, to the
                  imagination,” and to notions of “transformative becoming” (251).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And yet, none of this really answers the question of whether there is a place for
                     the spiritual in literature, or what that place might be (are we talking about a thematic
                     subject? a principle of form? allusive atmospherics?), if only because we have not
                     defined what we mean by <em>the spiritual</em>. But is an adequate definition even possible? I ask because, as the young Derrida
                     reminded us in endless analyses of Hegel, the spiritual may not simply be one category
                     in a sea of others.

                              Hence, “to be opposed to its own tendency, to itself, to matter, it must be spirit.
                              And it if yields to this tendency, it is still spirit. It is spirit in any case; its
                              essence is nothing but spiritual. There is no essence but spiritual” (Derrida 22).</span></div>
                     </div> Consider Steven Goldsmith’s recent, and cogent, observations concerning the status
                     of the imagined dialectical opposite of the spiritual, the material, in modern literary
                     studies:<span class="quote">‘No doubt materialism is too multivalent to invoke so broadly, but it is also a conceptual
                        ground so pervasive as to operate virtually uncontested. If materialism means “the
                        explanation of the higher by the lower,” as Bourdieu once suggested, it encompasses
                        not only Marxist tradition but our criticism’s tendency always to descend further
                        (toward whatever is smallest, neglected, and least elevated or heroic), with its understanding
                        that beneath the materialist floor as currently conceived there is always a still
                        lower condition awaiting discovery . . .. Although we might challenge or promote one
                        version or another (historicist, economic, affective, dialectical, speculative, ecological,
                        thing theorized, object oriented, new empirical), no one today would seriously argue <em>against</em> materialism—and that consensus is enough to make me wonder about the work we want
                        our materialisms to perform. (416)’</span> While I concur with Goldsmith’s conclusions, the “multivalent” status of materialism
                     reintroduces the notion of the spiritual through the back door. Consider what it means
                     for there to be, in Bourdieu’s words, a “higher” notion of materialism, a kind of
                     (divine or simply peer-review-sanctioned) canon under which we may group the various
                     orders of materiality (“historicist, economic, affective, dialectical, speculative,
                     ecological,” and so on). In the scenario Goldsmith outlines, the material <em>is</em> (also the) spiritual.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>So, is the spiritual also material in literature? That is to say, while the spiritual
                     may find a place in any text or critical apparatus (like the presence of the void
                     in any mathematical set, which is impossible to exclude since “nothing” might always
                     be added), does it count there; does it <em>matter</em>? This question is becoming increasingly relevant in the humanities, during an era
                     when tightening university budgets tend to invite new scrutiny of literary scholarship,
                     with charges occasionally laid against it of obscurantism, political homogeneity,
                     and the sacrifice of “big questions” to small stakes hobbyhorsery.

                     </div> The spiritual is a kind of index for questions of meaning and value, and while never
                     shorn of politics (who decides what is meaningful?), it nevertheless carries with
                     it an aura of import for a vaguely imagined public sphere. This means that to pose
                     the question of the spiritual in literature is to jostle the lid on Pandora’s box.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Or, perhaps, it just means doing history. For the question of the spiritual in literature
                  is hardly new, and it is one chapter of that history, or one portion of one chapter,
                  that I wish to address here. The Scottish poet, essayist, novelist, songwriter, collector,
                  and shepherd James Hogg frequently invoked the spiritual—more specifically in Hogg’s
                  case, the presence of spirits—in his work, and did so from under the aegis of both
                  religion (whether fanatical or moderate) and folk culture. For Hogg, the spiritual
                  is a fact of existence, though it is rarely, if ever, a straightforward fact for literature.
                  This is most famously the case in his brilliant and experimental narrative <em>The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</em>, in which the account of a murder is rehearsed twice, the second time from within
                  the mind of a religious zealot who has been deceived by an extended relationship with
                  the devil incarnate. The proximity to evil functions in the <em>Confessions</em>, Ian Duncan argues, as “a powerful critique of the Scottish philosophical account
                  of sympathy as the foundation of moral sentiment, the ethical system that regulates
                  civil society” (“Fanaticism” 58). Robert Wringhim’s sympathy for the devil, his destructive
                  attachment to ideas and narratives that distort the actual conditions of his existence,
                  reveals fanaticism to be “the dialectical product of objective historical processes
                  of modernization” (59), the uncanny obverse of progress that divulges, in place of
                  a “primitive moral force” (59), a state of disenfranchisement.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But spirits take multiple forms in Hogg’s work. Accordingly, spirituality meets with
                     multiple uses. And here, in my essay, it is not the <em>Confessions</em>, but rather two other Hogg texts under examination, texts that take a more ecumenical
                     approach to the problem of the spiritual. One is Hogg’s long poem <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>, which stages a competition between bards from across sixteenth-century Scotland.
                     The other is the sprawling narrative <em>The Three Perils of Man</em>, a text initially conceived as a tale of chivalry (in subversive homage to Walter
                     Scott), but which devolves into a story about witchcraft and, crucially, tale-telling
                     (in which Hogg resuscitates the premise of a competition among raconteurs, the conceit
                     of <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>). Similarly to <em>Confessions</em>, a dialectic establishes itself in these texts by way of a traffic with spirits,
                     though here it is not civil society that Hogg places on trial as much as literature
                     itself, specifically the modern concept of the literary as a species of imaginative
                     writing set against a normative sphere of everyday life. Anthony Jarrells presents
                     a variation on this point in his essay in this volume, remarking that Hogg adheres
                     to “an idea of experience thoroughly grounded in belief, including belief in ghosts,
                     miracles, divine intervention, and supernatural visitations, none of which”—and this
                     is my point—“are consistent with real life as represented in novels” (par. 15). Offsetting
                     my argument somewhat from Jarrells’s, what concerns Hogg is less the status of literature
                     per se than its dialectic with reality and the schism that such a dialectic implies—something
                     both <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> and <em>The Three Perils of Man</em> undercut. Each, then, exemplifies a kind of Bakhtinian heteroglossia, a condition
                     historically associated with the novel. Neither text, however, is a novel (even <em>Perils</em> presents itself more as a meandering tale, an exercise in narrative bricolage), and
                     the multitude of voices these texts unleash militate less against particular literary
                     forms (e.g., for Bakhtin, the epic) than against “the literary” as such.

                              that refuses to be symbolically resolved” (par. 2).</span></div>
                     </div> Hogg’s work thus evokes and undercuts the modern novel, at least as imagined as the <em>modern</em> narrative form (<span class="foreign">pace</span> Walter Benjamin

                     </div>). Hogg thus makes a place for novelistic prose that, in one fashion, at least (with
                     Scott as its dialectical antithesis), is irreducible to the same. Call it an engagement
                     with the <em>spirit</em> of the novel.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The title of my essay alludes to Wassily Kandinsky’s famous treatise <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>, published in 1912, a century after Hogg composed <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> (which appeared in January 1813). Kandinsky’s aim was to delineate the relationship
                  between the spirit of the age and the forms of art. “Every work of art is the child
                  of its time,” his treatise begins. And “[i]t follows that each period of culture produces
                  an art of its own” (23). The concept of the spiritual in Kandinsky’s long essay is
                  part Percy Shelley, part Hegel in that it consists in a set of idealized abstractions
                  that take shape in history. Similar elements inform <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>, where Hogg synthesizes something like a “spirit of Scotland” from the diverse ballads,
                  or “songs,” that constitute it. Of particular interest here, with Kandinsky in mind,
                  are Hogg’s references to colors and shapes, and particularly to distorted perspectives—to
                  “silver curve[s]” in the water cut by the prows of boats (26, l. 140), or to “lurid
                  vapours” that “deform” the appearance of land and sky (55, ll. 3, 5).</p>
               <p>But such spirits are not sufficiently literal for Hogg. <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> is a work replete with fairies, witches, demons, ghosts, visions, and other phenomena
                  associated with the supernatural. “That fairies <em>were</em>, was not disputed; / But <em>what</em> they were, was greatly doubted,” one ballad declares (66, ll. 423–24). Of course,
                  few things simply <em>are</em> in the poem, including fairies, for that particular ballad reveals its otherworldly
                  beings to be a group of singing maids. Nevertheless, both this particular bardic offering
                  and the longer poem of which it is part embrace an aesthetic of enchantment, returning
                  repeatedly to the existence of the otherworldly. The traditional Scottish ballads
                  that serve as Hogg’s templates are themselves rife with supernatural encounters, to
                  be sure, but <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> ups the ante by importing ballad sensibilities into the narrative framework of the
                  poem, as the narrator himself speaks of spirits roaming the Scottish countryside.
                  Such spirits, he declares, “stretch imagination’s power” (149, l. 1583) making spiritual
                  experience one of the poem’s practical and even theoretical modes and objects.</p>
               <p>By “spiritual experience” in this context I mean something like the classical definition
                  furnished by William James: “abnormal psychical variations” and “exalted emotional
                  sensibilit[ies]” (9). Perhaps better, it designates what modern scholars of spiritual
                  experience in psychology and philosophy identify as “intense experiences[:] . . .
                  liminal, profound, numinous, extreme, transcendental, traumatic, sublime,” and so
                  on. Such experiences entail a “cognitive and emotional potency that focuses attention”
                  and consist of a “rich interconnection of ideas, memories, and emotions that weaves
                  normally separated parts of life into a single field of meaning” (Wildman, 104–05).
                  <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> exhibits such “weav[ing]” tendencies in its imaginative premise, the wake hosted
                  by Mary Queen of Scots that unifies Scotland’s regional poetic traditions under a
                  single national-literary aegis. And the individual ballads certainly qualify as explorations
                  of “intensity,” whether narratively or in the complexity of their tone.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Take, as one example, the ballad “The Witch of Fife,” which tells of “Quhat good man
                     never knew” (40, l. 626). A peasant’s wife and her companions are transported one
                     night to the top of Ben Lomond where they dance with the devil. Then, a different
                     night, they voyage to Lapland, where they are bathed by “warlock men and weerd wemyng”
                     in “witch-water” (44, ll. 733, 737). The peasant’s/witch’s “gude-man” later accompanies
                     her on a third excursion, this time to the bishop’s vault in Carlisle, where he drinks
                     himself silly before being found by “five rough Englishmen” (47, l. 865), who “nickit
                     the auld man, and . . . prickit the auld man, / And . . . tyit him till ane stone;
                     / And they set ane bele-fire him about, / And they burnit him skin and bone” (48,
                     ll. 881–4).

                              (75, ll. 747–48); and across the countryside, the narrator informs us, “spirits talk[]
                              along the hill[s]” (106, l. 49).</span></div>
                     </div> The convergence of the demonic with drunken revelry evokes Robert Burns’s well-known
                     poem “Tam O’Shanter,” but Hogg’s ballad intensifies the element of the grotesque in
                     the beating the “gude-man” receives. More pertinently, it stages a dramatic conflict
                     between the world of spirits (whether otherworldly or simply alcoholic) and the lordship
                     of vindictive Englishmen that introduces an interpretive crisis. Are we supposed to
                     believe the story we have read, or was it all a drunken hallucination? The ballad
                     does not answer this question, but it impresses as real the <em>effect</em> of disgust even as it underscores the uncanny narrative that conjures it.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Many of the ballads in <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> operate this way, such that what draws us to them is less the explicability of their
                     spiritual dimensions on conventional interpretive grounds—the encounter with spirits
                     as nationalist allegories, say, or as some kind of libidinal manifestation—than their
                     sheer affect, the poetic faith or suspension of disbelief these visitations elicit.
                     Hogg, in other words, is as much a literalist as Kandinsky, though in a different
                     register. Kandinsky develops a positive—that is, a positivist—theory about spiritual
                     intensities (with color, for example, producing “spiritual vibration[s]” as a kind
                     of “psychological effect”: yellow “is the typical earthly color,” whereas blue “is
                     the typical heavenly color” and so on [44, 58]).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Kandinsky appeals to the analogy of music: “Generally speaking, color directly influences
                              the soul. Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with
                              many strings. The artist is the hand that plays” (45).</span></div>
                     </div> Hence, he remarks: a “yellow triangle, a blue circle, a green square, or a green triangle,
                     a yellow circle, a blue square: all these are differently acting entities” (47). Hogg,
                     if anything, is more abstract than the arch-abstractionist Kandinsky because Hogg’s
                     menagerie of spiritual intensities is real without the figures giving rise to it,
                     the demons and witches, being quite believable. For Hogg, that is, the spiritual is
                     real, but not necessarily <em>these</em> spirits, which might be mere figures, mere fictions. And the poet, therefore, is less
                     a prophet than the vehicle for the strangeness of what is numinous or sublime, or
                     for the illegibility of what we nevertheless experience. What is thus tangible in
                     reading <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> is the juxtaposition between a quotidian experience with spirits (the everydayness
                     of the uncanny) and the simultaneous elevation and debasement of this experience to
                     the mere status of the literary.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In introducing a rift between spiritual and literary experience, <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> pre-emptively invalidates a principle that would become associated with the modern
                  concept of literature, a principle that Walter Scott would animate the following year,
                  1814, with the publication of <em>Waverley</em>. This is the principle we understand today under the rubric of cultural materialism,
                  which explains not only how cultures emerge but also how they inform the ways we think
                  by differentiating, within themselves, one domain of meaning from another—scientific
                  fact, say, from folk knowledge—along an axis of progress. As Scott famously explained
                  at the conclusion of <em>Waverley</em>, “for the purpose of preserving some idea of the ancient manners of which [he has]
                  witnessed the almost total extinction, [he has] embodied [them] in imaginary scenes
                  . . .. Indeed, the most romantic parts of [<em>Waverley</em>] are precisely those which have a foundation in fact” (340). In essence, Scott brackets
                  as (mere) culture what a group of people experiences (or once experienced) as vital.
                  In <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>, one sees the rudiments of this principle articulated by the Lord of Mar, a character
                  based on the historical Earl of Mar who was a guardian of James V and, afterwards,
                  of Mary. At the conclusion of the poem, after the bards have all sung their songs,
                  a skirmish irrupts when no clear victor is named. “‘Twas party all—not minstrel worth,
                  / But honour of the south and north; / And nought was heard throughout the court,
                  / But taunt, and sneer, and keen retort” (165, ll. 82–85). So Mar takes the floor
                  and explains that “taste, as sapient sages tell, / Varies with climes in which we
                  dwell” (165, ll. 106–07). So do the poems: “Fair emblems of the Border dale, / Is
                  cadence soft and simple tale; / While stern romantic Highland clime, / Still nourishes
                  the rude sublime” (165, ll. 108–11). Hence, so unlikely is it that the subjects of
                  one region could enjoy those of another, that Mar likens its prospect to an outbreak
                  of supernatural or even anti-natural incidents: “trow you may the tides adjourn, /
                  And Nature from her path-way turn; / The wild-duck drive to mountain tree, / The capperkayle
                  [or wood grouse] to swim the sea,” and so forth (166, ll. 120–23). So unnatural would
                  it be for a Highlander to approve of a Border poem that, as a solution, Mar proposes
                  that the three bards preferred by the majority of the auditors be summoned to perform
                  again, with the queen alone declaring the victor.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It seems like a logical solution: inasmuch as each of us is encased, as Walter Pater
                     might say, within a thick wall of cultural personality (see Pater 60), let the queen
                     adjudicate poetic justice. (The situation anticipates the conclusion of Scott’s 1827
                     story “The Two Drovers,” when a judge acknowledges the cultural forces that motivated
                     a Highlander to slay his English comrade before, nevertheless, sentencing the unregenerate
                     Highlander to death.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div>) Indeed, Mar’s proposal seems more nineteenth century, when <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> was composed, than sixteenth century, when it is set, in that it grafts a classical
                     aesthetic principle of unity amid variety onto an Enlightenment-era world view held
                     by stadial historians like Adam Smith and Lord Kames, and onto the arguments of proto-anthropologists
                     like Johann Gottfried Herder, who crafted such histories into a theory of cultural
                     relativity. In <em>Waverley</em>, of course, these dynamics yield diverse “worlds”—Highland Jacobite, Lowland Jacobite,
                     English, and so on—within an encompassing modernity that operates as a reality principle
                     differentiating the durable stuff of history from the imaginary compensations, the
                     merely spiritual experiences, of romance.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But think again about Mar’s assertion that an eclectic taste defies nature—the kind
                  of taste exhibited, incidentally, by Hogg’s imagined readers, who supposedly have
                  enjoyed all the ballads. Are Hogg’s readers unnatural? Perhaps more to the point,
                  do not virtually all the songs in <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> defy nature in some fashion, unless we call the traffic with spirits, fairies, witches,
                  and other supernatural forms natural? But if we label such beings natural, at least
                  in the <em>Wake</em>, then how do we account for the poetic charge, the aura of transport (of what is
                  “more than mortal,” as one song puts it [13, l. 244]) that attaches itself to these
                  episodes? If anything, the ballads articulate a conflicted relationship between the
                  natural and spiritual worlds, personified by the bard of Fife, who recounts the song
                  about the witches. This bard takes the stage bearing iconic hallmarks of the medium:
                  “Bushy his beard, and wild his eye,” with a “haggard cheek” and thin, gray locks (39,
                  l. 594). “He deemed that fays and spectres wan / Held converse with the thoughts of
                  man” (40, ll. 603–04). But, precisely because <em>he</em> holds these attitudes, <em>we</em> do not. Or rather, we believe such “converse” possible, but not as he does—or, if
                  we do, as exceptional rather than everyday occurrences, or as <em>events</em> rather than <em>customs</em>. It is natural, the poem implies, to believe in something other than what is superficially
                  evident, especially to the degree that we recognize differences between the worlds
                  in which we live and the ones in which we believe.</p>
               <p>In this way, <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> presents spiritual experience as at once ubiquitous and romantic, as common and deeply
                  strange. And in that respect, predicating its poetic effects on a kind of fascinated
                  ambivalence, <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> seems utterly if also uncannily modern—more so than Kandinsky’s concept of modern
                  art as a conduit of positive spiritual realities, but more so, too, than Scott’s delineation
                  of a literature as a reservoir of epistemic, ontological, and historical difference.
                  <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> at once drains this reservoir and bursts the dam, voiding the spiritual of its literal
                  status but insisting on a constant flow of our experience with the unseen. In this
                  way, the poem shrugs at the prospects of difference as a literary value; and, with
                  that gesture, it renders literature in its modern guise an indifferent medium—an accessory
                  to life, but nothing essential.</p>
               <p>Hogg’s dialogue with Scott reaches an even higher pitch in <em>The Three Perils of Man</em>, published in 1822. In <em>Perils</em>, the existential status of romance and the modern cultural status of the literary
                  are on particularly acute display. As Graham Tulloch reveals, Hogg initially had a
                  different title in mind—<em>The Perilous Castle: A Tale of Chivalry</em>—because he planned to write a different kind of narrative, one directly responding
                  to Scott. This “perilous castle” and its corresponding “tale” referred to the Roxburgh
                  fortress and to the battle over it between lords of competing English and Scottish
                  kingdoms, the winner earning the hand of the princess of his realm. Scott had twice
                  dealt with this story, “once in a note to <em>The Lord of the Isles</em> in 1815 and again in his essay ‘Chivalry,’ which appeared in February 1818” (Tulloch
                  158). In visiting this territory himself, Hogg sought not only to draft off Scott’s
                  success, but also to reflect critically on “Scott’s first long poetic romance, <em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em>, [which] was explicitly a tale of ‘Border chivalry’” (161). However, in the version
                  of the novel he eventually published, Hogg devoted a greater share of attention to
                  a new castle, Aikwood, and to a story that deals not with chivalry, but rather with
                  witchcraft and the supernatural. This was, Tulloch remarks, “a much more familiar
                  ground” for Hogg (166), and the lengthy portion of the novel devoted to it—despite
                  Scott’s critique of it, and despite Hogg’s own lament, later, that he had “retarded
                  the main story” by indulging it—is much more assured than the Roxburgh narrative.
                  In this Aikwood section, references to the supernatural, spirits, demons, and fairies
                  abound, with Hogg “interpos[ing] no . . . sceptical voice” to undercut the narrative
                  (169).</p>
               <p>We are then, in this Aikwood section, once again squarely in the realm of spirits.
                  At its center, however, is an enigmatic and protracted tale-telling contest that reproduces
                  the conceit of the poetic competition in <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>. A motley assemblage of characters—among them Charlie Scott, a member of the Douglas
                  clan seeking to recapture the castle of Roxburgh; a friar; a homely laird; a gluttonous
                  laborer; a fair damsel; and a poet—makes its way to Aikwood to seek the prophetic
                  wisdom of the wizard, Michael Scott. Scott has no interest in granting the company’s
                  wish, instead imprisoning the group within the castle. After extended experiences
                  with “diablerie” of various kinds (like metamorphoses of humans into animals, enchanted
                  feasts in which degraded elements—“the joint of a frog’s leg, or that of a rat” [<em>Perils</em> 200]—take the form of sumptuous meats, and so on), a skirmish breaks out between
                  Scott’s demonic servants and the castle’s human inhabitants, and Scott finds himself
                  fighting alongside the company he has imprisoned. He does not entirely become a comrade
                  in arms, however, and after staving off the supernatural turncoats he threatens to
                  starve the group by refusing to grant its release. However, Scott agrees to preserve
                  the life of Delany, the beautiful maid, by giving her to the member of the group who
                  can tell him the best tale. Thus resumes, in effect, the conceit of the competition
                  from <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>.</p>
               <p>And, provocatively, thus concludes our consort with spirits, at least temporarily.
                  For the tales mostly involve human circumstances. The friar, the first raconteur,
                  rehearses (in the Biblical language of chapter and verse) the story of his love for
                  a woman who falls, herself, for a soldier and then has a child by him. This child,
                  the party immediately discovers, is Delany. The laird then tells a story about a meat-loving
                  shepherd—a member of their party, Tam Craik, it turns out—who, in a moment of weakness,
                  slaughters a “fat ewe lamb” (<em>Perils</em> 258). Charlie Scott, the loyal clansman, then takes a turn and tells a story about
                  a battle with English forces, and about his action in sparing the life of a small
                  child—who proves to be the poet, as the latter reveals to the others upon hearing
                  Charlie’s story. At this disclosure, “Charlie’s visage altered into lengthened amazement. . ..
                  ‘Gude faith but we are a queer set that are prickit up on top o’ this tower thegither’”
                  (292–93), he exclaims. “Od,” echoes Tam, “we seem to ken mair about ane anither than
                  ony ane o’ us kens about ourselves” (293). More than merging life and art, the tales
                  bind the group to each other, interweaving a community from the aleatory associations
                  that initially brought the group together. In this respect, the enchanted circumstances
                  the party had witnessed in Aikwood castle evolve from the encounter with demons to
                  the bewitching effects of narrative itself, and this despite the relative absence
                  of supernatural events within the individual tales.</p>
               <p>The magical quality of storytelling in this competition becomes more significant in
                  light of the critique in <em>The Queen’s Wake</em> of literature’s bifurcation from life. There, in that earlier work, Romantic artifice
                  effectively divides literary from quotidian experience, a space of ontological difference
                  from a more expansive existence in which actuality and possibility commingle (instead
                  of being relegated to different positions on the grid of history). In <em>The Three Perils of Man</em>, Romantic artifice is again brought under scrutiny, though here it reconciles the
                  binary between the literary and the everyday as the tales presented in the competition
                  in Aikwood castle mediate the actual (and revealed) relationships subsisting between
                  the characters. In this respect, <em>Perils</em> “explores not just what stories <em>are</em>, but whom or what they are <em>for</em> in a particular culture” (Fielding 70)—or rather, and more ambitiously, I would say,
                  what they are for <em>generally</em>, and not only for a particular, Romanticized body of individuals or readers. <em>Perils</em>, that is, does <em>not</em> encase narrative within a particular cultural context. It thus revises “the Enlightenment
                  allegory of cultural progress as a disenchantment of the world” (Duncan, <em>Scott’s Shadow</em> 194–95) wherein the transporting effects of narrative are <span class="foreign">a priori</span> contained as mere literature, or as “real” only for the benighted sensibilities of
                  older societies echoing from out of the dustbin of history.</p>
               <p>In <em>Perils</em>, as in <em>The Queen’s Wake</em>, the domain in which this revision occurs is that of (what I am calling) the spiritual.
                  I make this claim with an eye to the specific nature of Hogg’s evocation in these
                  texts of supernatural agents—fairies, ghosts, demons, <em>stories</em>—and a correlative set of intense experiences as the media of a unified relation between
                  literature and life. In Hogg’s work, as in the landscape outside Aikwood castle, “the
                  heavens and the earth seem[] mingled together” (199), as do diverse elements of society
                  (from the Edinburgh elite to the Border peasants whose traditional and bewitching
                  literary forms attracted wide attention). Such eclectic inclusivity is part of the
                  history of the modern novel, explained perhaps most memorably by Bakhtin as “a phenomenon
                  multiform in style and variform in speech and voice” (261). In early nineteenth-century
                  Scotland, however, the reputed heteroglossia of the novel form was at least partly
                  contained within a historicist framework that relegated peasant tales and the <span class="foreign">Völkisch</span> beliefs on which they were predicated to an evocative, romantic past. This makes
                  <em>Perils</em> the emblem of a different kind of literary history, one that scrambles the idea of
                  progress. More evocatively for us, it casts Hogg’s fiction as an important case study
                  for a post-secular age in which belief in the unseen seems at once impossible and
                  necessary. Amy Hungerford, for example, argues that literary studies in the postmodern
                  age is defined by a <em>belief in meaninglessness</em>, which is to say, by a faith in fictive world-making as the vehicle “of crucial cultural
                  work in the age of literature’s waning social prestige and its eclipse by other media”
                  (xiv–xv). We believe, in other words, in the power and importance of texts and narratives
                  we know to be false, or at least fictive. And yet, if literature is still to mean
                  anything, Hogg might tell us, it is by marshaling the kind of faith that converts
                  belief into something more empowering: it must oppose, that is, the logic of <em>mere</em> belief, of a strictly <em>literary</em> authority or purely <em>poetic</em> faith. Instead, literature must derive its power from its continuity with life, from
                  its concourse with the kind of meaning that transcends the university, let alone genres,
                  fields, and disciplines. Conceived as a kind of spiritual experience, literary narratives
                  may not be “fiction,” after all. Copping to anything else just recapitulates the history
                  of the novel, of <em>Waverley</em>.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For matter to <em>be</em>, for it to have something like an essence, it must also be spiritual. Hence, “to
               be opposed to its own tendency, to itself, to matter, it must be spirit. And it if
               yields to this tendency, it is still spirit. It is spirit in any case; its essence
               is nothing but spiritual. There is no essence but spiritual” (Derrida 22).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               volume. She treats Owensen’s incongruities of style “as symptoms of a historical conflict
               that refuses to be symbolically resolved” (par. 2).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Other ballads recount similarly intense situations. In one, a bride sings about how
               her murdered father harrows the bride’s “parricide lover” (36, l. 460); in another,
               a bard, we are told, during “a night of dread [had] held convention with the dead”
               (75, ll. 747–48); and across the countryside, the narrator informs us, “spirits talk[]
               along the hill[s]” (106, l. 49).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Kandinsky appeals to the analogy of music: “Generally speaking, color directly influences
               the soul. Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with
               many strings. The artist is the hand that plays” (45).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
