            <p class="noCount">This essay examines Sydney Owenson’s strange syntax—at once ornate and truncated,
               full of floating modifiers and attributions that remain forever unresolved—as a medium
               for her explorations of sensation and perception. Tracing the form of her novels in
               conjunction with her meditations on empiricism, it argues that Owenson’s syntax resists
               the ontic and formalizing claims of a Common Sense philosophy of perception. Instead
               her early novels enact, syntactically and therefore figurally, a conception of “life”
               as ceaseless, formless motion and an ethics of interdependency embodied in what Thomas
               Reid called “mere sensation.” </p>

                  <p>To read the novels of Sydney Owenson has always been to be made to think strangely:
                     that is, to encounter, and often to struggle with, anomalies of style, figuration,
                     and form. Percy Shelley’s preoccupation with <em>The Missionary</em>, and his continuing engagement in “Fancy” with what remain, to him, images inaccessible
                     of resolution or realization (or what he calls the capacity to “incorporate”) is at
                     once the best-known and most favorable contemporary response to such an experience
                     of Owenson’s novels (P.B. Shelley 1: 107).

                              respectively, form and philosophical implications. Gelpi attributes to Owenson’s The
                              Missionary some part of the origin of the “drifting atmosphere of reverie” produced
                              by the “associative and evocative image clusters” in Prometheus Unbound (170–71).
                              Hogle makes The Missionary one of the influences on Alastor that pile up “in an astonishing,
                              interweaving transference” coupled with a “dim awareness that his own ‘variability’

                     </div> But his coupling of preoccupation with the strangeness of fancy has close parallels
                     in several more public and more fully explicated reading histories, such as William
                     Gifford’s review of <em>Woman: or, Ida of Athens</em>, from 1809. Writing in the first number of the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, Gifford remarks that the effort of reading the novel, “a hundred similar conundrums,
                     in the compass of half as many pages,” has left him “in despair; . . . turning the
                     leaves of the volume backward and forward.” He speculates that the printer must have
                     “fabricated the requisite number of lines, by shaking the types out of the boxes at
                     a venture,” making the novel “a kind of overgrown <span class="foreign">amphigouri</span>, a heterogeneous combination of events, which, pretending to no meaning, may be innocently
                     permitted to surprise for a moment, and then dropt for ever” (Gifford 50). For John
                     Wilson Croker, who devoted a series of essays in the Dublin <em>Freeman’s Journal</em> to <em>The Wild Irish Girl</em> in 1806–7, reading Owenson is “a task of no small difficulty” that produces a vertigo
                     of “involvement and intricacy,” or focus and scale: “common occurrences are decorated
                     with importance, with mysterious dignity and consequential remark—feebleness mimics
                     strength, and trifles ape grandeur” (3). Geraldine Jewsbury, to whom Owenson was at
                     once a friend and patron, similarly sums up the experience of reading her early works.
                     Before writing the <em>The Missionary: An Indian Tale</em> in 1811, Jewsbury writes, Owenson “read up a great deal for Indian customs, history
                     and antiquities,” but the details of her reading, “manners and customs, races and
                     countries,” become quickly “confounded together in the rose-coloured mist of fine
                     writing and high-flown sentiment. . . . [T]he reader feels disposed to say as Sheridan
                     said, when the servant threw down a china plate with a great crash, without breaking,
                     ‘You rascal! how dare you make all that noise for nothing?’” (Jewsbury 1: 424–25).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Noise for nothing; heterogeneous events without meaning: in one sense, in the emphasis
                     on heterogeneity and clanging disunion, this reading persists in more recent commentary.
                     Terry Eagleton emphasizes, for example, the “formally disheveled” quality of Owenson’s
                     narratives. For Eagleton, Owenson’s irresolutions of form are best understood as a
                     failure of closure and, in turn, as a consequence of Irish political history. He argues
                     that her novels embody a frustrated drive to reconcile the competing ideologies of
                     early nineteenth-century Ireland—“romantic” and “realist”; “domestic” and “political”—and
                     in this negative sense capture the historical “truth” of Ireland’s colonized condition
                     (Eagleton 182, 184). David Lloyd offers a similar but widened perspective on this
                     formal heterogeneity, so that Owenson appears as just one among the group of nineteenth-century
                     Irish novelists whose fractious narratives invariably betray the “insufficiency” of
                     novel form to mediate the fragmentation and violence of Irish history (Lloyd 141).
                     Implicit in these more recent readings is an assumption about narrative form that
                     backreads what Lloyd has called the “laws of integration or harmonization” characteristic
                     of the later nineteenth-century realist novel onto Romantic-period works (Lloyd 133).
                     When such a drive toward formal unity is construed, as Fredric Jameson posits about
                     narrative in general, as “an ideological—but formal and immanent—response to a historical
                     dilemma,” then such novels as Owenson’s most often appear as symptoms of a historical
                     conflict that refuses (for Eagleton and Lloyd, in the absence of the structures of
                     a nation-state) to be symbolically resolved (Jameson 139).

                     and “atheism” that stands as shorthand for a specifically Irish version of English
                     Jacobin ideology—suggests, however, that the novels’ formal strangeness is something
                     more, or other, than a symptom of ideological ambivalence and historical fracture.

                     </div> Such a strangeness could not, of course, have been understood, circa 1810, as a failure
                     to conform to realist conventions. But the consistent and specific bewilderment expressed
                     by contemporary readers suggests that something is taking place in Owenson’s works
                     that is distinct not just from Victorian realist novel form but also from what Franco
                     Moretti has called the “<em>intrinsically contradictory</em>” transitional form of the Romantic <span class="foreign">bildungsroman</span>, with its tensions between “dynamism and limits, restlessness and the ‘sense of an
                     ending,’” or its more specific instantiation in the imperial quest romance described
                     by Sara Suleri (Moretti 6, emphasis in original; Suleri 10–11).

                     </div> It is not only, and not primarily, formal irresolution that troubles Owenson’s earliest
                     readers. Rather, these readers place a greater emphasis on their surprise and bewilderment
                     at encountering an overwhelming yet at the same time frustratingly insubstantial plenitude:
                     Jewsbury’s noisy mist; Croker’s vertigo of scale; Gifford’s turning of pages, at once
                     compulsive and unrequited.</p>
               </div>
               <p>How are we to understand this experience and these motions? This essay will argue
                  that both arise, equally and inseparably, from a gap that opens, for contemporary
                  readers, between Owenson’s descriptions and the readers’ own capacity to conceive
                  of what is described. The irritable reaction of Owenson’s earliest readers to this
                  tension between what Yoon Sun Lee, in her introduction to the present volume, terms
                  “non-spontaneous, purposive expression” and the expectation of “representation” heralds
                  Carl Schmitt’s enraged encounters with what Lee, quoting Jacques Rancière, identifies
                  as the (definitively Romantic) “‘phenomenon of expression as such.’” The gap between
                  description and conception, or expression and representation, is produced by the syntactic
                  form and the lexical range of Owenson’s invocations of sensation and its sources,
                  or, in other words, as I will show, by the play of figuration. </p>
               <p>In what follows, I will explore the relationship of Owenson’s figural practices to
                  conceptual irresolution, readerly motion, and narrative form in her early novels.
                  Attending most closely to <em>Woman: or, Ida of Athens</em> and <em>The Missionary</em>, and to the philosophical essays Owenson, as Lady Morgan, published alongside autobiographical
                  anecdotes and opinions in <em>The Book of the Boudoir</em> in 1829, I will propose that this quartet of critical concerns—conception, figuration,
                  motility, and fractured form—is the register, for readers, of what I would like to
                  call an ethics of sensation in Owenson’s works. As such, it demands that these works
                  be read in relation not only to the histories of national and narrative form but also
                  to the intersecting histories of empiricist and idealist philosophies of sensation
                  and what recent scholarship has begun to see as the closely related topic of Romantic
                  understandings of the relationship between organic form and the sciences of life.</p>

                  <p>Owenson may seem a surprising candidate for a philosophical reading: her work has
                     not been addressed by any of the major recent scholarship on the history of sensation,
                     and, to the extent that her novels have been considered in conjunction with empiricist
                     thought, the readings have tended to concentrate exclusively on her invocations of
                     political sympathy.

                     elaborately, but in a context designed retrospectively to inform readings of her novels—about
                     her interest in contemporary philosophy, particularly questions of sensation and of
                     life. By her early teens, she writes, she had been broadly “influenced” by “the value
                     of philosophy and the importance of chemistry”: she took “infinite delight” in Locke’s
                     theories of sensation but found Kantian idealism “vague and unsatisfactory” (though
                     it is not clear that she ever read Kant) (Morgan, “Raconteurs” 1: 32; “Richard Kirwan
                     Esq.” 1: 60). In middle age she enjoyed discussing philosophy with her husband, though
                     on occasion, when she forgot herself, “giving [her]self the air of talking metaphysics
                     . . . and throwing in a word on the <em>Doctrine of Causation</em>” in front of male visitors, “a look” from Sir Thomas Charles Morgan could quickly
                     send her back to conventionally feminine topics such as landscape, with which she
                     “made ‘pure description hold the place of sense’” (Morgan, “Doctrine of Causation”
                     1: 191–92).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Even when most absorbed in metaphysical discussion, however, Morgan remained less
                  interested in “sense” than in sensation. She is canonically Lockean on the derivation
                  from sensation of what she calls “natural causes,” but what Locke identified as the
                  relation between a “Cause” and what is “produced by” it she redefines correlationally,
                  as the observed “concurrence of certain antecedents with certain consequences” (Locke
                  324, 2: 26 §1; Morgan, “Doctrine of Causation” 1: 193). Elsewhere she seems to differ
                  more explicitly from Locke on the relationship of sensation to the metaphysics of
                  causality. What is for Locke evidence of “the Qualities, that are really in things
                  themselves” is for Morgan a thing in itself: she dispenses with Locke’s view of “<em>simple</em> Ideas” as “the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things” and “<em>complex</em> Ideas <em>of Substances</em>” as “Representations of Substances, as they really are,” and with his distinction
                  between “real” and “fantastical” ideas, or those “with a Foundation in Nature” and
                  those without (Locke, <em>Essay</em> 372–74, 2: 30 §1–2, 5). For Morgan, in contrast, “to prove a proposition means, to
                  render it evident to the senses—nothing more” (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158).
                  This emphasis on sensation allows her to remain agnostic on such questions as the
                  nature and qualities of the “external world” even as she distances herself from “the
                  idealist” who “has no ground for believing any other existence than his own mind”
                  (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>With such a statement, Morgan firmly separates her epistemological musings not only

                     the major metaphysical schools of her own time: Kantian idealism, with its positing
                     of an extrasensory noumenal realm that grounds all knowledge even while it remains
                     inaccessible save to the intuitions of reason, and Thomas Reid’s common sense philosophy,
                     with its establishment of a given though incompletely perceptible world as an arrest
                     to the skeptical implications of empiricism.

                     </div> Gifford complained that Owenson was an enemy of, or perhaps merely allergic to, “revelation”
                     (52). He may have been more accurate when he wrote, with Gifford, of Owenson’s “inveterate
                     obliquity” of “mind, which prevents her from perceiving, or stating a fact as it really
                     exists”; certainly there is more evidence in her writings for such a claim (Croker
                     and Gifford 261). In <em>The Missionary</em>, Owenson comments that the “waking dream”-like experience that suffuses the eponymous
                     protagonist Hilarion on his arrival in “Cashmire” is “sensation” that has “survived
                     all power of perception” (Owenson, <em>The Missionary</em> 105). And, as we will see, Owenson does turn away—not glancingly, but persistently—from
                     what Reid called “perception,” or the cognitive assemblage of sensations into approximations
                     (imperfect figurings) of the things of the given world, the secular counterpart of
                     “revelation,” or at least of metaphysical doctrine (Reid 290).</p>

                     Owenson dwells constantly in sensation. Here, for example, is a passage from the extended
                     (eight-page) scene that introduces Ida Rosemeli, the heroine of <em>Woman</em>, a passage characteristic enough to make one of Gifford’s three epigraphic examples
                     of “a hundred similar conundrums in half as many pages” (Gifford 50). In the scene
                     Ida is asleep and seen for the first time from a distance by an “English traveller”:

                        aerial character; and her gently languid respiration alone, spoke her not a thing

                        sleep seemed still to struggle with the renovating energy of awaked intelligence.

                     conceits and uncertain pronoun reference (in the analogy between modesty and translucent
                     veiling, a comparison founded on the simile form of “seem[ing],” it is impossible
                     to determine whether the “apparent tissue of woven air” is a figural or material garment,
                     or, somehow, both), strings of adjectives whose numerousness and abstraction confirms

                     “ease,” and “imitation” are at stake?) (Owenson, <em>Woman</em> 1: 23, 26). By Owenson’s diction and syntax, as in the narrator’s semantic claim,
                     Ida’s presence is “at once betrayed and concealed” (1: 23). Is Ida, as the novel’s
                     title suggests, a “woman”? A “form” (1: 28)? A “vision” (1: 28)? It is only certain,
                     from Owenson’s thickly worded but strangely vaporous and “vanish[ing]” description,
                     that she is “not a thing,” at least “not a thing which fancy only had embodied,” even
                     as the scene invites “the [whose?] fancy” to “wander . . . through imagined worlds”
                     (1: 23).</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is worthwhile, here, to compare Owenson’s scene with Reid’s pioneering 1764 distinction
                  between sensation and perception, which worked, from within empiricism, to arrest
                  the skeptical impulse latent from the beginnings of associationist theories of mind.
                  It is indeed the case, Reid argues, that sensation is autotelic, “can have no existence
                  but in a sentient mind,” but “perception . . . hath always an object . . . which may
                  exist whether it be perceived or not. . . . [T]he perception of an object implies
                  both a conception of its form, and a belief of its present existence” (Reid 289–90).
                  This common sense brake on skepticism functions poetically as well as metaphysically:
                  if for Locke, as Natania Meeker and Helen Thompson have argued, “substance can only
                  be apprehended as figure,” then for Reid, in the process of perception, the figure
                  takes fully resolved shape with a stable referent in the things of nature (Thompson
                  and Meeker 185). “The signs by which objects are presented to us in perception,” he
                  proposes, “are the language of nature to man,” so that “there is certainly a resemblance,
                  and necessary connection, between the visible figure and magnitude of a body, and
                  its real figure and magnitude” (Reid 153, 296). Though the form of a “visible figure”
                  may be more or less complete according to the viewer’s perceptual capabilities, as
                  in the case of “a man born blind,” the thing perceived will always appear to a sighted
                  viewer with all the formal completeness of a reflection in a mirror (Reid 154). The
                  figural range of perception, in short, is determined by poles of incompleteness and
                  completeness, or partially and fully apprehended form, which is to say, synecdoche
                  on the one hand and metaphor on the other. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The presence of the thing, and the referential bond between this “real figure” and
                     the “visible figures” that represent it in the mind, is never in question in Reid’s
                     philosophy, for it is warranted by what he calls “the Author of [his] being” (Reid
                     294). In Owenson’s <em>Woman</em>, in contrast, lexical range and plenitude and syntactical restlessness and uncertainty
                     mean that the figures of sensation are left unresolved. They don’t fully take shape,
                     and the glancing sensations they capture are left unpinned to the assumption of a
                     stable referent. Thus they are best understood as a series of metonymies: shifting
                     sensations, often minute, impermanently as well as imperfectly established as a partial
                     reference to any fully formed or fixed “external thing.” Not for nothing did Owenson’s
                     contemporaries describe her early novels as “extravagant,” or wandering, figuratively,
                     outside the straight paths of representation marked by metaphor, synecdoche, and common
                     sense philosophy.

               <h2><span class="head">3. Form and the ethics of sensation: Owenson on “identity” and “life”</span></h2>
               <p>In the series of philosophical essays included in the <em>Book of the Boudoir</em>, Owenson Morgan argues that the process of wandering of, and in, sensation, is commensurate
                  with “life.” “To measure human action against time, and to overtake it,” she writes
                  in the essay on “Rapidity,” “is to double existence. To live fast (properly understood)
                  is not to wear out life briefly, but to multiply the sensations which extend it” (Morgan,
                  “Rapidity” 1: 95). Such a motile and formless life is, in turn, in Morgan’s assessment,
                  at odds with conventional notions of unified, stable being—with such notions, equally,
                  as applied to the sensing agent and to what and how the agent senses. The constant
                  train of sensation contributes to what Morgan calls, in the opening essay of <em>The Book of the Boudoir</em>, “the great mystery of identity,” which she describes with the observation that “even
                  the hand which traced the first line of this farrago, is not the same agent of the
                  same volition, with that which will write the last” (Morgan, “My Book” 1: 5). Her
                  agnostic apprehension of “identity” denies her readers even the consolatory “fiction
                  of continu’d existence” Hume proposed to account for the human “propension to unite
                  . . . broken appearances,” including proprioceptions (205). In 1827, an assessment
                  of <em>The O’Briens and the O’Flahertys</em> in <em>The Monthly Review</em> had complained that “Lady Morgan is still devoted to the tessellated style of writing”
                  (Review 518). <em>The Book of the Boudoir</em> responds to such references to her preferred prose form (from tessellation to “farrago”)
                  by associating her composite, mobile, and formless prose with the mixing of sensations
                  that comprises “life” and complicates “identity.”</p>

                  <p>Defining Romanticism as “a wide-sweeping inquiry into the phenomena of life,” Denise
                     Gigante has argued for the prominence of epigenesist conceptions (those focused on
                     the “power” of self-actualizing formal potential and self-organizing form) in the
                     poetic as well as the biological thought of the period (Gigante 26, 39). For her the
                     key figure in Romantic debates about life is Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who repurposed
                     his key phrase “multëity in Unity,” the definition of poetic beauty, to define life
                     as “unity in multëity” (Gigante 3).

                     </div> Against the dominance of Coleridge, Amanda Jo Goldstein has recently posited the Shelley
                     of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, who, Goldstein argues, pursues a “Lucretian poetics of transience” wherein the relations
                     between and mutual impacts of living, not-quite-living, no-longer-living, and more-conventionally-understood-as-inanimate
                     beings and things come together in an understanding of life as collective, contingent,
                     historical and therefore perpetually in flux (Goldstein 62–63). To make this argument,
                     for Goldstein, is also to take issue with Paul de Man’s reading of figuration (understood
                     both as troping generally and as face-giving, or prosopoeia) as “a power radically
                     alien to life, relation, and sense” and the dominant force in Shelley’s poem (Goldstein
                     66).

                              to figuration and is figured by the measured treat of the Shape All Light in The Triumph
                              of Life (de Man, “Shelley Disfigured” 119).</span></div>
                     </div> Here her argument takes an explicitly ethical turn: when the category “life” takes
                     on a distinct ontological status, “life” also becomes a comparative and implicitly
                     value-laden term (Goldstein 69). Or, as Goldstein puts it, “when science affirms specific
                     forms of life [those less organized; those less fully formed] to be medically less
                     alive already, it helps to render their deaths less reprehensible—a logic familiar
                     to twenty-first-century readers from its realization in fascist thanatopolitics” (70).
                     For her Lucretian Shelley, in contrast, faces are everywhere together. In the final
                     few words of this essay, I would like to consider the implications of Goldstein’s
                     rigorous and important reading of Shelley for approaching the novelist whose poetics
                     of sensation helped make Shelley think so strangely.</p>

                  <p>Owenson’s motion-capture of the play of sensation that is tantamount to life is at
                     least as tropical as the face-giving <em>Triumph of Life</em> for which it provided Shelley with a model. Yet unlike Shelley, or Lucretius, the
                     Owenson of <em>Woman</em> and <em>The Missionary</em> rarely, if ever, makes faces. Her closest approach to prosopoeia might be the moment
                     when the narrator asserts that the scene of the protagonist’s “delightful and delighted
                     wanderings . . . seem[s] . . . to smile into a luxurious garden” as the “English traveller”
                     approaches Ida’s home (Owenson, <em>Woman</em> 17–18). Here, though, the narrator’s figuring of the traveller’s sensation yields
                     a motion and a resemblance rather than a face and an identity, however contingent,
                     whether singular or composite. As ever in Owenson’s early work, sensation, while figural
                     (here, that most mobile of tropes, the simile) is specifically not form-making.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Carlson’s account of Shelley’s similes is relevant here: “Shelley’s similes work against
                              entrenchment in linguistic and ethical realms, perpetually un-building the object
                              world, including its putative opposition to the internal life of the subject, by showing
                              objects to be as ethereal and ever-changing subjects and the so-called subjective”
                              (Carlson 77).</span></div>
                     </div> If we compare Shelley’s Lucretian atomism with Owenson’s descriptions of sensation,
                     we will discern Owenson’s contrasting emphasis on a perpetual motion of fleeting minutiae,
                     atoms of sense that elude formal resolution: a rigorous (and, with respect to Shelley’s
                     prosopoeia, proleptic) resistance to pareidolias of all kinds.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I have cited the passage in <em>The Missionary</em> in which Hilarion, transformed by his journey through Cashmire, is stripped of “perception”
                  while “sensation” survives (Owenson, <em>The Missionary</em> 105). Let me now add that in <em>The Missionary</em> Owenson contrasts Hilarion’s “waking dream,” in which feelings associated with the
                  “enjoyment” of sensation “possess . . . themselves of his whole being,” with the early,
                  imperial ambition he conceives on his arrival in India (Owenson, <em>The Missionary</em> 105). On first seeing India’s “shores, which were rather imagined than perceived
                  in so great an interval,” his “spirit . . . partook [sic], for a moment, the sublimity
                  of the objects he contemplated, the force of the characters he reflected on, and,
                  expanding with its elevation, mingled with the universe” (Owenson, <em>The Missionary</em> 80–81). This is not just a formal but also an explicitly ethical break with perception
                  as a scene of self-making, retroactively characterized, by contrast with the Cashmire
                  passages, as hubris and grandiloquence.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>By emphasizing the unbridgeable gap between description and things, Owenson prompts
                     her readers to consider their own composite, mobile quality and their suffusion in
                     a world of sensation—an experience that, she reminds them in <em>The Missionary</em>, can also be understood as the varied texture of love. What her contemporaries called
                     decadent (but also recognized as radical), and what subsequent readers have sometimes
                     dismissed as an effete leisured dalliance becomes an ethics of interdependency as
                     pleasure—lacking in determined outcomes, radically unproductive and, therefore, in
                     Owenson’s terms, “free.”

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The adjective “free” is everywhere in Woman and The Missionary; it not only refers
                              to republican polities (the opposite of “slavery”) but also to “love” as an “intimacy”
                              of “mind” and “heart” (Owenson, Woman 1: 202; 3: 161). Carlson writes illuminatingly
                              about “freedom” and love in Shelley; Jackson makes a compelling case for the ideological
                              character of Erasmus Darwin’s aesthetics of pleasure, which influenced Owenson philosophically
                              and formally (Jackson, “Erasmus Darwin’s Romanticism” 175–77, 187). See also Burgess,
                              “On Being Moved” 314–18. For an “effusive” and “aristocratic” Owenson, see …</span></div>
                     </div> Such an ethics stops short of what Tim Milnes, in his essay in this volume on the
                     essayistic and pragmatic character of empiricism between Hume and J. S. Mill, identifies
                     as the “possibility of a shared experience,” which, Milnes argues, is the implicitly
                     ethical as well as epistemological goal of Romantic moral philosophy. Yet Owenson’s
                     prose, like the philosophical essays of Charles Lamb and others, both avowedly subscribes
                     to and formally enacts a conception of literary form and literary experience that
                     is, like the sensation it cultivates and describes, exuberantly autotelic. Such an
                     ethics of sensation emerges with inconceivable but especially insistent liveliness
                     when it is read amid the histories of Romantic form and life.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Most relevant to this essay are the comments of Gelpi and Hogle, on sensation in conjunction,
               respectively, form and philosophical implications. Gelpi attributes to Owenson’s <em>The Missionary</em> some part of the origin of the “drifting atmosphere of reverie” produced by the “associative
               and evocative image clusters” in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (170–71). Hogle makes <em>The Missionary</em> one of the influences on <em>Alastor</em> that pile up “in an astonishing, interweaving transference” coupled with a “dim awareness
               that his own ‘variability’ may come from a movement, a Lucretian one at bottom, commanding
               the verses [and, in Owenson’s case, the prose] of his older contemporaries just as
               much as his own” (45–46). More recent criticism, by, for example, Wilson and Goldstein,
               has not elaborated these brief mentions of Owenson’s connection with Shelley’s formal
               practice or its relations to sensation. A second well-known, and related, though less
               favorable contemporary comment on Owenson’s anomalies of form and sensation is Austen’s
               snarky remark to her sister in January 1809: “We have got <em>Ida of Athens</em> by Miss Owenson. . . . We have only read the Preface yet; but her Irish Girl does
               not make me expect much.—If the warmth of her Language could affect the Body, it might
               be worth reading in this weather” (166). See also Burgess, “Sydney Owenson’s Tropics”

               philosophical tradition of empiricism (read here in its iteration as moral philosophy,
               particularly its emphasis on sentiment and sympathy, here associated with “romance”),

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">As Ameriks points out, contemporaries, not least Kant’s first interpreters and expositors,
               tended to understand Reid and common sense as Kantian precursors (21–22). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Terada’s model takes note that most if not all Romantic phenomenophiles are men, commenting
               that some narrative genres of the period, notably the Gothic novel, that were “next
               door to mere phenomenality” were more hospitable to female writers.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">The scene of the traveller’s distantiated gaze, familiar to contemporary readers from
               Owenson’s <em>The Wild Irish Girl</em>, is here substantially rewritten in being deprived of substantive details: the “scarlet,
               “bodkin,” and “diadem” of <em>The Wild Irish Girl</em>’s Glorvina gives way to vapors, and the traveller Horatio’s experience of Glorvina,
               who seems to him “like the incarnation of some pure ethereal spirit” but whose beauty
               is anchored in the “symmetrical <em>contour</em>” of her body—a literal “figure” indeed—yields to the mobile agentless attitudes of
               <em>Woman</em> (Owenson, <em>Wild Irish Girl</em> 48).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">According to a review of <em>Woman</em> in the <em>Dublin Satirist</em> of November 2009, quoted in Belanger 119, Owenson’s “extravagant picture” would be
               “more creditable to her head and heart” if she were “to keep within the bounds of
               decency, probability, and common sense.” I rely here on Paul de Man’s account of metonymy
               as “purely relational” and his account of metaphor as associated with “an element
               of truth” in his reading of Proust, and follow de Man’s association, in this reading,
               of synecdoche with metaphor rather than metonymy (de Man 14). For a reading of sensation
               as a figural event, which Reid, like de Man’s Proust, pursues, the association is
               more convincing than what de Man acknowledges is the synecdoche-metonymy pairing more
               common in “classical rhetoric” (de Man 63n).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               by which language performs the erasure of its own positions”—is a process internal
               to figuration and is figured by the measured treat of the Shape All Light in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (de Man, “Shelley Disfigured” 119).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               entrenchment in linguistic and ethical realms, perpetually un-building the object
               world, including its putative opposition to the internal life of the subject, by showing
               objects to be as ethereal and ever-changing subjects and the so-called subjective”

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The adjective “free” is everywhere in <em>Woman</em> and <em>The Missionary</em>; it not only refers to republican polities (the opposite of “slavery”) but also to
               “love” as an “intimacy” of “mind” and “heart” (Owenson, <em>Woman</em> 1: 202; 3: 161). Carlson writes illuminatingly about “freedom” and love in Shelley;
               Jackson makes a compelling case for the ideological character of Erasmus Darwin’s
               aesthetics of pleasure, which influenced Owenson philosophically and formally (Jackson,
               “Erasmus Darwin’s Romanticism” 175–77, 187). See also Burgess, “On Being Moved” 314–18.
               For an “effusive” and “aristocratic” Owenson, see for example Moore.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
