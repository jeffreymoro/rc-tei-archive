            <p class="noCount">A recent media turn in Romantic studies has foregrounded the ballad—and poetry more
               generally—as a privileged site for understanding how questions about medium and mediality
               feature in the writing of the period. But do such questions feature in the era’s prose
               genres, as well? And is it possible to talk about a medium of Romantic prose as Celeste
               Langan and Maureen N. McLane talk about a <em>medium of Romantic poetry</em>? In this essay, I suggest that the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” and
               to show this I turn to the prose tales of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who
               not only recognized bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but
               also understood ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of each
               other. Like the ballad, I argue, the tale, too, can be understood as a “hybrid oral
               and textual practice” (in Paula McDowell’s words), a prose form that exhibits a subtle
               self-consciousness about its own medial status.</p>

               <p>In his 1800 Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, Wordsworth asks, “where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to
                  typify the affinity between metrical and prose composition” (<em>Major Works</em> 602)? One answer, surely, is in the lyrical ballads themselves: in poems such as
                  “Simon Lee,” “We are Seven,” and “The Thorn,” that is, which adopt “language really
                  used by men” (597) and dispense with “what is usually called poetic diction” (600).
                  Readers might have to “struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness” (596)
                  before any such bonds can be affirmed, as Wordsworth admitted in his revised Preface
                  of 1802. Still, the poet remained decided in his opinion that “there neither is, nor
                  can be, any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition”
                  (602).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Another answer might be gleaned in the scores of titles published in the same two-year
                     period, 1800–02, in which the words “ballad” and “tale” seem to be used interchangeably.
                     Wishing to write “in the manner of” Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, for example, Mary Robinson published <em>Lyrical Tales</em> in 1800.

                     </div> In 1801, Matthew Lewis’s collection of ballad imitations appeared as <em>Tales of Wonder</em>.

                     </div> A year later, Anne Bannerman published <em>Tales of Superstition and Chivalry</em>, another collection of ballads. 1802 also saw the first two volumes of Walter Scott’s <em>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</em>, a collection of “tales” of “elder times” (as Scott described them in the dedication)
                     that recovered the rich ballad culture of the Scottish border country. William Earle’s <em>Welsh Legends: A Collection of Popular Oral Tales</em> (1802) features both verse and prose compositions, including prose tales on which,
                     as Earle explains, the ballads “of this and other countries” were “founded” (vi).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In certain respects, the conflation of “ballad” and “tale” is confusing in that both
                     were well-known forms at the turn of the century, the former as a verse form, the
                     latter, increasingly, as a prose form. The ballad had undergone a revival in the latter
                     half of the eighteenth century, thanks to the publication of Thomas Percy’s <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em> (1765) and to what Katie Trumpener calls the “new” genre of the ballad <em>collection</em> (xi). And it was in these same years that the tale emerged as its own, distinct generic
                     category, with a first major peak in popularity in the 1790s, followed by a second,
                     even more dramatic rise in the 1820s, when “tale” surpassed both “novel” and “romance”
                     to become the most popular label for prose fiction in the decade.

                              the first is the moral or didactic (as in the work of Jean-Francois Marmontel, Hannah
                              More, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth), the second is the regional and traditional
                              (as in the work of Edgeworth (again), Walter Scott, and James Hogg). The foregrounding
                              of the moment of telling or teaching in both might be said to link these two major
                              associations. The present article will focus on the tale’s strong regional and oral-traditional
                              associations, but for a general view that considers both major strands of…</span></div>
                     </div> In other respects, however, the conflation of ballads and tales is not so difficult
                     to account for. Both words had strong associations with what had come to be understood
                     as “oral tradition” and both reflected a general sense of “nervousness” about the
                     fate of songs and stories in a print-saturated age.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Paula McDowell argues that in the latter half of the eighteenth century, following
                              a new interest in the ballad and in the controversy surrounding James Macpherson’s
                              Ossian poems, “we see an epochal shift in attitudes toward ‘oral tradition,’ and the
                              crystallization of the modern secularized version of this concept” (McDowell, “Mediating
                              Media,” 240). See also Nicholas Hudson, “Constructing Oral Tradition: the Origins
                              of the Concept in Enlightenment Intellectual Culture.” The Spoken Word: Oral Culture

                     </div> Indeed, the confusion already is evident in the series of publications that got the
                     whole ballad revival started: I mean the proto-tales, or prose translations of Gaelic
                     ballads, that James Macpherson called <em>The Poems of Ossian</em> (1760–65). “Pleasant are the words of the song,” says Cuchullin in book three of <em>Fingal</em>, “and lovely are the tales of other times” (73). Or, in “Oina-Morul. a Poem”: “I
                     seize the tales as they pass, and pour them forth in song” (323). “Tale” and “ballad”
                     refer generally to “story,” “tradition,” “antiquity.” But what was new and distinctive
                     about these two as forms, especially compared with, say, the novel or the polite poetry
                     of the eighteenth century, was precisely the attention they drew to the act of remediating
                     traditional, oral stories in print. Both ballads and tales exhibit what Jussi Parikka
                     calls “the media-archaeological spirit of thinking the new and the old in parallel
                     lines” (2). As such, they bring to the fore the very question of medium itself.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet of the two answers offered here to Wordsworth’s question about affinities between
                     metrical and prose composition, only one—the yoking together of lyric and ballad—has
                     received scholarly attention. The other—the conflation of ballad and tale—has hardly
                     been remarked upon at all, not even by those recent scholars whose work constitutes
                     an important media turn in the field and highlights the significance of the ballad
                     in particular for understanding the “medium” of Romantic poetry.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In terms of the latter, I’m thinking especially of the work of Maureen N. McLane (Balladeering,
                              Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry). In terms of a more general
                              media turn in Romantic studies, see, in addition to McLane, Celeste Langan (“Understanding
                              Media in 1805”); Langan and McLane (“The Medium of Romantic Poetry”); Paula McDowell,
                              “Mediating Media Past and Present”; Kevis Goodman, Georgic Modernity and British Romanticism:
                              Poetry and the Mediation of History (Cambridge UP, 2008); and Clifford Siskin, “Mediated

                     </div> There are, I think, a couple of reasons for the silence. First, although the tale
                     was a recognized form in the Romantic period, distinguished from the novel by booksellers,
                     publishers, and readers, it has not been considered as such in our own time, which
                     tends to see it merely as one subgenre in a larger “system” of novels.

                              (6)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As in, for instance, Franco Moretti, Graphs, Maps, Trees: “Both synchronically and
                              diachronically . . . the novel is the system of its genres” (30). Clifford Siskin
                              has used the term “novelism” to describe the “habitual subordination of writing to
                              the novel” (172–3).</span></div>
                     </div> Second, the media turn in eighteenth-century and Romantic studies has focused mostly
                     on verse, finding in “the situation of British poetry, 1760–1830,” as Maureen McLane
                     writes, “a window onto the transhistorical condition of poetic ‘mediality’” more generally—“mediality”
                     being “the condition of existing in media, whether oral, manuscript, print, or digital”
                     (<em>Balladeering</em> 6).

                              is introduced.</span></div>
                     </div> Without necessarily intending to do so, such accounts sometimes collapse prose into
                     the larger category of print and ignore a genre such as the tale which, like the ballad,
                     can also be described—in Paula McDowell’s words—as a “hybrid oral and textual practice”
                     (“Mediating” 242).

                     </div> In what follows, I examine the ways that the tale, too, exhibits a subtle self-consciousness
                     about its own medial status and I ask whether the features and history of this form
                     open up possibilities for talking about a medium of Romantic prose.

                     </div> To do this, I turn to the work of James Hogg, a Romantic-period writer who not only
                     recognized bonds of affinity between metrical and prose composition, but also understood
                     ballads and tales to be versions—interchangeable, in a sense—of one other.</p>

                  <p>Hogg’s 1830 tale, “The Mysterious Bride,” opens with references to two writers who
                     had a profound impact on his career. The first is Scott, a friend and competitor whose
                     wildly successful “school of chivalry” was always threatening to edge out of the literary
                     market Hogg’s own, more eccentric, “mountain and fairy school” (Hogg <em>Anecdotes</em> 9). Concerned about what he saw as a recent turn away from belief in ghosts and spirits,
                     and about Scott’s comments on the subject in his <em>Keepsake</em> tale of 1829, “My Aunt Margaret’s Mirror,” Hogg exclaims, “Even Sir Walter Scott is
                     turned renegade, and, with his stories made up of half-and-half . . . is trying to
                     throw cold water on the most certain, though the most impalpable, phenomena of human

                              tale its most striking formal development” (Scott’s Shadow 35).</span></div>
                     </div> That Scott would then use the form to question the tale’s great topos of the supernatural
                     only added fuel to the fire.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The second reference follows immediately from the first and expands the argument about
                  the supernatural to include another form associated with tradition: the ballad. As
                  a means of challenging the recent rejection of ghosts and spirits, Hogg exclaims:
                  “Before [naysayers like Scott] had ventured to assert such things, I wish they had
                  been where I have often been; or, in particular, where the Laird of Birkendelly was
                  on St Lawrence’s eve, in the year 1777, and sundry times subsequent to that” (155).
                  The place in question is the road from Birkendelly, in the “great muckle village of
                  Balmawhapple”; the Laird to whom Hogg’s narrator almost silently gives way is casually
                  riding along and “chanting a song” by “a certain, or rather uncertain, bard ycleped
                  Robert Burns, who made a number of good songs” (155). This song, Hogg writes, “was
                  an amorous song of great antiquity, which, like all the said bard’s best songs, was
                  sung one hundred and fifty years before he was born” (155). “O let me in this ae night,”
                  the song referred to, was first taken up by Burns in 1792 when he modified it for
                  inclusion in James Johnson’s <em>Scots Musical Museum</em> (1787–1803). He returned to it again several times between 1793 and 1795 following
                  a request from George Thomson to contribute to his <em>A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs </em>(1793–1818).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>“Oh let me in this ae night,” sings a lover standing outside a woman’s window: he’s
                     cold and wet and complains that “love has bound [him], hand and foot.” But the woman
                     is not persuaded: “Gae back the gate ye came again / I winna let you in, jo—,” she
                     responds (Kinsley 485). These lines are from Burns, the bard Hogg mentions in his
                     tale. However, the lines that Hogg actually provides are from another, earlier version,
                     much like the one published in <em>The Scots Musical Museum</em> and based on David Herd’s <em>Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs</em> (1776). In this version, too, a man pleads to be admitted to his lover’s house:

                     two stanzas are presented in reversed order. Indeed, both versions by Burns (in the <em>Musical Museum</em> and in Kinsley) follow Herd for the first eight lines. But the three versions are
                     quite different in their endings. The later Burns version is the most chaste of the
                     three: it was, after all, commissioned by Thomson, and the Burns whom Thomson wanted
                     for his collection was the pious, sentimental Burns of “The Cotter’s Saturday Night,”
                     not the bawdy Burns of such songs as would be printed a few years later in <em>The Merry Muses of Caledonia </em>(1799).

                     </div> Although Hogg does not provide the actual lines, he hints at them when he writes,

                     at the catastrophe, when, ere ever aware, he beheld, a short way before him, an uncommonly
                     elegant and beautiful girl walking in the same direction with him” (155–56). The word
                     “catastrophe” can mean “a conclusion generally unhappy,” as Samuel Johnson defined
                     it; “a sudden disaster, as in the <em>OED</em>; or a “convulsion affecting the earth’s surface,” which was a new usage in Hogg’s
                     time derived from the emerging science of geology (also listed in the <em>OED</em>). Hogg’s use of the word might be said to capitalize on all three meanings. Here
                     are the concluding verses of Herd’s version:
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                     </blockquote> That Hogg’s laird is able to laugh at this catastrophe is somewhat ironic—it’s “wierd,”
                     we might say—as it foreshadows his own unhappy conclusion: later in the tale, the
                     laird’s “blackened corpse” is discovered at the very spot where the elegant and beautiful
                     girl first appeared to him, on the day the two of them were to be married. “This woful
                     catastrophe,” Hogg writes, repeating the word he used earlier to describe the end
                     of the ballad, “struck the neighborhood with great consternation, so that nothing
                     else was talked of” (166). The elegant and beautiful girl is, of course, the mysterious
                     bride of the title—the ghost of one Jane Ogilvy, who, long ago, let a man in one night,
                     so to speak. After losing her “maidenhead” she is jilted by the man, Allan Sandison,
                     the grandfather of the laird singing the tune, who forsakes her to wed “the great
                     heiress of Birkendelly.” Ogilvy’s ghost takes its revenge on Sandison’s heir, and
                     we come to understand that a similar catastrophe befell the previous generation of
                     Sandisons, as well.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Hogg, then, refers to one version of a ballad—by Burns—and cites another, a version
                  “that is more direct in defining the ‘catastrophe’ that results from admitting the
                  laird ‘this ae night,’” as Hogg’s recent editor, Thomas C. Richardson, puts it (<em>Blackwood’s</em> 433, n. 155d). It’s a clever bit of play, showing not only that Hogg knew a good
                  deal about different versions of ballads but also drawing attention to the process
                  of transmission itself: from the song “sung one hundred and fifty years” before Burns’s
                  birth to the different versions collected by Herd, Johnson, and Thomson, and on to
                  Hogg’s own tale. Indeed, Hogg seems to suggest that his tale is yet another instance
                  in this process, part of a living tradition comprised of individual memory (what the
                  narrator characterizes as “facts that happened in my own remembrance” [155]) and oral
                  lore as collected in songs and stories. Hogg does not try to smooth over the differences
                  brought about in the process or to “conflate sources so as to produce a single representative
                  text”—as, for example, David Atkinson suggests that Scott did in his <em>Minstrelsy </em>and Percy did before him in his <em>Reliques</em> (Atkinson 120). Rather than seeing the ballad as a “closed, original, and seminal
                  utterance,” Hogg understands it “as a constant and multiple production” (Atkinson
                  23). The ballad’s “appropriate organizing principle,” as Atkinson argues, “is precisely
                  one of proliferation” (23). The laird in Hogg’s version of the story might be singing
                  the tune that Burns’s verses are set to while chanting the words printed in Herd’s
                  edition or combining elements from all of the versions. The tale thus highlights the
                  ballad’s “inherent” instability even as it becomes yet another version (Atkinson 182).</p>
               <p>My aim here is not to reduce “The Mysterious Bride” to an allegory about the pitfalls
                  of ballad editing. But I do want to suggest that it reveals an acute awareness of
                  how the ballad exists somewhere between orality and print and of how the tale, though
                  written in prose, can be understood to be part of the “multiple production” of the
                  ballad, either following from it, as in Hogg, or preceding it, as in the Earle example
                  cited above. The mysterious bride from whom the tale takes its title is, in a sense,
                  conjured into being from the singing of the Burns song: so sudden is her appearance
                  on the road that the laird assumes that she must have “risen out of the earth” (156).
                  And in a description that sounds like it could be of the antiquarian ballad collection
                  itself, Hogg writes that when the body of the young Sandison was discovered, “[e]very
                  ancient tradition and modern incident were raked together, compared, and combined”
                  (166). To little effect, it might be said. Hogg’s tale would seem to offer another
                  instance of what Ian Duncan, writing about Hogg’s <em>Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</em> (1824), calls “a grisly parody of the late Enlightenment project of antiquarian and
                  literary ‘revival’—the attempt by scholars and poets to recover the remains of national
                  traditions, buried in a primitive countryside” (xi). Instead of raking, comparing,
                  and combining with the hope of arriving at an answer—or text—the mystery is solved
                  by an old woman named Marion Haw, who simply tells another tale. This tale, Hogg notes,
                  has more than a little in common with his own attempts in the genre. “She gave the
                  parishioners a history of the Mysterious Bride, so plausibly correct, but withal so
                  romantic,” he writes, “that everybody said of it, (as is often said of my narratives,
                  with the same narrow-minded prejudice and injustice,) that it was a <em>made story</em>” (166–67; emphasis in the original).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Given the stress in Hogg’s tale on the ballad and its multiple versions, the word
                     “made” as it is used here could be understood to refer to an <em>assembled</em> story—that is, to the raking, comparing and collecting that aims to produce a true
                     or original text, something both “correct” and “romantic,” like a ballad in an eighteenth-century
                     collection. The explicit comparison that Hogg makes, however, is to his “narratives,”
                     a comparison which suggests that a “made” story is something more like a <em>mere</em> fiction or perhaps a story that is too seamless to be true. Something like a novel,
                     that is. This might very well be a dig at Scott or, more generally, at what Matthew
                     Wickman, in his contribution to this issue, describes as “the modern concept of the
                     literary as a species of imaginative writing set against a normative sphere of everyday
                     life.”

                     </div> But if Hogg means to draw a distinction between the tale and the novel, the word “made”
                     would seem to go against my own reading of the former’s major difference from the
                     latter: its self-consciousness about its own medial status. Wouldn’t something that
                     appears to be “made” be something more likely to call attention to its made-ness,
                     or its medium—as in “made of what” or “made how”? This is a point that McLane and
                     Celeste Langan make in their lucid account of “The Medium of Romantic Poetry” (2008).
                     Commenting on a 1799 review of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, in which Charles Burney describes Wordsworth and Coleridge’s project as an “ingenious
                     forgery,” Langan and McLane explain that it is precisely the “forged” aspect of the
                     collection that makes visible poetry’s status as medium. “[T]he ‘retrogradation,’
                     to use Burney’s term, is intentional” (253), they write; Wordsworth and Coleridge,<span class="quote">‘are exploring the ‘medium of poetry’ in another sense [not, as in Burney, as transition
                        from one period to another]: neither its origin nor its end but rather its <em>middle</em>—and by extension, perhaps, its <em>essence</em>. For it may be that the question of a medium and the question of an essence are always
                        bound together: the very possibility of multiple ‘mediations’ produces in turn the
                        question, ‘mediations of what [thing]?’ (254)’</span> Hogg understands the ballad’s essence similarly: its multiple mediations not only
                     open a space for the prose tale, but also allow his own telling to become a new—although
                     not a final—version. But then how is the tale not also forged—or “made”? Wouldn’t
                     a made story be more in keeping with a forged poetry?</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The difference comes down to the medium that fictional prose is so often conflated
                     with—print—and to the genre that has come to stand in for literature more generally
                     in an age of print: the novel.

                     </div> Unlike the ballad or the tale, the novel is a born-print genre: as Walter Benjamin
                     explains, what “distinguishes” it from the latter is “its essential dependence on
                     the book” (87). Such a dependence on the newly naturalized medium of print suggests
                     that the “made” in Hogg’s description has a different character than the “forged”
                     in Langan and McLane’s example. “Made” stories in print are those in which there appears
                     to be no medium whatsoever, no work of forging, making, or mediation. As Catherine
                     Gallagher has shown, novels offer readers the kind of consistency and depth of character
                     which, though the product of fiction, appear consistent with—indeed, coterminous with—real
                     life. “The novel gives us explicit fiction,” she writes, “and simultaneously seems
                     to occlude it” (349). Such occlusion constitutes a kind of immediacy, a new product
                     of “an age in which the medium of the book,” as Friedrich Kittler argues, “is first
                     universal” (117), an age that Kittler dates to 1800. Poetry, too, exhibited the effects
                     of the change. Langan, for instance, describes blank verse as “the redefinition of
                     English poetry by the medium of print,” explaining that a poem like “Tintern Abbey”
                     “appears to reject artifice” and thus to render its medium of communication “invisible”
                     (“Understanding” 53–54). When poetry becomes prose or prose-like, in other words,
                     medium becomes invisible because prose itself has become synonymous with print. A
                     forged poetry, to go back to the example above, brings medium back to the fore by
                     keeping the poetry part active: it resists the conflation of poetry and print, in
                     practice if not in theory, by highlighting the poetic process of forging, or making,
                     as distinct from something already made.</p>

                  <p>The novel, likewise, can be described as the redefinition of storytelling by the medium
                     of print. Plausibly correct and withal so romantic, it, too, appears to reject its
                     own artifice and to obscure the fact of medium. But what then can we say about prose
                     in the period? Is its case a hopeless one, always to be collapsed into the larger
                     category of print, a category that, having become natural and universal, had it made,
                     so to speak? Perhaps the ballad-tale conflation highlighted at the start of this essay
                     is somewhat akin to the poetry-prose conflation Langan analyzes, though here it resists
                     the additional conflation of prose and print by highlighting the former’s continued
                     affinities with poetry, that medium that refused to give way in the face of massive
                     medium change? To say such is not to collapse prose into the larger category of medium.
                     Instead, it is to make medium itself part what Yoon Sun Lee, in her introduction to
                     this issue, describes as “the situated quality of prose,” and especially of prose
                     written in a modern, print-saturated, world.

                     </div> It is interesting to note that the word “tale” can mean both “number” and “story.”
                     Hogg’s friend, Lord Byron, highlights the overlapping registers when he puns on the
                     word in Canto III of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> (1816): “and if thy tale be true,” he exclaims, alluding to the number of bodies that
                     perished on the field of Waterloo and to the story those numbers tell of that decisive
                     battle (l. 308). Hogg, too, brings to the fore the seemingly contradictory registers
                     of number and story—or tally and tale—in his repeated claim that his tales are founded
                     on incidents told again and again or, as in “The Mysterious Bride,” that they are
                     a “relation of facts.” On the one hand, such stories traffic in a realm of experience
                     that is thoroughly grounded in belief, including belief in ghosts, miracles, spirits
                     and all that is inconsistent with real life as represented in novels.

                     it,” says Wordsworth’s speaker in “Simon Lee” (l. 80), making the reader both frustrated
                     and, as McLane shrewdly observes, “like the poet, a ‘maker,’” (<em>Balladeering</em> 227). Tales are part of a process—and a community—in which facts are made in and by
                     the act of transmission.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hogg’s knowledge of the rich history of ballad transmission is hardly surprising:
                     one of his first successes came with “Donald Macdonald” (1801), a patriotic song that
                     gained a popular following in Scotland; and Hogg and his mother, Margaret Laidlaw
                     Hogg, were what McLane describes as “informants” for Scott’s <em>Minstrelsy</em> (<em>Balladeerin</em>g 4). With Scott’s encouragement Hogg published a collection of “ballads and songs
                     founded on facts and legendary tales,” <em>The Mountain Bard</em>, in 1807.

                     market and his most distinctive literary voice. Many of his tales, like “The Mysterious
                     Bride,” engage, build upon, or indirectly comment on the ballad tradition that Hogg
                     was so familiar with.

                     like the mysterious bride herself, by song. In <em>The Mountain Bard</em>, for instance, Hogg includes a ballad imitation, “The Pedlar,” that he published
                     three years earlier in the <em>Scots Magazine</em>. The ballad tells the story of a murdered pedlar and of the discovery, following
                     a bizarre incident in which a recovered heel bone starts “streamin wi’ blood,” of
                     the murderer (<em>Mountain</em>, l. 147). As Hogg’s editor, Suzanne Gilbert, suggests, the “motif” of a part of a
                     victim’s body bearing witness to his fate is common in traditional ballads; it can
                     be seen in “The Cruel Sister,” collected in Scott, and the better known version, “The
                     Twa Sisters,” collected in Francis James Child’s <em>The English and Scottish Popular Ballads</em> (1882–98).

                     a headnote and endnotes. But these spaces are used not to highlight excluded variants
                     or to justify one version over another, but instead to proliferate multiple versions
                     of the “fact” on which the ballad is “founded” (26). The endnotes, for instance, stretch
                     on for many pages and offer multiple instances of the “superstitious awe” (<em>Mountain Bard</em> 31) recorded in the song. “This reminds me of a trifling anecdote, which I will here
                     relate as an instance” (33), Hogg writes. A few paragraphs later: “some, yet alive,
                     have heard John Corry, who was [Mr Boston’s] servant, tell the following story” (34).
                     “A similar story to this of Mr Boston and the pedlar, is told of a contemporary of
                     his, the Reverend Henry Davieson, of Gallashiels . . .” (35). And off he goes again,
                     with one account suggesting another until a tale—indeed, a set of tales—has unfolded
                     in the margins to extend the story and to show it to be alive still, present “amongst

                  <p>In the 1821 edition of <em>The Mountain Bard</em>, Hogg added a number of new ballads, including “The Wife of Crowle,” a version of
                     the famous “Wife of Usher’s Well,” from Scott’s <em>Minstrelsy</em>, which tells the story of three sons drowned at sea who return—as revenants—to feast
                     with their bereaved mother before departing in the morning to go to their graves.
                     Hogg’s version was originally published in his own, short-lived literary periodical, <em>The Spy</em>, in 1810, as “A Fragment.” And as Hogg notes in the headnote to <em>The Mountain Bard</em> version, it is also “given more at large in ‘The Winter Evening Tales’” (312), a collection
                     of prose tales that Hogg published in 1820—his most successful work of fiction. This
                     more-at-large version appears in the first story of the collection, “The Renowned
                     Adventures of Basil Lee,” which was itself published in two fragments earlier in <em>The Spy</em> and tells of the wanderings of the anti-heroic Basil, from a Berwickshire farm to
                     Canada to revolutionary-war America and back to Edinburgh. Along the way Basil encounters
                     the tale of “an old woman who lived in a lone sheiling, at the head of an arm of the
                     sea, called Loch Kios, to whom a ghost paid a visit every night” (<em>Winter</em> 53). The account recorded in “The Wife of Crowle” is here transplanted to the isle
                     of Lewis and then extended in the form of a prose tale.

                     the start of this essay, his deployment of these two forms as versions of one another,
                     interchangeable, in a sense, is a product of the ballad-tale conflation that marks
                     the turn of the century more generally and that can be linked back to Ossian, the
                     ballad revival, and a general sense of anxiety about the fate of old stories in new
                     media. It is tempting to see in the examples given from Hogg a progress of sorts:
                     from the ballad (“Donald Macdonald”), to the ballad and tale existing side by side
                     (as in <em>The Mountain Bard</em> or <em>The Spy</em>), and finally on to the tale: “Basil Lee” or “The Mysterious Bride,” each one taking
                     its starting point from a ballad. That is perhaps a little too neat, though the progression
                     is in keeping with a larger cultural shift in these years, one that saw the tale first
                     confused with the ballad and then, for a time, rivaling it and even displacing it
                     as an object of collection (as in Earle’s <em>Welsh Legends</em> or the more famous example of the <em>Children’s and Household Tales</em> of the Grimm brothers, first published in 1812).

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The tale has two major associations that attach to it in these years of emergence:
               the first is the moral or didactic (as in the work of Jean-Francois Marmontel, Hannah
               More, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth), the second is the regional and traditional
               (as in the work of Edgeworth (again), Walter Scott, and James Hogg). The foregrounding
               of the moment of telling or teaching in both might be said to link these two major
               associations. The present article will focus on the tale’s strong regional and oral-traditional
               associations, but for a general view that considers both major strands of the tale’s
               rise, see Tim Killick, <em>British Short Fiction in the Early Nineteenth Century</em> (2008), and Anthony Jarrells, “Short Fictional Forms and the Rise of the Tale,” in
               <em>The Oxford History of the Novel in English, vol. 2: English and British Fiction 1750–1820</em>, edited by Karen O’Brien and Peter Garside (Oxford UP, 2015), 478–94. On the word
               “tale” surpassing “romance” and “novel” in the 1820s, see Peter Garside, “The English
               Novel in the Romantic Era: Consolidation and Dispersal,” in <em>The English Novel, 1770–1829: A Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction Published

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Paula McDowell argues that in the latter half of the eighteenth century, following
               a new interest in the ballad and in the controversy surrounding James Macpherson’s
               Ossian poems, “we see an epochal shift in attitudes toward ‘oral tradition,’ and the
               crystallization of the modern secularized version of this concept” (McDowell, “Mediating
               Media,” 240). See also Nicholas Hudson, “Constructing Oral Tradition: the Origins
               of the Concept in Enlightenment Intellectual Culture.” <em>The Spoken Word: Oral Culture in Britain, 1500–1850</em>, edited by Adam Fox and Daniel Woolf (Manchester UP, 2002), pp. 240–55. On “nervousness”
               about the spread of print in the eighteenth century, see McDowell, “The Art of Printing
               was Fatal,” p. 56.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In terms of the latter, I’m thinking especially of the work of Maureen N. McLane (<em>Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry</em>). In terms of a more general media turn in Romantic studies, see, in addition to
               McLane, Celeste Langan (“Understanding Media in 1805”); Langan and McLane (“The Medium
               of Romantic Poetry”); Paula McDowell, “Mediating Media Past and Present”; Kevis Goodman,
               <em>Georgic Modernity and British Romanticism: Poetry and the Mediation of History</em> (Cambridge UP, 2008); and Clifford Siskin, “Mediated Enlightenment: the System of

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">“The Mysterious Bride” was published as a continuation of Hogg’s “Shepherd’s Calendar”
               series, which started in <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> in 1819 and was later published as a two-volume collection in 1829. I am aware of
               the pitfalls of conflating narrator and author in Romantic works and understand, too,
               that the shepherd-narrator that Hogg employs for his series is a creation based on
               Hogg’s own experiences, on people he knew in Ettrick, and on the persona of “the Shepherd”
               as it appeared in the pages of <em>Blackwood’</em>s. Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience and to more clearly position Hogg the
               writer in relation to the references and sources he engages in his tale, I will refer
               to him throughout this essay as “Hogg” rather than as the more awkward “Hogg’s narrator”
               or “Hogg’s speaker.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Scott’s shift from poetry to the novel, the tale began to match the ballad as a subject
               worthy of study by the antiquarian and the folk historian” (<em>British Short Fiction</em> 122).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note24_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               oral epic singers compose and as such contributes to discussions about Homer and his
               age that go back to the eighteenth century. Marshall McLuhan described his 1962 book,
               <em>The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</em> (U of Toronto P, 1962) as “complementary” to <em>The Singer of Tales</em>, for the ways it understands one moment of medium change (oral to print) in terms
