                <p rend="noCount">This article makes the case that perlocution, a notoriously tricky
                    species of speech act, opens up news ways of thinking about De Quincey’s
                    autobiographical writings, particularly <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title>. Because its
                    effects are indirect, uncertain and unpredictable, perlocution helps us
                    understand language’s ability to entangle: readers, writers, memories,
                    experience, events, other texts. That uncanny ability to entangle things—and our
                    inability to ever fully disentangle them—is one of De Quincey’s abiding
                    preoccupations. Its readiest models are the famous involute and the palimpsest,
                    but examples of it exist throughout his oeuvre. De Quincey’s thinking on these
                    and related matters anticipates later theoretical concepts such as Freud’s
                    “tangle of dream thoughts," Benjamin’s <foreign>verschränkte Zeit</foreign> (entangled time), and
                    Derrida’s double bind, “which can only be endured in passion.”</p>

                    <quote> There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream
                        which has to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the
                        work of interpretation that at that point there is a tangle of
                        dream-thoughts which cannot be unraveled and which moreover adds nothing to
                        our knowledge of the content of the dream (Freud 525 / 564). </quote>

                        will learn to know as an intruder into my dreams, bear to my own mind. He is

                        generally, is but that which I have said in daylight, and in meditation deep
                        enough to sculpture itself on my heart. But sometimes, as his face alters,
                        his words alter; and they do not always seem such as I have used,
                            or <emph>could</emph> use. No man can account for all things that occur
                        in dreams (De Quincey, <title level="m">Suspiria de Profundis</title> 147).

                    <p>Language has long been associated with the dangers of getting entangled in
                        it. Hobbes, for instance, warns that someone who does not use language
                        carefully and consciously “will find himself entangled in words, as a bird
                        in lime-twigs; the more he struggles, the more belimed” (28). Or, in the
                        opening of his first <title level="m">Enquiry</title>, Hume says that
                        abstruse philosophers and religious fanatics alike, “unable to defend
                        themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling brambles [words] to cover
                        and protect their weakness” (1.11, 7). It is the same tack taken in Locke’s
                        “On the Abuse of Words,” where power can be grasped by “employing the
                        ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms, and
                        holding them perpetually entangled in that labyrinth” (3.10.9, 495). Hume
                        likely gets the image from Locke, and Locke from a chapter in Bacon called
                        “The Intellect’s Ladder, or the Thread of the Labyrinth.” Bacon, in turn,
                        inherits these tropes from the Italian humanist Cardano’s <title level="m"
                            >De Subtilitate</title>, which talks of “things which through
                        impropriety of language rather than intention are unintelligible and
                        entangled like knots which chance to twist upon themselves” (qtd. Wilson
                        40).</p>
                    <p>What interests me in these accounts is language’s apparent agency, its
                        ability to ensnare without anyone’s direct “intention,” as Cardano puts it.
                        The tradition of British empiricism rarely uses terms such as
                            <emph>entangle</emph>, but when it appears it often describes language’s
                        material-like power, a force that can “hold” you “perpetually entangled in
                        that labyrinth”: i.e., language itself. There is, of course, also a more
                        positive, and more literary, account of language’s entangling activity, one
                        that goes at least back to Petrarch. That counter to language’s undead
                        materialism is perhaps best articulated by Sterne’s Yorick who describes his
                            <title level="m">Sentimental Journey</title> thus: “’Tis going, I own,
                        like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy adventures.
                        But I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the
                        existence of a soul within me, as when I am entangled in them” (95). Here
                        language (“adventures,” or rather the temptingly melancholy narratives of
                        them that Yorick hears, reads and relates) might be material, but its
                        entangling activity uncovers something seemingly immaterial—the “soul within
                        me” and, perhaps, within it. For Sterne, the eighteenth century’s
                        arch-thinker of entanglement, getting “entangled in telling a plain story”
                            (<title level="m">TS</title>, 263) and in the relationships that telling
                        precipitates, is active proof of language’s divinity.</p>
                    <p>More than half a century later, having imbibed critiques of that empiricist
                        tradition by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, and also
                        having imbibed tremendous quantities of a very different kind of riposte to
                        empiricism (viz., <emph>opium</emph>), De Quincey arrives at a Sternian
                        conclusion, at once speculative and devastating: <quote>And, recollecting it
                            [his sister’s death], often I have been struck with the important
                            truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts and feelings pass to us
                            through perplexed combinations of <emph>concrete</emph> objects, pass to
                            us as <emph>involutes</emph> (if I may coin that word) in compound

                        trying—we cannot “disentangle” or “abstract” (separate, isolate, pull away)
                        certain “compound experiences” or “perplexed combinations” of our

                    <p>Our deepest thoughts’ and feelings’ “concreteness” (their having grown
                        together), it would seem, happens in a Proustian <title level="m"
                            >verschränkte Zeit</title>, an “entangled” or “intertwined” time where
                        experiences only become legible when properly constellated in memory and
                        lived time (<title level="m">SW2.1</title> 244). For Benjamin, “The eternity
                        which Proust opens to view is intertwined time, not boundless time. His true
                        interest is in the passage of time in its most real—that is,
                        intertwined—form”; “the heart of Proust’s world” is “this universe of
                        intertwining” where “<title level="m">correspondances</title> rule” (<title
                            level="m">SW2.1</title> 244). This is a fair description of De Quincey’s
                        involutes, where past artifacts and events become legible only when properly
                        constellated with lived reality. But De Quincey’s eternity yawns deeper, and
                        his “true interest” is harder to locate, much less his conception of truth.
                        “The world,” as Benjamin says elsewhere, “is knowable <title level="m"
                            >now</title>,” which is precisely where to find “truth” (<title
                            level="m">SW1</title> 277). In that <title level="m">now</title> that
                        exceeds subjective intention, “truth is charged to the bursting point” by
                        the historical images that happen, at that moment, to become synchronic with
                        it. A <title level="m">now</title> worthy of the name draws aspects of the
                        past into alignment with it and in a flash knowledge is produced—“the text
                        [and the possibility of reading it] is the long roll of thunder that
                        follows” (<title level="m">Arcades</title> 462 N2a,3). De Quincey’s oeuvre
                        and personal mythology are also premised on a model of reading: the brain as
                            palimpsest,<note place="foot"> “What else than a natural and mighty
                            palimpsest is the human brain? Such a palimpsest is my brain; such a
                            palimpsest, O reader! is yours. Everlasting layers of ideas, images,
                            feelings, have fallen upon your brain softly as light. Each succession
                            has seemed to bury all that went before. And yet in reality not one has
                            been extinguished” (<title level="m">S</title> 135). The brain is
                            receptive to impressions; they typically remain hidden and
                            recorded-over, to be brought into sudden constellation with other
                            experiences and memories. John describes an involute as “an intricately
                            coiled or interwoven manifold.” In reading De Quincey’s entire corpus as
                            tied to master-involute, the death of his sister, I think Barrell
                            sometimes condenses or oversimplifies this figure of the tangled
                            manifold; for him, involutes seem far more capable of being
                            disentangled. See <title level="m">The Infection of Thomas De Quincey: a

                            “reflex” of De Quincey’s own “inner nature,” someone he encounters in
                            (opium) dreams. His function is therapeutic: “in uttering your secret
                            feelings to <title level="m">him</title>, you make this phantom the dark
                            symbolic mirror for reflecting to the daylight what else must be hidden
                            forever.” But he is like a “Greek Chorus,” and sometimes “swerves out of
                            [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien natures” so that De Quincey
                            “does not always know him .&#160;.&#160;. as [his] own parahelion”
                                (<title level="m">S</title> 147). In <title level="m">Dark

                            whispers” (19.69), a fact he connects to “<emph>involutes</emph> of
                            human sensibility”: “combinations in which the materials of future
                            thought or feeling are carried as imperceptibly into the mind as
                            vegetable seeds are carried variously combined” into the world (19.73).
                            His model for this involution is the scene from the <title level="m"

                        Freud’s un-unravellable “tangle of dream thoughts”—that is, to
                        psychoanalysis, and resistances to it. But I will first linger on a nexus of
                        concepts that structures my argument. Entanglement (or intertwining, or
                        involution, or twisting) clearly is one, and it is related—or so I argue—to
                        De Quincey’s articulation of truth (§3)<note place="foot">Following Markus
                            Gabriel’s persuasive reading of Schelling’s <title level="m">Freedom
                                Essay</title>, we might posit a theory of performative predication
                            here. “Schelling thinks of freedom in terms of performances: freedom is
                            our capacity to produce objects by so much as stating their existence,
                            as when we assert that we just asserted something, which produces an
                            assertion as an object of investigation.” What allows us to do this is
                            “the Unground,” the universal undetermined X that is identity in
                            difference. It has no content itself, but “is maximally topic-neutral:
                            it stands for whatever can be the case and make a statement about it
                            true” (97). De Quincey’s “abstract shapes” are like this
                            identity-in-difference, but all that “pass[es] to us” of it are
                            “concrete objects” and “perplexed combinations.” The “important truth”
                            that strikes De Quincey is, perhaps, disjunction or identity, a truth he
                            futilely tries to comprehend via entanglement, what Schelling might call
                            “interconnected resistants” (<foreign>zusammenhängende

                        passion (§3 &amp; §4), and performative utterance (§2). De Quincey is

                            “infirm” (147) and truths can never pass to us “directly,” then ironic

                        time and language whose (perlocutionary) effects can be profound, but also
                        oblique and unpredictable. He is a confessed “self-dialogist .&#160;.&#160;.
                        perhaps the earliest that has existed,” because at a young age he “caught
                        too early and too profound a glimpse of certain dread realities” (10.11–12),
                        or truths. At a certain pitch, however, even De Quincey’s self-dialogism
                        sometimes “swerves out of [his] orbit, and mixes a little with alien
                        natures,” as when the Dark Interpreter’s “words alter” (<title level="m"
                            >S</title> 147). Like the Sorrows, that haunting figure also whispers
                        “truths” to De Quincey in his sleeps (<title level="m">S</title> 245). But
                        to become intelligible those truths must—presumably—later be recollected
                        (gathered) and disentangled from his other experiences and interpretations.
                        Their reinterpretation can only happen via an entangling (an involution) and
                        a resistant disentangling (an analysis, an untying), which is itself another
                        kind of entangling. This endless and sincere process of receiving and
                        reinterpreting the truths that pass to us is what I think De Quincey means
                        by “impassioned prose,” his confessions’ signature “mode” (238). In this
                        piece I suggest that perlocutionary speech acts, whose effects are
                        entangling and incalculable, are a worthwhile model for interpreting—or
                        rather, reinterpreting—De Quincey’s impassioned prose.</p>

                    <head>II. Perlocution &amp; Entanglement</head>
                    <p>But what exactly are speech acts in general, and perlocution in particular?
                        Speech acts do not, or do not merely, describe; they act, they produce
                        effects in the world. In J.L. Austin’s terms, speech acts are thereby
                        “performative” rather than “constative” utterances. But realizing the
                        difficulty of distinguishing performative and constative utterances, Austin
                        moved on to a tripartite categorization of locutionary, illocutionary and
                        perlocutionary speech acts. Let me give you Cavell's quick checklist from
                        “Performative and Passionate Utterance”: “the locutionary act (saying
                        something meaningful), the illocutionary act (what is done <emph>in</emph>
                        saying something), and the perlocutionary act (what is done <emph>by</emph>
                        saying something)” (169). Austin himself defines a perlocutionary act as one
                        which produces “certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts or
                        actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may
                        be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them” (101). You
                        can see why perlocution is the trickiest of the three types—all those
                            <emph>ors</emph> and <emph>mays</emph> (thoughts, feelings
                            <emph>or</emph> actions; audience, speaker, or other persons; it
                            <emph>may</emph> be done by design, or intention, or purpose—or not)
                        spread the concept out into who knows what, or where, or how. Austin
                        repeatedly tries to contrast this diffusion with what he takes to be a more
                        stable target, illocutionary acts’ <emph>specific</emph> force to get
                        something done. If in an illocutionary act the effect must be contained in
                        what is said, in a perlocutionary act the effect <emph>cannot</emph> be
                        contained in it; if for an illocutionary act to succeed there must be a
                        communally agreed upon set of rules to judge its success, for a perlocution
                        to work the speaker is on his own—he must use whatever imagination,
                        subtlety, or flair that he has at his disposal. Weirdly, one can perform a
                        perlocutionary act via a locution—that is, by simply stating a meaningful
                        fact. For example, I might prevent you from reading or liking a novel by
                        saying “Byron hated that novel”—or, that might make you reread it and like
                        it even more. Again, you can see why perlocution exasperated Austin, and why
                        Cavell and Miller see it as the place where his system breaks down. It gives
                        reign to “parasitic,” “not serious” and “not full normal” uses of language
                        (104). If what Austin calls “the doctrine ‘of illocutionary forces’” (100)
                        seems predictably Newtonian, perlocution is more like quantum mechanics,
                        where God plays dice and disparate elements are mysteriously entangled.</p>
                    <p>In Miller’s reading, “Austin is haunted by poetry .&#160;.&#160;.” (38);
                        jokes and poetry are “etiolated,” whitened, and have “no force”; although
                        Austin “uses tropes brilliantly and commands a powerful rhetoric, but he
                        does not generally reflect on the implications of the way his use of tropes
                        is necessary to get said what he wants to say” (39). Put another way, Austin
                        wants to say it “straight,” but uses tropes and turns to do so; he
                            <emph>must</emph> use them. Indeed, for Miller <title level="m">How To
                            Do Things with Words</title> is haunted by a “lurid under text of
                        violence and catastrophe” (49), perhaps because it cannot grasp its own
                        tropological foundation. Tracing Austin's growing stable of terms—from
                            <emph>performative</emph> and <emph>constative</emph>, to
                            <emph>locutionary, illocutionary</emph> and<emph> perlocutionary</emph>,
                            to<emph> behabitives, expositives, commissives</emph>, and<emph>
                            verdictives</emph>—Miller concludes: “the project frays out into
                        increasingly unmanageable complexity, the complexity of everyday usage in
                        ordinary language” (13). That's the process of getting “bog[ged], by logical
                        stages, down,” a phrase Miller borrows from Austin and uses repeatedly.
                        Miller's point, I think, is that Austin was all too aware of ordinary
                        language's resistance to theorization, the way it lures you in and entangles
                        you. The figure of the fray and the bog connote entanglement in the term’s
                        traditional sense—Thomas Browne, for instance, wonders how the viscosity of
                        a chameleon’s tongue “inviscates and intangleth” insects. For Austin, the
                        entangling tongue is human speech itself.</p>
                    <p>Or, as Miller puts it, “words are not pictures of reality. They are part of
                        the thing, tangled inextricably with the event they describe” (<title
                            level="m">Tropes</title> 43). In <title level="m">Ariadne’s
                            Thread</title>, he extends this into a claim about literature’s
                        resistance to interpretation: “The critic may fancy himself safely and
                        rationally outside the contradictory language of the text, but he is already
                        entangled in its web” (23). That happens, for Miller, because it’s
                        impossible to isolate any given portion of a text from the whole: a critical
                        problem or “knot may be in one region untied, made unperplexed, but only at
                        the expense of making a tangle of knotted crossings at some other point on
                        the loop” (22)—a double bind. This does not mean that criticism is futile,
                        but merely that works of literature also interpret themselves. Describing
                        Joseph Conrad’s “self-interpretive elements” in <title level="m">Fiction and
                            Repetition</title>, Miller declares that “No literary text has a
                        manifest pattern, like the design of a rug, which the eye of the critic can
                        survey from the outside” (23). Here we see what will later become Miller's
                        claims about the critic's performative utterances and the impossibility of
                        purely constative criticism.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the model of reading here is deconstructive, but also
                        psychoanalytic, as much work on De Quincey is. Joel Faflak has suggested
                        that De Quincey’s readers become inscribed within “the text’s transferential
                        field of reading.” In a Miller-like vein, Faflak says that “Our inability to
                        master the text’s meaning .&#160;.&#160;. mirrors uncannily the text’s call
                        for knowledge and interpretation that is built into its very structure”
                        (25). What interests me is the text’s “call” to read it, know it, interpret
                        it, perform it. In <title level="m">Theory of the Lyric</title>, Jonathan
                        Culler has recently warned of the dangers of “celebrat[ing] the performative
                        character of literature, as a simple consequence of the conventions of
                        literary discourse” because it distracts us from its real perlocutionary
                        work. “The most important acts a poem performs,” he suggests, “are likely to
                        be those not entailed by it” (130).<note place="foot"> Culler goes on to
                            cite Barbara Cassin’s recommendation that we subsume illocution and
                            perlocution under the rubric of <emph>performance</emph> rather than
                                <emph>performativity</emph>; in a footnote, he pairs her work with
                            Gadamer’s, which speaks about how literature tasks us with performing it
                            so that a truth might emerge—a literary work is “an event [<title
                                level="m">Ereignis</title>] that appropriates us into itself”
                            (367n35).</note> Here literature, and linguistic entanglement, becomes a

                            dialectical pirouettes one thought oneself supple enough to carry out”
                            (77).</note> By this I simply mean language’s power to produce effects
                        that exceed a single act or an individual intention; as perlocutionary

                        term, entanglement often becomes an “undead metaphor”—one which renews
                        itself in the connections it makes between different things, particularly
                        when those connections cannot be conceptually mapped. If such relations are
                        increasingly problematized across the latter half of the Enlightenment,
                        which I think they are, De Quincey’s oeuvre—as both theory and
                        palimpsest of inexplicable connections—marks this trend’s <foreign>ne plus

                    <p>De Quincey, in his “Letters to a Young Man,” had much to say about the
                        definition of literature and its relationship to <emph>knowledge</emph> and
                            <emph>power</emph>, which we might roughly associate with constative and
                        performative utterances—a kind of “mixed discursive mode,” to borrow Ian
                        Balfour’s phrase.<note place="foot"> Balfour on Coleridge’s <title level="m"

                            the timelessness of the most fundamental truths. This tension can be
                            ascribed in part to its mixed discursive mode, both performative and

                            257+.</note> In his reading of those letters, Brian McGrath has
                        persuasively argued that De Quincey marshaled his redefinition of
                            <emph>literature</emph> (and hence <emph>power</emph>) to selectively
                        manage the mushrooming list of texts one had to read (847–48). Yes,
                            <emph>had to read</emph>—that is, I think, literature's call, or at
                        least the call of the literary marketplace. Literature’s proper call is
                        slightly different—“all literature seeks,” in De Quincey’s words, “to
                        communicate power” (3.71) where other texts only communicate knowledge. Real
                        literature is a stronger <emph>actant</emph> inasmuch as it calls more
                        powerfully on us to read it. But <emph>where</emph> do we locate this call,
                        this seeking to communicate? Here is where the diffuseness of effects,
                        persons and intentions of perlocution’s model is useful for thinking with De
                        Quincey, and frustrating. As Cavell says, the problem in part is that “in
                        perlocutionary acts, the ‘you’ comes essentially into the picture”
                            (180).<note place="foot">Ellen Burt ties the <title level="m"
                                >Confessions’</title> representations of performative language to
                            the problem of hospitality, to an “other” such as the Malay or the
                            Welsh, and thus to the other as such: “The iterability of language means
                            that the masterful, staged performative that unsays the said and allows
                            one to enter into inaugural, heartfelt dialogue with the human other,
                            may not be distinguishable from repetition. Or, to put it another way,
                            the house of language is always open to visitation by a poetic spirit,
                            which spirit allows consideration of the potential meaning of patterns
                            that language has as a written language. Those patterns don't just
                            gainsay the said; they also gainsay saying, and with it the scene of
                            ethical relation and dialogue as implicating only humans” (139). I will
                            only add that De Quincey explicitly theorizes this ethical and
                            linguistic relation, and that he often does so through the trope of
                            entanglement.</note></p>

                    <p>Robert Morrison has connected De Quincey’s <title level="m"
                            >Confessions</title> to what Foucault in 1975 called “the production of
                        truth,” modernity’s social demand to confess what one truly is (x). Several
                        years later, in <title level="m">Wrong-Doing and Truth-Telling</title>,
                        Foucault discusses truth-telling as a “speech act” (14). “Avowal is,”
                        according to Foucault, “a verbal act through which the subject affirms who
                        he is, binds himself to truth, places himself in a relationship of
                        dependence with regard to another, and modifies at the same time his
                        relationship to himself” (17). Foucault’s more general strategy is to
                        examine how a subject constitutes himself as an object—that is, to look at
                        both “the formation of procedures by which the subject is led to observe
                        himself, analyze himself, interpret himself, recognize himself as a domain
                        of possible knowledge” and “the way in which the subject experiences himself
                        in a game of truth where he relates to himself” (461).<note place="foot">See

                            Stuart Elden cites the importance of confession in Foucault’s late
                            thought: “Foucault’s interest in confession might move from power
                            relations to the production of truths [in the late 1970’s], but it
                            remained at the center of his concern .&#160;.&#160;. Confession is the

                        Jean-Luc Marion’s work is salutary. For him, Augustine’s <title level="m"
                            >Confessions</title> merely “orient” the reader towards God. They are
                        “written neither to describe nor to demonstrate nor to instruct, but to
                        provoke confession”; they “tend only to produce an effect, or rather an
                            <emph>affect</emph>, upon the interlocutor, understood as each reader.
                        This intention is defined exactly as a perlocutionary act" (46–47)—that is,
                        a speech act whose consequences are inexplicit, incalculable and perhaps
                        even untraceable. Every word of Augustine’s <title level="m"
                            >Confessions</title> strains to accomplish, not represent, something; it
                        cannot even represent to itself what it seeks to accomplish. Thus “the truth
                        of this perlocutionary word does not rest on the truth (at least in the
                        sense of adequation of mind to thing, <foreign>Wahrheit</foreign>) but on
                        the will to say the truth (veracity or sincerity,

                    <p>De Quincey’s confessional mode consists in playing truth as adequation off of
                        the will to speak the truth (to perform it, produce it, elicit it), even as
                        his will is overwrought by doubts and complications and broken open by other
                        voices. That is, he tries to represent and reproduce a truth that he himself
                        doesn’t fully grasp or believe he can ever communicate directly, to himself
                        or a reader; he is never sure where his writing comes from or where it is
                            going.<note place="foot">Eric Lindstrom gives a wonderful reading of De
                            Quincey’s uncanny experience of being woken by his own voice while in a
                            “dog sleep”: “Far from a pleasurable exteriorizing of expressive
                            identity, agency, and intent, this voice is exterior to De Quincey in
                            the radically alternate sense of originating as though from outside of
                            him. Yet the source of the disruptive noise is the somatic body most
                            deeply contained inside .&#160;.&#160;. Such a source of interiority and
                            inward sensation takes us too far inside the body of the writer”
                            (399).</note> To borrow Yoon Sun Lee’s more general description of
                        Romantic prose, De Quincey’s styles continually try to map their past,
                        present and future occasions to communicate that truth more fully; his form
                        unfolds through the endless unfixing and revising of its occasions. “You
                        understand now, reader, what I am” (54), De Quincey tells us, but
                        nevertheless his <title level="m">Confessions</title>’ moral “is addressed
                        to the opium-eater”: “If he is taught to fear and tremble, enough has been
                        effected” (78). But that education can only happen through the <title
                            level="m">Confessions</title>’ “true object”—“those parasitical
                        thoughts, feelings, digressions” (88) and the (perlocutionary) “effects”
                        they incite.<note place="foot"> David Clark has suggested that Kant himself
                            sometimes operates in a second gear, where he is no longer a seeker
                            after truth, but a “practician” of it (265). That is something De
                            Quincey in fact accuses Kant of doing unwittingly, so that he (De
                            Quincey) can attend “once more to the intricacies that lie at the heart
                            of the confessional speech-act, the secret communications that obtain
                            necessarily there between self-aggrandizement and self-debasement,
                            dissimulation and truth-telling, avowal and disavowal” (263).</note>
                        This is also the “important truth” of involution: “no complex or very
                        important truth was ever yet transferred in full development from one mind
                        to another” (3.97). Hence <title level="m">Suspiria</title>’s worries about
                        the earlier <title level="m">Confessions’</title> “true object” (88).<note
                            place="foot">De Quincey’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> claims:

                            the subject of the fascinating spells, but to the fascinating power. Not
                            the Opium-eater, but the opium, is the true hero of the tale, and the
                            legitimate centre on which the interest revolves” (77).</note> De
                        Quincey doubts whether a style couched in “the simplicity of truth” that
                        “moves truly and faithfully” through circumstances can determine what the
                        reader “attaches” to it (88–89); he also openly wonders about the “true
                        interpretation” of his addiction’s “final symptoms,” the later ones
                        addressed in <title level="m">Suspiria</title> which “differ in something
                        more than degree from” <title level="m">Confessions</title>’ two accounts
                        (85). No complex or very important truth, it seems, can ever be transferred
                        in full development within the same person, much less “from one mind to
                        another”; they must make the perilous journey through language and its
                        unpredictable effects. Even our own truths must “pass through the several
                        stages of growth” (3.97) and degrees of, or absolute, ruin.<note

                    <p> Speaking of Augustine, De Quincey defines his own <title level="m"
                            >Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Suspiria</title> as “modes of
                        impassioned prose” (238).<note place="foot">Joel Faflak argues that De
                            Quincey’s impassioned prose collapses genre (poetry and prose,
                            metaphysics and psychology) into a “transitional psychoanalysis,” which
                            in turn collapses other distinctions: “Autobiography, understanding, and
                            impassioned prose are thus separate signifiers of the subject’s
                            identity, and yet collapse into one another by force of the unconscious”
                            (158, 276n16).</note> He means by this “the very idea of breathing a
                        record of human passion, not into the ear of the random crowd, but of the
                        saintly confessional.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Impassioned, therefore, should be
                        the tenor of the composition” (238). Its only examples are “those of St.
                        Austin”—miraculous abbreviation!—and, on a lesser scale, Rousseau. Across
                        his autobiographical works De Quincey stresses this enamoring. We see
                        “impassioned minds” (112), “impassioned memory” (169), impassioned themes,
                        interests and passages (237–38). The lesson of the <title level="m"
                            >Suspiria</title> thereby mirrors what he calls “the education of
                        Levana,” the Roman goddess of childbirth who “lifts” infants from the earth
                        into “the atmosphere of our troubled planet,” who “present[s] its forehead
                        to the stars, saying, perhaps, in his heart—‘Behold what is greater than
                        yourselves!’” (<title level="m">S</title> 138). Paradoxically Levana’s
                        lifting happens by opening up the labor of our hidden depths: “that mighty
                        system of central forces hidden in the deep bosom of human life, which by
                        passion, by strife, by temptation, by the energies of resistance, works for
                        ever upon children” (139). One of De Quincey’s problems is to instantiate
                        this system of forces—of lift and descent, of expansion and contraction, of
                        passion, strife, temptation and resistance—in his own writing. Citing
                        Wordsworth, De Quincey asserts that true style is the “incarnation of
                        thought.” And yet language as “counter-spirit” threatens to reopen the
                        original fracture between thinking and expressing that conditions language’s
                        actual use. That counter-spirit is, says Wordsworth, “unremittingly and
                        noiselessly at work to derange, to subvert, to lay waste, to vitiate, and to
                            dissolve.”<note place="foot">Alexander Regier helpfully reads, via
                            Benjamin, De Quincey’s complex citing of Wordsworth here (151-52).
                            Regier also suggests that Benjamin’s is a performative theory of
                            language: “.&#160;.&#160;. to cite a word is to call it by its name
                            .&#160;.&#160;.. It performs a fracturing process that involves breaking
                            a word out of Language” (146).</note> Separate but inseparable, De
                        Quincey could say that language and thought are <emph>entangled</emph>, or
                        “incapable of being disentangled.” Indeed, I hope to have shown that he
                        often does say this.</p>

                    <p>De Quincey devoted a great deal of energy to the topic of style. He asserts,
                        for instance, that the “periodic style of writing” practiced by newspapers
                        tires one out not for its “length… the paralytic flux of words,” nor “even
                        the cumbrous involution of parts within parts.” Rather, “It is the suspense,
                        the holding-on, of the mind until .&#160;.&#160;. the sentence
                        commences—this it is which wears out the faculty of attention” (12.21).
                        Imagine an age where <emph>that</emph>’s newspapers’ problem, that they’re
                        too reflective! But look how easily De Quincey moves between claims about
                        style and its effect on the act of reading. Style’s “organic aspect”
                        expresses “all possible relations that can arise between thoughts and
                        words—the total effect of a writer”; the emphasis here is on the “use of
                        words,” style’s so-called “commerce with thought” (12.24–25). I am not sure
                        whether this commerce is exactly the same thing as the call literature makes
                        upon us, but it’s close. What wears us out in reading the “periodic style”
                        is its periodicity, the way that it turns back upon its point.<note
                            place="foot"> This is perhaps the same as the turn of mind he finds in
                            Malthus’s twisted mind: “Mr. Malthus has the most perplexed
                            understanding. He is not only confused himself, but is the cause that
                            confusion is in other men. Logical perplexity is shockingly contagious,
                            and he who takes Mr. Malthus for his guide through any tangled question,
                            ought to be able to box the compass very well; or before he has read ten
                            pages he will find himself (as the Westmoreland guides express it)
                            ‘maffled’.” (3.285-86).</note></p>
                    <p>De Qunicey’s own style, meanwhile, attempts to get at truth, but through a
                        different sort of turning or twisting, one that resembles the tangling of a
                        vine. Permit me to return to De Quincey’s “true object”: <quote>The true
                            object in my “Opium Confessions” is not the naked physiological theme
                            [of opium addiction] .&#160;.&#160;. but those wandering musical
                            variations upon the theme—those parasitical thoughts, feelings,
                            digressions, which climb up with bells and blossoms round about the arid
                            stock; ramble away from it at times with perhaps too rank a luxuriance;
                            but at the same time, by the eternal interest attached to the <title
                                level="m">subjects </title>of these digressions, no matter what were
                            the execution, spread a glory over incidents that for themselves would
                            be—less than nothing. (88)</quote> This oddly twinned discourse of truth
                        and the entangling parasite marks this section of <title level="m"
                            >Suspiria</title>, which ends with a double crescendo—one intellectual,
                        one emotional—that I will cite again: <quote>I have been struck with the
                            important truth—that far more of our deepest thoughts and feelings pass
                            to us through perplexed combinations of concrete objects, pass to us as
                                <title level="m">involutes</title> (if I may coin that word) in
                            compound experiences incapable of being disentangled, than ever reach us
                            directly, and in their own abstract shapes. (97) </quote>That
                        intellectual crescendo sets up his real goal of communicating the “burden of
                        the incommunicable,” the awe he feels at his sister’s death. “Out of this
                        digression [the involute], which was almost necessary for the purpose of
                        showing how inextricably my feelings and images of death were entangled with
                        those of summer, I return to the bedchamber of my sister. From the gorgeous
                        sunlight I turned round to the corpse .&#160;.&#160;.” (98). He describes
                        his sister’s “marble lips, the stiffening hands, laid palm to palm, as if
                        repeating the supplications of closing anguish,” and asks: “could these be
                        mistaken for life?” (99). </p>
                    <p>De Quincey’s inability to communicate directly how summer and death became
                        associated in his mind is somehow powerful. Before the digressive account of
                        the involutes, he articulates his crisis with extreme economy: “the glory is
                        around us, the darkness is within us” (97). Summer’s glory evokes, almost as
                        a conceit, the death we carry within us. But the association is not complex
                        enough; he feels compelled to describe an even “subtler reason why the
                        summer had this intense power of vivifying the spectacle or the thoughts of
                        death.” For me, the most devastating detail is how the passage invisibly
                        links the Bible’s depiction of palm trees, which young De Quincey associated
                        with summer and Oriental climes, with his sister’s “stiffening hands, laid
                        palm to palm, as if repeating the supplications of closing anguish.”<note
                            place="foot"> “Palm to palm” resonates too with the priest’s
                                “<emph>earth to earth .&#160;.&#160;. ashes to ashes
                                .&#160;.&#160;.dust to dust .&#160;.&#160; .</emph> the farewell
                            volley announces that the grave—the coffin—the face are sealed up for
                            ever and ever” (103). Those same words were announced at his father’s
                            funeral (De Quincey’s first, he claims): “Then first it was that solemn
                            farewell of the English burial-service, “Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,’
                            and the great eloquence of St. Paul in that matchless chapter of his
                            epistle to the Corinthians, fell upon my ear; and, concurring with my
                            whole previous feelings, for ever fixed that vast subject upon my mind”
                            (10.13). Barrell gives a compelling, though somewhat different, reading
                            of the “palms” passages (33).</note> “’Palms!’—what were they?
                            <emph>That</emph> was an equivocal word… palms, as a product of nature,
                        expressed the pomps of summer” (97). But what about these palms had
                        “haunted” him, and when? It was not merely their association with “the
                        peace” and “the summer .&#160;.&#160;. the deep sound of rest below all
                        rest, and of ascending glory.” But there are always further connections,
                            <foreign>in esse</foreign> or <foreign>in posse</foreign>. What haunts
                        him, in part, is the sheer number of connections he can make, or have made,
                        across the tangled register of his knowledge and experience. </p>
                    <p>We should ask with him: “could these [his sister’s hands] be mistaken for
                        life?” Or for a “vivifying spectacle”? Could his memories, or dreams, or
                        writing—his progressive compounding of experience—be mistaken for life or
                        vivifying spectacle? The passage’s true power and devastation seems to come
                        from our inability to “disentangle” these “compound experiences,” even
                        trifling ones. Just as we can never fix those experiences’ full or proper
                        occasions, we can never experience something in its singularity or “abstract
                        shape.” To return to Benjamin’s phrase, there is no disentangled time,
                        simply better or worse constellations of it. Pulling apart our perplexed
                        thoughts and feelings (ab-stracting or analyzing them) only layers in more
                        connections—(with Hobbes, again, “the more he struggles, the more belimed”).
                        The depths momentarily opened within compounded experience can be
                        expressed—or sounded—only by sighs: “One profound sigh ascended from my
                        heart, and I was silent for days” (<title level="m">S</title> 85).</p>
                    <p> For Sterne, these details, twists, connections, overlappings and involutions
                        were ultimately a boon to life and literature—“Digressions, incontestably,
                        are the sunshine;—they are the life, the soul of reading;—take them out of
                        this book for instance,—you might as well take the book along with them”
                            (<title level="m">Tristram</title> 54). But for De Quincey they express
                        anxiety, or even ruin. De Quincey begins the <title level="m"
                            >Confessions</title> by stating that he is “bound to confess” his
                        excessive indulgence in opium, but that he has “untwisted almost to its
                        final links, the accursed chain which fettered” him (4). The <title
                            level="m">Suspiria</title>’s involutes shows how there is always
                        something that resists untwisting, perhaps even the “true interpretation of
                        these final symptoms” (85)—the chain of interpretation and the inevitability
                        of new links. Rei Terada has compared De Quincey’s psychic model to early
                        Freud, where it is not the <emph>order</emph> of one’s thoughts, but rather
                        their <emph>density</emph> that signals a healthy psychic economy. Within
                        the brain, stimuli from within and without can become “unbound” in such a
                        way that they catastrophically “destabilize one’s energy system”—what is
                        sought is an “ego that is neither straightjacketed by its own bindings nor
                        overwhelmed by stimuli inconveniently becoming unbound” (221).</p>
                    <p> I will conclude by thinking with Derrida’s “Resistances of Psychoanalysis”
                        about a slightly later, but related Freudian model. That work draws chiefly
                        upon a few passages from the <title level="m">Interpretation of
                            Dreams</title>, specifically those places—and those patients—which
                        “resist analysis.” There Freud gives his famous, Shandyean analogy of the
                        “navel of the dream,” a passage excerpted in my epigraph. Here it is in
                        full: <quote>There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly
                            interpreted dream which has to be left obscure; this is because we
                            become aware during the work of interpretation that at that point there
                            is a tangle of dream-thoughts which cannot be unraveled [<foreign>ein
                                Knäuel von Traumgedanken anhebt, der sich nicht entwirren
                                will</foreign>] and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of
                            the content of the dream. This is the dream’s navel, the spot where it
                            reaches down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts to which we are led by
                            interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have any definite
                            endings; they are bound to branch out in every direction into the
                            intricate network [<foreign>in die netzartige Verstrickung</foreign>] of
                            our world of thought. It is at some point where this network is
                            particularly close that the dream-wish grows up, like a mushroom out of
                            its mycelium (525 / 564).</quote> For Freud the mushroom (the
                        dream-wish) merely marks the knotty ground that gives rise to it. That set
                        of tangles is unanalyzable both because the links are too numerous and
                        because it reaches into the “unplummable” depths; it is, in the language of
                        the note, its “point of contact with the unknown” (143n2) and in the body of
                        the text the threads of dream-thoughts “have no definite endings” (564).</p>
                    <p>A version of this passage originally occurs, as Derrida points out, in a note
                        a couple hundred pages earlier in <title level="m">The Interpretation of
                            Dreams</title>. It comes as a kind of “confession” given by Freud for
                        his inability to decipher his dream about Irma’s injection—that is, the one
                        where he begins to feel that <emph>he</emph> might be responsible for
                            <emph>her</emph> refusal to accept his interpretation of her condition.
                        It is thus a case of the responsibility or the ethics of interpretation.
                        It’s an imperative that extends even into the analyst’s own dream life
                        despite his once believing that it was the patient’s sole responsibility to
                        accept or decline interpretations. But with the dream her and his psychic
                        lives become, as it were, entangled. In Greek analysis simply means untying,
                        disentangling, “solving” and “dissolving”; analysis should therefore solve
                        that problem. But for Derrida the unweaving of any psychic phenomenon is
                        always tied to a twinned, resistant weaving. Analysis resists itself as much
                        as patients resist an interpretation imposed on them by a psychoanalyst; all
                        analysis, all interpretation is haunted by that imperative to resist. </p>
                    <p>But: <foreign>Faudrait-il résister? Et d’abord à l’analyse?</foreign> So
                        begins <title level="m">Resistances</title>’ first essay. Its seven words
                        ask at least six questions: Must one resist? Must one resist, first,
                        psychoanalysis? Or analysis? But also: Must one <emph>endure</emph> or
                            <emph>withstand</emph> (<foreign>résister</foreign>) psychoanalysis, or
                        analysis? But the problem is even worse: “If it were necessary to resist
                        analysis,” Derrida continues, “one would still have to know whence comes
                        this ‘one must’ and what it means. One would have to analyze it.” These
                        increasingly tangled questions, all beneath an ambiguous title: <title
                            level="m">Résistances de la psychonalyse—</title>resistances of / from /
                        by psychoanalysis. <foreign>Faudrait-il résister</foreign>? What does it
                        mean to resist if one must do it? The question feeds back on itself, like
                        the liar’s paradox. Derrida eventually names the problem a <foreign>double
                            bind</foreign>, concluding that “a double bind cannot fully be analyzed:
                        one can only unbind one of its knots by pulling on the other to make it
                        tighter”—it “cannot be assumed; one can only endure
                            [<foreign>souffrir</foreign>] it in <foreign>passion</foreign>”
                        (36).</p>
                    <p>In De Quincey’s impassioned prose we see an entangled and entangling system
                        whose effects—on readers, on himself, on Austin’s “other people”—seem
                        incalculable, but nevertheless calls to be endured.<note place="foot"> This
                            is perhaps the dark obverse of what Miranda Burgess, in her piece,
                            defines as Owenson’s “varied texture of love”: “an ethics of
                            interdependency as pleasure—lacking in determined outcomes, radically
                            unproductive and, therefore, in Owenson’s terms, “free”—when it is read
                            amid the histories of Romantic form and life.”</note> In a kind of
                        Foucauldian avowal that binds him to the sad truths that will unfold his
                        spirit, De Quincey places a demand upon us: “view me, as one
                            <foreign>viridantem fioribus hastas</foreign>—making verdant, and gay
                        with the life of flowers, murderous spears and halberts—things that express
                        death in their origin, (being made from dead substances that once had lived
                        in forests,) things that express ruin in their use” (88). Or, to paraphrase,
                            <emph>watch me do things</emph>, or <emph>do</emph> things,<emph> with
                            words</emph>.</p>
