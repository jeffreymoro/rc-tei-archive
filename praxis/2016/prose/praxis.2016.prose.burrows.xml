        <p rend="noCount">"The Privatization of Public Life: Free Direct Discourse in <title
            level="m">Persuasion</title>" argues for the importance of other narrative techniques
          beyond free indirect discourse in Jane Austen’s work, such the related but in many ways
          opposed form, free direct discourse. Paying particular attention to such techniques, I
          contend, allows us to see the ways in which public discourse in a novel such as <title
            level="m">Persuasion</title> is repeatedly converted into a medium for private feeling.
          The result is a strangely fractured view of public life, in which characters fail to share
          even something as fundamental as time itself. </p>

        <div type="section">
        <p>“With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body’s
          feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body’s destiny” (Austen,
            <title level="m">Emma</title> 339). Emma Woodhouse’s withering self-indictment offers a
          exemplary instance of free indirect discourse, so exemplary indeed that it is tempting to
          read her judgment as extending to its co-speaker, the narrator of <title level="m"
            >Emma</title>, who really is privy to all secrets, arranger of all destinies. Suspicion
          of the authority granted by free indirect discourse to narrative, and in particular to
          Jane Austen, was widespread in the 1980s and 1990s, when critics saw it as the means by
          which, in D. A. Miller’s words, “the narration simultaneously subverts [the characters’]
          authority and secures its own” (<title level="m">The Novel and the Police</title> 25).
          Casey Finch and Peter Bowen, in an influential account of <title level="m">Emma</title>,
          followed Miller’s lead, contending that free indirect discourse functions as a form of
          “surveillance” (3), incessantly “mak[ing] public the private thoughts of characters” (5).
          Yet since, needless to say, we do not inhabit the same world as that occupied by the
          characters we read about, it is far from clear how their thoughts can be described as
          being made public. If novels can be said to involve the notion of publicity this surely
          belongs exclusively to the diegetic world, which often feels like much more of a
          panopticon than the novels themselves: few acts or remarks in the society Austen depicts
          go unnoticed, and without the protection of money or marriage individuals are pitifully
          vulnerable to the judgments of others. </p>
        <p>This essay argues against the idea that free indirect discourse, at least in Austen’s
          hands, renders the realist novel a “stylistic Panopticon” (99) to quote from Franco
          Moretti’s recent study of the bourgeoisie. To characterize the technique as a means of
          making public what should ideally remain private misunderstands the relation between
          private and public within the novels themselves. For public and private life in Austen’s
          fiction are less easily opposed than the surveillance model of criticism suggests. Not
          only do Austen’s characters repeatedly discover what it is they think and want by seeing
          these thoughts and desires manifested by others, her protagonists are less on display in
          public than we might imagine, since they may be said to be under the protection of the
          narrative itself. Austen’s unfinished manuscript <title level="m">The Watsons</title>
          gives a sense of how cruel her world looks shorn of what Miller describes as the
          “anonymous, impersonal, universal” (<title level="m">Jane Austen</title> 27) voice of free
          indirect discourse; with no authorial consciousness to echo her thoughts, no matter how
          ironically, the text’s unmarried heroine feels terrifyingly exposed. The desire to protect
          her characters does not, however, explain Austen’s fascination with free indirect
          discourse. Rather, this fascination is a result, I will be contending, of a recognition
          that the structure of free indirect discourse, in which one voice speaks through or with
          another, shapes relations within the society upon which she reports. Austen’s
          popularization of the technique, that is, represents a formalization of a social practice.
          My focus will be on the Austen novel most indebted to free indirect discourse, <title
            level="m">Persuasion</title>, whose heroine’s thoughts are expressed almost exclusively
          in the third person. The distance this imposes between Anne Elliot and a world which
          refuses to acknowledge her extends to every aspect of that world, inverting the
          relationship between public and private. So extensive is this reorientation that it ends
          up reordering relations even more primary—those involving time itself, a reordering which
          narrative is peculiarly well equipped to document.</p>
        <p>According to Frances Ferguson, free indirect discourse represents “the novel’s one and
          only formal contribution to literature” (159). Leaving aside the truth of this claim, it
          is safe to say that free indirect discourse is limited <emph>to</emph> literature; for all
          that it mimics the structure of the social world depicted in Austen’s novels, the practice
          itself can only exist in the world of the novel. Austen’s development of the technique
          would thus seem to disqualify her work from consideration in a volume devoted to Romantic
          prose, a form Yoon Sun Lee’s introduction defines as inseparable from an “idea of the
          spoken.” Yet if free indirect discourse belongs to the domain of unspoken speech, the
          related device I examine in this essay, free <emph>direct</emph> discourse, aligns
          Austen’s work much closer with the genre of Romantic prose. In free direct discourse, a
          rare and critically neglected form, utterances go unattributed, leaving open the
          possibility that they have been said by more than one speaker. Austen’s deployment of the
          technique—a carryover from the eighteenth century novel’s looser sense of the boundaries
          between direct and indirect speech—is motivated in part by her fascination with the ways
          speech brings communities into being, a question explored in relation to philosophical
          discourse in Timothy Milnes’ essay for this volume, “Trusting Experiments.” I borrow the
          term, appropriately enough, from a reading of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. But
          unlike the author of that account, Norman Page, who characterizes free direct discourse as
          a means of summarizing lengthy conversations “without the loss of immediacy” (“Categories”
          735), I understand the device as generated by a unusual structural component of the novel.
            <title level="m">Persuasion</title> narrates the renewal after eight years of the
          romance between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth in the face not just of social barriers
          but of narrative ones too: the novel seemingly goes out of its way to bar its protagonists
          from speaking directly to one another. The result is a courtship conducted almost
          exclusively through the expressions, opinions, and judgments of others. Kept apart by
          their friends and family, Anne and Wentworth are able to renew relations only by turning
          public life into a medium for private feelings. Their second courtship, in other words,
          inverts the structure of free indirect discourse. </p>
        <p>Whereas free indirect discourse is spoken by both narrator and character, free direct
          discourse is spoken by more than one character. The technique is thus concerned less with
          consciousness than with social interaction, with public rather than private life. Little
          penetration is required to discern who in <title level="m">Emma</title> remarks on “‘the
          handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston’” (17) or the identity of
          the “some” who wonder why gruel is not “taken every evening by every body” (85). In not
          attributing these remarks to a specific speaker at a specific moment, Austen not only
          underscores the recognizability and transferability of speech, she describes a society in
          which almost every character speaks for, through, or on behalf of another. Mr. Woodhouse
          is undoubtedly the source of the comment about the gruel, but his success in convincing
          his daughter Isabella to join him in eating it allows him to disappear into the plural
          subject “some.” The maneuver is characteristic. Mr. Woodhouse, who constantly validates
          his hypochondria by referring his own opinions to his doctor, happily voices the opinions
          of his younger daughter Emma, oblivious to her actual views. But then Austen’s heroine
          repeatedly speaks on behalf of her friend Harriet, dictating to her who she should and
          should not marry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Emma could even be said to
            ventriloquize Austen herself at one point, entertaining Mrs. Weston with a pitch-perfect
            imitation of Mrs. Bates.</note> Harriet is little more than a surrogate for Emma, which
          makes it almost inevitable that the one desire Emma’s friend gives voice to without
          prompting—her love for Mr. Knightley—should be “the means whereby [Emma] .&#160;.&#160;.
          comes to acknowledge her own” (Miller, <title level="m">Narrative</title> 12). This
          vicarious economy extends not just to relations between characters but to the subplot of
          the novel, the love affair between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill: one a surrogate
          daughter, the other a surrogate son. Their decision to keep their love secret leads to
          Frank ventriloquizing his own feelings—his fulsome praise for the unknown person who sends
          Jane a piano is eventually revealed as self-directed—and Emma ventriloquizing Jane’s—she
          imagines a scenario in which Jane falls in love by proxy.</p>
        <p>In the end, the story told in <title level="m">Emma</title> is of characters finding
          their own voice: Frank admits his love for Jane; Mr. Knightley proposes to Emma; Harriet
          accepts the man she actually loves, Robert Martin. Things are quite different in <title
            level="m">Persuasion</title>. Rather than characters recognizing their desire only when
          expressed by another, as in <title level="m">Emma</title>, they depend on others to
          articulate feelings that would otherwise not be able to find a voice; characters know what
          they want, but they cannot say what they want. As Miller’s reading of the novel details,
          the reason Anne’s feelings are inexpressible is because of her social status: a spinster
          lacks the social standing to give voice to her desires. The result is a use of free
          indirect discourse so extensive some critics have characterized <title level="m"
            >Persuasion</title> as a radical departure from Austen’s other novels.<note place="foot"
            resp="editors">In <title level="m">The Economy of Character</title> Deidre Lynch offers
            a particularly helpful discussion of the workings of free indirect discourse in <title
              level="m">Persuasion</title>.</note> The novel features a number of scenes in which
          Anne refers the expressed thoughts and feelings of others to her own situation, as if she
          and the actual speaker were the twinned subjects of a first-person utterance. When Louisa
          Musgrove expresses to Wentworth her mistaken belief that Lady Russell “persuaded Anne to
          refuse” (80) Louisa’s brother Charles, before going on to dismiss the idea that she
          herself would be “so easily persuaded” (81), her words are also heard by Anne, hidden
          behind a hedgerow. The extraneous repetition of the term persuasion signals the work of
          delegation being performed here. In distinguishing her own feelings from ones Anne never
          possessed (Austen’s heroine never wanted to marry Charles) Louisa ventriloquizes feelings
          Anne has since come to possess (regret at having been persuaded by Lady Russell not to
          marry Wentworth). No wonder the listening Anne “could imagine what Louisa was feeling”
          (81), since what Louisa is feeling is exactly what Anne is feeling.</p>
        <p>The odd thing about the conversation Anne overhears is that Louisa, despite being
          mistaken about Anne’s feelings for Charles and ignorant of Anne’s feelings for Wentworth,
          ends up speaking for Anne anyway, albeit without knowing this. Anne’s private feelings are
          made public, yet not by her, and not in a manner recognizable to anyone else, even the
          subject of those feelings. This leads to a strange situation which in many ways is the
          opposite of the ones depicted in <title level="m">Emma</title>: rather than discovering
          her feelings by hearing them voiced by another, Anne has to indulge these feelings
          vicariously, since she has no-one to share, sympathize, or even suspect her love for
          Wentworth. The delight Louisa and her sister Henrietta take in Wentworth’s stories of life
          at sea thus becomes for Anne, however painfully, the only means in which her own memories
          of hearing these tales could possibly find expression outside of her own thoughts: “their
          surprise at his accounts .&#160;.&#160;. drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which
          reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant” (60). Diegetic space is
          converted into the space of Anne’s consciousness; private life given public form, yet Anne
          (and the reader) is the only public in a position to recognize this. The conversations
          between Wentworth, Louisa, and Henrietta are mirror image of earlier ones between
          Wentworth Anne, yet because the narrator never describes this courtship—and because no
          character ever acknowledges it—they function as the novel’s only depiction of it. Anne and
          Wentworth’s second engagement functions, we might say, as a kind of proxy for the first.
          It seems no more than fitting then that this engagement should follow René Girard’s model
          of mediated desire so closely: Wentworth, observing the interested look Anne’s cousin Mr.
          Elliot casts on her at Lyme, “gave her a momentary glance .&#160;.&#160;. which seemed to
          say, ‘That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne
          Elliot again’” (97). Having been triggered by a third person, Wentworth’s feelings,
          appropriately enough, are only expressible within it. Castigating his friend Captain
          Benwick for having fallen in love with Louisa less than a year after the death of an
          adored wife, Wentworth counsels Anne that “A man does not recover from such a devotion
          .&#160;.&#160;. He ought not; he does not” (173). Speaking of his friend provides
          Wentworth with the opportunity to speak about himself, as if he were barred from directly
          expressing his feelings.</p>
        <p>Anne and Wentworth’s eventual reconciliation follows the same pattern, offering a
          particularly literal instance of triangulated desire, in which an oblivious third speaker
          acts as a medium for Anne’s feelings in the presence of Wentworth. Faced with the prospect
          of having to go to a dinner in honor of Mr. Elliot, Charles Musgrove peevishly remarks
          “What is Mr. Elliot to me?” “The careless expression,” Austen’s narrator asserts, “was
          life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with
          his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to
          herself” (210). Both Anne and Wentworth, in the strangest of substitutions, refer the
          question to Anne rather than to Charles: ‘what is Mr. Elliot to me?’ Anne wants Wentworth
          to imagine her having said, dismissively; ‘what <emph>is</emph> Mr. Elliot to you?’
          Wentworth wants Anne to imagine him having said, anxiously. Anne is given an opportunity
          to answer this question the next day, again by proxy. This time the speaker is Mrs. Croft,
          arguing in favor of young people marrying quickly no matter their financial situation;
          Anne, we are told, “felt [the conversation’s] application to herself” (217). Austen’s
          heroine promptly enters into a passionate defense of women’s constancy in a conversation
          with a naval officer, speaking so as to be overheard by Wentworth. Inspired by Anne’s
          words, Wentworth abandons the letter he is writing and starts composing one to Anne
          instead, which she reads moments later. Wentworth’s decision to express himself in a
          letter ensures that the climatic moment of the novel, the moment in which the two lovers
          express their renewed feelings for one another, takes place out of the direct gaze of
          reader and narrator: “they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had
          once before seemed to secure everything” (225). </p>
        <p>That the two lovers’ vows should remain unheard by the reader is fitting, since their
          relationship has been wrapped in silence from the very beginning. Anne’s father and her
          sister Elizabeth not only refuse to recognize Wentworth socially, they appear to have
          completely forgotten his existence. The first conversation in the novel concerns a former
          neighbor of Sir Walter whose name neither he nor Elizabeth nor their lawyer Mr. Shepherd
          can remember until prompted by Anne: “Wentworth was the very name! Mr. Wentworth was the
          very man” (24). The man in question turns out not to be Anne’s old lover but his brother,
          a former neighbor of the Elliots, though Sir Walter observes that “Mr. Wentworth was
          nobody, I remember” (24). The sliding of Captain Wentworth’s identity under that of the
          ‘nobody’ who is his brother continues through the opening chapters of the novel, in which
          Anne repeatedly mistakes which Wentworth brother is being discussed. Austen seems to want
          to affirm Sir Walter’s arch observation that “a Mr. (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the
          nation,) always needs a note of explanation” (24–25). Indeed the novel goes out of its way
          to provide Wentworth with just such a note, for when Anne reflects that soon
            “<emph>he</emph>, perhaps, may be walking here” (25), the next chapter opens by
          pedantically noting “<emph>He</emph> was not Mr. Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,
          however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother”
          (26). </p>
        <p>What motive could Austen have for repeatedly confusing the hero of her novel with a man
          who never actually appears in it? The fussiness of Austen’s syntax—“<emph>He</emph> was
          not”—represents a curiously literal acknowledgement of the ambiguity of the third person,
          which, because it “does not specifically designate anything or anyone .&#160;.&#160;. can
          take any subject whatsoever or no subject” (Benveniste 199). The hesitation with which the
          novel introduces Wentworth mirrors the indifference with which he is regarded by the
          Elliots, whose monumental self-regard is signaled by their adoption of the third person in
          referring to themselves. The first thing we are told about Anne’s father is that “Sir
          Walter Elliot was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion” (6), an
          attitude adopted with equal zeal by Elizabeth and her obsequious friend Mrs. Clay, all of
          whom speak in one voice: “‘Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot. They did not know’”
          (131). The conflation of subjects results in a confusion of direct and indirect speech,
          most conspicuously in Sir Walter’s opening remarks, in which he responds to Lady Russell’s
          suggestion that he rein in his expenses: <quote>‘What! every comfort of life knocked off!
            Journeys, London, servants, horses, table—contractions and restrictions every where! To
            live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman! No, he would sooner quit
            Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.’ (14)</quote> The
          elimination of the distinction between direct and indirect speech makes conversation oddly
          permeable, allowing the narrative to take part in the very conversation it records: “‘Quit
          Kellynch Hall.’ The hint was immediately taken up by Mr. Shepherd .&#160;.&#160;. ‘Since
          the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,’
          he said, ‘in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side” (14). No one repeats
          Sir Walter’s utterance “Quit Kellynch Hall,” yet the words appear in quotation marks
          nonetheless. “‘he had no scruple,’ he said,” except that <emph>he</emph> didn’t say that;
          the narrator did. No wonder Mr. Shepherd refers to “the very quarter which ought to
          dictate.”</p>
        <p>At times <title level="m">Persuasion</title> betrays a remarkable lack of interest in
          specifying who is speaking and when. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of this comes in
          another passage of free direct discourse, in which the panicked statements of a number of
          different characters in the aftermath of Louisa’s fall are contained within a single set
          of quotation marks: <quote>‘Uppercross,—the necessity of some one’s going to Uppercross,—
            the news to be conveyed—how it could be broken to Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove—the lateness of
            the morning,—an hour already gone since they ought to have been off,—the impossibility
            of being in tolerable time.’ (105)</quote> The only person whose voice is not part of
          this concord, Anne, is rarely granted the privilege of quotation marks, speaking almost
          always indirectly: “Anne quietly tried to convince her [sister] .&#160;.&#160;. Anne
          avoided a direct reply” (99). This does not mean, however, that Anne is silent through the
          course of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. Mary and her husband Charles value Anne as
          a house guest precisely because she is so adept at conveying their needs and desires to
          one another, while never giving voice to her own. Having been converted into a medium for
          the feelings of others, it seems only fitting that Anne needs a medium of her own in which
          to express her own feelings.</p>
        <p>Her family’s reluctance directly to address Anne is not surprising given their belief
          that, like Wentworth’s brother, she is “nobody” (7). But then, this appears to be Anne’s
          view of herself: “her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way—she was
          only Anne” (7). For Miller, Anne’s sense of herself as ‘nobody’ represents such a thorough
          internalization of the position adopted by the narrative that <title level="m"
            >Persuasion</title> gives the impression of having originated with Anne herself, as if
          it were “a diary written in the third person” (<title level="m">Jane Austen</title>
            72–73).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Miller’s reading is based on an unpublished
            essay by David Kurnick: “Throwing Her Voice: <title level="m">Persuasion</title>’s
            Erotics of Indirection.”</note> The formulation is irresistible. I would only add that
          such a diary is the product of many hands. For just as Anne’s adoption of the third person
          to talk about herself represents “a thorough internalization” of the narrative, so the
          references to her in the third person that Anne overhears while playing the piano at a
          dance at the Musgroves represent a thorough externalization of it: “she has quite given up
          dancing. She had rather play. She is never tired of playing” (67). Anne is of such little
          consequence that she can be spoken of as if she were not present—as if, that is, she had
          no means of claiming the first person for herself.</p>
        <p> Anne’s situation is not dissimilar to Fanny Crawford’s in <title level="m">Mansfield
            Park</title>. Like Anne, Fanny is constantly spoken for and about; like her, she is
          often privy to the intimate conversations of others. Page observes of the heroine of
            <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> that “perhaps no heroine of a great novel has
          quite such a fondness for silence” (<title level="m">Language</title> 36) but in fact
          Fanny, like Anne, speaks more than we might think—it is just that almost all her speech is
          indirect, whether or not it appears in quotation marks.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            >George Eliot adopts this technique near the end of <title level="m">The Mill on the
              Floss</title> for seemingly similar reasons. In response to Lucy Deane’s urging that
            he absolve his sister from her promise never to see Philip Wakem, Tom Tulliver replies
            that “of course Maggie could do as she liked. For Tom’s part, he held himself to be
            bound by his duty to his father’s memory” (456). Despite appearing within quotation
            marks Tom’s speech cannot be direct, underscoring how unapproachable, even inaccessible,
            he is on the subject of what he and his sister owe the past.</note> In this sense her
          first reported utterance—“‘William did not like she should come away’” (13)—parallels her
          last, on which Austen’s narrator refuses to report: “Let no one presume to give the
          feelings of a young woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which she has
          scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope” (370).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Roy
            Pascal, in his indispensable study of free indirect discourse, points to Fanny’s opening
            remark as evidence that she “can hardly arrogate the self-assertive ‘I’ for herself”
            (51–52).</note> Anne-Lise François notes that “Austen’s third-person narration
          .&#160;.&#160;. relieves Fanny from first-person assertions” (224). But Fanny is sheltered
          from the first person even in direct discourse. The episode detailing Miss Crawford’s gift
          of the necklace to Fanny, for example, records all of Mary’s remarks, but none of Fanny’s
          responses, restricting itself merely to noting that Fanny has responded: “Fanny still
          resisted .&#160;.&#160;. Fanny protested .&#160;.&#160;. Fanny dared not make any further
          opposition” (202–4). The effect of placing Fanny, like Anne, outside the moment of
          utterance is to insulate her from the world, indeed from the passing of time. If Tony
          Tanner is right to argues that <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> tells the story of
          “a girl who triumphs by doing nothing .&#160;.&#160;. she waits, she endures” (143) then
          we might say that removing her from direct discourse affords her a time in which to wait,
          just as the novel’s trick of exiling her to Portsmouth provides her with a place in which
          to do so. Thus Fanny preserves her defining characteristic: moral consistency; she remains
          where she is—in the right—while Edmund and Sir Thomas Bertram slowly move toward her. </p>
        <p>Consistency is not exactly Anne Elliot’s defining trait, as Captain Wentworth knows to
          his cost. Yet, just like Fanny, Anne spends the novel of which she is the heroine standing
          still while others come round to her position. This results in a curious temporal
          dissimilarity between Anne’s consciousness of events, to which Austen’s free indirect
          discourse gives us unparalleled access, and that of those around her. Anne inhabits a time
          all her own. Consider, for example, the first, oddly delayed, words she speaks in the
          text. Introduced with the portentous line, “Here Anne spoke” (20), her opening remark is
          uttered in support of the idea that her improvident father should let his house to an
          admiral, but it can also read as a response, eight years too late, to Lady Russell’s
          objection to the idea of her marrying a sailor: “The navy, I think, who have done so much
          for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men” (20). Anne’s words do not
          possess a double meaning so much as occupy a double time. This time can best be glimpsed
          in two distinct yet similar moments in the text in which Wentworth saves Anne: first from
          the unwanted attentions of her young nephew—“some one was taking him from her
          .&#160;.&#160;. and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth
          had done it” (74)—second from a tiring walk—“he had done it. She was in the carriage, and
          felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it” (84). Both
          episodes are described from within Anne’s consciousness, a place where Wentworth, here
          “some one” rather than no-one, needs no introduction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
            a compelling reading of these twinned moments Adela Pinch observes that “Austen’s
            representation of Anne’s innerness takes the form of an <emph>inward</emph>ness that
            oddly seems only penetrated from the outside with difficulty” (106).</note> And both
          play strange tricks with time, the sign of which is the odd repetition of the phrase, “had
          done it.” </p>
        <p>Anne’s delayed perception is signaled by the strangely impersonal syntax, which sticks
          resolutely and confusingly to the third person, whether describing Wentworth, Anne’s
          nephew, or Anne herself. The passages are written in the third person of free indirect
          discourse, yet the perceptions belong exclusively to Anne. They do however share a
          significant feature of free indirect discourse: they lift the speaker out of the time of
          the narrative. Austen anticipates in such passages the kind of atomistic temporality
          common to modernist novelists such as Virginia Woolf, whose commitment to representing
          individual consciousness estranges her characters from each other, as if they failed to
          inhabit the same temporal moment. One of the striking characteristics of <title level="m"
            >Sense and Sensibility</title>, for example, is how often characters fall into reveries
          while speaking to one another: “From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of
          some minutes by Willoughby .&#160;.&#160;. rousing himself from a reverie at least equally
          painful” (309). <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> could be said to personify such
          reveries in the still, silent presence of Fanny, which might explain its oddly playful
          attitude to time, which it bends to suit its own purposes: “exactly at the time when it
          was quite natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care
          about Miss Crawford, and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire”
          (369). </p>
        <p>The same elasticity marks the passage of time in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>.
          Just a few moments elapse between Wentworth writing the letter to Anne and Anne reading
          it, and just a few moments more before they are reunited.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
            >Rae Greiner provides a fascinating reading of this episode in her essay “The Art of
            Knowing One’s Own Nothingness.”</note> Although Anne and Wentworth have to endure an
          agonizing wait, their second courtship possesses a strangely accelerated tempo: “Before
          Mrs. Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw
          him” (164). After the pair finally reconcile, time speeds up to such an extent that it
          erases the distinctions between moments upon which the passing of time depends: “All the
          little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there
          could scarcely be an end” (226). The repeat engagement with which the novel ends abolishes
          the passing of time altogether. For not just Anne’s consciousness is out of step with
          those around her; the text as a whole could be said to be out of synch, beginning with the
          act of persuasion which gives Austen her title, which is not only never narrated but takes
          place, strictly speaking, outside the time of the novel. Indeed the title, <title
            level="m">Persuasion</title>, suggests an ongoing action rather than the results of that
          action, confusing past and present in a way that sets the tempo for the entire novel.</p>
        <p> What reason would Austen have for organizing her last novel around a temporal
          disjunction? The answer takes us back to the relation between private and public with
          which I began, a relation introduced as early as the first paragraph of the novel, which
          reproduces the page of the <title level="m">Baronetage</title> detailing the history of
          the Elliot family. Sir Walter reads this history “with an interest which never failed”
          (5), partly because he busies himself updating the entry to include events such as his
          wife’s death and his daughter’s marriage. The amendments put public and private life at
          odds in a way that could be said to determine the novel that follows. The trajectory of
            <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is thus the opposite of the one outlined in Bowen
          and Finch, in which an all-seeing narrative makes private thoughts public. Instead, we
          find a consciousness constantly translating public events into private experience: “it
          would soon be over. And it was soon over. .&#160;.&#160;. Her eye half met Captain
          Wentworth’s, a bow, a curtsey passed .&#160;.&#160;. the room seemed full, full of persons
          and voices, but a few minutes ended it” (56). Anne’s consciousness speeds up time and
          slows it down, separates voices from persons and speakers from subjects, renders public
          life so private that one cannot even say when, where, and to whom it is happening.</p>
