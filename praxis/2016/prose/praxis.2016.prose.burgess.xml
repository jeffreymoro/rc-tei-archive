                <p rend="noCount">This essay examines Sydney Owenson’s strange syntax—at once ornate
                    and truncated, full of floating modifiers and attributions that remain forever
                    unresolved—as a medium for her explorations of sensation and perception. Tracing
                    the form of her novels in conjunction with her meditations on empiricism, it
                    argues that Owenson’s syntax resists the ontic and formalizing claims of a
                    Common Sense philosophy of perception. Instead her early novels enact,
                    syntactically and therefore figurally, a conception of “life” as ceaseless,
                    formless motion and an ethics of interdependency embodied in what Thomas Reid
                    called “mere sensation.” </p>

                    <p>To read the novels of Sydney Owenson has always been to be made to think
                        strangely: that is, to encounter, and often to struggle with, anomalies of
                        style, figuration, and form. Percy Shelley’s preoccupation with <title
                            level="m">The Missionary</title>, and his continuing engagement in
                        “Fancy” with what remain, to him, images inaccessible of resolution or
                        realization (or what he calls the capacity to “incorporate”) is at once the
                        best-known and most favorable contemporary response to such an experience of
                        Owenson’s novels (P.B. Shelley 1: 107).<note place="foot"> Most relevant to
                            this essay are the comments of Gelpi and Hogle, on sensation in
                            conjunction, respectively, form and philosophical implications. Gelpi
                            attributes to Owenson’s <title level="m">The Missionary</title> some
                            part of the origin of the “drifting atmosphere of reverie” produced by
                            the “associative and evocative image clusters” in <title level="m"
                                >Prometheus Unbound</title> (170–71). Hogle makes <title level="m"
                                >The Missionary</title> one of the influences on <title level="m"
                                >Alastor</title> that pile up “in an astonishing, interweaving
                            transference” coupled with a “dim awareness that his own ‘variability’
                            may come from a movement, a Lucretian one at bottom, commanding the
                            verses [and, in Owenson’s case, the prose] of his older contemporaries
                            just as much as his own” (45–46). More recent criticism, by, for
                            example, Wilson and Goldstein, has not elaborated these brief mentions
                            of Owenson’s connection with Shelley’s formal practice or its relations
                            to sensation. A second well-known, and related, though less favorable
                            contemporary comment on Owenson’s anomalies of form and sensation is
                            Austen’s snarky remark to her sister in January 1809: “We have got
                                <title level="m">Ida of Athens</title> by Miss
                            Owenson.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. We have only read the Preface yet; but her
                            Irish Girl does not make me expect much.—If the warmth of her Language
                            could affect the Body, it might be worth reading in this weather” (166).
                            See also Burgess, “Sydney Owenson’s Tropics” 283. </note> But his
                        coupling of preoccupation with the strangeness of fancy has close parallels
                        in several more public and more fully explicated reading histories, such as
                        William Gifford’s review of <title level="m">Woman: or, Ida of
                            Athens</title>, from 1809. Writing in the first number of the <title
                            level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, Gifford remarks that the effort of
                        reading the novel, “a hundred similar conundrums, in the compass of half as
                        many pages,” has left him “in despair; .&#160;.&#160;. turning the leaves of
                        the volume backward and forward.” He speculates that the printer must have
                        “fabricated the requisite number of lines, by shaking the types out of the
                        boxes at a venture,” making the novel “a kind of overgrown
                            <foreign>amphigouri</foreign>, a heterogeneous combination of events,
                        which, pretending to no meaning, may be innocently permitted to surprise for
                        a moment, and then dropt for ever” (Gifford 50). For John Wilson Croker, who
                        devoted a series of essays in the Dublin <title level="j">Freeman’s
                            Journal</title> to <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title> in
                        1806–7, reading Owenson is “a task of no small difficulty” that produces a
                        vertigo of “involvement and intricacy,” or focus and scale: “common
                        occurrences are decorated with importance, with mysterious dignity and
                        consequential remark—feebleness mimics strength, and trifles ape grandeur”
                        (3). Geraldine Jewsbury, to whom Owenson was at once a friend and patron,
                        similarly sums up the experience of reading her early works. Before writing
                        the <title level="m">The Missionary: An Indian Tale</title> in 1811,
                        Jewsbury writes, Owenson “read up a great deal for Indian customs, history
                        and antiquities,” but the details of her reading, “manners and customs,
                        races and countries,” become quickly “confounded together in the
                        rose-coloured mist of fine writing and high-flown sentiment. .&#160;.&#160;.
                        [T]he reader feels disposed to say as Sheridan said, when the servant threw
                        down a china plate with a great crash, without breaking, ‘You rascal! how
                        dare you make all that noise for nothing?’” (Jewsbury 1: 424–25). </p>
                    <p>Noise for nothing; heterogeneous events without meaning: in one sense, in the
                        emphasis on heterogeneity and clanging disunion, this reading persists in
                        more recent commentary. Terry Eagleton emphasizes, for example, the
                        “formally disheveled” quality of Owenson’s narratives. For Eagleton,
                        Owenson’s irresolutions of form are best understood as a failure of closure
                        and, in turn, as a consequence of Irish political history. He argues that
                        her novels embody a frustrated drive to reconcile the competing ideologies
                        of early nineteenth-century Ireland—“romantic” and “realist”; “domestic” and
                        “political”—and in this negative sense capture the historical “truth” of
                        Ireland’s colonized condition (Eagleton 182, 184). David Lloyd offers a
                        similar but widened perspective on this formal heterogeneity, so that
                        Owenson appears as just one among the group of nineteenth-century Irish
                        novelists whose fractious narratives invariably betray the “insufficiency”
                        of novel form to mediate the fragmentation and violence of Irish history
                        (Lloyd 141). Implicit in these more recent readings is an assumption about
                        narrative form that backreads what Lloyd has called the “laws of integration
                        or harmonization” characteristic of the later nineteenth-century realist
                        novel onto Romantic-period works (Lloyd 133). When such a drive toward
                        formal unity is construed, as Fredric Jameson posits about narrative in
                        general, as “an ideological—but formal and immanent—response to a historical
                        dilemma,” then such novels as Owenson’s most often appear as symptoms of a
                        historical conflict that refuses (for Eagleton and Lloyd, in the absence of
                        the structures of a nation-state) to be symbolically resolved (Jameson
                            139).<note place="foot">See also Jameson’s observation that “form is
                            immanently and intrinsically an ideology in its own right” (141).

                    </p>
                    <p>That the more hostile among Owenson’s earliest readers locate in the novels a
                        politics that is both consistent and readily identified—a mix of
                        “libertinism,” “disloyalty,” and “atheism” that stands as shorthand for a
                        specifically Irish version of English Jacobin ideology—suggests, however,
                        that the novels’ formal strangeness is something more, or other, than a
                        symptom of ideological ambivalence and historical fracture.<note
                            place="foot"> For these specific terms, see Gifford (52); see also
                            Croker’s references to “qualities&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. highly esteemed
                            in the realms of gaiety, and the circles of intrigue” as well as to a
                            “striking system of morality” at odds with religious convention.</note>
                        Such a strangeness could not, of course, have been understood, circa 1810,
                        as a failure to conform to realist conventions. But the consistent and
                        specific bewilderment expressed by contemporary readers suggests that
                        something is taking place in Owenson’s works that is distinct not just from
                        Victorian realist novel form but also from what Franco Moretti has called
                        the “<emph>intrinsically contradictory</emph>” transitional form of the
                        Romantic <foreign>bildungsroman</foreign>, with its tensions between
                        “dynamism and limits, restlessness and the ‘sense of an ending,’” or its
                        more specific instantiation in the imperial quest romance described by Sara
                        Suleri (Moretti 6, emphasis in original; Suleri 10–11).<note place="foot">
                            See also Trumpener 146 and Wright 22–25. </note> It is not only, and not
                        primarily, formal irresolution that troubles Owenson’s earliest readers.
                        Rather, these readers place a greater emphasis on their surprise and
                        bewilderment at encountering an overwhelming yet at the same time
                        frustratingly insubstantial plenitude: Jewsbury’s noisy mist; Croker’s
                        vertigo of scale; Gifford’s turning of pages, at once compulsive and
                        unrequited. </p>
                    <p>How are we to understand this experience and these motions? This essay will
                        argue that both arise, equally and inseparably, from a gap that opens, for
                        contemporary readers, between Owenson’s descriptions and the readers’ own
                        capacity to conceive of what is described. The irritable reaction of
                        Owenson’s earliest readers to this tension between what Yoon Sun Lee, in her
                        introduction to the present volume, terms “non-spontaneous, purposive
                        expression” and the expectation of “representation” heralds Carl Schmitt’s
                        enraged encounters with what Lee, quoting Jacques Rancière, identifies as
                        the (definitively Romantic) “‘phenomenon of expression as such.’” The gap
                        between description and conception, or expression and representation, is
                        produced by the syntactic form and the lexical range of Owenson’s
                        invocations of sensation and its sources, or, in other words, as I will
                        show, by the play of figuration. </p>
                    <p>In what follows, I will explore the relationship of Owenson’s figural
                        practices to conceptual irresolution, readerly motion, and narrative form in
                        her early novels. Attending most closely to <title level="m">Woman: or, Ida
                            of Athens</title> and <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, and to
                        the philosophical essays Owenson, as Lady Morgan, published alongside
                        autobiographical anecdotes and opinions in <title level="m">The Book of the
                            Boudoir</title> in 1829, I will propose that this quartet of critical
                        concerns—conception, figuration, motility, and fractured form—is the
                        register, for readers, of what I would like to call an ethics of sensation
                        in Owenson’s works. As such, it demands that these works be read in relation
                        not only to the histories of national and narrative form but also to the
                        intersecting histories of empiricist and idealist philosophies of sensation
                        and what recent scholarship has begun to see as the closely related topic of
                        Romantic understandings of the relationship between organic form and the
                        sciences of life. </p>

                    <p>Owenson may seem a surprising candidate for a philosophical reading: her work
                        has not been addressed by any of the major recent scholarship on the history
                        of sensation, and, to the extent that her novels have been considered in
                        conjunction with empiricist thought, the readings have tended to concentrate
                        exclusively on her invocations of political sympathy.<note place="foot"> On
                            sensation, see especially Wang, Terada, Jackson, and Goodman. On Owenson
                            and the philosophical tradition of empiricism (read here in its
                            iteration as moral philosophy, particularly its emphasis on sentiment
                            and sympathy, here associated with “romance”), see Nersessian 110–41;
                            Connolly 85–124; Ferris 60–62.</note> Yet the essays she published in
                        later life speak suggestively—more suggestively than elaborately, but in a
                        context designed retrospectively to inform readings of her novels—about her
                        interest in contemporary philosophy, particularly questions of sensation and
                        of life. By her early teens, she writes, she had been broadly “influenced”
                        by “the value of philosophy and the importance of chemistry”: she took
                        “infinite delight” in Locke’s theories of sensation but found Kantian
                        idealism “vague and unsatisfactory” (though it is not clear that she ever
                        read Kant) (Morgan, “Raconteurs” 1: 32; “Richard Kirwan Esq.” 1: 60). In
                        middle age she enjoyed discussing philosophy with her husband, though on
                        occasion, when she forgot herself, “giving [her]self the air of talking
                        metaphysics .&#160;.&#160;. and throwing in a word on the <title level="m"
                            >Doctrine of Causation</title>” in front of male visitors, “a look” from
                        Sir Thomas Charles Morgan could quickly send her back to conventionally
                        feminine topics such as landscape, with which she “made ‘pure description
                        hold the place of sense’” (Morgan, “Doctrine of Causation” 1: 191–92).</p>
                    <p>Even when most absorbed in metaphysical discussion, however, Morgan remained
                        less interested in “sense” than in sensation. She is canonically Lockean on
                        the derivation from sensation of what she calls “natural causes,” but what
                        Locke identified as the relation between a “Cause” and what is “produced by”
                        it she redefines correlationally, as the observed “concurrence of certain
                        antecedents with certain consequences” (Locke 324, 2: 26 §1; Morgan,
                        “Doctrine of Causation” 1: 193). Elsewhere she seems to differ more
                        explicitly from Locke on the relationship of sensation to the metaphysics of
                        causality. What is for Locke evidence of “the Qualities, that are really in
                        things themselves” is for Morgan a thing in itself: she dispenses with
                        Locke’s view of “<emph>simple</emph> Ideas” as “the Marks, whereby we are to
                        know, and distinguish Things” and “<emph>complex</emph> Ideas <emph>of
                            Substances</emph>” as “Representations of Substances, as they really
                        are,” and with his distinction between “real” and “fantastical” ideas, or
                        those “with a Foundation in Nature” and those without (Locke, <title
                            level="m">Essay</title> 372–74, 2: 30 §1–2, 5). For Morgan, in contrast,
                        “to prove a proposition means, to render it evident to the senses—nothing
                        more” (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158). This emphasis on sensation
                        allows her to remain agnostic on such questions as the nature and qualities
                        of the “external world” even as she distances herself from “the idealist”
                        who “has no ground for believing any other existence than his own mind”
                        (Morgan, “External Existence” 1: 158). </p>
                    <p>With such a statement, Morgan firmly separates her epistemological musings
                        not only from Locke’s representational and referential conception of
                        sensation but also from the major metaphysical schools of her own time:
                        Kantian idealism, with its positing of an extrasensory noumenal realm that
                        grounds all knowledge even while it remains inaccessible save to the
                        intuitions of reason, and Thomas Reid’s common sense philosophy, with its
                        establishment of a given though incompletely perceptible world as an arrest
                        to the skeptical implications of empiricism.<note place="foot"> As Ameriks
                            points out, contemporaries, not least Kant’s first interpreters and
                            expositors, tended to understand Reid and common sense as Kantian
                            precursors (21–22). </note> Unlike the phenomenophiles discussed by Rei
                        Terada, who retreat to “mere phenomenality” in retreat from or revolt
                        against the normative pressures of the given, Morgan seems, in her essays,
                        to bracket the very idea of givens (Terada 32).<note place="foot">Terada’s
                            model takes note that most if not all Romantic phenomenophiles are men,
                            commenting that some narrative genres of the period, notably the Gothic
                            novel, that were “next door to mere phenomenality” were more hospitable
                            to female writers.</note> Gifford complained that Owenson was an enemy
                        of, or perhaps merely allergic to, “revelation” (52). He may have been more
                        accurate when he wrote, with Gifford, of Owenson’s “inveterate obliquity” of
                        “mind, which prevents her from perceiving, or stating a fact as it really
                        exists”; certainly there is more evidence in her writings for such a claim
                        (Croker and Gifford 261). In <title level="m">The Missionary</title>,
                        Owenson comments that the “waking dream”-like experience that suffuses the
                        eponymous protagonist Hilarion on his arrival in “Cashmire” is “sensation”
                        that has “survived all power of perception” (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). And, as we will see, Owenson does turn away—not
                        glancingly, but persistently—from what Reid called “perception,” or the
                        cognitive assemblage of sensations into approximations (imperfect figurings)
                        of the things of the given world, the secular counterpart of “revelation,”
                        or at least of metaphysical doctrine (Reid 290).</p>
                    <p>Truncated as they are, Morgan’s philosophical comments in her essays can
                        serve as little more than hints. In her early novels, however, to which the
                        essays are a supplement, Owenson dwells constantly in sensation. Here, for
                        example, is a passage from the extended (eight-page) scene that introduces
                        Ida Rosemeli, the heroine of <title level="m">Woman</title>, a passage
                        characteristic enough to make one of Gifford’s three epigraphic examples of
                        “a hundred similar conundrums in half as many pages” (Gifford 50). In the
                        scene Ida is asleep and seen for the first time from a distance by an
                        “English traveller”: <quote> an air of vestal innocence, that modesty which
                            is of soul, seemed to diffuse itself over a form whose exquisite
                            symmetry was at once betrayed and concealed by the apparent tissue of
                            woven air which fell like a vapour around her. There was something so
                            delicate, so ideal in her form, that the very drapery that veiled it
                            seemed to partake of its aerial character; and her gently languid
                            respiration alone, spoke her not a thing which fancy only had
                            embodied.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <lb/> Changing her attitude from grace to
                            grace, as indulgence dictated, or ease impelled, the variety of her
                            gentle motions might have presented to the statuary the most beautiful,
                            the most difficult models for imitation; while the delicious indolence
                            of doubtful sleep seemed still to struggle with the renovating energy of
                            awaked intelligence. Happy state of indefinite existence! how perpetual
                            the formless but delicious visions which live and die with you!

                            room .&#160;.&#160;. ; then drew a drapery across the lattice work to
                            exclude the sun: the drapery excluded, also, the dazzled gaze of the
                            English traveller.—The beautiful vision vanished! After the scene, the
                            forms, he had previously witnessed, could it be more than a dream!

                        a strange plasticity of image by means of extended conceits and uncertain
                        pronoun reference (in the analogy between modesty and translucent veiling, a
                        comparison founded on the simile form of “seem[ing],” it is impossible to
                        determine whether the “apparent tissue of woven air” is a figural or
                        material garment, or, somehow, both), strings of adjectives whose
                        numerousness and abstraction confirms the stated pairing of “the most
                        beautiful” with “the most difficult,” and dangling participles that,
                        remaining unsutured to a subject, never attribute the actions they describe
                        (who exactly is “changing [Ida’s] attitude” as she sleeps, and whose
                        “indulgence,” “ease,” and “imitation” are at stake?) (Owenson, <title
                            level="m">Woman</title> 1: 23, 26). By Owenson’s diction and syntax, as
                        in the narrator’s semantic claim, Ida’s presence is “at once betrayed and
                        concealed” (1: 23). Is Ida, as the novel’s title suggests, a “woman”? A
                        “form” (1: 28)? A “vision” (1: 28)? It is only certain, from Owenson’s
                        thickly worded but strangely vaporous and “vanish[ing]” description, that
                        she is “not a thing,” at least “not a thing which fancy only had embodied,”
                        even as the scene invites “the [whose?] fancy” to “wander .&#160;.&#160;.
                        through imagined worlds” (1: 23).</p>
                    <p>It is worthwhile, here, to compare Owenson’s scene with Reid’s pioneering
                        1764 distinction between sensation and perception, which worked, from within
                        empiricism, to arrest the skeptical impulse latent from the beginnings of
                        associationist theories of mind. It is indeed the case, Reid argues, that
                        sensation is autotelic, “can have no existence but in a sentient mind,” but
                        “perception .&#160;.&#160;. hath always an object .&#160;.&#160;. which may
                        exist whether it be perceived or not.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. [T]he perception
                        of an object implies both a conception of its form, and a belief of its
                        present existence” (Reid 289–90). This common sense brake on skepticism
                        functions poetically as well as metaphysically: if for Locke, as Natania
                        Meeker and Helen Thompson have argued, “substance can only be apprehended as
                        figure,” then for Reid, in the process of perception, the figure takes fully
                        resolved shape with a stable referent in the things of nature (Thompson and
                        Meeker 185). “The signs by which objects are presented to us in perception,”
                        he proposes, “are the language of nature to man,” so that “there is
                        certainly a resemblance, and necessary connection, between the visible
                        figure and magnitude of a body, and its real figure and magnitude” (Reid
                        153, 296). Though the form of a “visible figure” may be more or less
                        complete according to the viewer’s perceptual capabilities, as in the case
                        of “a man born blind,” the thing perceived will always appear to a sighted
                        viewer with all the formal completeness of a reflection in a mirror (Reid
                        154). The figural range of perception, in short, is determined by poles of
                        incompleteness and completeness, or partially and fully apprehended form,
                        which is to say, synecdoche on the one hand and metaphor on the other. </p>
                    <p>The presence of the thing, and the referential bond between this “real
                        figure” and the “visible figures” that represent it in the mind, is never in
                        question in Reid’s philosophy, for it is warranted by what he calls “the
                        Author of [his] being” (Reid 294). In Owenson’s <title level="m"
                            >Woman</title>, in contrast, lexical range and plenitude and syntactical
                        restlessness and uncertainty mean that the figures of sensation are left
                        unresolved. They don’t fully take shape, and the glancing sensations they
                        capture are left unpinned to the assumption of a stable referent. Thus they
                        are best understood as a series of metonymies: shifting sensations, often
                        minute, impermanently as well as imperfectly established as a partial
                        reference to any fully formed or fixed “external thing.” Not for nothing did
                        Owenson’s contemporaries describe her early novels as “extravagant,” or
                        wandering, figuratively, outside the straight paths of representation marked
                        by metaphor, synecdoche, and common sense philosophy.<note place="foot">
                            According to a review of <title level="m">Woman</title> in the <title
                                level="j">Dublin Satirist</title> of November 2009, quoted in
                            Belanger 119, Owenson’s “extravagant picture” would be “more creditable
                            to her head and heart” if she were “to keep within the bounds of
                            decency, probability, and common sense.” I rely here on Paul de Man’s
                            account of metonymy as “purely relational” and his account of metaphor
                            as associated with “an element of truth” in his reading of Proust, and
                            follow de Man’s association, in this reading, of synecdoche with
                            metaphor rather than metonymy (de Man 14). For a reading of sensation as
                            a figural event, which Reid, like de Man’s Proust, pursues, the
                            association is more convincing than what de Man acknowledges is the
                            synecdoche-metonymy pairing more common in “classical rhetoric” (de Man
                            63n).</note> The descriptive passages in her early novels typically
                        remain both formless and fluctuating. If they frustrate such readers as
                        Gifford by inciting them to fruitless motion, they engage another kind of
                        reader, such as, avowedly, Shelley, who enjoys the invitation to wander.</p>

                    <head>3. Form and the ethics of sensation: Owenson on “identity” and
                        “life”</head>
                    <p>In the series of philosophical essays included in the <title level="m">Book
                            of the Boudoir</title>, Owenson Morgan argues that the process of
                        wandering of, and in, sensation, is commensurate with “life.” “To measure
                        human action against time, and to overtake it,” she writes in the essay on
                        “Rapidity,” “is to double existence. To live fast (properly understood) is
                        not to wear out life briefly, but to multiply the sensations which extend
                        it” (Morgan, “Rapidity” 1: 95). Such a motile and formless life is, in turn,
                        in Morgan’s assessment, at odds with conventional notions of unified, stable
                        being—with such notions, equally, as applied to the sensing agent and to
                        what and how the agent senses. The constant train of sensation contributes
                        to what Morgan calls, in the opening essay of <title level="m">The Book of
                            the Boudoir</title>, “the great mystery of identity,” which she
                        describes with the observation that “even the hand which traced the first
                        line of this farrago, is not the same agent of the same volition, with that
                        which will write the last” (Morgan, “My Book” 1: 5). Her agnostic
                        apprehension of “identity” denies her readers even the consolatory “fiction
                        of continu’d existence” Hume proposed to account for the human “propension
                        to unite .&#160;.&#160;. broken appearances,” including proprioceptions
                        (205). In 1827, an assessment of <title level="m">The O’Briens and the
                            O’Flahertys</title> in <title level="j">The Monthly Review</title> had
                        complained that “Lady Morgan is still devoted to the tessellated style of
                        writing” (Review 518). <title level="m">The Book of the Boudoir</title>
                        responds to such references to her preferred prose form (from tessellation
                        to “farrago”) by associating her composite, mobile, and formless prose with
                        the mixing of sensations that comprises “life” and complicates
                        “identity.”</p>
                    <p>Defining Romanticism as “a wide-sweeping inquiry into the phenomena of life,”
                        Denise Gigante has argued for the prominence of epigenesist conceptions
                        (those focused on the “power” of self-actualizing formal potential and
                        self-organizing form) in the poetic as well as the biological thought of the
                        period (Gigante 26, 39). For her the key figure in Romantic debates about
                        life is Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who repurposed his key phrase “multëity in
                        Unity,” the definition of poetic beauty, to define life as “unity in
                        multëity” (Gigante 3).<note place="foot">In the late fragments collected as
                            the <title level="m">Opus Maximum</title>, Coleridge simply joined
                            “multeity” and “unity” with the coordinating conjunction “and”
                            (298).</note> Against the dominance of Coleridge, Amanda Jo Goldstein
                        has recently posited the Shelley of <title level="m">The Triumph of
                            Life</title>, who, Goldstein argues, pursues a “Lucretian poetics of
                        transience” wherein the relations between and mutual impacts of living,
                        not-quite-living, no-longer-living, and
                        more-conventionally-understood-as-inanimate beings and things come together
                        in an understanding of life as collective, contingent, historical and
                        therefore perpetually in flux (Goldstein 62–63). To make this argument, for
                        Goldstein, is also to take issue with Paul de Man’s reading of figuration
                        (understood both as troping generally and as face-giving, or prosopoeia) as
                        “a power radically alien to life, relation, and sense” and the dominant
                        force in Shelley’s poem (Goldstein 66).<note place="foot"> Goldstein is
                            commenting on de Man’s claims that “disfiguration”—“the repetitive
                            gestures by which language performs the erasure of its own positions”—is
                            a process internal to figuration and is figured by the measured treat of
                            the Shape All Light in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (de
                            Man, “Shelley Disfigured” 119).</note> Here her argument takes an
                        explicitly ethical turn: when the category “life” takes on a distinct
                        ontological status, “life” also becomes a comparative and implicitly
                        value-laden term (Goldstein 69). Or, as Goldstein puts it, “when science
                        affirms specific forms of life [those less organized; those less fully
                        formed] to be medically less alive already, it helps to render their deaths
                        less reprehensible—a logic familiar to twenty-first-century readers from its
                        realization in fascist thanatopolitics” (70). For her Lucretian Shelley, in
                        contrast, faces are everywhere together. In the final few words of this
                        essay, I would like to consider the implications of Goldstein’s rigorous and
                        important reading of Shelley for approaching the novelist whose poetics of
                        sensation helped make Shelley think so strangely. </p>
                    <p>Owenson’s motion-capture of the play of sensation that is tantamount to life
                        is at least as tropical as the face-giving <title level="m">Triumph of
                            Life</title> for which it provided Shelley with a model. Yet unlike
                        Shelley, or Lucretius, the Owenson of <title level="m">Woman</title> and
                            <title level="m">The Missionary</title> rarely, if ever, makes faces.
                        Her closest approach to prosopoeia might be the moment when the narrator
                        asserts that the scene of the protagonist’s “delightful and delighted
                        wanderings .&#160;.&#160;. seem[s] .&#160;.&#160;. to smile into a luxurious
                        garden” as the “English traveller” approaches Ida’s home (Owenson, <title
                            level="m">Woman</title> 17–18). Here, though, the narrator’s figuring of
                        the traveller’s sensation yields a motion and a resemblance rather than a
                        face and an identity, however contingent, whether singular or composite. As
                        ever in Owenson’s early work, sensation, while figural (here, that most
                        mobile of tropes, the simile) is specifically not form-making.<note
                            place="foot">Carlson’s account of Shelley’s similes is relevant here:
                            “Shelley’s similes work against entrenchment in linguistic and ethical
                            realms, perpetually un-building the object world, including its putative
                            opposition to the internal life of the subject, by showing objects to be
                            as ethereal and ever-changing subjects and the so-called subjective”
                            (Carlson 77).</note> If we compare Shelley’s Lucretian atomism with
                        Owenson’s descriptions of sensation, we will discern Owenson’s contrasting
                        emphasis on a perpetual motion of fleeting minutiae, atoms of sense that
                        elude formal resolution: a rigorous (and, with respect to Shelley’s
                        prosopoeia, proleptic) resistance to pareidolias of all kinds. </p>
                    <p>I have cited the passage in <title level="m">The Missionary</title> in which
                        Hilarion, transformed by his journey through Cashmire, is stripped of
                        “perception” while “sensation” survives (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). Let me now add that in <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> Owenson contrasts Hilarion’s “waking dream,” in which
                        feelings associated with the “enjoyment” of sensation “possess
                        .&#160;.&#160;. themselves of his whole being,” with the early, imperial
                        ambition he conceives on his arrival in India (Owenson, <title level="m">The
                            Missionary</title> 105). On first seeing India’s “shores, which were
                        rather imagined than perceived in so great an interval,” his “spirit
                        .&#160;.&#160;. partook [sic], for a moment, the sublimity of the objects he
                        contemplated, the force of the characters he reflected on, and, expanding
                        with its elevation, mingled with the universe” (Owenson, <title level="m"
                            >The Missionary</title> 80–81). This is not just a formal but also an
                        explicitly ethical break with perception as a scene of self-making,
                        retroactively characterized, by contrast with the Cashmire passages, as
                        hubris and grandiloquence. </p>
                    <p>By emphasizing the unbridgeable gap between description and things, Owenson
                        prompts her readers to consider their own composite, mobile quality and
                        their suffusion in a world of sensation—an experience that, she reminds them
                        in <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, can also be understood as the
                        varied texture of love. What her contemporaries called decadent (but also
                        recognized as radical), and what subsequent readers have sometimes dismissed
                        as an effete leisured dalliance becomes an ethics of interdependency as
                        pleasure—lacking in determined outcomes, radically unproductive and,
                        therefore, in Owenson’s terms, “free.”<note place="foot"> The adjective
                            “free” is everywhere in <title level="m">Woman</title> and <title
                                level="m">The Missionary</title>; it not only refers to republican
                            polities (the opposite of “slavery”) but also to “love” as an “intimacy”
                            of “mind” and “heart” (Owenson, <title level="m">Woman</title> 1: 202;
                            3: 161). Carlson writes illuminatingly about “freedom” and love in
                            Shelley; Jackson makes a compelling case for the ideological character
                            of Erasmus Darwin’s aesthetics of pleasure, which influenced Owenson
                            philosophically and formally (Jackson, “Erasmus Darwin’s Romanticism”
                            175–77, 187). See also Burgess, “On Being Moved” 314–18. For an
                            “effusive” and “aristocratic” Owenson, see for example Moore.</note>
                        Such an ethics stops short of what Tim Milnes, in his essay in this volume
                        on the essayistic and pragmatic character of empiricism between Hume and J.
                        S. Mill, identifies as the “possibility of a shared experience,” which,
                        Milnes argues, is the implicitly ethical as well as epistemological goal of
                        Romantic moral philosophy. Yet Owenson’s prose, like the philosophical
                        essays of Charles Lamb and others, both avowedly subscribes to and formally
                        enacts a conception of literary form and literary experience that is, like
                        the sensation it cultivates and describes, exuberantly autotelic. Such an
                        ethics of sensation emerges with inconceivable but especially insistent
                        liveliness when it is read amid the histories of Romantic form and life.
