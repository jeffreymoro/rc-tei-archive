               <head>About this Volume</head>
               <p>What might romantic minimality and brevity suggest as alternative additions to our critical vocabulary in romantic studies? How do they allow us to think differently—and
          briefly—about a constellation of questions and perspectives that throw into relief the necessity to think through the small, negligent, obscure, too little or too much, the ephemeral, the
          mere <emph>there is</emph>, the all but <emph>not there</emph>? The authors of the position papers collected for this issue were each asked to respond to just these kinds of prompts, and to
          keep their arguments operatively brief. Conciseness and intensification in service of our theme of brevity and minimality was the order of the day. The space between stanzas, like the
          disappearance of a ruin into history, became equal considerations for reflecting on the brevity of things that the larger “life” of romanticism cannot ever ignore.</p>

            Rettenmaier, Technical Editor. The initial
            transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup
            modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text in archival quality for
            better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the
            modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI
            files into HTML. The image associated with this volume is John Linnell's <title level="m">

            to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the
            languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
            Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on
            the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
            the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical
            discussions of today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this
            terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
            scholarship.</p>

               <head>Introduction: Too Much, Too Little: Of Brevity</head>
               <p> In a brief search of the <title level="m">English Poetry</title> database, the words “minimum” and “minimal” do not appear in the writings
          of some of the authors who we often associate with the period and concept of Romanticism. That almost insignificant fact, however, calls to
          mind a much larger series of matters that come to the fore as the clichés that serve as Romanticism’s most common and ponderous “others”:
          temporal and historical parameters of what Romanticism “was” and “is”; Romanticism’s theoretical suppleness and expansiveness; its <emph>too
            muchness</emph>, its affective expansiveness and rhetorical disruptions; its “uncontainable” and effusive structures; its slippery
          ambivalence as a term that either says too much or too little about the limits of historical thought; its putatively close engagements with
          vitality, “life,” creativity, infinity; and its ongoingness as a conceptual marker of modernity, refusing to bury a past that inscribes
          present temporalities through and through. Think of T.E. Hulme, for whom Romanticism posits “that man, the individual, is an infinite
          reservoir of possibilities; and if you can so rearrange society by the destruction of oppressive order then these possibilities will have a
          chance and you will get Progress” (57). One cannot, then, be too brief about what Romanticism seemingly aspires to, and the commitments it
          often hopes to maximize. </p>
               <p> And yet, as if rescinding Hulme’s terms in a poem that otherwise seems concerned with countering industrialization with pastoral
          self-expansion, William Wordsworth’s sonnet, “The World is Too Much With Us,” considers the fine calibrations involved in deciding what
          constitutes <emph>too much</emph> in the first place. If the world is one that is both “late and soon,/Getting and spending,” (Wordsworth
          1-2) it is one whose appropriative economies seek to reel in a world as something that is decidedly subject to representation and
          capture—one that is coercively <emph>with us</emph>. At the same time, it is also a world that cannot quite be held by those economies that
          criss-cross each other and seem to miss the very transitional object they cannot nor are properly able to destroy and leave behind. <quote>

                        <l>…we lay waste our powers;</l>
                        <l>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</l>
                        <l>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</l>
                        <l>This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,</l>
                        <l>The winds that will be howling at all hours,</l>
                        <l>And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,</l>
                        <l>For this, for everything, we are out of tune;</l>
                        <l>It moves us not. (2-9)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The little that is ours is seen, and the more that we don’t glimpse remains the blind spot in nature that cannot be taken.
          There is a world that is not <emph>this</emph> world, neither transcendental nor immanent, but something considered otherwise in its
          measurelessness. And strangely, Wordsworth’s critique of disenchantment and estrangement ends up exposing us to the remains of
            <emph>something</emph> that we can neither have nor approximate. If the sonnet’s meter seemingly condenses the speaker’s thoughts into a
          dynamic of evanescence and materialization, it is one that is transitional, testing, and mildly reparative—it tries to understand how, if
          there is too much of something with us, too little won’t do either.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Curran.</note>
          Less is not more, in this case—less <emph>and</emph> more are alternating ideologies.</p>
               <p>What might Romantic minimality and brevity suggest as alternative additions to our critical vocabulary? How do they allow us to think
          differently—and briefly—about a constellation of questions and perspectives that throw into relief the necessity to think through the small,

               <p> In a prosaic world otherwise tethered to the value of disclosure, unconcealment, publicity, and of making oneself heard, understood, and
          recognized, consider the small, unobtrusive, fugitive, minute, brief, cursory, and all but illegible sign or trace, the mark that could just
          as easily be over-looked as seen. What of the forms of life that do not merely endure but in fact <emph>honor</emph> inconspicuousness and,
          as Jacques Khalip argues, “anonymity”? Such barely perceivable indications and enunciations constitute what Anne-Lise François calls “open
          secrets,” i.e., “forms of uncounted experience and unremarkable virtue,” and all “those nonassertive ways of being in the world” for which
          the least demonstrative, expressive, or forthcoming is also a condition of utmost frankness because unapologetically free from the otherwise
          irresistible imperative either to withhold or present, to conceal a secret or speak the truth (60). Consider the ephemera that Samuel Taylor
          Coleridge conjures in “Frost at Midnight,” i.e., the shadowy figure or “stranger’s face” (41), whom he recalls as a child hoping would
          arrive at his classroom door, but doesn’t, as if a reverse image of the unknown visitor who rings the door-bell in Ionesco’s play, yet
          cannot wait to be received. Through the eyes of the child, the poet looks for a salvific sign, but what he sees is notable for its barely
          solicitous substancelessness. Coleridge glances at a glance that never was. An immaterial mediation of a fleeting memory of an encounter
          that failed to take place—an <emph>un</emph>missed encounter, so to speak—seems deliberately to flirt with the limits of what one can be
          made to feel or read as significant. Here there is no breathing of trauma that enlarges the psychic deep time of Romantic modernity. Rather,
          Coleridge queerly finds “companionship” with something that must be looked at precisely because it suggests nothing at all: he is queerly
          drawn to a filmy apparition that approaches in the mode of its own fading, taking pleasure not in a memory but in the eddies of anxious
          interiority that it leaves in its tremulously minimal wake. </p>
               <p>Perhaps this is what it means to tarry with what Emmanuel Levinas calls the trace, “the movement that already carries away the
          signification it brought” (70). What would it mean to follow such a movement for its insignificance, for unraveling precisely the
          experiences it nominally would appear to host? Without “getting and spending,” might the trace be the barest mark (which is precisely
            <emph>not</emph> the barest life, not answerable, in the manner of the biopolitical, to the measure of life or to a certain normatively
          sacralizing conception of “life”) that affords interest in a world that is too much—too powerfully coercive, demanding of assent,
          contractual in its sensible and epistemological obligations? Such a line of thinking suggests modes for reading and writing that circle
          around just this kind of brevity and minimality. If we have come to think that Romanticism can and must endure as the site of
            <emph>and</emph> the arsenal for excavating the historical, then perhaps such a historicism endlessly believes in the repleteness or
          sustainability of the “Romantic” as bedrock for life. If historicism is excessive in its tarrying of the referent with the letter, might
          there be an interest in questioning the degree to which such work might be <emph>too much</emph>, or perhaps <emph>too little</emph> in its
          emphases? That we here face an indistinction of exactly opposed weightings suggests that weighting is the problem and that tarrying with an
          indifference to weighing—weightlessness—offers a way to address that problem. Might “history” indicate a desire to cover over another kind
          of desire, one that often operates in Romanticism as an interest in Coleridge’s film as that which is never precisely here and not here, too
          small or too large, unfindable and fascinating in its absence? As we came to realize, the minimal itself is hard to pin down. </p>

            and then <emph>more</emph> of much less (re: the radical diminution of the “the Leech-Gatherer”): all keywords in the seemingly
            self-evident logics of accumulation and dispossession that play out in different ways in Malthus, Hegel, and Marx and that normatively
            organize life along the phantasmatic axis of minimal primitive “needs” and unlimited surplus “wants.” Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
            economisms give life to a powerful double anthropological illusion that privileges the concept of a simple origin in the least: the “man”
            of sheer needs who is never more essentially human than in this condition of naked life. The creature without <emph>wants</emph> wants
            nothing and wants for nothing . . . or so the story goes. As the youthful speaker of Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper” says, "Hush, Tom! never
            mind it, for when your head's bare, / You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair” (7-8). Bravely eschewing or cruelly denied
            surplus, ornament, or opulence, and thus imagined to be immune to the propertied vicissitudes of time and circumstance, the mirage of the
            subject who is resolutely independent from wants is compelled to be both scarcely human <emph>and</emph> the most human. This is not the
            only place in Romanticism where the minimum and the maximum incoherently meet. In the figures of the discharged soldier, the blind beggar,
            the bereft widow, the child slave, the dream of the destitution of a life untarnished by luxury flickers troublingly between scandal and
            nobility. Or one thinks of the hero-waifs of Dickens’s novels, who, through some dark magic, remain sentimentally attractive—to a moneyed
            class of readers—because they are enduringly human amid unendurable poverty. In conflating bare life with natural life, capital thereby
            becomes an apology for impoverishment, both notional and real. As Simon Jarvis demonstrates, no Romantic thinker makes the maddening
            destructiveness of this ideologically saturated anthropology more legible than Wordsworth. For Jarvis, the tale told by the weeping man in
            “The Last of the Flock” is exemplary in this regard. Our incredulity seems initially to be directed at a fellow whose narrative of
            austerity muddles wants and needs, but his inconsolable tears point readers elsewhere, towards the derangement of a culture that not only
            requires the destitution of others but also dares to call that deprivation salutary, a teachable moment. What is the lesson that
            Wordsworth’s mad and bereft shepherd knows in his bones to be a pacifying and defeatist lie? A “core of essential humanness remains
            unshakeable by all misfortune” (Jarvis 87).</item>

              Benjamin, reading Hölderlin, calls <foreign>die reine Sprache</foreign>, i.e., that which is purely or sheerly language, language so entirely divested of
              its semantic function, so indifferent to the solicitousness with which we naturalize language (compelling it to be human, indeed, the
              very sign of humanity) that it is divested even of that divestiture (Benjamin 54).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of Benjamin’s “pure language”

              and redaction, as Kevin McLaughlin argues, are “the pieces” or “the bits of language” (66) that can, among other things, testify to the
              barest of relations among texts <emph>as</emph> texts: the unused remainders of Thomas De Quincey’s <title level="m">Confessions of an
                English Opium-Eater</title> that knock senselessly about Charles Baudelaire’s <title level="m">Artificial Paradises</title> is a case
              in point. The French poet’s “technique of amalgamation,” as McLaughlin says, “imitates a dead spot, a pause, that comes between the two
              works” (66). <hi rend="bold">Example: </hi>In “Brief Encounter: de Man on Wordsworth, or The Irony of The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Lee
              Edelman reminds us of the spatio-temporal adjacencies that force language to torque between thought and unthought—quite literally the
                <emph>between</emph> as the hinge moment (or the blank space between the stanzas in “A slumber did my spirit seal”) that doesn’t quite
              perform the change from one thing to another. “Brevity,” Edelman remarks, “seen as the soul of wit, can make things easier to remember,
              thus enabling them to endure, but it also can be seen as duration’s impossible dream of self-erasure, its effort to collapse or
              minimalize the spatialization of time as distance. In that sense, the simultaneity of events (as opposed to their sequential unfolding)
              would constitute brevity’s absolute form, its purest realization.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> Wordsworth famously tarries with spots of time, which are their own genre of minimalia—the lyric distillation of the
              life of things that punctuates the prose of the world. Against those moments of the living present we might contrast the advent of the
              “dead spot,” the insentient passing of difference <emph>as</emph> difference, and nothing more. This alteration and altercation of
              “live” and “dead” spots brings to mind a memorable verse from Blake: “Los reads the Stars of Albion! the Spectre reads the Voids /
              Between the Stars” (<title level="m">Jerusalem</title> 36-7). A generation ago, Harold Bloom sketched out six revisionary ratios with
              which to consider the varied forms that poetic intertextuality can take, but those ratios feel positively baroque compared to the flat
              relationality or mere difference which McLaughlin associates with the recursiveness and indistinction of what he calls “poetic force”
              and “unforce.” </p>

              conceptually guided judgments that transform them into the objects of experience. In an often cited reflection on the judgments of
              taste, for example, Kant dreams of aesthetes for whose impassive and non-acquisitive eyes the sea is not as a source of food or
              transportation but merely that which appears, meaning—if the meaning of saying “something means something” isn’t already saying far too
              much in this instance—only its appearance and little else. The minimally cognizable is, as Kant insists, the source of an uncommon
              pleasure that is also shared and shareable by all rational creatures <emph>as</emph> rational creatures (153). (The conceptless concept
              of seeing next to nothing proves to have remarkable staying power. Consider, for example, its important if unexpected modulation in the
              work of Jean-Luc Marion, for whom seeing “saturated phenomenon” means “letting appearances appear in such a way that they accomplish
              their own apparition, so as to be received exactly as they give themselves” [7].)</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> But mere reflection is also strangely empty, comprehensible mostly in comparison to what it is not, i.e., the
              “determinate, empirical, contentful knowledge of objects” (Zuckert 1). Rodolphe Gasché points out that although in Kant “the adverb
              ‘merely’ (<emph>bloss</emph>) is not to be taken in a depreciatory sense,” (18) its repeated use betrays “the difficulty of isolating,
              with the required purity, the realm to be delimited” (19). At the point of mereness, the self-showing of an untrammelled purity is
              haunted by fragility and a vulnerability to all that it has shunned, shed, and excluded. “Looking at the stars forever”: so Rei Terada
              describes, recalling a strange moment of rapt inattentiveness in Keats’s <title level="m">Hyperion</title>, the almost unimaginable act
              of merely seeing—neutrally, endlessly (i.e., without an end in sight), and inconsequentially. “Among Keats’s many instances of scanning,
              survey, aversion, dreaming, aesthetic vision, partial blindness, and so on, I’m most interested in his inclusion of looking that seems
              openly absorptive, yet withholds its realization,” Terada notes: “<title level="m">Hyperion</title> exhibits a kind of discretion about
              what might accompany looking at the stars whose motive may be the inclusion of ‘nothing’” (278). Is reading—or a certain conception of
              reading—the paradigmatic instance of this minimal looking without seeing, eyes wide shut? <hi rend="bold">Example:</hi> in a reading of
              Horne Tooke’s <title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> alongside Shelley, William Keach focuses on rhetorical abbreviation and
              speed as components of “Hymn to Mercury,” where the latter figure is endlessly rethought and refigured as a trope for the brevity that
              enables poetic renewal and imagination. Indeed, as Keach reminds us, to read is necessarily to expose oneself to mere language, for
              example, to the sheer ordering of letters, phonemes, and words and to the spaces between those pieces of language, i.e., to the minimal
              differences without which signs cannot appear. </p>

              remind us of the sheerly inscriptive nature of both. What could it mean to attend, for example, to a squiggle in a Blake illustration,
              and to tarry with whether or to what degree it signifies? Or to consider the top portion of the first preliminary drawing for Francisco

                which it is impossible to decide whether they function merely as hatching or are already the first suggestions of the emerging contour
                of a representational form. The drawing, we quickly realize, does not just depict the imagination’s independent activity during
                sleeping and dreaming, but is also the place where it is carried out. (33)</quote> Yet Grave significantly underestimates the
              importance of the force of the minimum in Goya’s sketch (and perhaps this is an occupational hazard for anyone exploring the nature of
              the barely there) insofar as he recuperates what he sees as the incarnation of the imagination at work. In doing so, he phenomenalizes
              the indeterminate differences and inscriptions that capture the eye without knowing what to do with them. We find ourselves looking not
              at the drawing <emph>of</emph> something—including, after Grave, the drawing of the process of drawing—but of something more grossly
              indeterminate, something on the threshold of drawing but little else. At the instant that we sense the infinite directions that Goya’s
              image <emph>could</emph> have taken, but finally did not, the wisdom of Jean-Luc Godard’s remark rings true: “in the absence of the just

                rather as if initial anarchy had been brought to order. This is the incomprehensible base of reality in things, the indivisible
                remainder, that which with the greatest exertion cannot be resolved in understanding but remains eternally in the ground. (29)</quote>
              Among the many captivating elements of this harried primal scene is the reversal with which it threatens itself: if the unruly is the
              generative basis of this “world,” then isn’t the “world” rather than the “irreducible remainder” also what merely remains–or, at the
              very least, the remainder of the remainder in a chain of formings and unformings without origin or end? At the very least, Schelling
              surprises us with the possibility that, pared down to its bare foundations, the ground is as unknowable as it is shaky, the scene of a
              pregnant indeterminacy that he captures by moving restlessly between describing the fundament as either the <emph>un-grund</emph> or the

              much depends upon the minimal difference between the two barely discernible prefixes qualifying what, strictly speaking, should stand on

              things is not a fall from order into disorderliness but the reiterated imposition of order on an unruliness that renders that order
              provisional, anxious, and always on the very threshold of ruin. In its minimal state, reality is equiprimordial with this ancient and
              pervasive fractiousness, a universe of remaindering, never to be remaindered. <hi rend="bold">Example: </hi>Michele Speitz’s “<ref target="praxis.2016.brevity.spietz.html">Formal Remainders: Wordsworth, Brevity, and Being Cut Short</ref>” turns poetry back and

              as ‘here lies’ but also to the non-human ‘diurnal course,’ pursued by earth, ‘rolled round’ ‘[w]ith rocks, and stones, and trees.’” The
              “here lies” seems to point to or mark, without specifying, the taking place of something that then follows it, but what Speitz implies
              is that the this marking might very well have a pathos all its own. What seems left-over is in fact the origin’s trace of itself,
              haunting the known universe like so much background radiation. </p>

              of a lost whole, or an intentional spark for something yet to be worked out” (800). Coleridge could be said to condense both
              possibilities—the burned trace <emph>and</emph> the slight augury—in the figure of “that fluttering stranger” (26), “the film, which
              fluttered on the grate” (15) that we discussed earlier. Romanticism may teach us to consider the fragmentary minimum as something
              otherwise than as a privation. Carol Jacobs has powerfully taught us to think of a decidedly “uncontainable romanticism,” or “an
              uncontrollable moving beyond all those parameters seemingly fixed within the texts”; such a Romanticism moves by critically turning in
              upon itself, evolution positing <emph>something</emph> only to unground each position in a recursive about-face, an involution of form
              and meaning precisely at all processual turns (ix). Yet what is the materiality of this species of Romanticism—uncontainable,
              uncontrollable, surplus, excessive, merely <emph>more than what is given</emph>? Might the force of such a Romanticism be the other side
              of something adynamic, not even recognizable as a strength or force (or an unforce, as McLaughlin argues), but a worklessness that
              neither moves nor returns to anything at all? <hi rend="bold">Example</hi>: in Karen Swann’s “<ref target="praxis.2016.brevity.swann.html">Keats’s Mask</ref>,” the material fragmentation of “Romantic capital” is phenomenalized in
              Keats’s life mask—as overdetermined a piece of Keatsiana as anything—that is at once the ephemera of Romantic transmission but also a
              strangely recessive object whose historical shock is unforced, pressureless—“the shocks of what cannot be assimilated into that
              project—the arrested experience and its detonating posthumous life.” How does the mask circulate in a non-processual “force,” at once
              symptom of and a grinding down to the impossible nothingness of Romantic thought? Of Keats’s unfinished <title level="m">Hyperion</title> poems, Balachandra Rajan writes: <quote>The dignity of a fragment in a poetry of self-formation lies in its finding
                its place in a process, in its being justified by its own extinction. It makes the truth instead of returning to it. It contributes to
                a whole which is neither beginning nor end but only history. The unfinished, in such a view, carried with it no natural citizenship,

              find / Nor can his watch Fiends find it” (Blake, <title level="m">Milton</title> 42-3). <hi rend="bold">Example: </hi>the point, in <ref target="praxis.2016.brevity.carlson.html">Julie Carlson’s article</ref>, is just this kind of distillation and retraction, and
              retreads the historical and affective transformations that theater allows through poetry: “a point is a feedback loop offering multiple
              vectors of flight. Some heighten drama and/or the transports envisioned in and through aesthetic moments experienced collectively as an
              individual. Some are taken to the streets, fostering conviviality, consumerism, spouting clubs, inventions, protest or agitation. Some
              heighten or depress private theatricals.” </p>

                     <p rend="noCount">Redaction, subtraction, reduction, suspension, and <emph>epoché</emph>, a bracketing off of the contingent,
              empirical, and worldly, leaving nothing but bare relation. Kant’s notion of transcendental apperception would be a profoundly
              consequential case in point: consciousness’s pure, foundational, and immutable relation to itself as the implied subject of all its
              representations. Transcendental apperception involves no experience of an object because it is the <foreign>a priori </foreign>condition
              of experiencing anything at all. It is not a state or condition but punctually an act or event of consciousness/self-consciousness. As
              such it is the occurrence of a founding cleft or division without which a singular mentality would be inconceivable. We are reminded of
              Heidegger’s thinking of <foreign>Dasein</foreign>, which Derrida characterizes as emerging through a process of “reducing or subtracting
              . . . so as to keep nothing but a relation to itself, a bare relation, to the Being of its being” (11). This is the minimal relation to
              itself as relation to Being,” Derrida writes, “the relation that the being which we are, as questioning, maintains with itself and with
              its own proper essence” (11). At the point of the minimum, we appear to arrive at the singular, that which is something in particular
              and not something else. <hi rend="bold">Example:</hi> Galperin’s “<ref target="praxis.2016.brevity.galperin.html">Minimal Unit</ref>”
              offers just this kind of yardstick, but one that is impossible to extend: <quote>[it] surrenders to time but not at the expense of
                either the unit’s eventfulness as such or the vacancy or pause that, thanks to its unitary quality, prevents [it] from simply escaping
                or being negated…the minimal unit…performs a cognate function in romantic-period writing in focalizing a state of being that is
                typically missed or overlooked or discounted, especially in the welter of modernity where ‘one’s own time’ is just a heartbeat from
                becoming ‘what went before.’ </quote> “Singularity is necessarily divided,” as Jonathan Culler says: “it takes part in the generality
              of meaning, without which it could not be read, and so is not closed in on itself, <foreign>punctuelle</foreign>, but iterable”
              (871).</p>

               <p>This essay addresses Percy Shelley’s exploration of linguistic brevity as a temporal and spatial phenomenon. Beginning with
          Shelley’s rethinking of John Horne Tooke’s account of grammatical abbreviation and of the tropological and iconographic significance of the
          figure of the wingéd Hermes (Mercury), the essay also draws intertextual connections in Shelley’s poetry to Horace’s “Ars Poetica” and to
          the “Homeric Hymn to Hermes.”</p>

               <p>The word <emph>brevity</emph> appears to derive from a troping of spatial linearity towards the temporal. The earliest examples of Latin
            <emph>brevis</emph> refer to shortness of “length in its different directions of breadth, height, or depth”—even to the length “of a
          circle, as merely a line, and without reference to the space enclosed” (Lewis and Short). The transfer of these spatial senses to temporal
          phenomena gives <emph>brevity</emph> an inherent spatiotemporal motility at issue in a long series of questions provoked by the topic of
          this volume. Among these questions is this one: are all our representations of time dependent on vocabularies of space?<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a useful overview of recent philosophical debate on this issue, see Robin Le Poidevin, “The
            Experience and Perception of Time,” <title level="m">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</title> (Fall 2011 Edition). Web.</note>
          Linked to this is the recognition that the Latin <foreign>brevis</foreign> and the English <emph>brief</emph> acquired, from very early in
          their histories, distinctly discursive and rhetorical significance. Thus the question of <emph>brevity</emph> carries important and
          difficult implications for ongoing debates about the materiality of language.</p>
               <p>One obvious place to turn in thinking about romantic brevity is John Horne Tooke’s unfinished dialogic book about language, <title level="m">ÉPEA PTERÓENTA, or the Diversions of Purley</title>. Before I continue with Tooke, let me give a brief indication of where I’m
          headed. Shelley ordered <title level="m">The Diversions of Purley</title> from his bookseller in December 1812 (<title level="m">Letters of
            PBS</title> 2: 345), certainly read it, and in the unpublished text we’ve come to call <title level="m">Speculations on
            Metaphysics</title> dissents sharply from what he takes to be Tooke’s efforts to reduce metaphysics to a “science of words” (Clark 185).
          Nevertheless, Tooke’s main theoretical concerns, together with his deployment of the figure of Hermes/Mercury, play an oblique but
          significant role in Shelley’s writing. </p>
               <p>The key analytical concept in Tooke’s sometimes brilliant, sometimes erroneous, sensationalist version of universal grammar is
            <emph>abbreviation</emph>. The term designates a dynamic that is both structural and historical. It emerges in the opening chapter from
          two interlocking and post-Lockean principles: (1) “The first aim of Language was to <emph>communicate</emph> our thoughts; the second to do
          it [quickly], with <emph>dispatch</emph>”; (2) “many words are merely <emph>abbreviations</emph> employed for dispatch, and are the signs
          [not of things or of ideas, but] of other words” (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 14). The process of
            <emph>abbreviation</emph> involves the derivation of conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, and the syntagmatic constructs they make
          possible from nouns and verbs. The cognitive act that supplies the etymological information <emph>abbreviation</emph> elides is what Tooke
          calls <emph>subaudition</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Tooke and <emph>subaudition</emph>, see Roy Harris
            and Talbot Taylor, <title level="m">Landmarks in Linguistic Thought</title> (London: Routledge, 2013), vol. 1, 168-69.</note> He
          elaborates these principles playfully as well as ponderously—and here I want to turn directly to the frontispiece of <title level="m">The
            Diversions of Purley</title> and its connections to the dialogue in Chapter 1 between Tooke and his skeptical friend Richard Beadon. </p>
               <p>The engraved figure of a young Hermes seated on a block of stone in the act of either putting on or taking off his winged sandals was
          designed and executed by William Sharpe, a well-known specialist in line engraving and Tooke’s friend and radical political ally. In broad
          terms the visual subject is familiar within one of the traditional representations of Hermes. But Sharpe’s figure differs in suggestive
          detail from this tradition—from the ancient Roman copy of a Lysippan bronze, for instance, as well as from eighteenth- and
          nineteenth-century versions of the subject in the Louvre. Sharpe’s Hermes is younger, his body more relaxed, the expression on his face more
          enigmatic as he looks at one of his pairs of wings. The pyramids in the background must allude to the syncretic identification of Hermes
          with Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing, and thus to Hermes Trismegistus. The caption beneath the image is from Horace’s <title level="m">Ars Poetica</title> 25-6: “dum brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio” [while I labor to be brief, I become obscure].<note place="foot" resp="editors">I have been unable to determine the textual basis for the conjunction “dum” at the beginning of this
            quotation. All eighteenth-century and present-day editions I have looked at begin the sentence in the middle of line 25 with “Brevis esse
            laboro.” This is in itself ironic—maybe ironically predictable—since conjunctions are among the parts of speech that Tooke is most
            concerned with.</note>The bearing of this quotation on Tooke’s analysis and on Shelley’s response to it is ironic. On the one hand, as
          Zachary Sng argues, “[the] principle of dispatch and its faithful servant, abbreviation, turn out to be curiously opposed . . . to [the] aim
          of communication.” Brevity often produces obscurity. On the other hand, Sng observes, while the “way of error was thus shown by the god
          Hermes, . . . the way out of it is revealed by the same deity” (59-60). To this insight we may add that Horace’s words in Tooke’s
          frontispiece syntactically and prosodically perform the brevity, and not the obscurity, they refer to.</p>
               <p>In the Chapter 1 dialogue it is Tooke’s interlocutor Beadon who initiates an indirect commentary on the frontispiece by complaining that
          “you have . . . no[t] a single word to unfold to us by what means you suppose Hermes has blinded Philosophy” (<title level="m">Diversion of
            Purley</title> 1: 24). Tooke responds by elaborating the metaphor of “the vehicle of our thoughts,” on his way to declaring that
            “<emph>Abbreviations</emph> are the <emph>wheels</emph> of language, the <emph>wings</emph> of Mercury” (<title level="m">Diversions of
            Purley</title> 1. 25). It’s especially the “<emph>wings</emph>” that make evident why Tooke used the Homeric formula <emph>épea
            pteróenta</emph> (winged words) as his title. <quote>B.— . . . You mean to say that the errors of Grammarians have arisen from supposing
            all words to be <emph>immediately</emph> either the signs of things or the signs of ideas; whereas in fact many words are merely
              <emph>abbreviations</emph> employed for dispatch, and are the signs of other words. And that these are the artificial wings of Mercury,
            by means of which the Argus eyes of philosophy have been cheated.<lb/> H.—It is my meaning.<lb/> B.—Well. . . . Proceed, and strip him of
            his wings. They seem easy enough to be taken off: for it strikes me now . . . that they are indeed put on in a peculiar manner, and do
            not, like those of other winged deities, make a part of his body. You have only to loose the strings from his feet, and take off his cap.
            Come—Let us see what sort of figure he will make without them. (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 26-7)</quote> What
          interests me here is the connection between Tooke’s demystifying method and the visual:verbal figure of Hermes, whose mythologized bodily
          identity is made entirely dependent on a non-essential supplement. This supplement—the artificial vehicular wings—is represented in a way
          that disrupts both the conventional eighteenth-century image of language as the clothing or veiling of thought and the transcendental image
          of language as embodiment or incarnation. We might (somewhat tendentiously) call the analytical method that emerges from Tooke’s figure of
          Hermes a hermeneutics of abbreviation.</p>
               <p>Hermes’ winged sandals are Tooke’s figure for abbreviation-as-speed, for a discursive brevity understood not primarily as conciseness or
          compactness (as in the lines from Horace) but as sheer rapidity, quickness, “dispatch” (the Lockean term he uses repeatedly, with its
          implications of communication and of elimination). Speed may of course produce brevity—but it doesn’t do so necessarily: Shelley’s
          evocations of speed sometimes go on for a long time, for long stretches of verse. For Tooke, abbreviation is not a discursive phenomenon of
            <foreign>parole</foreign> subject to the agency of particular speakers or writers; it is an aspect of <foreign>langue</foreign> as
          historically evolved system. Tookian brevity is primarily a matter of syntactical grammar and only secondarily a function of phonetic or
          graphemic duration. </p>
               <p>There is, however, a persistent problem with Tooke’s conviction that “the <emph>composition</emph> of <emph>ideas</emph>” is “merely a
          contrivance of Language” (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 37) —or as Hans Aarsleff summarizes it, “that the operations of
          mind are really operations of language” (51). And this problem has specifically to do with abbreviation-as-speed. The development of thought
          is identical with the development of language—and yet, Tooke says, the speed of the former will always exceed the speed of the latter: 
        <quote> Words have been called <emph>winged</emph>; and they well deserve that name, when their abbreviations are compared with the progress which
          speech could make without these inventions; but, compared with the rapidity of thought, they have not the smallest claim to that title.
          Philosophers have calculated the difference of velocity between sound and light: but who will attempt to calculate the difference between
          speech and thought! What wonder then that the invention of all ages should have been upon the stretch to add such wings to their
          conversation as might enable it, if possible, to keep pace in some measure with their minds. (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title>
          1: 28-9) </quote>
        Language retains an otherness to thought here that, by implication, must have to do with what Saussure refers to as “the linearity of the
            signifer,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The “linear character of the signal” is the second principle in Saussure’s
            chapter on the “Nature of the linguistic sign” (<title level="m">Course in General Linguistics</title>, 69-71). Roy Harris’s
              discussion of this principle in <title level="m">Reading Saussure</title> (55 ff., 69 ff., 124 ff.) is particularly
            helpful.</note> which persists in differentiating language as discursive system from the mental life it makes possible and otherwise
          constitutes. </p>
               <p>Shelley’s reading of Tooke would have foregrounded this problem, I suspect, and would have led him to understand abbreviation-as-speed
          rhetorically as well as grammatically. Language is “arbitrarily produced by the Imagination and has relation to thoughts alone,” Shelley
          writes in the <title level="m">Defence</title> (<title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> 513), and yet in British Romanticism’s
          best-known paradigm of inspirational and compositional brevity, “when composition begins, inspiration is already on the decline” (531). As a
          consequence, poetry must continually renew and reawaken the metaphoricity of language as a counterforce against its deteriorating into a
          system of “signs for portions or classes of thoughts” that is “dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512). “[T]he copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar,” Shelley insists, “. . .are merely the
          catalogue and the form” of language that remains “vitally metaphorical.” Shelley’s attraction to swiftness, rapidity, and quickness might be
          read, then, as a rhetorical rewriting of Tooke’s grammatical abbreviation-as-speed. Where Tooke in his way disfigures Hermes to isolate the
          function of his wings, Shelley may be said to refigure the ties of these “artificial” wings to Hermes’ mythographic body. </p>
               <p>Such refiguration is at work in Shelley’s translation of the Homeric “Hymn to Mercury” (1820), parts of which read as an allegorizing of
            <foreign>poieisis</foreign>, including lyric temporality, in its Hermetic and Apollonian modes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Kahan 147: “. . . through a turn away from the text, [Shelley’s] translation provides the formalization of a
              historic moment in Greek history when <foreign>techne</foreign>, as work primarily productive of an object, becomes
                <emph>praxis</emph>, work primarily defining a subject, and when the demiurge, not yet strictly artisan, is still thaumaturge as
              well.” </note> Rhetorically the poem capriciously (in some moments maliciously) narrates and dramatizes the first day of
          Mercury/Hermes’ life: twice he says explicitly (in English as in Greek) “I was born yesterday” (ll. 363, 497). Much of the poem depends on
          an extreme and comic durational abbreviation for which we might adapt Mieke Bal’s term “temporal foreshortening” (144). On his way to
          stealing Apollo’s cattle, the un-infant Mercury comes across a tortoise, “Moving his feet in a deliberate measure” (l. 30) and is instantly
          inspired to an act of gruesome creative violence. With a chisel “He bore[s] the life and soul out of the beast” (50) and turns its shell
          into the sounding-board of the world’s first lyre. Shelley makes this scene of lyric origination a moment of fiercely sadistic
          “dispatch”:

       In his book on Shelley and translation, Timothy Webb observes that the “image of the wheel with its flashing spokes does not occur in the
          [Greek] original” (Webb 99). But the wheel image does occur in connection with the figure of Hermes’ speed in Tooke’s <title level="m">The
            Diversions of Purley</title> where, as we’ve seen, it instantly gives way to wings as a metaphor for the speed of grammatical
          abbreviation. In Shelley’s translation, via a negative simile, Hermes/Mercury fashions the artifact of lyric <foreign>energeia</foreign> by
          transmuting slowness into swiftness in a flash of perverse brevity.</p>
               <p>Shelley’s allegory of sonic intensity and duration turns towards a mercurial materiality of the letter in Mercury’s confrontation with
          Apollo over the theft of his cattle. To escape detection Mercury mysteriously makes his own and the cattles’ prints in the sand turn
          backwards, “So that the tracks which seemed before, were aft” (l. 98; Shelley is translating the phrase <foreign>íchni apostrépsas</foreign>
          in l. 76 of the Greek text). He then discards his (already winged?) sandals and substitutes for them sandals improvised out of tamarisk
          leaves that further obscure his footprints. The figure of linguistic signs as footprints is recurrent in Shelley and carries both
          inscriptive and tropological implications. In the “Hymn to Mercury” the image is comically played out when Apollo hauls Mercury before Jove
          and complains of (among other things) “the double kind of footsteps strange”:

        The entire confrontation is framed by Mercury’s invention of the lyre and brought to a close by his passing on to Apollo an instrument
          imbued with mercurial rapidity, exploitation, and deception as well as with the potential of sublime pathos. </p>
               <p>Apollo is eventually undeceived by Mercury’s cryptic traces. But he has come to be indebted to Mercury’s artificial gift of lyric
            <foreign>energeia</foreign>—a quick, opportunistic performative brevity that exploits thought’s vexed interdependence with its material
          articulations. As Apollo launches into a concluding encomium of the “little contriving Wight” (l. 585), he is represented as doing so in
          Mercury’s own terms: “His words were wingèd with his swift delight” (l. 581).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Near the
            end of her article Kahan argues that Mercury/Hermes, despite the appearance of compromise, ultimately wins: “. . . the kind of <foreign>to
              poiein</foreign> Shelley has in mind bears affinities to Hermes’ <foreign>poieisis</foreign> rather than to Apollo’s . . . Hermes, the
            Chthonian to Apollo’s Olympian, has . . . privileged access to magical powers and his utterance is accordingly marked by its transgressive
            ability to subdue rational argument” (168).</note> With the concluding exchange of lyre and caduceus, though, we may be left wondering
          about the terms on which mercurial/hermaic brevity can survive its normalizing Apollonian appropriation.</p>

               <p>The minimal unit in romantic-period writing maintains the uneasy status of being in time as
          well as out of it: both temporalized as a condition of occurring and sufficiently
          freestanding to withstand incorporation to any narrative in which the present would be
          captured by the future in becoming anterior and contained or, in the case of poem like
          Shelley’s “Mont Blanc,” in bringing “vacancy” to some larger account. Closer to an instance
          of “stopped time,” the minimal unit marks an interval where time proceeds just enough for
          something monadic to occur as a pathway (or detour) to something else--some other timescape,
          some other world or stratum, some recessive consciousness--of which the unit is now an
          apprehendable trace. </p>

               <p> In a recent discussion of modernity as a discourse of empowerment, where the past is presumed fixed and capable of yielding historical knowledge, Harry Harootunian notes that in histories
        “devoted to reconstructing the past of a present” that is putatively modern there is also (and paradoxically) no time for that present or for the “minimal unity” (in his phrase) from which the
        modern might be ratified in its break from what precedes it. That’s because “what distinguishes modernity,” according to Harootunian, “is consciousness of time and how it relates to both past
        and present. If all events are,” in some sense, “catastrophic,” he argues, “constantly destroying the new landscape, it will not be time that successively carries away each now, each present.
        Rather each present is empty, vacated of meaning at the moment it arrives” (18). My interest here, then, is in the way writing of the Romantic period, despite its subscription to a
        “self-accelerating temporality that,” in Reinhart Koselleck’s description, “robs the present of the possibility of being experienced as the present” (22) (as in “Can Spring be far behind?” or
        “something evermore about to be”), manages also to make time for the present. And it does so not by monumentalizing the minimal unit (in rendering it, say, a spot of time) but, following
        Harootunian’s claims, through a dialectic of vacancy and occupancy. In instances ranging from “hinge moments” in Austen and Keats to double-takes in Wordsworth, the minimal unit surrenders to
        time but not at the expense of either the unit’s eventfulness as such or the vacancy or pause that, thanks to its unitary quality, prevents this suddenly “[a]pprehendable present” (Kosselleck
        22) from simply escaping or being negated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am concerned broadly speaking here with a polarity bounded by Benjamin’s
              sense of a recurrent present and de Man’s sense of recurrent loss or what, with specific reference to figuration, he describes as an authentically temporal destiny” (“Rhetoric”
            206).</note> It is the case rather that the minimal unit in Romanticism maintains the uneasy status of being in time as well as out of it: both temporalized as a condition of
        occurring and sufficiently freestanding to withstand incorporation to any narrative in which the present would be captured by the future (Koselleck’s notion) in becoming anterior and contained
        or, in the case of Shelley’s “Mont Blanc,” in bringing “vacancy” to some larger account. </p>
               <p> And so what I’m describing here are instances of “stopped time” where time doesn’t really stop but proceeds just enough for something monadic to occur as a pathway (or detour) to something
        else—some other timescape, some other world or stratum, some recessive consciousness—of which the minimal unit is an apprehendable trace. For Harootunian this other world is nothing less than
        culture or cultural practice itself or what, with special focus on Japan, he calls “history’s disquiet”: the commonness of tradition lived in the everyday where both history and time appear
        motionless (155). And while there are ways, certainly, that the minimal unit, as I construe it, performs a cognate function in Romantic-period writing in focalizing a state of being that is
        typically missed or overlooked or discounted, especially in the welter of modernity where “one’s own time” is just a heartbeat from becoming “what went before” (241), what I’m after here is
        less wieldy even as it is by definition bounded.</p>
               <p> But it is, first and foremost, <emph>minimal</emph>: constrained to a present that, for all its alterity in the long run (as I’ve been arguing), is irreducibly unitary and/or the
        same. We can take as an example of such a unit the “hinge moment” in Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title>, where the phrase “Emma could not forgive her”—this in reference to the heroine’s
        same-aged counterpart, Jane Fairfax—closes one chapter only to inaugurate the chapter that follows immediately. (Another example from this same novel, working to quite different ends, would be
        the largely depersonalized and strangely vacant view from Ford’s store, where “a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer” [183].) In his
        characteristically brilliant brief on the hinge moment, D. A. Miller notes that, however out of place this repetition might appear, particularly for a writer “whose sentences frame everything
        with elegant edges, . . . . it becomes clear that a shift, a change, has occurred in the time or space between” the first “Emma could not forgive her” and its reiteration. “What generates the
        first ‘Emma could not forgive her,’” he observes, is 
      <quote>Emma’s own affective consciousness, intimately accessed and ironically inflected by its free indirect narrative performance. What generates the second ‘Emma could not forgive her’ is pure
        narration, a detached consciousness to which Emma’s own has ceased to contribute having been reduced to a little bit of information useful to the plot. By virtue of repeating the same formula
        (truly magical), we move from free indirect style—for all its irony, always grounded in an intimate identificatory relation to the image of a person—to mere omniscient narration, more remote
        in its detachment, and less <emph>engagé</emph> in its impersonality. (64-65)</quote>
      Or maybe, just maybe, it’s the other way around: that the repetition, far from registering some stylistic progress, figures—by and through its very infelicity—something monadic (again) that,
        to borrow Walter Benjamin’s formula, blasts the protagonist, or a consciousness to be precise, out of the homogenous course of both developmental narrative, where Emma will eventually learn
        forgiveness (among other things), and the equally appointed course of narrative performance, where by Miller’s lights the narrator and her erstwhile double eventually, inevitably, part
        company. What gives the reiteration force, in other words, or enough force to interrupt progress of all kinds in <title level="m">Emma</title>, is not the difference or change that Miller marks
        (however brilliantly) but a sameness, alternately subliminal and of the surface, in which a little bit of information achieves both unitary status and an exemption in the process from the
        operations of time by which either information, or more generally a given present, is captured by narrative and thereby vacated. </p>
               <p>But there is also, it turns out, something surprisingly vacant about this unit or about the rabbit hole, in effect, to which it proves tantamount. In the build-up to it, in fact, we are
        forewarned that the problem with Jane or with “her” to be exact, which the unit at once formalizes and amplifies, is not just a problem with the novel’s heroine (who is inclined to think “too
        well of herself” and too badly of others) but a problem, more importantly, in and <emph>with</emph> the present in which the narrative, the narrator, and even Emma are ultimately
        bystanders:
      <quote> Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not—and then, her aunt was
        such an eternal talker!—and she was made such a fuss with by everybody!—and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each
        other.” These were her reasons—she had no better. (130-31)</quote>
      It bears noting that the word “her” appears no fewer than eight times in this passage and that in one remarkable instance it is used in reference to the now-culpable and, dare I say it,
        unforgiveable protagonist “herself.” And while there is surely some collusion with the narrator in assigning moral authority to Mr. Knightley, who is briefly introjected by Emma as someone who
        knows best, the equally remarkable feature here involves the various rationalizations that Emma—with no guidance or assistance—dismisses on her own by putting in quotations. By the time of the
        minimal unit, in other words—and that time, once again, is the present—the “unforgiveable her” is really all that’s left: a misogyny that, beginning with Emma’s self-loathing and with the
        vacancy into which it gradually morphs (“These were her reasons—she had no better”), is seemingly beyond justification. </p>
               <p>To be sure, there are enough characters in this novel, from Mrs. Elton to the absent, equally odious, Mrs. Churchill, who bear a special onus in which both the narrative apparatus and the
        narrator, who does not scruple to distribute blame, conspire. But it is clear too that the acts of containment and judgment that the narrative performs in partnership with time fail on balance
        to forgive “her,” which is to say any woman. Miss Bates, who is a victim surely and deserving of sympathy, is only the most obvious instance of this unregulated hatred. But it takes just a
        moment’s reflection to recognize that misogyny is unregulated in <title level="m">Emma</title> because it is omnipresent: the substance of a now-time (if you will) that, depending on one’s
        perspective, is either accessory to the narrative and its regulatory operations over time or the oxygen that the novel continually breathes and a stratum to which the minimal unit effectively
        drills down. This explains, better than anything, why Miller is so invested in dissolving the minimal unit in tracing its temporal progress from point A to point B. For the monadic
        alternative, where the novel makes time for the present and for the social catastrophe that is the present, also stops time in virtually the same way that a broken phonograph record (in
        Miller’s analogy) stops it: as an irritant or “malfunction” (63) where narrative vanishes and where culture, for want of a better term, takes hold.</p>
               <p> The minimal unit does not always work to such miserable, if revelatory, ends. But in opening onto something continually present, it operates as a formal antidote to the consolations of form
        whether as narrative or, in the case now of Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale,” poetical argument, which is another kind of narrative. In the case of the “Ode,” the narrative/argument is embedded
        in the famous closing question— “Do I wake or sleep?” (80)—which, for all its mimetic force in capturing the speaker’s confusion and in breaking, thereby highlighting, a temporal continuum,
        lopsidedly pits the escapism that the speaker has been dallying with throughout against an immersion in nature and in time (again) that the poem both advocates and celebrates. And yet, in the
        hinge moment, where the poem turns irrevocably to the present (“forlorn. . . . Forlorn! The very word is like a bell / To toll me back from thee to my sole self!” [70-72]), something irrupts
        (or returns) that complicates the poem’s management of time and the homology more specifically of world and time that is Keats’s version of the fabled “marriage” of mind and nature. While it
        purports, as a formal artifact, to represent the movement of the speaker’s mind in a present that, like the environment before him, is ongoing, what the “Ode” stages—with an assist once more
        from the minimal unit as I’ve been describing it—is a disconnect, where in seeming to capture the present the poem does precisely that. Thus for all the poem’s subscription to immediacy, or to
        an engagement in real time, it is increasingly clear that what is presented here as process is not really process but a simulation in which virtually all that follows in the wake of “My heart
        aches” (1) is relegated to a teleology where the commitment to wakefulness is preordained and a paradoxically closed affair (like a poem). And it is the minimal unit, once more, the echoing,
        monadic, present demarcated by “forlorn,” that reopens things, vacating the “Ode” of its fiction in real-time or what is presented as a working through in time by tolling back, however
        counterintuitively, to the here and now and to the pain that, like the social catastrophe of Austen’s world, is always there and untethered.</p>
               <p> This has become a more melancholy demonstration than I had intended, so I’ll conclude on what I take to be a happier note: with the floral arrangement in Wordsworth’s Great Ode, which opens
        onto a materially glorious present that remains a steady, if at times invisible, accompaniment to the Ode’s progress, both in tracking developments in time and as an argument. Wordsworth, as
        we know, began writing what eventually became the “Intimations Ode” in 1802 only to suspend composition for two years upon completing the fourth stanza ending in the question “Whither is fled
        the visionary gleam / Where is it now, the glory and the dream?” As a goad to blockage, rather than the rhetorical question it became in the completed poem, where an answer of sorts is
        eventually provided, the question as it stood in 1802 is almost always viewed as an index of despair. But as the “meanest flower” in the poem’s last lines eventually confirms, this initial
        stoppage was an instance more properly of “stopped time,” where a present abides against artifice of all kinds, including the mythologies here of both loss and gain:</p>

               <p>Refusing to leave the present, even as it shifts perspective, the 1802 stanza goes from a “now” marked briefly by participatory <foreign>jouissance</foreign> (though we should pay
        attention to the enjambed flowers as well), to one that demonstrably slows, beginning with the Tree and then the field before stopping finally with the pansy. And while the pansy’s status as a
        <foreign>pensée</foreign> or pathetic fallacy would appear to transport it to a world and time elsewhere, there is a palpable tension between the figment of mind, on the one hand, to
        which the environment is indeed “gone” in this stanza, and the “it” or materiality, on the other, to which, as species of the “now,” the “glory and the dream” (and I’m assuming the pansy)
        potentially belong in the same way that “is” substitutes for “has” in the first interrogative: “whither <emph>is</emph> fled the visionary gleam.” In making time for the present or,
        better still, a parallel present in a text seemingly consumed by mutability, Wordsworth not only reaches a stopping point of considerable note; he reaches, however unbeknownst, a solution to
        the dilemma that he will proceed, as we all know, to belabor. </p>
               <p> That this is not how Wordsworth immediately perceived things, at least in 1802, may be reckoned a windfall for literary history. However, just as the speaker is tolled back to the present
        and to the very beginning of “Ode to a Nightingale” amid that poem’s procession through what purports to be real time, so it devolves on the minimal unit of stopped time—the flower’s thing- or
        “it”-ness as broached in stanza 4 and focalized in the abbreviated question “is it now”—to perform a cognate function in disposing of the argument eventually summarized in the poem’s subtitle
        (“Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood”) and prosecuted in the remainder of the poem. The “meanest flower” that brings the Ode to a final stop, rather than to
        closure, in largely bypassing its argument for trickle-down immortality, is simply a less adorned—if properly cryptic—version of a present that was stumbled upon when the poem first stopped
        and subsequently elided in the life-course that the poem outlines in preparation for the notably weak transcendence it eventually offers. But it is in the poem’s most famous passage
        arguably—“Though nothing can bring back the hour / Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; / We will grieve not, rather find / Strength in what remains behind” (180-83)—that the
        vacancy created by this timescape and the quite different vacancy or <emph>durée</emph> that defines the minimal unit (and the floral thinking to which it gives rise) are properly
        juxtaposed. </p>
               <p>I have already suggested that the hour or interval of glorying in the flower is a now-time rather than a placeholder for what is past and no longer available. Thus even as he insists that
        “nothing can bring back the hour . . . of glory in the flower,” the speaker is literally tripped up from “behind”—both in the lines just cited where the interval of stopped time is
        acknowledged along with the flower marking its immediacy (“is it now?”), and in the “behind” on which so much still depends. Moving seamlessly from an argumentative referent—a past that is
        fixed and lost even as it remains a resource going forward (as the poem elaborates)—to one that is far less argumentative—specifically a residue <emph>in and of</emph> the
        present—the hinge-work that “behind” performs is not a pun of sorts where past and present (or behind and behind) are conjoined in intimations of immortality from recollections of early
        childhood, but a narrowing of “time” to something minimal (as in “There was a time”) to which the poem, amid its bombast, reverts. This something minimal, it turns out, has a contemporaneous
        analogue in the famous caesura or pause of which Hölderlin speaks (and that de Man later mobilizes in discussing him), where in “a reversal of tone as well as . . . time,” an “end” (Hölderlin
        is referring specifically to the Oedipus plays) reestablishes a contact with the beginning which it seemed to have lost (<title level="m">Romanticism</title> 72). And in Wordsworth, with
        impending confirmation from the meanest flower and the peculiar (but hardly tragic) vacancy it occupies on reflection (thoughts that lie too deep for tears), “behind,” in disregard of <emph>any</emph> progress or mythology that the poem tracks, figures a “remainder” (in the poem’s own language) where only the present or, better, only <emph>a present</emph>
          prevails. </p>

               <p>This essay offers the phenomenon of theatrical points to consider
          the transformative power of these multi-sensorial highpoints in metropolitan Georgian
          theater.  Defined by the OED as a gesture, vocal inflection, or some other piece of
          theatrical technique used to underline a climactic moment in a speech, role, or situation,
          points often coincide with a play's textual highpoint, which they also surpass by
          temporarily stopping the show and shifting attention to the embodied significance of
          words.  They are brief, stunning, and highly anticipated moments and thus add to the
          suspension and extension of time as experienced in theater.</p>

               <head>On Point</head>
               <p>I offer the phenomenon of “points” experienced in Georgian London patent theater as an example of brevity presenting itself as a central concern of Romantic thought and culture. “Points” are
        those avowed highpoints in theater entertainment when the audience breaks into applause, shouts, tears, or displays other signs of transport in response to a significant moment of acting on
        stage. They are highly anticipated in that they are both electrifying and expected, and are said both to transport audience members out of themselves and, more than any other aspect of the
        evening’s entertainment, guarantee their return another day. Points often coincide with textual highpoints which, by virtue of their being enacted, are heightened but also surpassed in
        becoming a point, whose power resides in its multi-sensorial and multi-mediated nature. As the <title level="m">OED</title> states, a point is “a gesture, vocal inflection, or some other piece
        of theatrical technique used to underline a climactic moment in a speech, role, or situation; a moment so underlined” and cites as its first instance on 4 October 1822 this sentence in a
        letter written by the famous comic actor Charles Mathews: “I don’t know an instance of a point failing which I considered to be really good myself” (“Point”). </p>
               <p>The date given is curious, since the phenomenon and term existed more than a century earlier, even if its precise usage is difficult to stabilize and seems to move on a continuum from tableau
        to show-stopper. Usually points are ascribed to the transformative acting style of David Garrick, but Joseph Roach spots them in the “phenomenal success” in 1708-09 of Cavaliere Nicolini
        Grimaldi, whose “mastery of physical expression” inhered in his capacity to “stand motionless for a moment in an exceptionally expressive pose,” an “attitude” that he held “until he had made
        his <emph>point</emph>” (69).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also p. 111.</note> But the <title level="m">OED</title> definition is
        useful for my inquiry in characterizing a point both as a moment underlined and as a growing concern to commentators on Romantic-era theater. It continues: “frequently derogatory, suggesting a
        histrionic or exaggerated style, or with the implication that the integrity of the performance as a whole is being subordinated to the desire for immediate applause.” These derogatory
        implications have carried the day. The phenomenon itself has died out as a desired feature of a legitimate theater experience, and the histrionic and anti-poetic aspects of points capture in a
        nutshell why Romantic-era drama and theater were neglected as valid aesthetic objects until the 1980s. Those days have passed, leaving us to reconsider afresh what points tell us about
        aesthetic moments as experienced in the theater of this era. Taken out from under the weight of a Romantic ideology in criticism that still sidelines theatrical analyses of reality in general
        discussions of Romantic thought and culture, my focus on points considers how this “moment so underlined” in theater affects period discussions of transformation, both psychic and
        socio-cultural. </p>
               <p>Probably the two most famous examples of a point, in terms of their immediate and lasting effectiveness, are David Garrick’s Hamlet first encountering the ghost of his father and Sarah
        Siddons’s Lady Macbeth in the sleep-walking scene. Descriptions of both highlight the basic constituents: (1) “painting” a passion “to the life” through the (2) skillful integration of the
        actor’s body / language as measured by (3) the rapturous responses of audience members. These descriptions also underscore the fundamental paradox that makes theater so difficult to integrate
        into discussions of more exclusively print-based types of literature: turning the ephemeral into a lasting impression. In the case of these two points, the fame of their enactors was not only
        solidified through them but also guaranteed repeated descriptions of them, often graphically depicted—in biographies, memoirs of theater, and acting manuals. For example, Georg Christoph
        Lichtenberg’s famous account of Garrick’s Hamlet enlists a host of words to portray the body’s expressiveness and became a “stock in trade of German school anthologies”: “Garrick turns sharply
        and at the same moment staggers back two or three paces with his knees giving way under him; his hat falls to the ground, and both his arms, especially the left, are stretched out nearly to
        their full length, with the hands as high as his head, the right arm more bent and the hand lower, and the fingers apart; his mouth is open: thus he stands rooted to the spot, with legs
        apart[.] . . . His whole demeanor is so expressive of terror that it made my flesh creep even before he began to speak” (8). Such descriptions highlight the intense cross-fertilization (even
        chicken-egg circularity) of acting and painting in the eighteenth-century, as the growing popularity of portraits and engravings of actors depict them in point and as physiognomic depictions
        of individual passions are taken from acting and devoted to training new actors and rhetoricians.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On painting and theater,
              see Shearer West.</note> Garrick is said to be the first to capitalize in his acting on its evocation of painting, and Siddons’s fame resides not only in being perceived as
        statuesque but also serving as the model in the first anatomically-informed manual of physiognomy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Frederick Burwick
              (pp. 83, 100-02) on the scientific advances marked by Charles Bell’s <title level="m">The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression </title>(1806) and the centrality of
              Sarah Siddons in it. One of Siddons’s most famous points is the statue scene in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Depictions of Siddons’s sleep-walking scene portray the extremes to which audience transport can go but are no less exemplary in foregrounding that a point is realized—i.e., recognized as
        one—through responsiveness to it. On the occasion of her retiring from the stage (29 June 1812), her enactment of this scene literally ended the performance, “a nobly artistic audience
        insist[ing] that the curtain should there fall, so that the last grand impression might not be disturbed”—a rare instance in the period of a play being terminated as a sign of enthusiasm
        rather than protest (Baker 307). The fame attributed to Siddons’s enactment relates to her striking innovation of setting down the taper before engaging in hand-washing, a marked departure
        from Hannah Pritchard’s interpretation of Lady Macbeth, which Siddons took on against the advice and pleas of manager Thomas Sheridan (Campbell 186-87). This example underlines the
        epoch-marking function of points, whereby audience reception determines whether an aspiring actor can be said now to “own” the role, and where ownership inheres in fidelity to the points more
        than to the role altogether. Fidelity is not faithful imitation but a delicate balancing of novelty and expectation, where the most well-worn parts of a play appear suddenly novel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, a review that compares Dorothy Jordan unfavorably to Abington, Wilson, and Mattocks describes “two points
              which praise cannot pass over” as “all her own” (<title level="j">Public Advertiser</title>, 11 January 1786).</note> This means, too, that a successful point is co-created by
        actor and audience members. </p>
               <p> To the extent that they have remained visible as a desirable theatrical phenomenon in the Romantic era, then, points work to signify the artistry of individual actors and apprehension of the
        naturalness of their depictions of the passions through sight and visual culture. Though viewed as capable of threatening poetry, connection to artistry generally keeps points high. My
        interest is how their co-created nature becomes more leveling and more transporting once we re-evaluate the linkage between sensationalism and lower-class or juvenile tastes. The two most
        prominent features of a point—perception of the exquisite body / language of an actor and the transport occasioned by it—already suggest the coordination of what is often figured as an
        opposition between dramatic and theatric flow. That is, both the sign and immediate consequence of an actor’s captivation of audience attention is an outbreak in shouts, claps, tears, or
        stunned silence that interrupts the flow of the action. Press accounts note these outbreaks and sometimes assess the timing of them with varying degrees of approval but rarely with the
        implication that such disruptions are in themselves negative or that they damage the capacity to re-engage plot, poetry, or action for those so inclined. In this respect, points reinforce what
        recent scholars of late-Georgian patent theaters claim about audience psychology. Theater-goers were not expecting an artistically integrated experience nor were they seeking a unified
        emotional experience, given that, over the course of an evening, “a company may put forth nearly the full range of genres, from five-act tragedies and comedies to comic operas, farces,
        re-enactments of current events, and musical romances” (xv). Proof by contrast is found in the transcribed lament of actors performing on the same evening as Siddons “that farces that used to
        raise mirth in an audience after a tragedy now fail of that effect from Mrs. Siddons having so absolutely depressed their spirits that the best comic actors cannot dispel the gloom” (Baker
        237).</p>
               <p> Judith Pascoe’s inspired construction of <title level="m">The Sarah Siddons Audio File</title> portrays points as peak experiences that strengthen connections between playgoers’ memories and
        pleasures. Characterizing points as the “condensation of the romantic theatrical experience to a collection of emotionally, visually, or sonically intense scenes,” she notes how “audience
        members anticipated these particular moments, watched them play out, and compared them to versions they had already experienced or even enacted themselves” (72). Her emphasis on the
        “imprinting” of plays on the memory is fostered, I would argue, by two aspects of the condensation that points embody, both of which feature audiences as active. One involves distillation,
        points reducing the length, variety, and tedium of a play to a series of highlights, each intensified by this focalization. Points understood as peaks both require a sense of the whole and
        acquire a life of their own, this switch-word phenomenon being part of their efficacy. In their integrative function, points manifest the interdependence of text, speech, body, and mind; they
        relate part to whole in the multiple senses (role, body part, speaking part, part-object) on which theater draws and through the multiple senses that theatergoing activates. Moreover, these
        readings of mind-body integration also often are literal reading experiences, playtexts brought to and sold in the theaters so that spectators can read along, coordinating written to spoken
        and embodied word. The “Advertisement” prefatory to the first volume of [John] <title level="m">Bell’s Edition of Shakespeare’s Plays as they are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London </title>notes that, because “the THEATRES, especially of
        late, have been generally right in their omissions” of offensive scenes and passages in Shakespeare’s plays, “we have printed our <emph>text</emph> after their regulation” so that
        “those who took books to the theatre will not be so puzzled themselves to accompany the speaker; nor so apt to condemn performers for being imperfect, when they pass over what is designedly
        omitted” (11). At the same time, distillation makes points detachable and highly portable, key to their longevity and status as a negative disruption of drama. As play part-objects, points
        break free from their dramatic context and assume an independent life in theater as a “prelude or coda to other dramas” or as inspiring the “subgenre of thespian mimicry,” where one actor
        performs another <emph>actor</emph> performing a certain role (Pascoe 72). Outside of theater, their breaking-free occasions all kinds of repetition, both creative and banal,
        strengthening the theatrical dimensions of subjectivity and offering phenomenal analyses of the spaces and degrees to which transport moves one. </p>
               <p> Pursuing this dimension departs from the unifying function of condensation in both senses of departure. In the moment of perceiving a point in theater, the unity accorded to body and mind,
        hearing and viewing is apprehended <emph>by</emph> the audience’s reaction that in turn grants a picture of its collective responsiveness to a common humanity. In this regard, I take
        at face value hyperbolic and clichéd assertions in press accounts that “everyone” felt, wept over, or applauded a point as ratifying what their depiction in physiognomic manuals means to
        underscore: that points are studies in affect whose basic claim is that the body’s expressiveness has a special way of forming and uniting persons. But the phenomena of points viewed as
        Romantic-era affect studies register two further observations. Voice is a highly moving gesture. As Aranye Fradenburg writes, seeing precedes speaking in an infant’s development but sound
        precedes sight and is the sense through which space first becomes perceptual (240). Pascoe’s project to recover Siddons’s voice, inspired by Joseph Severn’s description of her “deep touching
        voice whose tones . . . were like the finest music,” the “grain” of which, according to Pascoe, made highly familiar speeches sound new and thus startling, underscores a general reality in
        theater that has worked to Romantic-era theater’s disadvantage: words are sensational (7, 45). The semiotic features of poetic language that are said to intensify the beauty of poetry are
        correlated with “dumb-show” in theater and thus perceived as threatening drama and poetry. A second observation is that the “truth” of our common humanity exemplified in points show
        recognition of it to be a fleeting, unpredictable, and highly mediated proposition. </p>
               <p>Both the integrative and detachable aspects of condensation affect forms of agency that we can attribute to theatergoers as a collectivity and as separate individuals. Here is where the unity
        concretized in a point breaks apart in multiple directions. The most obvious relates to the audience’s differentiation from actors and occasional exertions of power over them—for the actor’s
        ownership of a point competes with theatergoers’ own senses of proprietorship over them. Exercised collectively within the theater, audience ownership runs the gamut from refuting an actor’s
        claim to a role, to hissing at this or that point but calling for the play’s repetition, to ratifying a new reign.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
              example, this review of a new actor from Edinburgh in the role of Richard III suggesting also the nation-solidifying function of points: “The multitude view with the jealousy of a lover
              every rival to the object of their election, more especially whom they have recently crowned with the palm of universal suffrage. [Meggott’s] greatest defects were palpably an excess of
              emphasis in many points, a too lengthened duration of his pauses, and chiefly in our opinion a deficiency of tact in seizing the disposition of the house, and conforming himself to their
              tumultuous dictate” (<title level="j">London Times</title>, 20 July 1815). </note> “Woe to the actor,” summarizes W. B. Worthen, “who, under the misguided influence of an original
        conception of his character, scanted the public’s keen anticipation of Hamlet’s or Jaffeir’s or Sir John Brute’s familiar points” (72). One of the headiest audience pleasures of witnessing an
        actor in a new role is anticipating the possibility of crowning someone and thus overthrowing another—a visceral enactment of the power of the people when unified. Revealed as well is the
        rarity of such unity in this setting where entrance and seating arrangements enforce strict class distinctions and where audience attention is scattered across an array of theatrical stimuli.
        </p>
               <p>When felt, then, this unity provides a glimpse of how theater’s artistry brings people together in a context that otherwise accentuates diversity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Martha Nussbaum’s articulation of how past theaters strengthen democracy and “civic reflection” by seating members in lighted spaces where they “saw
              across the staged action the faces of their fellow citizens” (260).</note> That “everyone” is said to respond similarly for a moment merges the “fashionable” classes in the
        boxes with the “gods” in the upper galleries, a moment of merger then recalled in the next day’s news. Even if few viewers or readers were attending to the democratizing implications of this
        accord, it is portrayed and reasserted as “theater intelligence,” enacting the “extraordinary socializing potential” that Daniel O’Quinn ascribes to the developing “rapid feedback loop” of
        press and theater in this era (3, 1-42). What this unity also indicates is working people’s senses of ownership and differential experiences of it in theater. They too have particular
        collections of personal and class-meaningful points, whose “emotionally, visually, or sonically intense” modes of manifestation underscore that theater literacy encompasses an array of
        signifying practices that do not rely on or necessarily privilege being text-literate.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On “intertheatrical” reading
              practice that “includes speech, scenery, costume, lighting but also genres, conventions, and memory,” see Jacky Bratton 36-8. On working people’s experiences of theater, see David
              Worrall.</note> At the least, theater literacy casts a rage for spectacle as one of several reading competencies developed by theater. It also illustrates why it is foolhardy to
        ascribe any particular politics to theater’s democratizing and even radical tendencies. Like the riots that break out when the people take theatrical matters into their own hands, the agency
        affirmed by group or individual allegiances to points is deeply protective of tradition. At the same time, commitment to their conservation is central to the transformations that they are
        capable of effecting. </p>
               <p>Taken to extremes, the custodial impulse results in a closeting of drama, where those who identify as poets can better maintain the fantasies of control ascribed to private reading over
        public viewing.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Julie A. Carlson 158-60.</note> Oddly, this strategy, while it affirms the importance of
        points in the constitution of one’s aesthetic identity, undercuts how the phenomenon of experiencing points effects internal changes that are necessary but not usually sufficient to achieve
        changes in thought, behavior, or action. In linking the “aesthetic moment” to the “search for transformation,” Christopher Bollas examines condensation in its psychoanalytic function as the
        most important of the laws of non-discursive thinking, suggesting why points are both so group-charged and personally differentiating (40-49). Any one symbol brings together multiple disparate
        meanings and thus affective histories. Here one could say that the extent to which a person’s identity is felt to be formed by and invested in aesthetic objects affects the nature and level of
        change that an aesthetic moment experienced in theater activates. Conversions can be quite dramatic. Joseph Severn recounts how, knocked unconscious by the press of the crowd to see Siddons as
        Queen Katherine in <title level="m">Henry VIII</title>, he came alive at the sound of her first speech, sat “‘as one entranced and conscious of some new and vital influence in his life,’” and
        vowed from that moment to “live the life of an artist” (Pascoe 2). Accounts of the child actor William Henry West Betty cite his declaration at the age of ten that he “shall die” if not
        allowed to “be a player” after experiencing Siddons’s Elvira in <title level="m">Pizarro</title> (Merritt 2). More commonly, changes are momentary, primarily conversational, but in this respect
        conducive to fostering the good-naturedness that critics like William Hazlitt characterize as the cultural benefit of theatergoing; “Whoever sees a play ought to be better and more sociable
        for it” (157).</p>
               <p>Two features of Bollas’s argument heighten the transformative potential of theater’s sensationalism and the positive dimensions of its juvenile pleasure.
          <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The negative ascription of “juvenile pleasure” with a thirst for “distinctness” that hampers “illusion” is in Charles Lamb’s “On the Tragedies of
              Shakespeare, Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation” I:98.</note> An aesthetic moment is known, i.e. felt, in its re-activation of the “first human
        aesthetic”—the rhythms, tones, touches, and pacing of infant-(m)other interactions—and this mixed media environment fosters the developing infant’s cross-modal perceptual capacities (Bollas
          41).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On cross-modal transfers of sensorial experience, see Fradenburg 240-42.</note> Fradenburg notes how, from
        very early on, infants learn to coordinate gesture and sound and rely on this felt-coordination for their sense of well-being. Romantic-era theater draws adults as well as children back to the
        nonsense-makings of paralanguage and its developmental precedence over speech. Interestingly, all the avowed “low” points of Romantic-era theater run on this prioritizing, playing up what
        high-cultural playwright Joanna Baillie recognizes as the primal allure of theater: demonstration that “a love for active, varied movement in the objects before us; for striking contrasts of
        light and shadow, for splendid decorations and magnificent scenery” is as “inherent” in humans as the “interest we take in the representation of the natural passions and characters” of them
        (232). Moreover, since the former sets the conditions for emergence of the latter, appearance of character in theater is typically heightened, rather than nullified or denigrated, by
        paralanguage. No form in the period plays on this developmental reality as spectacularly as does pantomime, whose generic hallmark is the outstripping of language by dumb-show. While analysis
        of pantomime is beyond my purview, what I wish to emphasize is that its staging of transformation as a combination of technical ingenuity and magical thinking recaptures our earliest, most
        pleasurable modes of processing the world.</p>
               <p>David Mayer’s identification of a shift over the course of the eighteenth century in how change is concretized and operationalized in the harlequinade suggests the visual affective-cognitive
        heightening that these low points both enable and require. Unlike Harlequin’s “trickwork, which required backcloths or built-up pieces abruptly transformed at the slap of his bat, Clown’s
        visual similes were elaborate ‘tricks of construction,’” where from an initial “hodgepodge of items,” usually stolen, Clown would assemble some new creation (“a grotesque human form, a
        carriage, a travesty of a military uniform, a sailing vessel”) that Harlequin would then animate (39-40). The fact that this shift in clowning technology is performed by the incomparable
        Joseph Grimaldi is a further example of how points at once enable distinctions between high and low and render them unsustainable, though therefore repeatedly asserted. Besides stressing that
        Clown’s assemblages are produced in real time and before a live audience, Mayer’s description introduces two further deliberate boundary confusions at which pantomime specializes and that
        seeing it disseminates: the role of props in expressivity, and their dependence on print mediation for legibility as recognized properties of a “human” done “to the life.” In the case of a
        “high” point, as we have seen, integration is asserted by the immediate multi-media perception (itself mediated by memories of prior renditions) and mediated print accounts of it, in both the
        next day’s news and theater history. To return to my initial example, part of the sensation attached to Garrick’s Hamlet was the debut of a fright-wig, engineered by one hair-dresser Perkins,
        that made his hair actually stand on end at the sight of the ghost—a contraption that was not portrayed as countering the naturalness of Garrick’s depiction of Hamlet’s fear (Roach 58-59). By
        contrast, the low-highs of Grimaldi’s Clown’s “tricks of construction” begin from dis-articulation, persons and things starting as component, often mechanized parts, whose appearance of unity
        is made live and thus revealed as temporary, a coming-together that is cobbled, not pre-existent, and that is forged through visual simile. </p>
               <p>Print mediation is even more crucial to rendering these highly ephemeral, minimally textual moments visible and legible. In the day, playbills often gave them top billing, and, thanks to
        Mayer’s and Jeffrey Cox’s painstaking efforts to decipher highly cryptic stage directions, we are gaining a rudimentary picture of how up-to-the-moment many of these scenes were, both in terms
        of technology and topical commentary. In attending to these scenes of transformation, I wish to highlight Mayer’s cross-modal “visual simile” as an apt description of the affective-cognitive
        processing that theater literacy cultivates. Call it wonder. Sometimes, the connections being forged in these scenes are before-unapprehended because both tenor and source signify “the new,”
        sets presenting the latest styles, trends, shops, and fashions in what Jeffrey Cox calls “an early version of product placement” (Cox, “‘Illegitimate’” 174). Sometimes, the simile is visual in
        order to escape apprehension by the Licenser of Plays, allowing pantomime, because of its circumventions of speech, to offer the most biting satire on stage (Mayer 50). In any case, these
        techno-magical transformations underscore O’Quinn’s and Gillian Russell’s claim that Georgian theater is a “multi-layered performance event, occurring on stage and in the auditorium” that is
        “mediated throughout the print public sphere,” and whose chief function is to reconvey the lived experience of cultural change (338 ). In either case, such sophisticated, under-articulated
        cross-modal live connection-making operations have remained unapprehended as poetry. </p>
               <p>Reconsideration of points in Romantic-era theater should change that. Even when prized as the peaks that constitute a star, a point is a feedback loop offering multiple vectors of flight.
        Some heighten drama and/or the transports envisioned in and through aesthetic moments experienced collectively as an individual. Some are taken to the streets, fostering conviviality,
        consumerism, spouting clubs, inventions, protest or agitation. Some heighten or depress private theatricals. Especially when viewed as peaks of ingenuity and cross-modal processing, points at
        whatever height recall an attractive feature of juvenile minds, belief that following this path, or that, could be interesting.</p>

               <p>This paper reconsiders a shrinking set of Lucy poems from <title level="m">Lyrical
      Ballads</title> (1800) in light of the longer ballad that precedes them: “Ellen Irwin, or the
      Braes of Kirtle.” Here Wordsworth thematizes death through a constellation of always working
      but not always living bodies. Moving throughout the corpus of each poem, these bodies embark
      upon trajectories not marked off by life but designated more simply by movement itself, by
      the turns and lines that shape the dead as well as the living. Be it the affect of the
      flesh, the linear gait of a horse, the orbit of the moon, or even the muted work of figures
      newly mantled by the earth, each metaphorical turn shadows the aesthetic work demanded by
      each line. Scripting a counter-intuitive formulation—you think that lyric poems are about
      people, they’re not—the poems reclaim the human body for deep time and ultimately announce
      the limits of what poetry and humanity as a whole can do.</p>

               <p> In the trinity of Lucy poems housed adjacent to one another in the 1800 edition of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads,</title> Wordsworth thematizes death within a constellation of always
          working but not always living bodies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The question of Lucy’s body and its seemingly absent presence is an old but recurrent problem. To address this puzzle,
            I move that we turn to a familiar Wordsworthian sourcebook: Thomas Percy’s <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. </title>In it we find the poem titled “Lucy and Colin” by
            Thomas Tickell Esq. that prefigures concerns central to “Strange fits of passion” and that will find its echo in the buried lovers of “Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of Kirtle.” More
            specifically, the following lines suggest that Wordsworth follows Percy in his concern over the play and movement of the poetic line and what it brings to bear on the nature of human life,
            on its seeming beginnings and earthly or geological endings: <quote>

                  </note> Moving throughout the corpus of each poem, they embark upon trajectories not marked off by life but designated more simply by the turns and lines that shape the dead
          as well as the living.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Simon Jarvis “Wordsworth’s verse itself continuously explores, explicitly as well as implicitly, the question of what verse is.
            […] It is a quality of Wordsworth’s thinking in general to pay attention to the slipperiness and subtle intermediateness of nature and culture, and upon no topic more so than meter. He
            wishes for ‘an art … that shall be life,’ and knows how much he is wishing for. The model for it is that ‘human history’ possessed not, as it happens, only by some human beings, but by a
            clump of trees.” It would be a music whose human character would reside not in its ability to work the world over, filling it with human meanings, but in its capacity to
              <emph>receive</emph> meaning. And it would be able to do this just because meter itself cannot be confidently assigned, from a Wordsworthian view, either to nature or to culture (111,
            112 emphasis in the original). See also Alan Liu on how an exclusively formalist approach risks leaving behind pressing questions about historically constitutive components of human being;
            he writes, “We need to find a strategy […] to read […] humanity as a historical formation. [… Particularly, a] humanity that suddenly seems, from a differentiated view point, inhuman. Only
            at this point will the historical form of Wordsworthian humanity emerge, signaling the need to turn our gaze from the iconic text to the context generating the need for imagery in the
            first place” (312, 313). </note> Be it the affect of the flesh, the linear gait of a horse, the orbit of the moon, or even the muted work of figures newly mantled by the earth, each
          metaphorical turn shadows the aesthetic work demanded by each line.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Janowitz.</note> Life is short, and poetry offers itself as eternal; therefore, life
          is a poor subject even for Romantic poetry, and Wordsworth’s way around this is to focus attention on inanimate objects as a way of metonymically reflecting the human back on to itself.
          Scripting a counter-intuitive formulation—you think that lyric poems are about people, they’re not—the poems exhibit a Wordsworthian geo-poetics that reclaims the human body for deep time
          and that ultimately announces the limits of what poetry and humanity as a whole can do.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Here Wordsworth in effect confronts Romantic poetics, where for Susan
            Stewart “issues of the fixed and living dimensions of meter became inextricably tied to questions of the connections between poetic forms and other life forms, the possibilities for
            representing emotion, and the role of poets’ voices in an increasingly literate culture” (53-54).</note> Wordsworth does not offer us a Keatsian claim that “Thou wast not born for death,”
          but rather a recognition that death is another turn in a story longer than the single human life (“Ode to a Nightingale” 61).</p>
               <p> Here I’ll consider one poem in full, “Strange fits of passion I have known,” but honoring the arrangement of these lyrical ballads and plumbing what Alan Liu calls their rich economy of
          shared images, my reading of moving bodies necessarily begins at an end (351).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Marjorie Levinson’s recent account of the Lucy poems also recognizes their
            special affinities and endorses their joint consideration. </note> I start with the closing of the poem preceding “Strange fits of passion,” the finale of “Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of
          Kirtle,” which paints the death of two lovers, Ellen and Adam Bruce. The poem’s curtain falls upon two graves, not two bodies, conceding the relative brevity of human life by commemorating
          their final remains, by highlighting the ground that holds them and the stones that remember them: </p>

                     <l> Now ye who willingly have heard</l>
                     <l> The tale I have been telling,</l>
                     <l> May in Kirkonnel church-yard view</l>
                     <l> The grave of lovely Ellen:</l>
                     <l> By Ellen’s side the Bruce is laid,</l>
                     <l> And, for the stone upon his head,</l>
                     <l> May no rude hand deface it,</l>
                     <l> And its forlorn HIC JACET. (49-56)</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
               <p>Significantly, because of how Wordsworth arrays the words on the page, the reader ends with a capitalized “HIC JACET” (56). Laying directly above these words, and plotted directly behind
          the Latinate phrase meaning “here lies,” are emblems of the material but fleeting body that lies beneath them; the reader first encounters a negative image in “deface” with its evocation of
          a decaying visage, followed by “his head,” and then the depths where “the Bruce is laid;” each line of verse transforms into a virtual layer of dust that increasingly obscures the legibility
          of this body and its history (55, 54, 53). At the same time, as the entire body of Adam Bruce seems to fade further from the metaphorical surface, it is the most detailed remainder of the
          head and the threat of defacement that hover nearest to the headstone. The carved stone by proxy now carries the impossible task of offering a kind of legibility once manifested by a whole
          body, by the shape of a head, by the unique contours of one’s visage. After hoping that gentle readers might behold the graves of these lost lovers, the poetic persona makes its final
          request: “May no rude hand deface it / And its forlorn [here lies].” In this closing stanza, an insistent “Now” in the mouth of the lyric speaker gives way to what is only conjectural, to a
          couple of “May[s]” that betray an overriding sense of vulnerability and insecurity. Abandoning the body and its name to a space now lines away, Wordsworth privileges a phrase—“here
          lies”—that is both a place and an act, as the poem worries about immediacy and permanence, legibility and indeterminacy. </p>
               <p> These lines detail how we record the loss of human life, how the earth records it with bodies laid down side by side. Now marked, the future history of this body is hefted upon once fallow
          earth and stone. Yet the monumental charge of the Wordsworthian page differs from that of the headstone. The reader does not finally alight upon the name of an individual. The poet casts off
          the more reportable history of <emph>a</emph> man to face the more conjectural and foreign story of one’s remains. By lastly announcing the condition and placement of the body, its lying in
          the earth—in another language no less—the author stresses the limit of what language can capture and throws into question what we can hope to know about our own or any posthumous lying. If
          “here lies” is a place and an action, then laying to rest, which seems an end, is also the beginning of a defacement, a decay that gives birth, perhaps, to new life. </p>
               <p> Each of the following Lucy poems expands upon this model, though each one decreases in length, shrinking from 28, to 12, to 8 lines. In effect sketching a literary equivalent to
          withdrawing half-lives, each engages less and less with an individuated entity by the name of Lucy, and more and more with only the suggestion of the body as an ever-diminishing remainder of
          mortal life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As those familiar with “A slumber did my spirit seal” will recall, whatever it is that might be the “she” of these poems will finally go home to
            an unmarked but continuously revolving and transforming grave.</note> The point to bear in mind is that death and elegy in these works rarely signal <emph>the</emph> end as much as they
          mark beginnings or continuances with varying degrees of human legibility. Wordsworth dramatizes loss of life in terms of ongoing actions. Tracking how Wordsworth narrativizes bodies in
          motion—particularly after he presents Adam Bruce’s body beginning its process of decay—allows for a consideration of these works that avoids a common hermeneutical snare. </p>
               <p> To illustrate that trap, in her examination of “Formalism and Time,” Catherine Gallagher offers that critics are perhaps influenced by Romantic poets who privilege epiphanic immediacy over
          the banalities of diachronic narrative. <quote> The unending is not figured in the sand that ‘paves’ the ceaseless movement of the sea but is instead imagined as the submerged and effaced
            mark in the sand of a passing air current over the waters. The figure indicates an event so brief that it seems almost to participate in a negative temporality, to be over before it has
            begun; by the time the wrinkle has formed at the bottom of the water, the wind on its surface has ceased to be. (235)</quote> While here she takes aim at Percy Shelley, she ultimately
          points to Aristotle’s <title level="m">Poetics</title> for engendering this temporal bias, for ranking poetry above plot and history (234). Taking issue with what she calls “stop-action”
          analyses, Gallagher prescribes the following: “if we are ever to develop a concept of length that includes analytic insights into the temporal nature of narrative” we must shed our
          preoccupation with epiphany; we must become “less enamored of the end” (251). Wordsworth, for one, offers a corrective to this case. His lyric is ever a ballad, yoked not only to the
          contracted moment but also to the unfurling story. The unending—not an eternal place but an incomplete tale—may not be “figured in the sand” but it is deposited into the plot of this earth,
          figured in the alternating terrestrial orbs that populate this compressed sequence of lyrical ballads.</p>
               <p> Emphasizing movements inextricable from successive moments, Wordsworth reconciles the incongruent durations of human, animal, and stone. The unfolding sequence of poems counterintutively
          deploys a decreasing number of lines to highlight a broadening acknowledgment of deep time and geological process. Making full use of the lyrical ballad’s temporal hybridity, where it is
          home to the ephemeral and the enduring, with each poem Wordsworth revalues movements and events occurring both above and below the earth.</p>
               <p> “Strange fits of passion” picks up roughly where Wordsworth left off in “Ellen Irwin.” Framed by the setting of the previous narrative, its buried lovers and defenseless headstone, this
          poem continues a study of death, love, and language. As a tale of passions felt and daringly told, as a tale designated for “the lover’s ear alone,” it calls attention to the sensual
          textures of vocalization, listening, and reading (3). Also with this phrase, the text makes a lover of any reader, and importantly, of every reader. The poem ironizes the intimacy shared
          within the private economy of two lovers, suggestively redirecting the charged proximities and distances of lyricized lovers to the seemingly trivial arenas of motion and stillness, sound
          and absence. </p>
               <p> Following suit, the first stanza hazards to disclose not simply how these odd “fits” became “known,” but also what so movingly “bef[alls]” the lyric persona (1, 4). <quote>

                        <l> Beneath the evening moon. (1-8)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Kinesthetically echoing the pulsating iambic tetrameter and trimeter lines of the poem and its back-and-forth <emph>abab</emph> rhyme scheme, “Strange fits of passion” first
          “befel” the lyric voice, pressing down as if with the unwavering force of gravity, only to be buoyed by a soundscape that acoustically registers singer and lover alike arising in June (4-5).
          The levity of this buried pun too is short-lived, and by the close of the stanza the lyric subject is “bent,” sandwiched “Beneath the evening moon” and the earth, but all the while “on [his]
          way” (7, 8, 7). This gesture establishes the poem’s rhythm of rise and fall, and, thus, the following segment flirts with fixity only to undercut it. As the reader works from line to line,
          the Wordsworthian wayfarer struggles forward, “fix[ing an] eye” onto a likewise travelling moon (9, 10-12). And again, the opening of stanza five suggests punctuated fits and starts that
          ultimately lead to a story of enduring movements: the horse’s labors, with its ceaseless trudging, grants nearer proximity to familiar paths that lead unsurprisingly to another plot, a plot
          soon knitted to Lucy’s future home in the earth but that is more quickly wedded through rhyme to a span above ground, to Lucy’s cot (13, 15). </p>
               <p> This lyrical ballad becomes a Wordsworthian model of the ebb and flow of existence, lodging Lucy, the horse, and the lyric speaker into its rolling <title level="m">abab</title> lines,
          where they work against stasis and counterpoise the moon, now figured above the earth, now below, all granted only the illusion of stillness. Each oscillates back and forth, moving with the
          natural arc of a sine curve either in the form of bodies transiting above and below the horizon or as bodies transforming above and below the ground: “[W]e climb’d the hill, / […] The moon
          descended still;” even in sleep coupled with dream, “Nature’s gentlest [uplifting] boon” finds its complement in the pull of “the descending moon” (14, 16, 17-20). And further still, a horse
          rises, a planet drops (21-2, 24). A readerly pairing of Lucy’s life exclusively with the moon that deserts the wanderer overlooks the wider company of sojourners Wordsworth juxtaposes with
          this “planet,” and furthermore misses the point. Just as promiscuously as the poem makes a lover of every reader, it also attunes joint narrative trajectories of man, animal, and rocky
          globe—all fittingly enough for lyric—against the measure of movement and a line. The poem spins a ballad of its various hard working, ceaselessly moving voyagers, lovers, animals, and
          planets all read relative to potentialities only made possible by a line—the line of the horizon, the surface of the earth, each stroke of verse. In recognizing the line, the limit, we
          glimpse life beyond man’s limitations, not just a human end, but a seemingly never-ending story of the motion of earth and all its living things. </p>
               <p> A parallel emerges in the poem, yoking the migratory pattern of the lyric subject to patterns of language and thought. At the beginning of the journey narrative, when the traveller first
          bends his way and first spies the moon, the momentum of the poetic lines next leads to a “wide lea” (10), that is, to “a tract of open ground, either meadow, pasture, or arable land” (<title level="m">OED</title> “lea,” n.1). In the long tradition of elegiac verse, “lea” recurrently figures a meadowed clearing.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Lea” recurs throughout elegiac
            verse, appearing in Thomas Gray’s iconic “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” (1751, 2); it inhabits Robert Burns’ 1793 collection where the word’s tie to mourning is made explicit
            (“Elegy on Captain Mathew Henderson” 25). The term is also deployed in part one of the macabrely titled “The Three Graves” (1809), a collaborative endeavor Wordsworth would abandon and
            Coleridge would expand but leave unfinished. For a more detailed discussion of this particular Wordsworthian and Coleridgean project, see Murray.</note> One way to account for this word’s
          ubiquity within elegy and its broader association with the graveyard would be that in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the word also evoked the scythe. Lea-sands and lea-stones
          were common scythe sharpeners (<title level="m">OED</title> “lea,” n.3). While “lea” widely stood for a clearing, a 1781 glossary entry for this term lists only scythe (Hutton 92). Thus,
          during this period “lea” signifies on at least these two levels: it is a plot of unsown earth giving rise to wild grasses; it is a tool used to cut down what rises from the earth. It
          scaffolds life and takes life; it is the expanse and the edge. </p>
               <p> Quite aptly then, the quatrain that bears this term arranges the traveller’s course. The earthly plane on which the “horse trudg’d on” appears already to tug on both animal and man.
          Pointedly, “All [occurs] over the wide lea,” over a field of fallow earth couched in one of the least resolvable lines of the poem. <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l> Upon the moon I fix’d my eye,</l>
                        <l> All over the wide lea; </l>
                        <l> My horse trudg’d on, and we drew nigh</l>
                        <l> Those paths so dear to me. (9-12)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The significance of this earth, requisite with its seductive, gravitational pull, suggestively recalls the final lines of the ballad of Ellen Irwin, its graves and its
          inadequate surface reminder of what remains resident in the earth. Wordsworth neatly deposits the sweeping indeterminacy of the phrase “All over the wide lea” into the brief space of a
          trimeter line. A compressed, janus-headed line and phrase, it doubles as both surface of play and receding yet inescapable horizon. For, all of us as readers, as lovers, trudging in tow with
          itinerant and horse “All over the wide lea,” for each of us, sojourners all, “we draw nigh those paths so dear,” we draw ever closer to an intimate but otherwise unknowable, unutterable, and
          illegible earthly futurity. </p>
               <p> Under the rubric established by “All over the wide lea,” moving bodies that to the reader’s ear “rose in June” bend back and promise to move anew. The capacious aesthetic of this stanza
          joins the only other stanza that is punctuated by expansive colons and semicolons and that explicitly figures the work of the horse in terms of trudging or moving on. The penultimate stanza
          pulses with both epiphanic and prosaic temporalities. Alternatingly, the lines harness the rhythm of the lyrical ballad’s contracting and expanding gait to reveal a horse that does not stop
          for death. <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l> My horse mov’d on ; hoof after hoof</l>
                        <l> He rais’d and never stopp’d :</l>
                        <l> When down behind the cottage roof</l>
                        <l> At once the planet dropp’d. (20-24)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Even though—and <emph>as</emph>, and <emph>after</emph>—the planet drops, the horse moves, something remains. The simultaneity afforded by poetic syntax enables Wordsworth to
          draft a horse that endures even with irreconcilable loss. </p>
               <p> Bearing in mind the distinct nature of the plane on which the horse rides, that of the earth that pulls it and entreats it to return, Wordsworth’s horse in motion resembles the final
          stanza’s “fond and wayward thoughts” that likewise operate along a plane, “slid[ing] / Into a Lover’s head” (25-26). These are fond thoughts precisely because they are wayward, anticipating
          death, the ultimate union with nature, the transformation promised by a lea that is always both loam <emph>and</emph> sickle. Here Wordsworth installs a visual pun, one that blurs easy
          distinctions between life and line, one that refuses to reduce linearity to mere flattening. With horse and thought driving parallel trajectories, thoughts wanted and unwanted find their way
          into the “Lover’s head,” bodies work like poetry moving hoof after hoof, foot after foot all along the way, the line, the wide lea. And adjacent to this lover’s head is just that, the
          extended space of a long, silent dash, the writer’s penned equivalent to a marked but unspeakable expanse that recalls not just the surface of the earth, but also what traveled above and
          what turns below: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l> What fond and wayward thoughts will slide </l>
                        <l> Into a Lover’s head—</l>
                        <l> “O mercy!” to myself I cried,</l>
                        <l> “If Lucy should be dead!” (25-28)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Finally the poem transitions into the high lyric mode of the apostrophic. An expression of the mind intrudes upon what is otherwise a catalogue of the overlap between life
          and death, aesthetically restyled in terms of emergence and retreat. Wordsworth transports the reader to “what might be called a timeless present but is better seen as a temporality of
          writing” (Culler 149). The apostrophe is a verbal event, one that for Jonathan Culler “stages the drama of the mind” and harbors a deep “connection” to “embarrassment” (148, 140). For Culler
          “to apostrophize is to will a state of affairs;” at issue is the “power of poetry to make something happen” (139, 140). The indiscreet call of the lyric voice—“‘O mercy!’ to myself I cried,
          / ‘If Lucy should be dead!’”—could seem a blot upon the page, particularly a page that sang elegy as a song between separated lovers and danced death along the arc of revolving bodies
          (27-28). </p>
               <p>This embarrassing blot might be read two ways. For most, this final cry is a loving and foolish exclamation of a wayward lover who has so identified the traveling moon with his pursuit of
          Lucy that the loss of one prompts the fear of the loss of the other at the very moment when the lover can make real his fits of passion. But the “should” might be read as an ethical
          imperative: it is right and a mercy that Lucy be dead, perhaps because the lover cannot bear to invest so much passion in what is after all only the fit of a fleeting life. We seem caught
          between sophomoric illusion and narcissistic sadism.</p>
               <p> Yet, knowingly or unknowingly Wordsworth leaves us another way. The root of the term “lea” is either “leuq- to shine (whence Latin <foreign>lūcēre</foreign> , English <emph>light</emph> …
          [as in a] clearing);” or it comes from the Greek and Latin “<emph>leu</emph>” meaning “to loosen” (<title level="m">OED</title>). The history of the word “lea” is bound to light and
          looseness, both of which resonate associatively and acoustically in the name Lucy. If Lucy goes, with Lucy goes the lea, the clearing on the ground, the wild grasses, and the scythe. With
          Lucy goes the expanse and the edge at home in the lyrical ballad. How does one account for or begin to express the loss of the play of light, the end of the play of the line, the loss of the
          looseness and pliability necessary to defend against the ultimate stopping, not death but fixity? How does the poem find itself half in love with unceasing death while fighting fixity to the
          very death? </p>
               <p> If the apostrophic mode “makes a spectacle” of both the speaker and “the event which the poem is attempting to be” (Culler 142, 149), then this verbal blush is for verse itself. The
          vocative act self-effacingly announces poetry’s own horizon. Although the poem centers around recycling, revolving bodies and repatterning lines, the call at the end of the poem underscores
          an insufficiency at home even in the expansive agency of lyric.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Kaufman, Keach, Stewart, and Wolfson.</note> In terms both poetic and planetary, each
          horizontal trudging and rising invites and propels a turn toward a wordless, vertiginous depth. “Here lies” seems to signal a fixed end against which continuation appears as defacement, but
          the Lucy poems explore a larger ecology of movement that repositions human life and death within the course of animal kind, the trajectory of planets, what Shelley would call “The
          everlasting universe of things” (“Mont Blanc” 1). It is not that the loss is denied. Here even poetry is not sufficient to alleviate the psychic toll of experiencing, working through, and
          recognizing the ongoing limitedness that underpins each enduring movement. While poetry may grant its readers a reprieve from various fixed ends, it cannot erase the brevity of a life, the
          precarity of each line, all over the wide lea. Wordsworth cannot preserve Lucy without losing her.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Alan Liu’s analysis of the Lucy figure operates in similar
            fashion. On this figure’s relation to the external world he writes, “What does it mean for Nature to foster Lucy? It means to kill her” (308).</note> Poetry cannot detach the scythe from
          the lea without forgetting itself. What it remembers and re-members is a humanity that finally belongs not just to human words such as “here lies” but also to the more than human “diurnal
          course,” pursued by earth, “rolled round” “With rocks, and stones, and trees” (“A slumber did my spirit seal” 7, 8).</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>In “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Paul de Man invokes allegory and irony as two distinct perspectives on the question on time: 
      the former responding to an epistemological problem by transposing it into temporal sequence and the latter collapsing temporal sequence into simultaneity. 
      This leads him, however, to imagine the possibility of texts that would “overcome irony.” When he examines “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal” as an example of such an overcoming,
      de Man’s own text, however, encounters the accident of an irony that opens a window onto the instability of his pedagogical distinction between irony and allegory—an instability
      that hinges on the necessity of “reading” irony’s brevity in narrative terms.</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>In the second part of “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Paul de Man arrives at a “provisional conclusion” (222) about the relation of allegory and irony. Describing the two as “linked
        in their common discovery of a temporal predicament” (222), he suggests that each of them demystifies a particular literary mode (symbolism in the case of allegory, realism in the case of
        irony) that came to prominence in the nineteenth century by seeming to hold out the promise that “fiction and reality could coincide” (222). Wary of his own conclusion, however, insofar as he
        finds it “dangerously satisfying and highly vulnerable to irony” (222), de Man remarks that it “rescues a coherent historical picture at the expense of stated human incoherence” (222). His
        conclusion offers, in others words, a historical narrative in which symbolism constitutes a regression from the theoretical insights intrinsic to allegory just as realism regresses from the
        negativity that characterizes irony. And it does so while asserting the “incoherence” of our relation, as linguistic subjects, to the empirical world.</p>
                  <p>But at this point something surprising happens; de Man insists on the possibility of a literature exempt from such incoherence because exempt from irony's “endless process that leads to no
        synthesis” (220), its “dizziness to the point of madness” (215). Referring to Baudelaire’s “De l’essence du rire,” on which he relies in his discussion of irony, de Man recalls that
        “Baudelaire speaks, without apparent irony, of a semimythical poetic figure that would exist beyond the realm of irony” (223). No sooner has de Man invoked this fictional or “semimythical”
        figure, however, than he adduces its ostensible real world equivalents, referring to Hölderlin and Wordsworth, along with Baudelaire, as if himself intent on making “fiction and reality
        coincide.” But then again, he compares the poetry he identifies as “truly meta-ironical, as having transcended irony,” and as “definitely non-ironic” (223) to what Baudelaire describes as “la
        poésie pure, . . . limpide et profonde comme la nature” (223), a simile that could seem to suggest the coincidence of nature and linguistic fiction too.</p>
                  <p>Baudelaire, though, conjures this figure of a poet “beyond the realm of irony” only, as de Man precisely phrases it, “without <emph>apparent</emph> irony” (223,
        emphasis mine), just as the clarity and depth of “pure poetry” is only <emph>comparable</emph> to that of nature. However irreducible the distance between
        language and empirical reality, however persistent the threat of an irony that might <emph>not</emph> be “apparent,” something about irony tempts de Man to
        envision “overcoming” (223) it, and he proposes that these poets, in some of their writings, do so by means of allegory. Since allegory and irony, as de Man makes clear, both demystify
        rhetorics of presence and the coincidence of fiction and reality, the prospect of overcoming irony by allegory must rest on their different relations to history, narrative, and time. When de
        Man introduces Wordsworth’s poem, “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal,” for a “brief comparison of the temporal structure of allegory and irony,” he chooses it not only because the poem is “well
        known,” but also because it is “exceedingly brief” (223). This double insistence on brevity in his engagement with a poem concerned with time suggests that his brief against irony may have
        something to do with brevity too and perhaps with the pedagogy of exemplarity that brevity often serves.</p>

                  <p>Brevity, seen as the soul of wit, can make things easier to remember, thus enabling them to endure, but it also can be seen as duration’s impossible dream of self-erasure, its effort to
        collapse or minimalize the spatialization of time as distance. In that sense, the simultaneity of events (as opposed to their sequential unfolding) would constitute brevity’s absolute form,
        its purest realization.  But the difference that duration articulates (in terms of what’s past, what’s passing, and what’s yet to come) shapes simultaneity as well.  The reading of two or more
        events as occurring at the same time demands their conceptual disentanglement, their interpretation as <emph>separate</emph> events, and thus introduces the
        distance that the act of reading depends on too, inflecting with narrative duration the simultaneity that seems to refuse it. If reading in this sense persistently translates simultaneity into
        sequence, into the narrative performed by that reading’s unfolding, then such sequencing is also bound, though blind, to what collapses it back on itself: the non-identity of knowing and doing
        that makes reading simultaneous with misreading.</p>
                  <p>To call this an account of “The Rhetoric of Temporality” would confer on that essay a coherence that, precisely to the extent that this reading is “true,” would have to be seen
        as false. The essay, that is, in coming to a “knowledge” about the irony that scuttles all knowledge-claims, however negative those claims may be, simultaneously resists that knowledge by
        asserting it sequentially. This leads to a question at the heart of the essay: does temporality reveal the “truth” of rhetoric or does rhetoric produce fictions of temporality?  The genitive
        structure of the essay’s title, like that of Keats’s “The Fall of Hyperion” as de Man discusses it in “The Resistance to Theory,” condenses both possibilities. In a longer analysis this
        tension could be approached by focusing on the figure of “history” in “The Rhetoric of Temporality.” The first section of the essay concludes, after all, by proposing a “historical scheme”
        (208) in which the Romantic discourse of symbolism attests to a regression from the critical insight made available through the structure of allegory. But de Man begins the second section by
        observing that irony cannot be approached through a similar “historical de-mystification.” Though symbolism’s “mystification is a fact of history” (211), irony, to the contrary, as de Man
        points out, often <emph>targets</emph> “the claim to speak about human matters as if they were facts of history” (211).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Carol Jacobs notes this movement as well in her brilliant essay, “Allegories of Reading Paul de Man”: “The section entitled ‘Allegory and Symbol,’ as we have seen,
              tells a historical tale that of a transition at the end of the eighteenth century from a concept of allegory as the key rhetorical term to that of symbol. The section on irony displays
              another narrative strategy, one that we will confront shortly” (113). Her essay, like my own, explores de Man’s claims about temporality and language as his work engages them in the
              process of conceptualizing allegory and irony and her essay does so, as does mine, by putting de Man’s claims about rhetoric in conversation with his own writing. Jacobs, however, argues
              that “as de Man’s irony becomes increasingly conscious of itself, it demonstrates the impossibility of being historical” (117). I suggest, to the contrary, that the pedagogical
              imperative in critical writing makes allegory <emph>inevitable</emph>. The very possibility of
              <emph>recognizing</emph> irony, let alone of its becoming “conscious of itself,” remains, in my reading, suspended. Jacobs, however, is canny enough to
              recognize this as well. She points to the possibility of reading the ironization of allegory as “an allegorization of sorts” (118) and writes that “the movement of the literary text is
              restated and repeated on an increasingly conscious level by the critical reading that must, no less than irony, fail to overcome the inauthenticity of its own language” (118). Even here,
              though, we see in this assertion of an “increasingly conscious level” of insight the (necessary) repetition of a faith in pedagogical possibilities. That faith, and its disturbance, are
              what my essay seeks to engage. It could not have done so, however, without Jacobs’s powerful example.</note> Thus in the space of a mere three sentences de Man both affirms as a
        “fact of history” the mystification effected by symbolism and pointedly calls attention to irony’s demystification of historical fact. This leads to a moment that may tempt us to read it as an
        instance of ironic self-consciousness when de Man writes, in magisterial but still playful prose: “It is a historical fact that irony becomes increasingly conscious of itself in the course of
        demonstrating the impossibility of our being historical” (211).<note place="foot" resp="editors">We might well ask just what it would mean for irony to become “conscious of
              itself.” This not only attributes consciousness to irony, but also supposes that irony possesses a specificity, an essence, made “increasingly” evident to itself across time.
          </note>  But can irony ever “be conscious of itself”? What consciousness could irony, as a mode, possess? Can we, moreover, with any certainty, be conscious of irony ourselves?
        Irony may refer, instead, to a loss or lapse of consciousness. Thus if irony seems to show itself here we cannot be sure of its target. Is the historical fact with which the sentence begins
        undone in the end by irony, or does the irony lie in irony’s ultimate historical determination? The copresence of such incompatible readings in an assertion presented as “fact” may define de
        Man’s take on irony, but to define the result as ironic immediately dismisses the copresence of what resists it.</p>
                  <p>To put this slightly differently: irony consists in the simultaneity of wisdom’s emergence from error and of error’s persistence in the very belief that wisdom has been achieved.
        In this way irony precipitates into a "temporal predicament" that allows for "no end, for no totality" (222) insofar as it divides "the flow of temporal experience into a past that is pure
        mystification and a future that remains harassed forever by a relapse within the inauthentic" (222). Like irony, allegory too may approach what de Man calls a "temporal void” (222), but it
        does so by mobilizing temporal relations in which signs refer to earlier signs instead of enacting, as irony does, “an instantaneous process that takes place rapidly, suddenly, in one single
        moment” (225).  "Always implying an unreachable anteriority" (222), allegory, in de Man’s view, "designates primarily a distance in relation to its own origins, and, renouncing the nostalgia
        and the desire to coincide, it establishes its language in the void of this temporal difference" (207). Thus allegory leads to a negative truth, understood as escape from error, by treating
        signs historically, while irony exposes the error of thinking that history could lead us to truth.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although the
              anteriority associated with allegory may be unreachable for de Man, that doesn’t stop him from tracing Rousseau’s allegorical depiction of Julie’s garden back to Defoe, by way of Bunyan,
              and, on the basis of this, declaring with assurance that <title level="m">La Nouvelle Héloïse</title> renounces “the values associated with a cult of the moment, and this renunciation
              establishes the priority of an allegorical over a symbolic diction” (204). An ability to read the historicity of allegorical temporality thus assists in avoiding what de Man describes as
              the “near-fatal relapse into former error” (201).</note>  This may clarify de Man’s assertion that “in speaking of irony we are dealing not with the
        <emph>history</emph> of an error but with a problem that exists within the self” (211, emphasis mine); in contra-distinction to allegory, irony deals with
        non-identity not as a relation between <emph>moments</emph>, but rather as inherent in the self and therefore operative at <emph>every</emph> moment.</p>
                  <p>De Man’s representation of allegory as distance from “its own origins” coexists, nonetheless, with his implicit identification of allegory <emph>as</emph> an
        origin. The first part of “The Rhetoric of Temporality” strives to correct “the widespread ‘<foreign>idées reçues</foreign>’ on the nature and the origins of European romanticism” (204) by
        proposing that allegory, not symbolism, deserves recognition in such a context. Symbolism may follow allegory in literary history, but it denotes a <emph>critical</emph> regression
        from the latter’s relentless <emph>historical</emph> regression, from allegory’s persistent orientation toward an "unreachable anteriority” informing its linguistic signs.  Though
        expressive of a “negative self-knowledge” (208) that bespeaks the temporal fate of the human, allegory gets figured by de Man, nonetheless, as the “light,” the source of radiance, over which
        symbolism throws a “veil” (208). Recalling Coleridge’s metaphor for symbolism, cited earlier in “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” as “the translucence of the eternal through and in the temporal”
        (192), de Man’s figural evocation of allegory similarly returns us to an originary light, but one that exposes the <emph>error</emph> of viewing the symbol as itself participating in
        what it represents and that “prevents the self from an illusory identification with the non-self, which is now [i.e., by virtue of allegory] fully, though painfully, recognized as a non-self”
        (207). Fully recognized? What can this possibly mean in a context where allegory continuously opens new vistas of distance and difference? The fantasy of awakening from illusion so thoroughly
        that everything pertaining to the non-self is “fully . . . recognized” as such, has its corollary in the fantasy of a self that would coincide with itself completely through complete
        separation from what it is not. Such a fantasy of allegorical awareness perversely returns us to the “nostalgia and the desire to coincide” that allegory supposedly renounces and it does so
        here in a prosopopeia (allegory’s “renunciation” of desire) that gives human agency to a literary structure, showing just how hard it is to differentiate self and non-self.</p>
                  <p>The truth of the distance between the two, like the truth of the difference between the human and the natural world for de Man, can be recognized “fully” only at the cost of being recognized
        “painfully.” Pain accompanies the knowledge of truth for de Man as it informs the experience of respect for Kant.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Carol
              Jacobs makes a wise observation in this regard: “But if the knowledge gained in the language of allegory is painful, the tale about that knowledge often appears remarkably satisfying”
              (116).</note> Irony occasions a mordant laughter but allegory’s wisdom hurts. “It is this painful knowledge that we perceive at the moments when early romantic literature finds
        its true voice” (207), de Man asserts, associating allegory’s painful recognition (the recognition, precisely, of the irreducible distance between the self and non-self, between linguistic
        fiction and empirical reality) with his own demystification of symbol. No sooner has he done so, however, than irony appears in his text: “it is ironically revealing that this voice is so
        rarely recognized for what it really is” (207). The allegory that “designates . . . distance,” though emphatically figured by de Man here as presence, even originary presence (“the true
        voice,” “what it really is”), has remained, to the moment of de Man’s essay, largely a presence concealed, like the light beneath symbolism’s “veil.” If this veiling reveals a general truth
        about the resistance to reading allegory, it does so only “ironically,” through the very act of concealing it. Irony insists on this simultaneity of revelation and concealment, but
        <emph>recognizing</emph> irony requires forgetting what that recognition veils: the impossibility of ever “fully” recognizing the difference between self and
        non-self and the equal impossibility of fully recognizing the presence or absence of irony. For irony, to put this another way, never in fact reveals; the claim that it does so forgets that
        irony is only <emph>ironically</emph> revealing, only revealing of its own insistence, and even then without any certainty that one can ever in fact “know”
        irony. In effect, by describing as “ironically revealing” the failure to recognize allegory as Romanticism’s “true voice,” de Man turns irony <emph>into</emph> allegory.  He imposes
        the narrative structure of a movement from blindness to recognition, from concealment to revelation, rather than dwelling in the unreadable coincidence of irony’s insight and error, which is
        to say, its illegibility.   </p>
                  <p>In this context it makes a certain sense that when de Man proposes his “brief comparison” of the temporalities of allegory and irony by engaging with Wordsworth’s “exceedingly brief” “A
        Slumber did my Spirit Seal,” he boldly declares: “[t]he text clearly is not ironic” (223).  But when he subsequently analyzes “the structure of irony” (225), contrasting it with allegory’s
        “tendency . . . toward narrative . . . in order to give duration” (225), he refers to what he calls Baudelaire’s “later, most ironic works” (2225), works that “grow shorter and shorter and
        always climax in the single brief moment of a final <foreign>pointe</foreign>” (225-26). Brevity, the hallmark of irony’s movement toward the undoing of allegorical
        duration, defines from the outset the poem in which irony, de Man argues, has been “transcended” (223). But brevity serves as a switchpoint here between duration and simultaneity,
        simultaneously expressing narrative extension and the movement toward a “single brief moment” in which antagonistic possibilities “are simultaneously present, juxtaposed within the same moment
        but as two irreconcilable and disjointed beings” (226).<note place="foot" resp="editors">By seeing these two beings as “juxtaposed,” de Man has already introduced the
              spatialization of allegorical distance that makes simultaneity legible at the expense of irony’s vertiginous madness. That recourse to the spatialization of time in order to be able to
              conceptualize the simultaneous pressure of antagonistic forces inheres in the critical endeavor as we see when Barbara Johnson traces the etymology of “critical” to the Greek “<foreign>krinein</foreign>, to separate, choose” (ix).</note> Given the difficulty of reading the difference between the allegorical and ironic temporalities that the concept
        of brevity condenses, we might want to examine the stake in de Man’s claim that Wordsworth’s “exceedingly brief” poem “<emph>clearly</emph> is not ironic”
        (emphasis mine).</p>
                  <p>De Man commences his reading by pointing to the allegorical shape of its narrative: its “successive description of two stages of consciousness, one belonging to the past and mystified, the
        other to the <emph>now</emph> of the poem, the stage that has recovered from the mystification of a past now presented as being in error” (224).  But this
        reading of the process of demystification from stanza one to stanza two should not obscure the quite different terms in which Marc Redfield evokes the poem. Introducing an issue of
        <title level="j">The Wordsworth Circle</title> devoted to essays on Geoffrey Hartman, Redfield refers to Wordsworth’s “lightning-like temporality” in which “something
        appears or disappears <emph>at once</emph>” and thereby produces a difference “at once momentous, a matter of life and death, and yet strangely minimal, as hard to read as the
        difference between the first and the second stanzas of ‘A Slumber did my Spirit Seal’” (6). De Man’s determination that the brevity of the poem elaborates duration (rather than the
        “lightning-like temporality” of irony)<note place="foot" resp="editors">When de Man writes that “irony appears as an instantaneous process that takes place rapidly, suddenly,
              in one single moment” (225), we see brevity invoked as a rapidity that then collapses into the geometrical singularity of a point: a movement in the opposite direction from his reading
              of brevity as a figure of duration that leads to allegory’s performance of demystification.</note> and so denotes an allegorical structure leads him to maximize this “minimal”
        difference, even at the expense of denying the poem any irony whatsoever and maintaining that this “difference has been spread out over a temporality . . . in which the conditions of error and
        wisdom have become successive.  . . . The fundamental structure of allegory reappears here in the tendency of language toward narrative, the spreading out along the axis of an imaginary time
        in order to give duration to what is, in fact, simultaneous within the subject” (225). By treating diachronically a difference inherent in the self at every moment, the poem, as de Man
        construes it, allegorizes irony and overcomes it. The narrator’s error in the first stanza, his submission to the “slumber” that “seals” his “spirit,” gives way to “grim awareness” (224) in
        the second as the woman, who first seemed incapable of feeling “the touch of earthly years," proves unable, after the stanza break, to feel, see, or hear at all.</p>
                  <p>As persuasive as this allegorization may be, de Man cannot completely ignore the pressure of irony in the poem, especially in lines three and four: “It could be said that, read within the
        perspective of the entire poem, these two lines are ironic, though they are not ironic in themselves or within the context of the first stanza. Nor is the poem, as a whole, ironic. The stance
        of the speaker, who exists in the ‘now,’ is that of a subject whose insight is no longer in doubt and who is no longer vulnerable to irony” (224). De Man then returns to his earlier phrasing
        to assert that “the poem is written from the point of view of a unified self that fully recognizes a past condition as one of error and stands in a present that, however painful, sees things
        as they actually are” (224). This language repeats the central terms (“fully . . . recognized,” “painfully,” “recognized for what it really is”) used earlier by de Man in his unveiling of
        allegory as the “true voice” of early Romanticism. But de Man in that passage could only unveil what was, in its very concealment, already “ironically revealing.” This may suggest, however
        “unintentionally” (and however much at odds, therefore, with the “full recognition” to which allegory is said to bring the supposedly “unified self”), that such an unveiling, pace de Man,
        “reveals” the insistence of irony. How, though, could one “reveal” irony without succumbing to the spatialization of time as the movement from error to knowledge, as the difference between now
        and then, as the clarifying logic of history (Wordsworth’s poem “<emph>clearly</emph> is not ironic,” de Man maintains)?</p>
                  <p>De Man claims that the difference effected by the demystification the poem describes, the transformation of the narrator’s stance from the first stanza (“first there was error” [225]) to the
        second (“now an eternal insight” [225]), “does not exist within the subject, which remains unique throughout” (225). That difference, instead, gets displaced onto the temporal sequencing of
        the poem as such. In effect, the irony that would divide the subject, that would signal a “radical discontinuity” (224) like that of the death on which the poem turns, gets consigned, as does
        the death itself, to the space between the two stanzas. The poem becomes a text “about” irony, then, much as it becomes a text about death: that is, precisely by leaving it out. Or so de Man
        seems to argue. The whole of his reading of Wordsworth’s poem returns (in imitation of allegory) to the language his essay used earlier in explicating irony.  Focusing on the subject’s altered
        understanding of the woman as a “thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years,” he writes that after the stanza break “[s]he now has become a
        <emph>thing</emph> in the full sense of the word, not unlike Baudelaire’s falling man who became a thing in the grip of gravity” (224). The falling man, the
        exemplary case of the encounter with irony in “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” finds himself divided between the thing that falls and the subject capable of seeing that fall as a fall into the
        knowledge of his thingness. He gains access to an understanding of his difference from the world through the language that lets him reflect on the world, and on himself, while dividing him
        from both as well. This difference, therefore, characterizes the falling man himself, splitting him into an empirical self, a thing among the many things in the world, and a self that inhabits
        the fictions of language and is prone to the mystified faith that this knowledge makes him superior to things as such.   </p>
                  <p>This ironic division gives way to a “unified self” in “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal” insofar as that division, according to de Man, gets externalized (which is also to say, allegorized) in
        the movement of the woman from life to death, of the “thing” from figural to literal, and of the first stanza’s retrospection to the second stanza’s “eternal” present. In this way the woman,
        not the subject, “falls”; it is she who enacts “the purely instrumental, reified character of [humanity’s] relationship to nature” (214), to quote de Man’s earlier account of what the falling man must
        learn. In displacing the fall onto the woman, however, and that phrasing should echo an ongoing history of gender relations in the West, de Man succeeds in depicting the subject as a “unified
        self” (224) that remains “unique” (225)—that is, singular and coherent—only by imagining the subject of the poem as radically different from the ironist. Where the latter is split “into an
        empirical self that exists in a state of inauthenticity [i.e., that presumes its superiority to nature] and a self that exists only in the form of a language that asserts the knowledge of this
        inauthenticity” (214), Wordsworth’s subject inhabits “the ideal, self-created temporality of the poem” and <emph>not</emph> the “actual temporality of experience” (225) in the
        reading de Man proposes.  The claim that the poem has transcended irony thus depends on the subject having escaped the constraints of the “actual” or “empirical self.”</p>
                  <p>But does Wordsworth’s subject really dwell in an “ideal . . . temporality” untouched by that of “actual . . .  experience”? Is it really the voice of “eternal insight”? The subject who refers
        to the moment of its error as when it “had no human fears,” seems strangely unchanged when awakened from that error by the fact of the woman’s death.  Indeed, the very “etern[ity]” of its
        “insight” repeats that exemption from the human. Although de Man will attribute an emotional intensity to the subject’s awakened consciousness—he refers to it as a “grim awareness”
        experienced, to some degree, as “painful” (224)—the poem makes no such claim. The subject’s affect, like the woman’s death, gets wholly left out of account in its eight lines; only through
        inference or projection does it sound in the second stanza’s constative utterances.  On the one hand, this could confirm the subject’s removal from empirical reality, from “the actual
        temporality of experience,” and so from the synchronic division of the self by the reflexive experience of irony.  On the other hand, this lack of human fear perpetuates the error, the
        “slumber,” whose overcoming de Man affirms, thus troubling the subject’s association with a  “stance of wisdom” (224) and an “ideal . . . temporality” (225). Through this optic, the subject’s
        “wisdom” can seem like a form of obtuseness to its quasi-Shelleyan fall from one state of slumber to another: the sort of fall that bespeaks the ironist’s division between an empirical self that
        lives in a state of inauthenticity (expressed by the lack of “human fear” recollected in stanza one) and the self who claims to know that inauthenticity but remains incapable of changing it
        (expressed by the “stance of wisdom” adopted in stanza two).  The overcoming of irony through allegory that de Man locates in the poem would thus reproduce the subject’s implicit, and still
        mystified, suggestion that its spirit has fully awakened at last from the slumber of mystification. In that sense nothing could be more ironic than the claim (de Man’s and the subject’s both)
        that allegorization overcomes irony.</p>
                  <p>Since de Man, however, refuses “to play [allegory and irony] off against each other” (226), maintaining instead that both give us access to a negative experience of time, why would he insist
        so emphatically on the absence of irony in the poem? Perhaps his comment comparing the two to each other offers a clue: “The knowledge derived from both modes is essentially the same” (226).
        This emphasis on “deriv[ing]” knowledge already tips de Man’s hand; it reiterates the primacy of allegorical sequence, narrative, and temporal duration at the expense of irony’s instantaneous
        explosion and rapid fall.  The former comports with pedagogy; the latter makes it impossible. Allegory’s pain thus expresses the knowledge derived through education while irony’s laughter
        acknowledges the void to which knowledge as such remains blind. “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” as a text devoted to “historical clarification” (188), undertakes to translate, from its opening
        sentences, a fall the essay will associate with irony (“Since the advent, in the course of the nineteenth century, of a subjectivistic critical vocabulary, the traditional forms of rhetoric
        have fallen into direspute” [187]) into the sequential movement of allegory (“It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that his was only a temporary eclipse” [187]).  Critical pedagogy
        demands an investment in allegorical temporality. Thus even when de Man refuses to see allegory or irony as “superior to the other” (226), he must champion allegory’s duration over irony’s
        vanishing-point of brevity in order to be able to “derive” such a knowledge in the first place. Even the evenhandedness with which he evaluates allegory and irony in relation to their access
        to wisdom and error leads him to a telling conclusion: “The dialectical play between the two modes . . . make[s] up what is called literary history” (226). The clash of allegorical and ironic
        temporalities, the synchronic coincidence of their antagonism (a coincidence characteristic of both irony and dialectic), yields in the end here to “history,” which is hardly a neutral
        category since it designates one of the two modes in play. History, the very paradigm of allegorical temporality, tendentiously gets positioned as the outcome of allegory’s dialectical
        relation to irony.</p>
                  <p>But never count irony out. When de Man nears the point of clinching his case for reading “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal” as articulating the “ideal . . . temporality” of allegory at the cost
        of the “actual temporality of experience”—at the cost, in other words, of the empirical self’s subjection to error and accident—he writes the following sentences: “The ‘now’ of the poem is not
        an actual now, but the ideal ‘now,’ the duration of an acquired wisdom. The actual now, which is that of the moment of death, lies hidden in the blank space between the two stanzas.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Paul de Man, “The Rhetoric of Temporality,”

        space between the stanzas of Wordsworth’s poem, but rather the “ideal ‘now’” in which de Man would situate the subject of that poem: “the duration of an acquired wisdom” by means of which
        allegory would overcome irony. If irony seems to have its revenge, though, when wisdom gets lost in the gap of a syntax whose illegibility taunts the reader by collocating “death” with what
        “lies hidden” between the two conflated “actual now”s (and what lies hidden here, consigned to death, is “the duration of an acquired wisdom”), then we have to acknowledge that to read this
        accident, this “error,” this way is to read it allegorically. Irony may tend to reduce itself to the brevity of a single point, but allegory alone can make the point about irony into a lesson.
        And it does so by displacing the antagonisms condensed in irony’s single moment into the spacing of narrative, the sequence of history that imposes the “duration of an acquired wisdom” at the
        very moment it enacts the error that guarantees wisdom’s fall.</p>
                  <p>All reading, all critical transmission, all pedagogy inhabits this allegorical temporality, even in laying bare the irony that informs and undoes that structure. The mangled sentence that
        students have read, teachers taught, and anthologies reprinted for more than forty years may condense, in its own condensation, a vast array of unresolved tensions: between the aspirations of
        pedagogy and the impossibility of reading, between fantasies of knowing and performances of ignorance, between allegory’s imperative and irony’s resistance, between brevity as narrative
        duration and brevity as simultaneity, between history and theory, between ideality and accident, and even—why not?—between life and death. But like the failure to recognize allegory as early
        Romanticism’s “true voice,” de Man’s brief encounter with Wordsworth is also “ironically revealing.” In brief, it is and is not ironic, much like Wordsworth’s poem. Which may (or may not)
        explain why “The Rhetoric of Temporality” can say so only by way of saying something else. That displacement, that temporal opening onto a continual “something else,” marks the distance
        between irony’s brevity and the allegorization inherent in reading. If de Man’s encounter with irony—by way of his encounter with Wordsworth’s poem—approaches the limit of reading, the
        illegible simultaneity that his essay’s truncated sentences enact, then perhaps it is “ironically revealing” that the limit should prove to be one “he neither hears nor sees.” But then again,
        neither do we.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>Biographical fascination perversely clings to Keats—the poet of
      “no self,” of “no identity”—in a manner that can feel exasperating to Keats critics. The
      spell cast by the materials of Keats’s brief life is, however, deeply bound up with the
      impersonal, allegorical style that his most influential readers see as central to the
      poetry’s radical modernity. Keats’s life and death masks bring this truth into focus. The
      mask, like the image of the Poet as it emerges in Romanticism, bears the trace of the
      singular lost person. Suggesting the capacity of the withdrawn, formal image of the
      biographical subject to mobilize affects of pathos and loss, the mask suggestively binds
      the “sentimental” treatment of Keats’s death to current accounts of his work that locate
      its distinctiveness in its refusals and critiques of the gestures of lyric
      subjectivity.</p>

               <head>Keats’s Mask</head>
               <p>Two books on Keats published in the past twenty years—Andrew Bennett’s
        <title level="m">Keats, Narrative and Audience</title> and Stanley
        Plumly’s <title level="m">Posthumous Keats</title>—reproduce on their covers images of the
        life mask of the poet taken by Benjamin Haydon in 1816. The images fascinate in part for
        their promise, before the advent of photography, to capture Keats as he was: the distinctive
        countenance, and, perhaps, even, the look of being lost to some other scene—a look that
        charges even the life mask with the pathos of a death to come, an effect enhanced in the
        Bennett cover reproduction by the strong light source that picks out the abstractedness of
        the form. Reflecting on nineteenth-century likenesses of Keats, Plumly prefers the masks and
        a small handful of contemporary sketches of the poet to any of the myriad oil portraits,
        modeled on these earlier images, executed posthumously: for Plumly, the more formal
        portraits, which often show Keats in the posture of the thinker, chin in hand, or amidst his
        books, are guilty of generalizing the singular person into the type of the Poet (23-55). But
        the mask of course affects a similar conversion. The portraits awkwardly perform their
        taxidermical commemorative work—restoring the poet to his social character and to his place
        in the National Gallery’s full set of British poets. The mask, in contrast—the withdrawn,
        abstracted image, tenuously descended from the singular body whose imprint it bears—presents
        the Poet as allegorical figure, a relic of a prematurely abbreviated life that survives into
        the present in denatured form, evoking a loss that can feel constitutive to Romanticism
        itself, but can also feel like <emph>our</emph> loss. </p>
               <p>The way biographical fascination perversely clings to the poet of “no self,” of “no
        identity” (<title level="m">KL</title> I, 387)—the poet whose force, at least since modernism,
        has been seen to derive from his resistance to and critique of lyric modes of
        self-investigation and disclosure can feel exasperating to Keats critics. Thomas Pfau, for
        instance, charges Keats’s readers, including professional Romanticists, of being “forever
        enthralled by Keats’s death at age twenty-six in Rome” (336). I want to propose, though,
        that the spell cast by the idea of Keats’s brevity is not easily broken because, more than
        taxidermical efforts to revive a lively, sociable, virile, political, or otherwise
        historically contextualized Keats, it is deeply responsive to the impersonal, allegorical
        style that his most exciting contemporary readers, from Marjorie Levinson to Jacques Khalip
        and Pfau himself, see as central to the poetry’s radical modernity. </p>
               <p>Keats’s mask brings this truth into focus, even and especially in its aspect as a
        technologically reproducible cultural form that circulates, exists as museum display,
        participates in projects of nation-building, and shores up cultural institutions, but that
        works by soliciting affective responses that can feel private, individual, ungeneralizable.
        The mask, like the abstracted image of the Poet as it emerges in Romanticism, bears the
        trace of the singular lost person. Suggesting the capacity of the withdrawn, formal image of
        the biographical subject to mobilize affects of pathos and loss, the mask suggestively binds
        the “sentimental” treatment of Keats’s death to contemporary accounts of his work that
        locate its distinctiveness in its refusals and critiques of the gestures of lyric
        subjectivity. In the remainder of this essay, I would like to turn to the materials of what
        Keats famously and evocatively called his “posthumous life”—that interval between a death
        sentence and death—to explore the ways in which they open us to modes of memory that belong
        neither to subjective experience nor to constructive projects of historiography or
        commemoration. Ultimately I want to suggest that these modes of memory bear the
        as-yet-undetonated possibilities of Romanticism into its future.</p>
               <p>In the letters Joseph Severn wrote from Rome to Keats’s friends, he frequently remarks on
        the avidity of Keats’s embrace of his posthumous existence, seeing this as symptomatic of a
        singular and poetic cast of mind: “Keats is desiring his death with dreadfull earnestness .
        . . The strangeness of his mind every day surprisses us—no one feeling or one notion like
        any other being” (<title level="m">KL</title> II, 373). Especially
        striking and frustrating to Severn is his friend’s refusal to invest in possibility: rather,
        as a space of withdrawal, the posthumous life promises to relieve the poet from the
        obligation to show promise, to care about answering to the hopes of others, to perform the
        strenuous work of the imagination. This is Severn again:
      <quote>he will not bear the idea of living much less strive to live . . . he will not hear that
        his prospects are favorable—he will not hear that his future prospects are favorable—he says
        that the continued stretch of his imagination has killed him—and were he to recover he could
        not write another line—then his good friends in England—he only cherishes the idea of what
        they have done and this he turns to a load of care for the future—the high hopes of him—his
        certain success—his experience he shakes his head at it all and bids it farewell— (<title level="m">JS</title> 116])</quote>
      Instead, Keats flies ahead to another shore, and from there lays claim to an insulated,
        virtual existence, a life of mere duration: in his own words, “I have an habitual feeling of
        my real life having passed, and that I am leading a posthumous existence” (<title level="m">KL</title> II, 359); “every man who can row his boat and walk and talk seems a different
        being from myself—I do not feel in the world” (II, 349). </p>
               <p>Severn’s reports and Keats’s own accounts suggest that for Keats, posthumous life promises
        a respite from the shocks that inevitably befall the one who possesses the negative
        capability to be in “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts”
        (<title level="m">KL</title> I, 193), especially as these pertain to the
        vagaries that shape the hopeful narratives of love, poetic composition, and career: to seize
        on one’s death sentence is to opt out of indeterminacy. Poetry, Keats seems to think, has
        been lethal to him; posthumous life promises to afford relief from the burden of promiscuous
        responsivity and the uncertainties of the paths it opens. Yet, paradoxically, in his
        posthumous life he suffers from an intensified version of the plight of the poetical
        character, whose lack of proper identity, he claims in his famous letter, makes him always
        vulnerable to annihilation. In that letter, Keats describes poetical speculation as a
        defense against the pressures of sociality, for when he is not filling and informing the
        bodies of “characters,” in a strange but characteristic hydraulic calculus, the identities
        of those around him flood him: “When I am in a room with People if I ever am free from
        speculating on creations of my own brain, then not myself goes home to myself: but the
        identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me that, I am in a very little time
        annihilated” (I, 387). In his posthumous life, a withdrawn Keats is morbidly and viscerally
        susceptible to the suffocating existences of others: “a person I am not quite used to
        entering the rooms half choaks me” (II, 314); “a person I am not quite used to causes an
        oppression in my chest” (II, 321); “Don’t breathe on me—it comes like Ice” (II, 378). The
        references suggest a hypersensitivity to the surprise advent of anything that threatens an
        embraced insularity, figured at first as the chance appearances of strangers, but as he
        becomes more ill, of all phenomenal traces of abjured social attachments. Thus he becomes
        preoccupied with controlling incursions into his world: he instructs people to limit their
        visits, and then, when visiting ceases, to limit their notes to bearable brevity, and
        finally, to the most minimal of indicators (“+” or “-” )(II, 352). Eventually all
        communication ceases except what is “framed” to Keats’s ear through Severn’s mediation, for
        Keats, all attest, cannot bear the “hand” or any material reminders of persons (“to see her
        handwriting would break my heart” [II, 351-2];“I cannot bear the sight of any hand writing
        of a friend I love as much as I do you” [II, 360]; “a letter to Keats now would almost kill
        him” [II, 363]).</p>
               <p>If the posthumous life promises an escape from poetry, it ultimately delimits a terrain
        that is allegorical and melancholic, “poetical” in some of the ways we have come to
        associate with Keats’s work since Levinson and Pfau. Walter Benjamin’s description in
        “Central Park” of the way allegorical intention works—“that which the allegorical intention
        has fixed upon is sundered from the customary contexts of life: it is at once shattered and
        preserved” (143)—at once evokes a distinctive Keatsian style that works by plundering from
        and restaging the preserved materials of antique worlds, and the landscape of Keats’s
        prematurely posthumous existence. Keats’s litany of protests suggests a keen sense, not of
        his coming death, but that he himself is a relic of a lost context, improbably lasting into
        this brief afterlife—the lone survivor of a vanished and mourned world, the traces of which,
        obtruding by chance into <emph>his</emph> world, activate scenes and sense
        information lodged in memory, ruptured from any trajectory of hope or desire. The world, in
        turn, possesses its own emptied, virtual existence as it withdraws: “I eternally see her
        figure eternally vanishing” (II, 345). Refusing the work of remembrance, he is attacked by
        figures of illimitable loss; aggressively withholding from others the chance of a gradual
        and negotiated letting go, he ensures his survival in the form of image and phrases that
        erupt into and shatter consciousness; giving up poetry, he sustains around him a charged
        poetic world.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an earlier

               </p>
               <p>The experiences described in these materials suggestively follow the paths Benjamin, in the
        later “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” adumbrates for impressions that manage to get around
        what he calls the “shock defense,” the defensive work of consciousness to ward off
        potentially traumatic incursions of information about the world. On the one hand, Benjamin
        suggests, there is the “shock,” the force of stimuli that manage to slip through this guard;
        on the other, the psychically disruptive
        <emph>memoire involontaire</emph>, the reactivation of the
        trace left by the rogue stimulus, triggered, perhaps, by accident—the eating, say, of a
        particular kind of cake dunked in the tea your grandmother used to serve (172-6). In “On
        Some Motifs,” Benjamin characterizes modern subjectivity as perpetually armed and vigilant
        against the shocks of life under capital, shocks that like Wordsworth before him he connects
        in part to the density of modern social life, with its multiplied possibilities of chance
        encounters (181-92), and in part to the ascendency of communication technologies that work
        to alienate subjects from authentic personal or collective experience. In Benjamin’s
        account, mass-mediated communication functions to bifurcate the way information comes to us
        and is registered: on the one hand, there is the “information” circulated, say, by way of
        the news—information that enters public consciousness, and that aims less to be assimilated
        into private and collective life than to be noted and forgotten, as news item follows news
        item; on the other hand, there is experience that slips by consciousness to become lodged in
        dwindling reservoirs of private and collective memory that are increasingly cut off from
        public life (172-4). </p>
               <p>If Wordsworth sees the introspective lyric as having salutary power vis-à-vis the shocks of
        modernity by virtue of the way it draws private, unconscious experience into collective
        life, for Benjamin, the waning of the lyric during the nineteenth century suggests that, in
        its traditional Romantic (that is, “introspective”) form, it no longer speaks to modern
        experience. Baudelaire, whose work has steadily gained readership during this period, would
        seem to be an exception (170-2). This, Benjamin suggests, has to do with the paradoxical way
        Baudelaire meets the “shocks” of modernity: he is at once theatrically and constantly <emph>en garde</emph> against them, and persistently failing to intercept them. The
        essay suggests that Baudelaire’s hyper-vigilance is that of a collector and connoisseur of
        shock, and indeed, comes out of a poet’s feeling for the special predicament of his times:
        Baudelaire parries so vigorously because only impressions that are <emph>not</emph> absorbed by consciousness, and thus <emph>not</emph> accessible to a
        poetic project of recovery, can become the materials of true experience and of true poetry
        (170-81).</p>
               <p>Benjamin is specifically concerned here with the work of memory, citing Theodor Reik in
        this context: “The function of memory (<foreign>Gedächtnis</foreign>) . . . is to
        protect our impressions; reminiscence (<foreign>Erinnerung</foreign>) aims at their
        dissolution. Memory is essentially conservative: reminiscence, destructive” (175). In an age
        of information, Reik’s “reminiscence,” the conscious and thus potentially public act of
        remembrance, is of a piece with forgetting, the necessary, constant shedding of information
        as the next thing comes along. Given the divide between “consciousness” and “experience” for
        Benjamin, for an event to become present to consciousness is “to isolate events from the
        realm in which they could affect the experience of the reader” (173). What <emph>can</emph> affect the reader—affect the reader <emph>in the form of memory
            unregistered by consciousness</emph>—can only come in the form of a shock that slips through
        a guard, and the subsequent, accidental detonation of its trace in a way that ruptures the
        conscious, public narratives and contexts into which “information” becomes installed. The
        achievement of Baudelaire’s poetry it that it at once blocks access to experience (that is,
        prevents experience from becoming registered as “information”) and effects the detonation
        and transmission of experience beyond its encryption in a singular psyche. That is, as
        Jennifer Bajorek argues in a fine account of the shock effect, it works in the manner of
        Proust’s <emph>madeleine</emph> (114).</p>
               <p>Benjamin’s essay on Baudelaire, in which Baudelaire’s poetry becomes the way that true
        experience, that is, experience blocked from consciousness, can move into collective memory,
        helps us think about both the dynamics of Keats’s posthumous life and the “sentimental”
        effects that dog his reception. For we could argue that the materials of Keats’s posthumous
        life, if they lay the ground for his posthumous fame, do so by modeling and creating the
        conditions for belatedly detonating memory: the “strangeness of Keats’s mind,” legible in
        the protests of what he cannot “bear” to think of—the letters that must remain closed and
        out of view; the “hands,” the material traces of singular persons, that accidently slip past
        the guard; the detonating phrases and images from the past; and the avidly refused telos of
        hope realized, promise fulfilled—all suggest a mode of experience that is private and
        singular but not “subjective,” and that can be transmitted—through these nuggets of speech,
        often embedded in Severn’s letters, which are then circulated among the friends whose
        letters won’t be opened and whose “hands” won’t be born—as an unassimilable burden of
        sociality. And we could extend our account of the movement of these materials into
        collective memory when we consider the sharp and unpredictable effects of pathos and loss
        that Keats’s poetry has historically prompted in its readers—effects generated by shards of
        verse that can randomly and unpredictably revive the <emph>memoire
          involontaire</emph> of the materials of the posthumous life. </p>
               <p>Reading Keats is always reading between the biographical and literary remains, which came
        before the public simultaneously, first in the pirated Galignani edition of 1829 and then in
        the editions of Richard Monckton Milnes of 1848. When reading Keats, the allegorical style
        concatenates with the relics of the singular biographical subject. This concatenation
        produces figures laden with more affective weight than they can perhaps sustain: on the one
        hand, a poetic corpus open to unpredictable affections and attachments; on the other, an
        allegorical image of the Poet—remote, abstracted, prematurely arrested, not of the order of
        ordinary consciousness and quotidian life, singled out to bear and fail to bear the shocks
        of a market-driven print culture and modern social arrangements. This is “the Poet” as
        represented by Keats’s mask: an abstracted, denatured appearance that yet carries the
        imprint of a unique and ungraspable loss, in a form that can be reproduced and circulated.
        If ultimately and historically this figure has functioned to shore up Keats’s and
        Romanticism’s capital, it simultaneously transmits the shocks of what cannot be assimilated
        into that project—the arrested experience and its detonating posthumous life. </p>
