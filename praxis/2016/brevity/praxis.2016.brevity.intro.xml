        <head>Introduction: Too Much, Too Little: Of Brevity</head>
        <p> In a brief search of the <title level="m">English Poetry</title> database, the words “minimum” and “minimal” do not appear in the writings
          of some of the authors who we often associate with the period and concept of Romanticism. That almost insignificant fact, however, calls to
          mind a much larger series of matters that come to the fore as the clichés that serve as Romanticism’s most common and ponderous “others”:
          temporal and historical parameters of what Romanticism “was” and “is”; Romanticism’s theoretical suppleness and expansiveness; its <emph>too
            muchness</emph>, its affective expansiveness and rhetorical disruptions; its “uncontainable” and effusive structures; its slippery
          ambivalence as a term that either says too much or too little about the limits of historical thought; its putatively close engagements with
          vitality, “life,” creativity, infinity; and its ongoingness as a conceptual marker of modernity, refusing to bury a past that inscribes
          present temporalities through and through. Think of T.E. Hulme, for whom Romanticism posits “that man, the individual, is an infinite
          reservoir of possibilities; and if you can so rearrange society by the destruction of oppressive order then these possibilities will have a
          chance and you will get Progress” (57). One cannot, then, be too brief about what Romanticism seemingly aspires to, and the commitments it
          often hopes to maximize. </p>
        <p> And yet, as if rescinding Hulme’s terms in a poem that otherwise seems concerned with countering industrialization with pastoral
          self-expansion, William Wordsworth’s sonnet, “The World is Too Much With Us,” considers the fine calibrations involved in deciding what
          constitutes <emph>too much</emph> in the first place. If the world is one that is both “late and soon,/Getting and spending,” (Wordsworth
          1-2) it is one whose appropriative economies seek to reel in a world as something that is decidedly subject to representation and
          capture—one that is coercively <emph>with us</emph>. At the same time, it is also a world that cannot quite be held by those economies that
          criss-cross each other and seem to miss the very transitional object they cannot nor are properly able to destroy and leave behind. <quote><lg>
              <l>…we lay waste our powers;</l>
              <l>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</l>
              <l>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</l>
              <l>This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,</l>
              <l>The winds that will be howling at all hours,</l>
              <l>And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,</l>
              <l>For this, for everything, we are out of tune;</l>
              <l>It moves us not. (2-9)</l>
            </lg></quote> The little that is ours is seen, and the more that we don’t glimpse remains the blind spot in nature that cannot be taken.
          There is a world that is not <emph>this</emph> world, neither transcendental nor immanent, but something considered otherwise in its
          measurelessness. And strangely, Wordsworth’s critique of disenchantment and estrangement ends up exposing us to the remains of
            <emph>something</emph> that we can neither have nor approximate. If the sonnet’s meter seemingly condenses the speaker’s thoughts into a
          dynamic of evanescence and materialization, it is one that is transitional, testing, and mildly reparative—it tries to understand how, if
          there is too much of something with us, too little won’t do either.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">See Curran.</note>
          Less is not more, in this case—less <emph>and</emph> more are alternating ideologies.</p>
        <p>What might Romantic minimality and brevity suggest as alternative additions to our critical vocabulary? How do they allow us to think
          differently—and briefly—about a constellation of questions and perspectives that throw into relief the necessity to think through the small,
          negligent, obscure, too little or too much, the ephemeral, the mere <emph>there is</emph>, the all but <emph>not there</emph>? The authors
          of the position papers collected for this issue were each asked to respond to just these kinds of prompts and to keep their arguments
          operatively brief. Conciseness and intensification in service of our theme of brevity and minimality was the order of the day. The space
          between stanzas, like the disappearance of a ruin into history, became equal considerations for reflecting on the brevity of things that the
          larger “life” of Romanticism cannot ever ignore.</p>
        <p> In a prosaic world otherwise tethered to the value of disclosure, unconcealment, publicity, and of making oneself heard, understood, and
          recognized, consider the small, unobtrusive, fugitive, minute, brief, cursory, and all but illegible sign or trace, the mark that could just
          as easily be over-looked as seen. What of the forms of life that do not merely endure but in fact <emph>honor</emph> inconspicuousness and,
          as Jacques Khalip argues, “anonymity”? Such barely perceivable indications and enunciations constitute what Anne-Lise François calls “open
          secrets,” i.e., “forms of uncounted experience and unremarkable virtue,” and all “those nonassertive ways of being in the world” for which
          the least demonstrative, expressive, or forthcoming is also a condition of utmost frankness because unapologetically free from the otherwise
          irresistible imperative either to withhold or present, to conceal a secret or speak the truth (60). Consider the ephemera that Samuel Taylor
          Coleridge conjures in “Frost at Midnight,” i.e., the shadowy figure or “stranger’s face” (41), whom he recalls as a child hoping would
          arrive at his classroom door, but doesn’t, as if a reverse image of the unknown visitor who rings the door-bell in Ionesco’s play, yet
          cannot wait to be received. Through the eyes of the child, the poet looks for a salvific sign, but what he sees is notable for its barely
          solicitous substancelessness. Coleridge glances at a glance that never was. An immaterial mediation of a fleeting memory of an encounter
          that failed to take place—an <emph>un</emph>missed encounter, so to speak—seems deliberately to flirt with the limits of what one can be
          made to feel or read as significant. Here there is no breathing of trauma that enlarges the psychic deep time of Romantic modernity. Rather,
          Coleridge queerly finds “companionship” with something that must be looked at precisely because it suggests nothing at all: he is queerly
          drawn to a filmy apparition that approaches in the mode of its own fading, taking pleasure not in a memory but in the eddies of anxious
          interiority that it leaves in its tremulously minimal wake. </p>
        <p>Perhaps this is what it means to tarry with what Emmanuel Levinas calls the trace, “the movement that already carries away the
          signification it brought” (70). What would it mean to follow such a movement for its insignificance, for unraveling precisely the
          experiences it nominally would appear to host? Without “getting and spending,” might the trace be the barest mark (which is precisely
            <emph>not</emph> the barest life, not answerable, in the manner of the biopolitical, to the measure of life or to a certain normatively
          sacralizing conception of “life”) that affords interest in a world that is too much—too powerfully coercive, demanding of assent,
          contractual in its sensible and epistemological obligations? Such a line of thinking suggests modes for reading and writing that circle
          around just this kind of brevity and minimality. If we have come to think that Romanticism can and must endure as the site of
            <emph>and</emph> the arsenal for excavating the historical, then perhaps such a historicism endlessly believes in the repleteness or
          sustainability of the “Romantic” as bedrock for life. If historicism is excessive in its tarrying of the referent with the letter, might
          there be an interest in questioning the degree to which such work might be <emph>too much</emph>, or perhaps <emph>too little</emph> in its
          emphases? That we here face an indistinction of exactly opposed weightings suggests that weighting is the problem and that tarrying with an
          indifference to weighing—weightlessness—offers a way to address that problem. Might “history” indicate a desire to cover over another kind
          of desire, one that often operates in Romanticism as an interest in Coleridge’s film as that which is never precisely here and not here, too
          small or too large, unfindable and fascinating in its absence? As we came to realize, the minimal itself is hard to pin down. </p>
        <p>Let us offer a working (workless?) definition, or eight ways of looking at minimality: </p>
        <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Min´imum</hi>, n. (pl. <emph>-ima</emph>), &amp; a. </p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>–Scarcity, austerity, dearth, penury, shortness of supply, “learning” to live within one’s means or compelled to live with less . . .
            and then <emph>more</emph> of much less (re: the radical diminution of the “the Leech-Gatherer”): all keywords in the seemingly
            self-evident logics of accumulation and dispossession that play out in different ways in Malthus, Hegel, and Marx and that normatively
            organize life along the phantasmatic axis of minimal primitive “needs” and unlimited surplus “wants.” Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
            economisms give life to a powerful double anthropological illusion that privileges the concept of a simple origin in the least: the “man”
            of sheer needs who is never more essentially human than in this condition of naked life. The creature without <emph>wants</emph> wants
            nothing and wants for nothing . . . or so the story goes. As the youthful speaker of Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper” says, "Hush, Tom! never
            mind it, for when your head's bare, / You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair” (7-8). Bravely eschewing or cruelly denied
            surplus, ornament, or opulence, and thus imagined to be immune to the propertied vicissitudes of time and circumstance, the mirage of the
            subject who is resolutely independent from wants is compelled to be both scarcely human <emph>and</emph> the most human. This is not the
            only place in Romanticism where the minimum and the maximum incoherently meet. In the figures of the discharged soldier, the blind beggar,
            the bereft widow, the child slave, the dream of the destitution of a life untarnished by luxury flickers troublingly between scandal and
            nobility. Or one thinks of the hero-waifs of Dickens’s novels, who, through some dark magic, remain sentimentally attractive—to a moneyed
            class of readers—because they are enduringly human amid unendurable poverty. In conflating bare life with natural life, capital thereby
            becomes an apology for impoverishment, both notional and real. As Simon Jarvis demonstrates, no Romantic thinker makes the maddening
            destructiveness of this ideologically saturated anthropology more legible than Wordsworth. For Jarvis, the tale told by the weeping man in
            “The Last of the Flock” is exemplary in this regard. Our incredulity seems initially to be directed at a fellow whose narrative of
            austerity muddles wants and needs, but his inconsolable tears point readers elsewhere, towards the derangement of a culture that not only
            requires the destitution of others but also dares to call that deprivation salutary, a teachable moment. What is the lesson that
            Wordsworth’s mad and bereft shepherd knows in his bones to be a pacifying and defeatist lie? A “core of essential humanness remains
            unshakeable by all misfortune” (Jarvis 87).</item>

          <item><p rend="noCount">On the far horizon of “weightless claims to attention” (François 3) lies the zero-degree semiosis of what Walter
              Benjamin, reading Hölderlin, calls <foreign>die reine Sprache</foreign>, i.e., that which is purely or sheerly language, language so entirely divested of
              its semantic function, so indifferent to the solicitousness with which we naturalize language (compelling it to be human, indeed, the
              very sign of humanity) that it is divested even of that divestiture (Benjamin 54).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"

              and redaction, as Kevin McLaughlin argues, are “the pieces” or “the bits of language” (66) that can, among other things, testify to the
              barest of relations among texts <emph>as</emph> texts: the unused remainders of Thomas De Quincey’s <title level="m">Confessions of an
                English Opium-Eater</title> that knock senselessly about Charles Baudelaire’s <title level="m">Artificial Paradises</title> is a case
              in point. The French poet’s “technique of amalgamation,” as McLaughlin says, “imitates a dead spot, a pause, that comes between the two
              works” (66). <hi rend="bold">Example: </hi>In “Brief Encounter: de Man on Wordsworth, or The Irony of The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Lee
              Edelman reminds us of the spatio-temporal adjacencies that force language to torque between thought and unthought—quite literally the
                <emph>between</emph> as the hinge moment (or the blank space between the stanzas in “A slumber did my spirit seal”) that doesn’t quite
              perform the change from one thing to another. “Brevity,” Edelman remarks, “seen as the soul of wit, can make things easier to remember,
              thus enabling them to endure, but it also can be seen as duration’s impossible dream of self-erasure, its effort to collapse or
              minimalize the spatialization of time as distance. In that sense, the simultaneity of events (as opposed to their sequential unfolding)
              would constitute brevity’s absolute form, its purest realization.”</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Wordsworth famously tarries with spots of time, which are their own genre of minimalia—the lyric distillation of the
              life of things that punctuates the prose of the world. Against those moments of the living present we might contrast the advent of the
              “dead spot,” the insentient passing of difference <emph>as</emph> difference, and nothing more. This alteration and altercation of
              “live” and “dead” spots brings to mind a memorable verse from Blake: “Los reads the Stars of Albion! the Spectre reads the Voids /
              Between the Stars” (<title level="m">Jerusalem</title> 36-7). A generation ago, Harold Bloom sketched out six revisionary ratios with
              which to consider the varied forms that poetic intertextuality can take, but those ratios feel positively baroque compared to the flat
              relationality or mere difference which McLaughlin associates with the recursiveness and indistinction of what he calls “poetic force”
              and “unforce.” </p></item>

              eye. —The self-showing of the depthless and of that which has nothing to hide. The “poets,” Kant claims in the <title level="m">Critique
                of the Power of Judgment</title>, possess the capacity to apprehend scenes <emph>merely</emph> as they appear, i.e., prior to the
              conceptually guided judgments that transform them into the objects of experience. In an often cited reflection on the judgments of
              taste, for example, Kant dreams of aesthetes for whose impassive and non-acquisitive eyes the sea is not as a source of food or
              transportation but merely that which appears, meaning—if the meaning of saying “something means something” isn’t already saying far too
              much in this instance—only its appearance and little else. The minimally cognizable is, as Kant insists, the source of an uncommon
              pleasure that is also shared and shareable by all rational creatures <emph>as</emph> rational creatures (153). (The conceptless concept
              of seeing next to nothing proves to have remarkable staying power. Consider, for example, its important if unexpected modulation in the
              work of Jean-Luc Marion, for whom seeing “saturated phenomenon” means “letting appearances appear in such a way that they accomplish
              their own apparition, so as to be received exactly as they give themselves” [7].)</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> But mere reflection is also strangely empty, comprehensible mostly in comparison to what it is not, i.e., the
              “determinate, empirical, contentful knowledge of objects” (Zuckert 1). Rodolphe Gasché points out that although in Kant “the adverb
              ‘merely’ (<emph>bloss</emph>) is not to be taken in a depreciatory sense,” (18) its repeated use betrays “the difficulty of isolating,
              with the required purity, the realm to be delimited” (19). At the point of mereness, the self-showing of an untrammelled purity is
              haunted by fragility and a vulnerability to all that it has shunned, shed, and excluded. “Looking at the stars forever”: so Rei Terada
              describes, recalling a strange moment of rapt inattentiveness in Keats’s <title level="m">Hyperion</title>, the almost unimaginable act
              of merely seeing—neutrally, endlessly (i.e., without an end in sight), and inconsequentially. “Among Keats’s many instances of scanning,
              survey, aversion, dreaming, aesthetic vision, partial blindness, and so on, I’m most interested in his inclusion of looking that seems
              openly absorptive, yet withholds its realization,” Terada notes: “<title level="m">Hyperion</title> exhibits a kind of discretion about
              what might accompany looking at the stars whose motive may be the inclusion of ‘nothing’” (278). Is reading—or a certain conception of
              reading—the paradigmatic instance of this minimal looking without seeing, eyes wide shut? <hi rend="bold">Example:</hi> in a reading of
              Horne Tooke’s <title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> alongside Shelley, William Keach focuses on rhetorical abbreviation and
              speed as components of “Hymn to Mercury,” where the latter figure is endlessly rethought and refigured as a trope for the brevity that
              enables poetic renewal and imagination. Indeed, as Keach reminds us, to read is necessarily to expose oneself to mere language, for
              example, to the sheer ordering of letters, phonemes, and words and to the spaces between those pieces of language, i.e., to the minimal
              differences without which signs cannot appear. </p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Other, related questions arise, but this time in a pictorial rather than a linguistic setting, but questions that
              remind us of the sheerly inscriptive nature of both. What could it mean to attend, for example, to a squiggle in a Blake illustration,
              and to tarry with whether or to what degree it signifies? Or to consider the top portion of the first preliminary drawing for Francisco

              image out of the chaos of the drawing hand. As Johannes Grave puts it, viewers <quote>encounter strokes, lines, and flourishes about
                which it is impossible to decide whether they function merely as hatching or are already the first suggestions of the emerging contour
                of a representational form. The drawing, we quickly realize, does not just depict the imagination’s independent activity during
                sleeping and dreaming, but is also the place where it is carried out. (33)</quote> Yet Grave significantly underestimates the
              importance of the force of the minimum in Goya’s sketch (and perhaps this is an occupational hazard for anyone exploring the nature of
              the barely there) insofar as he recuperates what he sees as the incarnation of the imagination at work. In doing so, he phenomenalizes
              the indeterminate differences and inscriptions that capture the eye without knowing what to do with them. We find ourselves looking not
              at the drawing <emph>of</emph> something—including, after Grave, the drawing of the process of drawing—but of something more grossly
              indeterminate, something on the threshold of drawing but little else. At the instant that we sense the infinite directions that Goya’s
              image <emph>could</emph> have taken, but finally did not, the wisdom of Jean-Luc Godard’s remark rings true: “in the absence of the just

            <p rend="noCount">The irreducible remainder, a concept derived from mathematics, i.e., that which is left over from processes of
              subtraction or division and which cannot itself be further subtracted or divided: the remainder without remainder. A residuum that

              substancelessness and barely there to which the actual remains eternally answerable. That the irreducible remainder can support such
              seemingly contradictory significances reminds us that it is a figure of desire, the subject of a potent dream of the inviolate origin
              that is itself inviolate: “Thus the desire or the <emph>phantasm</emph> of the intact kernel is irreducible,” Jacques Derrida remarks,
              “–despite the fact that <emph>there is no</emph> intact kernel” (115). The resistant <foreign>reste</foreign> is that which is

              anything at all). The Romantic locus classicus is undoubtedly F.W.J. Schelling’s masterwork, the <title level="m">Freedom</title> essay:
                <quote>After the eternal act of self-revelation, everything in the world is, as we see it now, rule, order and form; but anarchy still
                lies in the ground, as if it could break through once again, and nowhere does it appear as if order and form were what is original but
                rather as if initial anarchy had been brought to order. This is the incomprehensible base of reality in things, the indivisible
                remainder, that which with the greatest exertion cannot be resolved in understanding but remains eternally in the ground. (29)</quote>
              Among the many captivating elements of this harried primal scene is the reversal with which it threatens itself: if the unruly is the
              generative basis of this “world,” then isn’t the “world” rather than the “irreducible remainder” also what merely remains–or, at the
              very least, the remainder of the remainder in a chain of formings and unformings without origin or end? At the very least, Schelling
              surprises us with the possibility that, pared down to its bare foundations, the ground is as unknowable as it is shaky, the scene of a
              pregnant indeterminacy that he captures by moving restlessly between describing the fundament as either the <emph>un-grund</emph> or the
                <emph>ur-grund</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">For a discussion of this question, see Clark.</note> So
              much depends upon the minimal difference between the two barely discernible prefixes qualifying what, strictly speaking, should stand on
              its own as that which stands. For Schelling—as for his rough contemporary, Blake—the narrative arc of the history of the nature of
              things is not a fall from order into disorderliness but the reiterated imposition of order on an unruliness that renders that order
              provisional, anxious, and always on the very threshold of ruin. In its minimal state, reality is equiprimordial with this ancient and
              pervasive fractiousness, a universe of remaindering, never to be remaindered. <hi rend="bold">Example: </hi>Michele Speitz’s “<ref

              forth on its (in)humanizing desires. What “it remembers and re-members is a humanity that finally belongs not just to human words such
              as ‘here lies’ but also to the non-human ‘diurnal course,’ pursued by earth, ‘rolled round’ ‘[w]ith rocks, and stones, and trees.’” The
              “here lies” seems to point to or mark, without specifying, the taking place of something that then follows it, but what Speitz implies
              is that the this marking might very well have a pathos all its own. What seems left-over is in fact the origin’s trace of itself,
              haunting the known universe like so much background radiation. </p>

            <p rend="noCount">—The shard, sherd, potsherd, or fragment. “The fragment may be a ruin,” Tilottama Rajan remarks, “a diasparactive part
              of a lost whole, or an intentional spark for something yet to be worked out” (800). Coleridge could be said to condense both
              possibilities—the burned trace <emph>and</emph> the slight augury—in the figure of “that fluttering stranger” (26), “the film, which
              fluttered on the grate” (15) that we discussed earlier. Romanticism may teach us to consider the fragmentary minimum as something
              otherwise than as a privation. Carol Jacobs has powerfully taught us to think of a decidedly “uncontainable romanticism,” or “an
              uncontrollable moving beyond all those parameters seemingly fixed within the texts”; such a Romanticism moves by critically turning in
              upon itself, evolution positing <emph>something</emph> only to unground each position in a recursive about-face, an involution of form
              and meaning precisely at all processual turns (ix). Yet what is the materiality of this species of Romanticism—uncontainable,
              uncontrollable, surplus, excessive, merely <emph>more than what is given</emph>? Might the force of such a Romanticism be the other side
              of something adynamic, not even recognizable as a strength or force (or an unforce, as McLaughlin argues), but a worklessness that
              neither moves nor returns to anything at all? <hi rend="bold">Example</hi>: in Karen Swann’s “<ref

              Keats’s life mask—as overdetermined a piece of Keatsiana as anything—that is at once the ephemera of Romantic transmission but also a
              strangely recessive object whose historical shock is unforced, pressureless—“the shocks of what cannot be assimilated into that
              project—the arrested experience and its detonating posthumous life.” How does the mask circulate in a non-processual “force,” at once
              symptom of and a grinding down to the impossible nothingness of Romantic thought? Of Keats’s unfinished <title level="m"
                >Hyperion</title> poems, Balachandra Rajan writes: <quote>The dignity of a fragment in a poetry of self-formation lies in its finding

                either the unit’s eventfulness as such or the vacancy or pause that, thanks to its unitary quality, prevents [it] from simply escaping
                or being negated…the minimal unit…performs a cognate function in romantic-period writing in focalizing a state of being that is
                typically missed or overlooked or discounted, especially in the welter of modernity where ‘one’s own time’ is just a heartbeat from
                becoming ‘what went before.’ </quote> “Singularity is necessarily divided,” as Jonathan Culler says: “it takes part in the generality
              of meaning, without which it could not be read, and so is not closed in on itself, <foreign>punctuelle</foreign>, but iterable”
