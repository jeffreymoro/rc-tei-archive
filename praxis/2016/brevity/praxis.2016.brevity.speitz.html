            <p>This paper reconsiders a shrinking set of Lucy poems from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1800) in light of the longer ballad that precedes them: “Ellen Irwin, or the Braes
               of Kirtle.” Here Wordsworth thematizes death through a constellation of always working
               but not always living bodies. Moving throughout the corpus of each poem, these bodies
               embark upon trajectories not marked off by life but designated more simply by movement
               itself, by the turns and lines that shape the dead as well as the living. Be it the
               affect of the flesh, the linear gait of a horse, the orbit of the moon, or even the
               muted work of figures newly mantled by the earth, each metaphorical turn shadows the
               aesthetic work demanded by each line. Scripting a counter-intuitive formulation—you
               think that lyric poems are about people, they’re not—the poems reclaim the human body
               for deep time and ultimately announce the limits of what poetry and humanity as a
               whole can do.</p>

                           Thomas Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. In it we find the poem titled “Lucy
                           and Colin” by Thomas Tickell Esq. that prefigures concerns central to “Strange fits
                           of passion” and that will find its echo in the buried lovers of “Ellen Irwin, or the
                           Braes of Kirtle.” More specifically, the following lines suggest that Wordsworth follows

                  even for Romantic poetry, and Wordsworth’s way around this is to focus attention on
                  inanimate objects as a way of metonymically reflecting the human back on to itself.
                  Scripting a counter-intuitive formulation—you think that lyric poems are about people,
                  they’re not—the poems exhibit a Wordsworthian geo-poetics that reclaims the human
                  body for deep time and that ultimately announces the limits of what poetry and humanity

                  of “Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of Kirtle,” which paints the death of two lovers, Ellen
                  and Adam Bruce. The poem’s curtain falls upon two graves, not two bodies, conceding
                  the relative brevity of human life by commemorating their final remains, by highlighting
                  the ground that holds them and the stones that remember them:</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Significantly, because of how Wordsworth arrays the words on the page, the reader
               ends with a capitalized “HIC JACET” (56). Laying directly above these words, and plotted
               directly behind the Latinate phrase meaning “here lies,” are emblems of the material
               but fleeting body that lies beneath them; the reader first encounters a negative image
               in “deface” with its evocation of a decaying visage, followed by “his head,” and then
               the depths where “the Bruce is laid;” each line of verse transforms into a virtual
               layer of dust that increasingly obscures the legibility of this body and its history
               (55, 54, 53). At the same time, as the entire body of Adam Bruce seems to fade further
               from the metaphorical surface, it is the most detailed remainder of the head and the
               threat of defacement that hover nearest to the headstone. The carved stone by proxy
               now carries the impossible task of offering a kind of legibility once manifested by
               a whole body, by the shape of a head, by the unique contours of one’s visage. After
               hoping that gentle readers might behold the graves of these lost lovers, the poetic
               persona makes its final request: “May no rude hand deface it / And its forlorn [here
               lies].” In this closing stanza, an insistent “Now” in the mouth of the lyric speaker
               gives way to what is only conjectural, to a couple of “May[s]” that betray an overriding
               sense of vulnerability and insecurity. Abandoning the body and its name to a space
               now lines away, Wordsworth privileges a phrase—“here lies”—that is both a place and
               an act, as the poem worries about immediacy and permanence, legibility and indeterminacy.
               </p>
            <p>These lines detail how we record the loss of human life, how the earth records it
               with bodies laid down side by side. Now marked, the future history of this body is
               hefted upon once fallow earth and stone. Yet the monumental charge of the Wordsworthian
               page differs from that of the headstone. The reader does not finally alight upon the
               name of an individual. The poet casts off the more reportable history of <em>a</em> man to face the more conjectural and foreign story of one’s remains. By lastly announcing
               the condition and placement of the body, its lying in the earth—in another language
               no less—the author stresses the limit of what language can capture and throws into
               question what we can hope to know about our own or any posthumous lying. If “here
               lies” is a place and an action, then laying to rest, which seems an end, is also the
               beginning of a defacement, a decay that gives birth, perhaps, to new life.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Each of the following Lucy poems expands upon this model, though each one decreases
                  in length, shrinking from 28, to 12, to 8 lines. In effect sketching a literary equivalent
                  to withdrawing half-lives, each engages less and less with an individuated entity
                  by the name of Lucy, and more and more with only the suggestion of the body as an
                  ever-diminishing remainder of mortal life.

                           revolving and transforming grave.</span></div>
                  </div> The point to bear in mind is that death and elegy in these works rarely signal <em>the</em> end as much as they mark beginnings or continuances with varying degrees of human
                  legibility. Wordsworth dramatizes loss of life in terms of ongoing actions. Tracking
                  how Wordsworth narrativizes bodies in motion—particularly after he presents Adam Bruce’s
                  body beginning its process of decay—allows for a consideration of these works that
                  avoids a common hermeneutical snare.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To illustrate that trap, in her examination of “Formalism and Time,” Catherine Gallagher
               offers that critics are perhaps influenced by Romantic poets who privilege epiphanic
               immediacy over the banalities of diachronic narrative. <span class="quote">‘The unending is not figured in the sand that ‘paves’ the ceaseless movement of the
                  sea but is instead imagined as the submerged and effaced mark in the sand of a passing
                  air current over the waters. The figure indicates an event so brief that it seems
                  almost to participate in a negative temporality, to be over before it has begun; by
                  the time the wrinkle has formed at the bottom of the water, the wind on its surface
                  has ceased to be. (235)’</span> While here she takes aim at Percy Shelley, she ultimately points to Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em> for engendering this temporal bias, for ranking poetry above plot and history (234).
               Taking issue with what she calls “stop-action” analyses, Gallagher prescribes the
               following: “if we are ever to develop a concept of length that includes analytic insights
               into the temporal nature of narrative” we must shed our preoccupation with epiphany;
               we must become “less enamored of the end” (251). Wordsworth, for one, offers a corrective
               to this case. His lyric is ever a ballad, yoked not only to the contracted moment
               but also to the unfurling story. The unending—not an eternal place but an incomplete
               tale—may not be “figured in the sand” but it is deposited into the plot of this earth,
               figured in the alternating terrestrial orbs that populate this compressed sequence
               of lyrical ballads.</p>
            <p>Emphasizing movements inextricable from successive moments, Wordsworth reconciles
               the incongruent durations of human, animal, and stone. The unfolding sequence of poems
               counterintutively deploys a decreasing number of lines to highlight a broadening acknowledgment
               of deep time and geological process. Making full use of the lyrical ballad’s temporal
               hybridity, where it is home to the ephemeral and the enduring, with each poem Wordsworth
               revalues movements and events occurring both above and below the earth.</p>
            <p>“Strange fits of passion” picks up roughly where Wordsworth left off in “Ellen Irwin.”
               Framed by the setting of the previous narrative, its buried lovers and defenseless
               headstone, this poem continues a study of death, love, and language. As a tale of
               passions felt and daringly told, as a tale designated for “the lover’s ear alone,”
               it calls attention to the sensual textures of vocalization, listening, and reading
               (3). Also with this phrase, the text makes a lover of any reader, and importantly,
               of every reader. The poem ironizes the intimacy shared within the private economy
               of two lovers, suggestively redirecting the charged proximities and distances of lyricized
               lovers to the seemingly trivial arenas of motion and stillness, sound and absence.
               </p>
            <p>Following suit, the first stanza hazards to disclose not simply how these odd “fits”
               became “known,” but also what so movingly “bef[alls]” the lyric persona (1, 4). </p>

               poem and its back-and-forth <em>abab</em> rhyme scheme, “Strange fits of passion” first “befel” the lyric voice, pressing down
               as if with the unwavering force of gravity, only to be buoyed by a soundscape that
               acoustically registers singer and lover alike arising in June (4-5). The levity of
               this buried pun too is short-lived, and by the close of the stanza the lyric subject
               is “bent,” sandwiched “Beneath the evening moon” and the earth, but all the while
               “on [his] way” (7, 8, 7). This gesture establishes the poem’s rhythm of rise and fall,
               and, thus, the following segment flirts with fixity only to undercut it. As the reader
               works from line to line, the Wordsworthian wayfarer struggles forward, “fix[ing an]
               eye” onto a likewise travelling moon (9, 10-12). And again, the opening of stanza
               five suggests punctuated fits and starts that ultimately lead to a story of enduring
               movements: the horse’s labors, with its ceaseless trudging, grants nearer proximity
               to familiar paths that lead unsurprisingly to another plot, a plot soon knitted to
               Lucy’s future home in the earth but that is more quickly wedded through rhyme to a
               span above ground, to Lucy’s cot (13, 15).</p>
            <p>This lyrical ballad becomes a Wordsworthian model of the ebb and flow of existence,
               lodging Lucy, the horse, and the lyric speaker into its rolling <em>abab</em> lines, where they work against stasis and counterpoise the moon, now figured above
               the earth, now below, all granted only the illusion of stillness. Each oscillates
               back and forth, moving with the natural arc of a sine curve either in the form of
               bodies transiting above and below the horizon or as bodies transforming above and
               below the ground: “[W]e climb’d the hill, / […] The moon descended still;” even in
               sleep coupled with dream, “Nature’s gentlest [uplifting] boon” finds its complement
               in the pull of “the descending moon” (14, 16, 17-20). And further still, a horse rises,
               a planet drops (21-2, 24). A readerly pairing of Lucy’s life exclusively with the
               moon that deserts the wanderer overlooks the wider company of sojourners Wordsworth
               juxtaposes with this “planet,” and furthermore misses the point. Just as promiscuously
               as the poem makes a lover of every reader, it also attunes joint narrative trajectories
               of man, animal, and rocky globe—all fittingly enough for lyric—against the measure
               of movement and a line. The poem spins a ballad of its various hard working, ceaselessly
               moving voyagers, lovers, animals, and planets all read relative to potentialities
               only made possible by a line—the line of the horizon, the surface of the earth, each
               stroke of verse. In recognizing the line, the limit, we glimpse life beyond man’s
               limitations, not just a human end, but a seemingly never-ending story of the motion
               of earth and all its living things.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A parallel emerges in the poem, yoking the migratory pattern of the lyric subject
                  to patterns of language and thought. At the beginning of the journey narrative, when
                  the traveller first bends his way and first spies the moon, the momentum of the poetic
                  lines next leads to a “wide lea” (10), that is, to “a tract of open ground, either
                  meadow, pasture, or arable land” (<em>OED</em> “lea,” n.1). In the long tradition of elegiac verse, “lea” recurrently figures a meadowed
                  clearing.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                           (8)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“Lea” recurs throughout elegiac verse, appearing in Thomas Gray’s iconic “Elegy Written
                           in a Country Churchyard” (1751, 2); it inhabits Robert Burns’ 1793 collection where
                           the word’s tie to mourning is made explicit (“Elegy on Captain Mathew Henderson” 25).
                           The term is also deployed in part one of the macabrely titled “The Three Graves” (1809),
                           a collaborative endeavor Wordsworth would abandon and Coleridge would expand but leave
                           unfinished. For a more detailed discussion of this particular Wordsworthian and Coleridgean
                           project, see Murray.</span></div>
                  </div> One way to account for this word’s ubiquity within elegy and its broader association
                  with the graveyard would be that in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the
                  word also evoked the scythe. Lea-sands and lea-stones were common scythe sharpeners
                  (<em>OED</em> “lea,” n.3). While “lea” widely stood for a clearing, a 1781 glossary entry for this
                  term lists only scythe (Hutton 92). Thus, during this period “lea” signifies on at
                  least these two levels: it is a plot of unsown earth giving rise to wild grasses;
                  it is a tool used to cut down what rises from the earth. It scaffolds life and takes
                  life; it is the expanse and the edge.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Quite aptly then, the quatrain that bears this term arranges the traveller’s course.
               The earthly plane on which the “horse trudg’d on” appears already to tug on both animal
               and man. Pointedly, “All [occurs] over the wide lea,” over a field of fallow earth
               couched in one of the least resolvable lines of the poem. </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

            <p> The significance of this earth, requisite with its seductive, gravitational pull,
               suggestively recalls the final lines of the ballad of Ellen Irwin, its graves and
               its inadequate surface reminder of what remains resident in the earth. Wordsworth
               neatly deposits the sweeping indeterminacy of the phrase “All over the wide lea” into
               the brief space of a trimeter line. A compressed, janus-headed line and phrase, it
               doubles as both surface of play and receding yet inescapable horizon. For, all of
               us as readers, as lovers, trudging in tow with itinerant and horse “All over the wide
               lea,” for each of us, sojourners all, “we draw nigh those paths so dear,” we draw
               ever closer to an intimate but otherwise unknowable, unutterable, and illegible earthly
               futurity.</p>
            <p>Under the rubric established by “All over the wide lea,” moving bodies that to the
               reader’s ear “rose in June” bend back and promise to move anew. The capacious aesthetic
               of this stanza joins the only other stanza that is punctuated by expansive colons
               and semicolons and that explicitly figures the work of the horse in terms of trudging
               or moving on. The penultimate stanza pulses with both epiphanic and prosaic temporalities.
               Alternatingly, the lines harness the rhythm of the lyrical ballad’s contracting and
               expanding gait to reveal a horse that does not stop for death. </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">My horse mov’d on ; hoof after hoof</div>

            </blockquote>
            <p> Even though—and <em>as</em>, and <em>after</em>—the planet drops, the horse moves, something remains. The simultaneity afforded by
               poetic syntax enables Wordsworth to draft a horse that endures even with irreconcilable
               loss.</p>
            <p>Bearing in mind the distinct nature of the plane on which the horse rides, that of
               the earth that pulls it and entreats it to return, Wordsworth’s horse in motion resembles
               the final stanza’s “fond and wayward thoughts” that likewise operate along a plane,
               “slid[ing] / Into a Lover’s head” (25-26). These are fond thoughts precisely because
               they are wayward, anticipating death, the ultimate union with nature, the transformation
               promised by a lea that is always both loam <em>and</em> sickle. Here Wordsworth installs a visual pun, one that blurs easy distinctions between
               life and line, one that refuses to reduce linearity to mere flattening. With horse
               and thought driving parallel trajectories, thoughts wanted and unwanted find their
               way into the “Lover’s head,” bodies work like poetry moving hoof after hoof, foot
               after foot all along the way, the line, the wide lea. And adjacent to this lover’s
               head is just that, the extended space of a long, silent dash, the writer’s penned
               equivalent to a marked but unspeakable expanse that recalls not just the surface of
               the earth, but also what traveled above and what turns below: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">What fond and wayward thoughts will slide </div>

                  <div class="l">“O mercy!” to myself I cried,</div>
                  <div class="l">“If Lucy should be dead!” (25-28)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Finally the poem transitions into the high lyric mode of the apostrophic. An expression
               of the mind intrudes upon what is otherwise a catalogue of the overlap between life
               and death, aesthetically restyled in terms of emergence and retreat. Wordsworth transports
               the reader to “what might be called a timeless present but is better seen as a temporality
               of writing” (Culler 149). The apostrophe is a verbal event, one that for Jonathan
               Culler “stages the drama of the mind” and harbors a deep “connection” to “embarrassment”
               (148, 140). For Culler “to apostrophize is to will a state of affairs;” at issue is
               the “power of poetry to make something happen” (139, 140). The indiscreet call of
               the lyric voice—“‘O mercy!’ to myself I cried, / ‘If Lucy should be dead!’”—could
               seem a blot upon the page, particularly a page that sang elegy as a song between separated
               lovers and danced death along the arc of revolving bodies (27-28).</p>
            <p>This embarrassing blot might be read two ways. For most, this final cry is a loving
               and foolish exclamation of a wayward lover who has so identified the traveling moon
               with his pursuit of Lucy that the loss of one prompts the fear of the loss of the
               other at the very moment when the lover can make real his fits of passion. But the
               “should” might be read as an ethical imperative: it is right and a mercy that Lucy
               be dead, perhaps because the lover cannot bear to invest so much passion in what is
               after all only the fit of a fleeting life. We seem caught between sophomoric illusion
               and narcissistic sadism.</p>
            <p>Yet, knowingly or unknowingly Wordsworth leaves us another way. The root of the term
               “lea” is either “leuq- to shine (whence Latin <span class="foreign">lūcēre</span> , English <em>light</em> … [as in a] clearing);” or it comes from the Greek and Latin “<em>leu</em>” meaning “to loosen” (<em>OED</em>). The history of the word “lea” is bound to light and looseness, both of which resonate
               associatively and acoustically in the name Lucy. If Lucy goes, with Lucy goes the
               lea, the clearing on the ground, the wild grasses, and the scythe. With Lucy goes
               the expanse and the edge at home in the lyrical ballad. How does one account for or
               begin to express the loss of the play of light, the end of the play of the line, the
               loss of the looseness and pliability necessary to defend against the ultimate stopping,
               not death but fixity? How does the poem find itself half in love with unceasing death
               while fighting fixity to the very death?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If the apostrophic mode “makes a spectacle” of both the speaker and “the event which
                  the poem is attempting to be” (Culler 142, 149), then this verbal blush is for verse
                  itself. The vocative act self-effacingly announces poetry’s own horizon. Although
                  the poem centers around recycling, revolving bodies and repatterning lines, the call
                  at the end of the poem underscores an insufficiency at home even in the expansive
                  agency of lyric.

                  </div> In terms both poetic and planetary, each horizontal trudging and rising invites and
                  propels a turn toward a wordless, vertiginous depth. “Here lies” seems to signal a
                  fixed end against which continuation appears as defacement, but the Lucy poems explore
                  a larger ecology of movement that repositions human life and death within the course
                  of animal kind, the trajectory of planets, what Shelley would call “The everlasting
                  universe of things” (“Mont Blanc” 1). It is not that the loss is denied. Here even
                  poetry is not sufficient to alleviate the psychic toll of experiencing, working through,
                  and recognizing the ongoing limitedness that underpins each enduring movement. While
                  poetry may grant its readers a reprieve from various fixed ends, it cannot erase the
                  brevity of a life, the precarity of each line, all over the wide lea. Wordsworth cannot
                  preserve Lucy without losing her.

                  </div> Poetry cannot detach the scythe from the lea without forgetting itself. What it remembers
                  and re-members is a humanity that finally belongs not just to human words such as
                  “here lies” but also to the more than human “diurnal course,” pursued by earth, “rolled
                  round” “With rocks, and stones, and trees” (“A slumber did my spirit seal” 7, 8).</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The question of Lucy’s body and its seemingly absent presence is an old but recurrent
               problem. To address this puzzle, I move that we turn to a familiar Wordsworthian sourcebook:
               Thomas Percy’s <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. </em>In it we find the poem titled “Lucy and Colin” by Thomas Tickell Esq. that prefigures
               concerns central to “Strange fits of passion” and that will find its echo in the buried
               lovers of “Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of Kirtle.” More specifically, the following
               lines suggest that Wordsworth follows Percy in his concern over the play and movement
               of the poetic line and what it brings to bear on the nature of human life, on its
               seeming beginnings and earthly or geological endings:

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">For Simon Jarvis “Wordsworth’s verse itself continuously explores, explicitly as well
               as implicitly, the question of what verse is. […] It is a quality of Wordsworth’s
               thinking in general to pay attention to the slipperiness and subtle intermediateness
               of nature and culture, and upon no topic more so than meter. He wishes for ‘an art
               … that shall be life,’ and knows how much he is wishing for. The model for it is that
               ‘human history’ possessed not, as it happens, only by some human beings, but by a
               clump of trees.” It would be a music whose human character would reside not in its
               ability to work the world over, filling it with human meanings, but in its capacity
               to <em>receive</em> meaning. And it would be able to do this just because meter itself cannot be confidently
               assigned, from a Wordsworthian view, either to nature or to culture (111, 112 emphasis
               in the original). See also Alan Liu on how an exclusively formalist approach risks
               leaving behind pressing questions about historically constitutive components of human
               being; he writes, “We need to find a strategy […] to read […] humanity as a historical
               formation. [… Particularly, a] humanity that suddenly seems, from a differentiated
               view point, inhuman. Only at this point will the historical form of Wordsworthian
               humanity emerge, signaling the need to turn our gaze from the iconic text to the context
               generating the need for imagery in the first place” (312, 313).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Here Wordsworth in effect confronts Romantic poetics, where for Susan Stewart “issues
               of the fixed and living dimensions of meter became inextricably tied to questions
               of the connections between poetic forms and other life forms, the possibilities for
               representing emotion, and the role of poets’ voices in an increasingly literate culture”

               in a Country Churchyard” (1751, 2); it inhabits Robert Burns’ 1793 collection where
               the word’s tie to mourning is made explicit (“Elegy on Captain Mathew Henderson” 25).
               The term is also deployed in part one of the macabrely titled “The Three Graves” (1809),
               a collaborative endeavor Wordsworth would abandon and Coleridge would expand but leave
               unfinished. For a more detailed discussion of this particular Wordsworthian and Coleridgean
               project, see Murray.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
