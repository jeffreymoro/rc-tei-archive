            <p>In “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Paul de Man invokes allegory and irony as two distinct
               perspectives on the question on time: the former responding to an epistemological
               problem by transposing it into temporal sequence and the latter collapsing temporal
               sequence into simultaneity. This leads him, however, to imagine the possibility of
               texts that would “overcome irony.” When he examines “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal”
               as an example of such an overcoming, de Man’s own text, however, encounters the accident
               of an irony that opens a window onto the instability of his pedagogical distinction
               between irony and allegory—an instability that hinges on the necessity of “reading”
               irony’s brevity in narrative terms.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I.</span></h2>
               <p>In the second part of “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” Paul de Man arrives at a “provisional
                  conclusion” (222) about the relation of allegory and irony. Describing the two as
                  “linked in their common discovery of a temporal predicament” (222), he suggests that
                  each of them demystifies a particular literary mode (symbolism in the case of allegory,
                  realism in the case of irony) that came to prominence in the nineteenth century by
                  seeming to hold out the promise that “fiction and reality could coincide” (222). Wary
                  of his own conclusion, however, insofar as he finds it “dangerously satisfying and
                  highly vulnerable to irony” (222), de Man remarks that it “rescues a coherent historical
                  picture at the expense of stated human incoherence” (222). His conclusion offers,
                  in others words, a historical narrative in which symbolism constitutes a regression
                  from the theoretical insights intrinsic to allegory just as realism regresses from
                  the negativity that characterizes irony. And it does so while asserting the “incoherence”
                  of our relation, as linguistic subjects, to the empirical world.</p>
               <p>But at this point something surprising happens; de Man insists on the possibility
                  of a literature exempt from such incoherence because exempt from irony's “endless
                  process that leads to no synthesis” (220), its “dizziness to the point of madness”
                  (215). Referring to Baudelaire’s “De l’essence du rire,” on which he relies in his
                  discussion of irony, de Man recalls that “Baudelaire speaks, without apparent irony,
                  of a semimythical poetic figure that would exist beyond the realm of irony” (223).
                  No sooner has de Man invoked this fictional or “semimythical” figure, however, than
                  he adduces its ostensible real world equivalents, referring to Hölderlin and Wordsworth,
                  along with Baudelaire, as if himself intent on making “fiction and reality coincide.”
                  But then again, he compares the poetry he identifies as “truly meta-ironical, as having
                  transcended irony,” and as “definitely non-ironic” (223) to what Baudelaire describes
                  as “la poésie pure, . . . limpide et profonde comme la nature” (223), a simile that
                  could seem to suggest the coincidence of nature and linguistic fiction too.</p>
               <p>Baudelaire, though, conjures this figure of a poet “beyond the realm of irony” only,
                  as de Man precisely phrases it, “without <em>apparent</em> irony” (223, emphasis mine), just as the clarity and depth of “pure poetry” is only
                  <em>comparable</em> to that of nature. However irreducible the distance between language and empirical
                  reality, however persistent the threat of an irony that might <em>not</em> be “apparent,” something about irony tempts de Man to envision “overcoming” (223)
                  it, and he proposes that these poets, in some of their writings, do so by means of
                  allegory. Since allegory and irony, as de Man makes clear, both demystify rhetorics
                  of presence and the coincidence of fiction and reality, the prospect of overcoming
                  irony by allegory must rest on their different relations to history, narrative, and
                  time. When de Man introduces Wordsworth’s poem, “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal,” for
                  a “brief comparison of the temporal structure of allegory and irony,” he chooses it
                  not only because the poem is “well known,” but also because it is “exceedingly brief”
                  (223). This double insistence on brevity in his engagement with a poem concerned with
                  time suggests that his brief against irony may have something to do with brevity too
                  and perhaps with the pedagogy of exemplarity that brevity often serves.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II.</span></h2>
               <p>Brevity, seen as the soul of wit, can make things easier to remember, thus enabling
                  them to endure, but it also can be seen as duration’s impossible dream of self-erasure,
                  its effort to collapse or minimalize the spatialization of time as distance. In that
                  sense, the simultaneity of events (as opposed to their sequential unfolding) would
                  constitute brevity’s absolute form, its purest realization.  But the difference that
                  duration articulates (in terms of what’s past, what’s passing, and what’s yet to come)
                  shapes simultaneity as well.  The reading of two or more events as occurring at the
                  same time demands their conceptual disentanglement, their interpretation as <em>separate</em> events, and thus introduces the distance that the act of reading depends on too,
                  inflecting with narrative duration the simultaneity that seems to refuse it. If reading
                  in this sense persistently translates simultaneity into sequence, into the narrative
                  performed by that reading’s unfolding, then such sequencing is also bound, though
                  blind, to what collapses it back on itself: the non-identity of knowing and doing
                  that makes reading simultaneous with misreading.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To call this an account of “The Rhetoric of Temporality” would confer on that essay
                     a coherence that, precisely to the extent that this reading is “true,” would have
                     to be seen as false. The essay, that is, in coming to a “knowledge” about the irony
                     that scuttles all knowledge-claims, however negative those claims may be, simultaneously
                     resists that knowledge by asserting it sequentially. This leads to a question at the
                     heart of the essay: does temporality reveal the “truth” of rhetoric or does rhetoric
                     produce fictions of temporality?  The genitive structure of the essay’s title, like
                     that of Keats’s “The Fall of Hyperion” as de Man discusses it in “The Resistance to
                     Theory,” condenses both possibilities. In a longer analysis this tension could be
                     approached by focusing on the figure of “history” in “The Rhetoric of Temporality.”
                     The first section of the essay concludes, after all, by proposing a “historical scheme”
                     (208) in which the Romantic discourse of symbolism attests to a regression from the
                     critical insight made available through the structure of allegory. But de Man begins
                     the second section by observing that irony cannot be approached through a similar
                     “historical de-mystification.” Though symbolism’s “mystification is a fact of history”
                     (211), irony, to the contrary, as de Man points out, often <em>targets</em> “the claim to speak about human matters as if they were facts of history” (211).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Carol Jacobs notes this movement as well in her brilliant essay, “Allegories of Reading
                              Paul de Man”: “The section entitled ‘Allegory and Symbol,’ as we have seen, tells
                              a historical tale that of a transition at the end of the eighteenth century from a
                              concept of allegory as the key rhetorical term to that of symbol. The section on irony
                              displays another narrative strategy, one that we will confront shortly” (113). Her
                              essay, like my own, explores de Man’s claims about temporality and language as his
                              work engages them in the process of conceptualizing allegory and irony and her essay
                              does so, …</span></div>
                     </div> Thus in the space of a mere three sentences de Man both affirms as a “fact of history”
                     the mystification effected by symbolism and pointedly calls attention to irony’s demystification
                     of historical fact. This leads to a moment that may tempt us to read it as an instance
                     of ironic self-consciousness when de Man writes, in magisterial but still playful
                     prose: “It is a historical fact that irony becomes increasingly conscious of itself
                     in the course of demonstrating the impossibility of our being historical” (211).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>We might well ask just what it would mean for irony to become “conscious of itself.”
                              This not only attributes consciousness to irony, but also supposes that irony possesses
                              a specificity, an essence, made “increasingly” evident to itself across time. </span></div>
                     </div>  But can irony ever “be conscious of itself”? What consciousness could irony, as a
                     mode, possess? Can we, moreover, with any certainty, be conscious of irony ourselves?
                     Irony may refer, instead, to a loss or lapse of consciousness. Thus if irony seems
                     to show itself here we cannot be sure of its target. Is the historical fact with which
                     the sentence begins undone in the end by irony, or does the irony lie in irony’s ultimate
                     historical determination? The copresence of such incompatible readings in an assertion
                     presented as “fact” may define de Man’s take on irony, but to define the result as
                     ironic immediately dismisses the copresence of what resists it.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To put this slightly differently: irony consists in the simultaneity of wisdom’s emergence
                     from error and of error’s persistence in the very belief that wisdom has been achieved.
                     In this way irony precipitates into a "temporal predicament" that allows for "no end,
                     for no totality" (222) insofar as it divides "the flow of temporal experience into
                     a past that is pure mystification and a future that remains harassed forever by a
                     relapse within the inauthentic" (222). Like irony, allegory too may approach what
                     de Man calls a "temporal void” (222), but it does so by mobilizing temporal relations
                     in which signs refer to earlier signs instead of enacting, as irony does, “an instantaneous
                     process that takes place rapidly, suddenly, in one single moment” (225).  "Always
                     implying an unreachable anteriority" (222), allegory, in de Man’s view, "designates
                     primarily a distance in relation to its own origins, and, renouncing the nostalgia
                     and the desire to coincide, it establishes its language in the void of this temporal
                     difference" (207). Thus allegory leads to a negative truth, understood as escape from
                     error, by treating signs historically, while irony exposes the error of thinking that
                     history could lead us to truth.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Although the anteriority associated with allegory may be unreachable for de Man, that
                              doesn’t stop him from tracing Rousseau’s allegorical depiction of Julie’s garden back
                              to Defoe, by way of Bunyan, and, on the basis of this, declaring with assurance that
                              La Nouvelle Héloïse renounces “the values associated with a cult of the moment, and
                              this renunciation establishes the priority of an allegorical over a symbolic diction”
                              (204). An ability to read the historicity of allegorical temporality thus assists
                              in avoiding what de Man describes as the “near-fatal relapse into former error” (201).</span></div>
                     </div>  This may clarify de Man’s assertion that “in speaking of irony we are dealing not
                     with the <em>history</em> of an error but with a problem that exists within the self” (211, emphasis mine);
                     in contra-distinction to allegory, irony deals with non-identity not as a relation
                     between <em>moments</em>, but rather as inherent in the self and therefore operative at <em>every</em> moment.</p>
               </div>
               <p>De Man’s representation of allegory as distance from “its own origins” coexists, nonetheless,
                  with his implicit identification of allegory <em>as</em> an origin. The first part of “The Rhetoric of Temporality” strives to correct “the
                  widespread ‘<span class="foreign">idées reçues</span>’ on the nature and the origins of European romanticism” (204) by proposing that allegory,
                  not symbolism, deserves recognition in such a context. Symbolism may follow allegory
                  in literary history, but it denotes a <em>critical</em> regression from the latter’s relentless <em>historical</em> regression, from allegory’s persistent orientation toward an "unreachable anteriority”
                  informing its linguistic signs.  Though expressive of a “negative self-knowledge”
                  (208) that bespeaks the temporal fate of the human, allegory gets figured by de Man,
                  nonetheless, as the “light,” the source of radiance, over which symbolism throws a
                  “veil” (208). Recalling Coleridge’s metaphor for symbolism, cited earlier in “The
                  Rhetoric of Temporality,” as “the translucence of the eternal through and in the temporal”
                  (192), de Man’s figural evocation of allegory similarly returns us to an originary
                  light, but one that exposes the <em>error</em> of viewing the symbol as itself participating in what it represents and that “prevents
                  the self from an illusory identification with the non-self, which is now [i.e., by
                  virtue of allegory] fully, though painfully, recognized as a non-self” (207). Fully
                  recognized? What can this possibly mean in a context where allegory continuously opens
                  new vistas of distance and difference? The fantasy of awakening from illusion so thoroughly
                  that everything pertaining to the non-self is “fully . . . recognized” as such, has
                  its corollary in the fantasy of a self that would coincide with itself completely
                  through complete separation from what it is not. Such a fantasy of allegorical awareness
                  perversely returns us to the “nostalgia and the desire to coincide” that allegory
                  supposedly renounces and it does so here in a prosopopeia (allegory’s “renunciation”
                  of desire) that gives human agency to a literary structure, showing just how hard
                  it is to differentiate self and non-self.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The truth of the distance between the two, like the truth of the difference between
                     the human and the natural world for de Man, can be recognized “fully” only at the
                     cost of being recognized “painfully.” Pain accompanies the knowledge of truth for
                     de Man as it informs the experience of respect for Kant.

                     true voice” (207), de Man asserts, associating allegory’s painful recognition (the
                     recognition, precisely, of the irreducible distance between the self and non-self,
                     between linguistic fiction and empirical reality) with his own demystification of
                     symbol. No sooner has he done so, however, than irony appears in his text: “it is
                     ironically revealing that this voice is so rarely recognized for what it really is”
                     (207). The allegory that “designates . . . distance,” though emphatically figured
                     by de Man here as presence, even originary presence (“the true voice,” “what it really
                     is”), has remained, to the moment of de Man’s essay, largely a presence concealed,
                     like the light beneath symbolism’s “veil.” If this veiling reveals a general truth
                     about the resistance to reading allegory, it does so only “ironically,” through the
                     very act of concealing it. Irony insists on this simultaneity of revelation and concealment,
                     but <em>recognizing</em> irony requires forgetting what that recognition veils: the impossibility of ever “fully”
                     recognizing the difference between self and non-self and the equal impossibility of
                     fully recognizing the presence or absence of irony. For irony, to put this another
                     way, never in fact reveals; the claim that it does so forgets that irony is only <em>ironically</em> revealing, only revealing of its own insistence, and even then without any certainty
                     that one can ever in fact “know” irony. In effect, by describing as “ironically revealing”
                     the failure to recognize allegory as Romanticism’s “true voice,” de Man turns irony <em>into</em> allegory.  He imposes the narrative structure of a movement from blindness to recognition,
                     from concealment to revelation, rather than dwelling in the unreadable coincidence
                     of irony’s insight and error, which is to say, its illegibility.   </p>

                  <p>In this context it makes a certain sense that when de Man proposes his “brief comparison”
                     of the temporalities of allegory and irony by engaging with Wordsworth’s “exceedingly
                     brief” “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal,” he boldly declares: “[t]he text clearly is
                     not ironic” (223).  But when he subsequently analyzes “the structure of irony” (225),
                     contrasting it with allegory’s “tendency . . . toward narrative . . . in order to
                     give duration” (225), he refers to what he calls Baudelaire’s “later, most ironic
                     works” (2225), works that “grow shorter and shorter and always climax in the single
                     brief moment of a final <span class="foreign">pointe</span>” (225-26). Brevity, the hallmark of irony’s movement toward the undoing of allegorical
                     duration, defines from the outset the poem in which irony, de Man argues, has been
                     “transcended” (223). But brevity serves as a switchpoint here between duration and
                     simultaneity, simultaneously expressing narrative extension and the movement toward
                     a “single brief moment” in which antagonistic possibilities “are simultaneously present,
                     juxtaposed within the same moment but as two irreconcilable and disjointed beings”
                     (226).

                     temporalities that the concept of brevity condenses, we might want to examine the
                     stake in de Man’s claim that Wordsworth’s “exceedingly brief” poem “<em>clearly</em> is not ironic” (emphasis mine).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>De Man commences his reading by pointing to the allegorical shape of its narrative:
                     its “successive description of two stages of consciousness, one belonging to the past
                     and mystified, the other to the <em>now</em> of the poem, the stage that has recovered from the mystification of a past now presented
                     as being in error” (224).  But this reading of the process of demystification from
                     stanza one to stanza two should not obscure the quite different terms in which Marc
                     Redfield evokes the poem. Introducing an issue of <em>The Wordsworth Circle</em> devoted to essays on Geoffrey Hartman, Redfield refers to Wordsworth’s “lightning-like
                     temporality” in which “something appears or disappears <em>at once</em>” and thereby produces a difference “at once momentous, a matter of life and death,
                     and yet strangely minimal, as hard to read as the difference between the first and
                     the second stanzas of ‘A Slumber did my Spirit Seal’” (6). De Man’s determination
                     that the brevity of the poem elaborates duration (rather than the “lightning-like
                     temporality” of irony)

                              rapidly, suddenly, in one single moment” (225), we see brevity invoked as a rapidity
                              that then collapses into the geometrical singularity of a point: a movement in the
                              opposite direction from his reading of brevity as a figure of duration that leads

                     even at the expense of denying the poem any irony whatsoever and maintaining that
                     this “difference has been spread out over a temporality . . . in which the conditions
                     of error and wisdom have become successive.  . . . The fundamental structure of allegory
                     reappears here in the tendency of language toward narrative, the spreading out along
                     the axis of an imaginary time in order to give duration to what is, in fact, simultaneous
                     within the subject” (225). By treating diachronically a difference inherent in the
                     self at every moment, the poem, as de Man construes it, allegorizes irony and overcomes
                     it. The narrator’s error in the first stanza, his submission to the “slumber” that
                     “seals” his “spirit,” gives way to “grim awareness” (224) in the second as the woman,
                     who first seemed incapable of feeling “the touch of earthly years," proves unable,
                     after the stanza break, to feel, see, or hear at all.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As persuasive as this allegorization may be, de Man cannot completely ignore the pressure
                  of irony in the poem, especially in lines three and four: “It could be said that,
                  read within the perspective of the entire poem, these two lines are ironic, though
                  they are not ironic in themselves or within the context of the first stanza. Nor is
                  the poem, as a whole, ironic. The stance of the speaker, who exists in the ‘now,’
                  is that of a subject whose insight is no longer in doubt and who is no longer vulnerable
                  to irony” (224). De Man then returns to his earlier phrasing to assert that “the poem
                  is written from the point of view of a unified self that fully recognizes a past condition
                  as one of error and stands in a present that, however painful, sees things as they
                  actually are” (224). This language repeats the central terms (“fully . . . recognized,”
                  “painfully,” “recognized for what it really is”) used earlier by de Man in his unveiling
                  of allegory as the “true voice” of early Romanticism. But de Man in that passage could
                  only unveil what was, in its very concealment, already “ironically revealing.” This
                  may suggest, however “unintentionally” (and however much at odds, therefore, with
                  the “full recognition” to which allegory is said to bring the supposedly “unified
                  self”), that such an unveiling, pace de Man, “reveals” the insistence of irony. How,
                  though, could one “reveal” irony without succumbing to the spatialization of time
                  as the movement from error to knowledge, as the difference between now and then, as
                  the clarifying logic of history (Wordsworth’s poem “<em>clearly</em> is not ironic,” de Man maintains)?</p>
               <p>De Man claims that the difference effected by the demystification the poem describes,
                  the transformation of the narrator’s stance from the first stanza (“first there was
                  error” [225]) to the second (“now an eternal insight” [225]), “does not exist within
                  the subject, which remains unique throughout” (225). That difference, instead, gets
                  displaced onto the temporal sequencing of the poem as such. In effect, the irony that
                  would divide the subject, that would signal a “radical discontinuity” (224) like that
                  of the death on which the poem turns, gets consigned, as does the death itself, to
                  the space between the two stanzas. The poem becomes a text “about” irony, then, much
                  as it becomes a text about death: that is, precisely by leaving it out. Or so de Man
                  seems to argue. The whole of his reading of Wordsworth’s poem returns (in imitation
                  of allegory) to the language his essay used earlier in explicating irony.  Focusing
                  on the subject’s altered understanding of the woman as a “thing that could not feel
                  / The touch of earthly years,” he writes that after the stanza break “[s]he now has
                  become a <em>thing</em> in the full sense of the word, not unlike Baudelaire’s falling man who became a thing
                  in the grip of gravity” (224). The falling man, the exemplary case of the encounter
                  with irony in “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” finds himself divided between the thing
                  that falls and the subject capable of seeing that fall as a fall into the knowledge
                  of his thingness. He gains access to an understanding of his difference from the world
                  through the language that lets him reflect on the world, and on himself, while dividing
                  him from both as well. This difference, therefore, characterizes the falling man himself,
                  splitting him into an empirical self, a thing among the many things in the world,
                  and a self that inhabits the fictions of language and is prone to the mystified faith
                  that this knowledge makes him superior to things as such.   </p>
               <p>This ironic division gives way to a “unified self” in “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal”
                  insofar as that division, according to de Man, gets externalized (which is also to
                  say, allegorized) in the movement of the woman from life to death, of the “thing”
                  from figural to literal, and of the first stanza’s retrospection to the second stanza’s
                  “eternal” present. In this way the woman, not the subject, “falls”; it is she who
                  enacts “the purely instrumental, reified character of [humanity’s] relationship to
                  nature” (214), to quote de Man’s earlier account of what the falling man must learn.
                  In displacing the fall onto the woman, however, and that phrasing should echo an ongoing
                  history of gender relations in the West, de Man succeeds in depicting the subject
                  as a “unified self” (224) that remains “unique” (225)—that is, singular and coherent—only
                  by imagining the subject of the poem as radically different from the ironist. Where
                  the latter is split “into an empirical self that exists in a state of inauthenticity
                  [i.e., that presumes its superiority to nature] and a self that exists only in the
                  form of a language that asserts the knowledge of this inauthenticity” (214), Wordsworth’s
                  subject inhabits “the ideal, self-created temporality of the poem” and <em>not</em> the “actual temporality of experience” (225) in the reading de Man proposes.  The
                  claim that the poem has transcended irony thus depends on the subject having escaped
                  the constraints of the “actual” or “empirical self.”</p>
               <p>But does Wordsworth’s subject really dwell in an “ideal . . . temporality” untouched
                  by that of “actual . . .  experience”? Is it really the voice of “eternal insight”?
                  The subject who refers to the moment of its error as when it “had no human fears,”
                  seems strangely unchanged when awakened from that error by the fact of the woman’s
                  death.  Indeed, the very “etern[ity]” of its “insight” repeats that exemption from
                  the human. Although de Man will attribute an emotional intensity to the subject’s
                  awakened consciousness—he refers to it as a “grim awareness” experienced, to some
                  degree, as “painful” (224)—the poem makes no such claim. The subject’s affect, like
                  the woman’s death, gets wholly left out of account in its eight lines; only through
                  inference or projection does it sound in the second stanza’s constative utterances.
                   On the one hand, this could confirm the subject’s removal from empirical reality,
                  from “the actual temporality of experience,” and so from the synchronic division of
                  the self by the reflexive experience of irony.  On the other hand, this lack of human
                  fear perpetuates the error, the “slumber,” whose overcoming de Man affirms, thus troubling
                  the subject’s association with a  “stance of wisdom” (224) and an “ideal . . . temporality”
                  (225). Through this optic, the subject’s “wisdom” can seem like a form of obtuseness
                  to its quasi-Shelleyan fall from one state of slumber to another: the sort of fall
                  that bespeaks the ironist’s division between an empirical self that lives in a state
                  of inauthenticity (expressed by the lack of “human fear” recollected in stanza one)
                  and the self who claims to know that inauthenticity but remains incapable of changing
                  it (expressed by the “stance of wisdom” adopted in stanza two).  The overcoming of
                  irony through allegory that de Man locates in the poem would thus reproduce the subject’s
                  implicit, and still mystified, suggestion that its spirit has fully awakened at last
                  from the slumber of mystification. In that sense nothing could be more ironic than
                  the claim (de Man’s and the subject’s both) that allegorization overcomes irony.</p>
               <p>Since de Man, however, refuses “to play [allegory and irony] off against each other”
                  (226), maintaining instead that both give us access to a negative experience of time,
                  why would he insist so emphatically on the absence of irony in the poem? Perhaps his
                  comment comparing the two to each other offers a clue: “The knowledge derived from
                  both modes is essentially the same” (226). This emphasis on “deriv[ing]” knowledge
                  already tips de Man’s hand; it reiterates the primacy of allegorical sequence, narrative,
                  and temporal duration at the expense of irony’s instantaneous explosion and rapid
                  fall.  The former comports with pedagogy; the latter makes it impossible. Allegory’s
                  pain thus expresses the knowledge derived through education while irony’s laughter
                  acknowledges the void to which knowledge as such remains blind. “The Rhetoric of Temporality,”
                  as a text devoted to “historical clarification” (188), undertakes to translate, from
                  its opening sentences, a fall the essay will associate with irony (“Since the advent,
                  in the course of the nineteenth century, of a subjectivistic critical vocabulary,
                  the traditional forms of rhetoric have fallen into direspute” [187]) into the sequential
                  movement of allegory (“It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that his was only
                  a temporary eclipse” [187]).  Critical pedagogy demands an investment in allegorical
                  temporality. Thus even when de Man refuses to see allegory or irony as “superior to
                  the other” (226), he must champion allegory’s duration over irony’s vanishing-point
                  of brevity in order to be able to “derive” such a knowledge in the first place. Even
                  the evenhandedness with which he evaluates allegory and irony in relation to their
                  access to wisdom and error leads him to a telling conclusion: “The dialectical play
                  between the two modes . . . make[s] up what is called literary history” (226). The
                  clash of allegorical and ironic temporalities, the synchronic coincidence of their
                  antagonism (a coincidence characteristic of both irony and dialectic), yields in the
                  end here to “history,” which is hardly a neutral category since it designates one
                  of the two modes in play. History, the very paradigm of allegorical temporality, tendentiously
                  gets positioned as the outcome of allegory’s dialectical relation to irony.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But never count irony out. When de Man nears the point of clinching his case for reading
                     “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal” as articulating the “ideal . . . temporality” of allegory
                     at the cost of the “actual temporality of experience”—at the cost, in other words,
                     of the empirical self’s subjection to error and accident—he writes the following sentences:
                     “The ‘now’ of the poem is not an actual now, but the ideal ‘now,’ the duration of
                     an acquired wisdom. The actual now, which is that of the moment of death, lies hidden
                     in the blank space between the two stanzas.”

                     featured in the text as originally published in <em>Interpretation: Theory and Practice</em>, edited by Charles Singleton in 1969, something else takes their place two years
                     later when de Man republishes “The Rhetoric of Temporality” in his own book, <em>Blindness and Insight</em>. Error and accident intervene. The text as republished now reads: “The ‘now” of the
                     poem is not an actual now, which is that of the moment of death, lies hidden in the
                     blank space between the two stanzas” (225). This syntactically unreadable sentence,
                     this unintentional anacoluthon, must surely derive from the copyist or typesetter’s
                     confusion of the two appearances of the same phrase, “actual now” (the first time
                     with “now” in quotation marks and the second time without them). By collapsing the
                     distance between the first and the second instance, the copyist or typesetter omitted
                     everything in between them, consigning the sense of the sentences to the void between
                     the two “now”s.

                              contained in a footnote to her essay, “Allegories of Reading Paul de Man”: “(The phrase
                              is inadvertently omitted in the reprinting of the essay)” (120). </span></div>
                     </div>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Yet this is the version of the sentence reprinted in the major teaching anthologies:
                  a version made unreadable by the fall of historical sequence, of allegorical temporality,
                  into the simultaneity that constitutes irony’s absolutization of brevity. Something
                  indeed “lies hidden” here, but what’s lost in this abbreviated sentence is not the
                  “moment of death” consigned to the space between the stanzas of Wordsworth’s poem,
                  but rather the “ideal ‘now’” in which de Man would situate the subject of that poem:
                  “the duration of an acquired wisdom” by means of which allegory would overcome irony.
                  If irony seems to have its revenge, though, when wisdom gets lost in the gap of a
                  syntax whose illegibility taunts the reader by collocating “death” with what “lies
                  hidden” between the two conflated “actual now”s (and what lies hidden here, consigned
                  to death, is “the duration of an acquired wisdom”), then we have to acknowledge that
                  to read this accident, this “error,” this way is to read it allegorically. Irony may
                  tend to reduce itself to the brevity of a single point, but allegory alone can make
                  the point about irony into a lesson. And it does so by displacing the antagonisms
                  condensed in irony’s single moment into the spacing of narrative, the sequence of
                  history that imposes the “duration of an acquired wisdom” at the very moment it enacts
                  the error that guarantees wisdom’s fall.</p>
               <p>All reading, all critical transmission, all pedagogy inhabits this allegorical temporality,
                  even in laying bare the irony that informs and undoes that structure. The mangled
                  sentence that students have read, teachers taught, and anthologies reprinted for more
                  than forty years may condense, in its own condensation, a vast array of unresolved
                  tensions: between the aspirations of pedagogy and the impossibility of reading, between
                  fantasies of knowing and performances of ignorance, between allegory’s imperative
                  and irony’s resistance, between brevity as narrative duration and brevity as simultaneity,
                  between history and theory, between ideality and accident, and even—why not?—between
                  life and death. But like the failure to recognize allegory as early Romanticism’s
                  “true voice,” de Man’s brief encounter with Wordsworth is also “ironically revealing.”
                  In brief, it is and is not ironic, much like Wordsworth’s poem. Which may (or may
                  not) explain why “The Rhetoric of Temporality” can say so only by way of saying something
                  else. That displacement, that temporal opening onto a continual “something else,”
                  marks the distance between irony’s brevity and the allegorization inherent in reading.
                  If de Man’s encounter with irony—by way of his encounter with Wordsworth’s poem—approaches
                  the limit of reading, the illegible simultaneity that his essay’s truncated sentences
                  enact, then perhaps it is “ironically revealing” that the limit should prove to be
                  one “he neither hears nor sees.” But then again, neither do we.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Carol Jacobs notes this movement as well in her brilliant essay, “Allegories of Reading
               Paul de Man”: “The section entitled ‘Allegory and Symbol,’ as we have seen, tells
               a historical tale that of a transition at the end of the eighteenth century from a
               concept of allegory as the key rhetorical term to that of symbol. The section on irony
               displays another narrative strategy, one that we will confront shortly” (113). Her
               essay, like my own, explores de Man’s claims about temporality and language as his
               work engages them in the process of conceptualizing allegory and irony and her essay
               does so, as does mine, by putting de Man’s claims about rhetoric in conversation with
               his own writing. Jacobs, however, argues that “as de Man’s irony becomes increasingly
               conscious of itself, it demonstrates the impossibility of being historical” (117).
               I suggest, to the contrary, that the pedagogical imperative in critical writing makes
               allegory <em>inevitable</em>. The very possibility of <em>recognizing</em> irony, let alone of its becoming “conscious of itself,” remains, in my reading, suspended.
               Jacobs, however, is canny enough to recognize this as well. She points to the possibility
               of reading the ironization of allegory as “an allegorization of sorts” (118) and writes
               that “the movement of the literary text is restated and repeated on an increasingly
               conscious level by the critical reading that must, no less than irony, fail to overcome
               the inauthenticity of its own language” (118). Even here, though, we see in this assertion
               of an “increasingly conscious level” of insight the (necessary) repetition of a faith
               in pedagogical possibilities. That faith, and its disturbance, are what my essay seeks
               to engage. It could not have done so, however, without Jacobs’s powerful example.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">We might well ask just what it would mean for irony to become “conscious of itself.”
               This not only attributes consciousness to irony, but also supposes that irony possesses
               a specificity, an essence, made “increasingly” evident to itself across time. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Although the anteriority associated with allegory may be unreachable for de Man, that
               doesn’t stop him from tracing Rousseau’s allegorical depiction of Julie’s garden back
               to Defoe, by way of Bunyan, and, on the basis of this, declaring with assurance that
               <em>La Nouvelle Héloïse</em> renounces “the values associated with a cult of the moment, and this renunciation
               establishes the priority of an allegorical over a symbolic diction” (204). An ability
               to read the historicity of allegorical temporality thus assists in avoiding what de
               Man describes as the “near-fatal relapse into former error” (201).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Carol Jacobs makes a wise observation in this regard: “But if the knowledge gained
               in the language of allegory is painful, the tale about that knowledge often appears
               remarkably satisfying” (116).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">By seeing these two beings as “juxtaposed,” de Man has already introduced the spatialization
               of allegorical distance that makes simultaneity legible at the expense of irony’s
               vertiginous madness. That recourse to the spatialization of time in order to be able
               to conceptualize the simultaneous pressure of antagonistic forces inheres in the critical
               endeavor as we see when Barbara Johnson traces the etymology of “critical” to the
               Greek “<span class="foreign">krinein</span>, to separate, choose” (ix).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">When de Man writes that “irony appears as an instantaneous process that takes place
               rapidly, suddenly, in one single moment” (225), we see brevity invoked as a rapidity
               that then collapses into the geometrical singularity of a point: a movement in the
               opposite direction from his reading of brevity as a figure of duration that leads
               to allegory’s performance of demystification.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
