               <h1><span class="head">Introduction: Too Much, Too Little: Of Brevity</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>In a brief search of the <em>English Poetry</em> database, the words “minimum” and “minimal” do not appear in the writings of some
               of the authors who we often associate with the period and concept of Romanticism.
               That almost insignificant fact, however, calls to mind a much larger series of matters
               that come to the fore as the clichés that serve as Romanticism’s most common and ponderous
               “others”: temporal and historical parameters of what Romanticism “was” and “is”; Romanticism’s
               theoretical suppleness and expansiveness; its <em>too muchness</em>, its affective expansiveness and rhetorical disruptions; its “uncontainable” and
               effusive structures; its slippery ambivalence as a term that either says too much
               or too little about the limits of historical thought; its putatively close engagements
               with vitality, “life,” creativity, infinity; and its ongoingness as a conceptual marker
               of modernity, refusing to bury a past that inscribes present temporalities through
               and through. Think of T.E. Hulme, for whom Romanticism posits “that man, the individual,
               is an infinite reservoir of possibilities; and if you can so rearrange society by
               the destruction of oppressive order then these possibilities will have a chance and
               you will get Progress” (57). One cannot, then, be too brief about what Romanticism
               seemingly aspires to, and the commitments it often hopes to maximize.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And yet, as if rescinding Hulme’s terms in a poem that otherwise seems concerned with
                  countering industrialization with pastoral self-expansion, William Wordsworth’s sonnet,
                  “The World is Too Much With Us,” considers the fine calibrations involved in deciding
                  what constitutes <em>too much</em> in the first place. If the world is one that is both “late and soon,/Getting and spending,”
                  (Wordsworth 1-2) it is one whose appropriative economies seek to reel in a world as
                  something that is decidedly subject to representation and capture—one that is coercively <em>with us</em>. At the same time, it is also a world that cannot quite be held by those economies
                  that criss-cross each other and seem to miss the very transitional object they cannot
                  nor are properly able to destroy and leave behind. 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                        <div class="l">…we lay waste our powers;</div>
                        <div class="l">Little we see in Nature that is ours;</div>
                        <div class="l">We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</div>

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> The little that is ours is seen, and the more that we don’t glimpse remains the blind
                  spot in nature that cannot be taken. There is a world that is not <em>this</em> world, neither transcendental nor immanent, but something considered otherwise in
                  its measurelessness. And strangely, Wordsworth’s critique of disenchantment and estrangement
                  ends up exposing us to the remains of <em>something</em> that we can neither have nor approximate. If the sonnet’s meter seemingly condenses
                  the speaker’s thoughts into a dynamic of evanescence and materialization, it is one
                  that is transitional, testing, and mildly reparative—it tries to understand how, if
                  there is too much of something with us, too little won’t do either.

            <p>What might Romantic minimality and brevity suggest as alternative additions to our
               critical vocabulary? How do they allow us to think differently—and briefly—about a
               constellation of questions and perspectives that throw into relief the necessity to
               think through the small, negligent, obscure, too little or too much, the ephemeral,
               the mere <em>there is</em>, the all but <em>not there</em>? The authors of the position papers collected for this issue were each asked to respond
               to just these kinds of prompts and to keep their arguments operatively brief. Conciseness
               and intensification in service of our theme of brevity and minimality was the order
               of the day. The space between stanzas, like the disappearance of a ruin into history,
               became equal considerations for reflecting on the brevity of things that the larger
               “life” of Romanticism cannot ever ignore.</p>
            <p>In a prosaic world otherwise tethered to the value of disclosure, unconcealment, publicity,
               and of making oneself heard, understood, and recognized, consider the small, unobtrusive,
               fugitive, minute, brief, cursory, and all but illegible sign or trace, the mark that
               could just as easily be over-looked as seen. What of the forms of life that do not
               merely endure but in fact <em>honor</em> inconspicuousness and, as Jacques Khalip argues, “anonymity”? Such barely perceivable
               indications and enunciations constitute what Anne-Lise François calls “open secrets,”
               i.e., “forms of uncounted experience and unremarkable virtue,” and all “those nonassertive
               ways of being in the world” for which the least demonstrative, expressive, or forthcoming
               is also a condition of utmost frankness because unapologetically free from the otherwise
               irresistible imperative either to withhold or present, to conceal a secret or speak
               the truth (60). Consider the ephemera that Samuel Taylor Coleridge conjures in “Frost
               at Midnight,” i.e., the shadowy figure or “stranger’s face” (41), whom he recalls
               as a child hoping would arrive at his classroom door, but doesn’t, as if a reverse
               image of the unknown visitor who rings the door-bell in Ionesco’s play, yet cannot
               wait to be received. Through the eyes of the child, the poet looks for a salvific
               sign, but what he sees is notable for its barely solicitous substancelessness. Coleridge
               glances at a glance that never was. An immaterial mediation of a fleeting memory of
               an encounter that failed to take place—an <em>un</em>missed encounter, so to speak—seems deliberately to flirt with the limits of what
               one can be made to feel or read as significant. Here there is no breathing of trauma
               that enlarges the psychic deep time of Romantic modernity. Rather, Coleridge queerly
               finds “companionship” with something that must be looked at precisely because it suggests
               nothing at all: he is queerly drawn to a filmy apparition that approaches in the mode
               of its own fading, taking pleasure not in a memory but in the eddies of anxious interiority
               that it leaves in its tremulously minimal wake.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this is what it means to tarry with what Emmanuel Levinas calls the trace,
               “the movement that already carries away the signification it brought” (70). What would
               it mean to follow such a movement for its insignificance, for unraveling precisely
               the experiences it nominally would appear to host? Without “getting and spending,”
               might the trace be the barest mark (which is precisely <em>not</em> the barest life, not answerable, in the manner of the biopolitical, to the measure
               of life or to a certain normatively sacralizing conception of “life”) that affords
               interest in a world that is too much—too powerfully coercive, demanding of assent,
               contractual in its sensible and epistemological obligations? Such a line of thinking
               suggests modes for reading and writing that circle around just this kind of brevity
               and minimality. If we have come to think that Romanticism can and must endure as the
               site of <em>and</em> the arsenal for excavating the historical, then perhaps such a historicism endlessly
               believes in the repleteness or sustainability of the “Romantic” as bedrock for life.
               If historicism is excessive in its tarrying of the referent with the letter, might
               there be an interest in questioning the degree to which such work might be <em>too much</em>, or perhaps <em>too little</em> in its emphases? That we here face an indistinction of exactly opposed weightings
               suggests that weighting is the problem and that tarrying with an indifference to weighing—weightlessness—offers
               a way to address that problem. Might “history” indicate a desire to cover over another
               kind of desire, one that often operates in Romanticism as an interest in Coleridge’s
               film as that which is never precisely here and not here, too small or too large, unfindable
               and fascinating in its absence? As we came to realize, the minimal itself is hard
               to pin down.</p>
            <p>Let us offer a working (workless?) definition, or eight ways of looking at minimality:
               </p>
            <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Min´imum</span>, n. (pl. <em>-ima</em>), &amp; a.</p>
            <ol>
               <li class="item" id="d30e294">–Scarcity, austerity, dearth, penury, shortness of supply, “learning” to live within
                  one’s means or compelled to live with less . . . and then <em>more</em> of much less (re: the radical diminution of the “the Leech-Gatherer”): all keywords
                  in the seemingly self-evident logics of accumulation and dispossession that play out
                  in different ways in Malthus, Hegel, and Marx and that normatively organize life along
                  the phantasmatic axis of minimal primitive “needs” and unlimited surplus “wants.”
                  Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century economisms give life to a powerful double anthropological
                  illusion that privileges the concept of a simple origin in the least: the “man” of
                  sheer needs who is never more essentially human than in this condition of naked life.
                  The creature without <em>wants</em> wants nothing and wants for nothing . . . or so the story goes. As the youthful speaker
                  of Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper” says, "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's
                  bare, / You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair” (7-8). Bravely eschewing
                  or cruelly denied surplus, ornament, or opulence, and thus imagined to be immune to
                  the propertied vicissitudes of time and circumstance, the mirage of the subject who
                  is resolutely independent from wants is compelled to be both scarcely human <em>and</em> the most human. This is not the only place in Romanticism where the minimum and the
                  maximum incoherently meet. In the figures of the discharged soldier, the blind beggar,
                  the bereft widow, the child slave, the dream of the destitution of a life untarnished
                  by luxury flickers troublingly between scandal and nobility. Or one thinks of the
                  hero-waifs of Dickens’s novels, who, through some dark magic, remain sentimentally
                  attractive—to a moneyed class of readers—because they are enduringly human amid unendurable
                  poverty. In conflating bare life with natural life, capital thereby becomes an apology
                  for impoverishment, both notional and real. As Simon Jarvis demonstrates, no Romantic
                  thinker makes the maddening destructiveness of this ideologically saturated anthropology
                  more legible than Wordsworth. For Jarvis, the tale told by the weeping man in “The
                  Last of the Flock” is exemplary in this regard. Our incredulity seems initially to
                  be directed at a fellow whose narrative of austerity muddles wants and needs, but
                  his inconsolable tears point readers elsewhere, towards the derangement of a culture
                  that not only requires the destitution of others but also dares to call that deprivation
                  salutary, a teachable moment. What is the lesson that Wordsworth’s mad and bereft
                  shepherd knows in his bones to be a pacifying and defeatist lie? A “core of essential
                  humanness remains unshakeable by all misfortune” (Jarvis 87).</li>

                     <p>On the far horizon of “weightless claims to attention” (François 3) lies the zero-degree
                        semiosis of what Walter Benjamin, reading Hölderlin, calls <span class="foreign">die reine Sprache</span>, i.e., that which is purely or sheerly language, language so entirely divested of
                        its semantic function, so indifferent to the solicitousness with which we naturalize
                        language (compelling it to be human, indeed, the very sign of humanity) that it is
                        divested even of that divestiture (Benjamin 54).

                        </div> What remains of this subtraction and redaction, as Kevin McLaughlin argues, are “the
                        pieces” or “the bits of language” (66) that can, among other things, testify to the
                        barest of relations among texts <em>as</em> texts: the unused remainders of Thomas De Quincey’s <em>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</em> that knock senselessly about Charles Baudelaire’s <em>Artificial Paradises</em> is a case in point. The French poet’s “technique of amalgamation,” as McLaughlin
                        says, “imitates a dead spot, a pause, that comes between the two works” (66). <span style="font-weight:bold">Example: </span>In “Brief Encounter: de Man on Wordsworth, or The Irony of The Rhetoric of Temporality,”
                        Lee Edelman reminds us of the spatio-temporal adjacencies that force language to torque
                        between thought and unthought—quite literally the <em>between</em> as the hinge moment (or the blank space between the stanzas in “A slumber did my
                        spirit seal”) that doesn’t quite perform the change from one thing to another. “Brevity,”
                        Edelman remarks, “seen as the soul of wit, can make things easier to remember, thus
                        enabling them to endure, but it also can be seen as duration’s impossible dream of
                        self-erasure, its effort to collapse or minimalize the spatialization of time as distance.
                        In that sense, the simultaneity of events (as opposed to their sequential unfolding)
                        would constitute brevity’s absolute form, its purest realization.”</p>
                  </div> 
                  <p class="noCount">Wordsworth famously tarries with spots of time, which are their own genre of minimalia—the
                     lyric distillation of the life of things that punctuates the prose of the world. Against
                     those moments of the living present we might contrast the advent of the “dead spot,”
                     the insentient passing of difference <em>as</em> difference, and nothing more. This alteration and altercation of “live” and “dead”
                     spots brings to mind a memorable verse from Blake: “Los reads the Stars of Albion!
                     the Spectre reads the Voids / Between the Stars” (<em>Jerusalem</em> 36-7). A generation ago, Harold Bloom sketched out six revisionary ratios with which
                     to consider the varied forms that poetic intertextuality can take, but those ratios
                     feel positively baroque compared to the flat relationality or mere difference which
                     McLaughlin associates with the recursiveness and indistinction of what he calls “poetic
                     force” and “unforce.”</p>

                     into the objects of experience. In an often cited reflection on the judgments of taste,
                     for example, Kant dreams of aesthetes for whose impassive and non-acquisitive eyes
                     the sea is not as a source of food or transportation but merely that which appears,
                     meaning—if the meaning of saying “something means something” isn’t already saying
                     far too much in this instance—only its appearance and little else. The minimally cognizable
                     is, as Kant insists, the source of an uncommon pleasure that is also shared and shareable
                     by all rational creatures <em>as</em> rational creatures (153). (The conceptless concept of seeing next to nothing proves
                     to have remarkable staying power. Consider, for example, its important if unexpected
                     modulation in the work of Jean-Luc Marion, for whom seeing “saturated phenomenon”
                     means “letting appearances appear in such a way that they accomplish their own apparition,
                     so as to be received exactly as they give themselves” [7].)</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">But mere reflection is also strangely empty, comprehensible mostly in comparison to
                     what it is not, i.e., the “determinate, empirical, contentful knowledge of objects”
                     (Zuckert 1). Rodolphe Gasché points out that although in Kant “the adverb ‘merely’
                     (<em>bloss</em>) is not to be taken in a depreciatory sense,” (18) its repeated use betrays “the
                     difficulty of isolating, with the required purity, the realm to be delimited” (19).
                     At the point of mereness, the self-showing of an untrammelled purity is haunted by
                     fragility and a vulnerability to all that it has shunned, shed, and excluded. “Looking
                     at the stars forever”: so Rei Terada describes, recalling a strange moment of rapt
                     inattentiveness in Keats’s <em>Hyperion</em>, the almost unimaginable act of merely seeing—neutrally, endlessly (i.e., without
                     an end in sight), and inconsequentially. “Among Keats’s many instances of scanning,
                     survey, aversion, dreaming, aesthetic vision, partial blindness, and so on, I’m most
                     interested in his inclusion of looking that seems openly absorptive, yet withholds
                     its realization,” Terada notes: “<em>Hyperion</em> exhibits a kind of discretion about what might accompany looking at the stars whose
                     motive may be the inclusion of ‘nothing’” (278). Is reading—or a certain conception
                     of reading—the paradigmatic instance of this minimal looking without seeing, eyes
                     wide shut? <span style="font-weight:bold">Example:</span> in a reading of Horne Tooke’s <em>Diversions of Purley</em> alongside Shelley, William Keach focuses on rhetorical abbreviation and speed as
                     components of “Hymn to Mercury,” where the latter figure is endlessly rethought and
                     refigured as a trope for the brevity that enables poetic renewal and imagination.
                     Indeed, as Keach reminds us, to read is necessarily to expose oneself to mere language,
                     for example, to the sheer ordering of letters, phonemes, and words and to the spaces
                     between those pieces of language, i.e., to the minimal differences without which signs

                        us a candid glimpse of the very emergence of the image <em>as</em> image out of the chaos of the drawing hand. As Johannes Grave puts it, viewers <span class="quote">‘encounter strokes, lines, and flourishes about which it is impossible to decide whether
                           they function merely as hatching or are already the first suggestions of the emerging
                           contour of a representational form. The drawing, we quickly realize, does not just
                           depict the imagination’s independent activity during sleeping and dreaming, but is
                           also the place where it is carried out. (33)’</span> Yet Grave significantly underestimates the importance of the force of the minimum
                        in Goya’s sketch (and perhaps this is an occupational hazard for anyone exploring
                        the nature of the barely there) insofar as he recuperates what he sees as the incarnation
                        of the imagination at work. In doing so, he phenomenalizes the indeterminate differences
                        and inscriptions that capture the eye without knowing what to do with them. We find
                        ourselves looking not at the drawing <em>of</em> something—including, after Grave, the drawing of the process of drawing—but of something
                        more grossly indeterminate, something on the threshold of drawing but little else.
                        At the instant that we sense the infinite directions that Goya’s image <em>could</em> have taken, but finally did not, the wisdom of Jean-Luc Godard’s remark rings true:
                        “in the absence of the just image, there is just an image” (qtd. in Loshitzky 28).</p>

                        subtracted or divided: the remainder without remainder. A residuum that traverses
                        a curiously wide semantic field, from a pith or founding and grounding bedrock <em>to</em> something closer to the restive substancelessness and barely there to which the actual
                        remains eternally answerable. That the irreducible remainder can support such seemingly
                        contradictory significances reminds us that it is a figure of desire, the subject
                        of a potent dream of the inviolate origin that is itself inviolate: “Thus the desire
                        or the <em>phantasm</em> of the intact kernel is irreducible,” Jacques Derrida remarks, “–despite the fact
                        that <em>there is no</em> intact kernel” (115). The resistant <span class="foreign">reste</span> is that which is non-metabolized, the elementally <em>un-</em> or, to be more precise, <em>an-</em>economic remains that are both <em>un-</em>thought (not grasped in cognition) and un-<em>thought</em> (not-thinkable because the condition of thinking anything at all). The Romantic locus
                        classicus is undoubtedly F.W.J. Schelling’s masterwork, the <em>Freedom</em> essay: <span class="quote">‘After the eternal act of self-revelation, everything in the world is, as we see it
                           now, rule, order and form; but anarchy still lies in the ground, as if it could break

                           but rather as if initial anarchy had been brought to order. This is the incomprehensible

                        with which it threatens itself: if the unruly is the generative basis of this “world,”
                        then isn’t the “world” rather than the “irreducible remainder” also what merely remains–or,
                        at the very least, the remainder of the remainder in a chain of formings and unformings
                        without origin or end? At the very least, Schelling surprises us with the possibility
                        that, pared down to its bare foundations, the ground is as unknowable as it is shaky,
                        the scene of a pregnant indeterminacy that he captures by moving restlessly between

                        For Schelling—as for his rough contemporary, Blake—the narrative arc of the history
                        of the nature of things is not a fall from order into disorderliness but the reiterated
                        imposition of order on an unruliness that renders that order provisional, anxious,

What “it remembers and

                        ‘[w]ith rocks, and stones, and trees.’” The “here lies” seems to point to or mark,
                        without specifying, the taking place of something that then follows it, but what Speitz
                        implies is that the this marking might very well have a pathos all its own. What seems
                        left-over is in fact the origin’s trace of itself, haunting the known universe like

                     Rajan remarks, “a diasparactive part of a lost whole, or an intentional spark for
                     something yet to be worked out” (800). Coleridge could be said to condense both possibilities—the
                     burned trace <em>and</em> the slight augury—in the figure of “that fluttering stranger” (26), “the film, which
                     fluttered on the grate” (15) that we discussed earlier. Romanticism may teach us to
                     consider the fragmentary minimum as something otherwise than as a privation. Carol
                     Jacobs has powerfully taught us to think of a decidedly “uncontainable romanticism,”
                     or “an uncontrollable moving beyond all those parameters seemingly fixed within the
                     texts”; such a Romanticism moves by critically turning in upon itself, evolution positing
                     <em>something</em> only to unground each position in a recursive about-face, an involution of form and
                     meaning precisely at all processual turns (ix). Yet what is the materiality of this
                     species of Romanticism—uncontainable, uncontrollable, surplus, excessive, merely <em>more than what is given</em>? Might the force of such a Romanticism be the other side of something adynamic, not
                     even recognizable as a strength or force (or an unforce, as McLaughlin argues), but
                     a worklessness that neither moves nor returns to anything at all? <span style="font-weight:bold">Example</span>: in Karen Swann’s “<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2016.brevity.swann.html">Keats’s Mask</a>,” the material fragmentation of “Romantic capital” is phenomenalized in Keats’s life

                     of Romantic transmission but also a strangely recessive object whose historical shock
                     is unforced, pressureless—“the shocks of what cannot be assimilated into that project—the
                     arrested experience and its detonating posthumous life.” How does the mask circulate
                     in a non-processual “force,” at once symptom of and a grinding down to the impossible
                     nothingness of Romantic thought? Of Keats’s unfinished <em>Hyperion</em> poems, Balachandra Rajan writes: <span class="quote">‘The dignity of a fragment in a poetry of self-formation lies in its finding its place
                        in a process, in its being justified by its own extinction. It makes the truth instead

                     consequential case in point: consciousness’s pure, foundational, and immutable relation
                     to itself as the implied subject of all its representations. Transcendental apperception
                     involves no experience of an object because it is the <span class="foreign">a priori </span>condition of experiencing anything at all. It is not a state or condition but punctually

                     Derrida writes, “the relation that the being which we are, as questioning, maintains
                     with itself and with its own proper essence” (11). At the point of the minimum, we
                     appear to arrive at the singular, that which is something in particular and not something
