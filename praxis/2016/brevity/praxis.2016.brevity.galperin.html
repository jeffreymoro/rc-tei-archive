            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In a recent discussion of modernity as a discourse of empowerment, where the past
                  is presumed fixed and capable of yielding historical knowledge, Harry Harootunian
                  notes that in histories “devoted to reconstructing the past of a present” that is
                  putatively modern there is also (and paradoxically) no time for that present or for
                  the “minimal unity” (in his phrase) from which the modern might be ratified in its
                  break from what precedes it. That’s because “what distinguishes modernity,” according
                  to Harootunian, “is consciousness of time and how it relates to both past and present.
                  If all events are,” in some sense, “catastrophic,” he argues, “constantly destroying
                  the new landscape, it will not be time that successively carries away each now, each
                  present. Rather each present is empty, vacated of meaning at the moment it arrives”
                  (18). My interest here, then, is in the way writing of the Romantic period, despite
                  its subscription to a “self-accelerating temporality that,” in Reinhart Koselleck’s
                  description, “robs the present of the possibility of being experienced as the present”
                  (22) (as in “Can Spring be far behind?” or “something evermore about to be”), manages
                  also to make time for the present. And it does so not by monumentalizing the minimal
                  unit (in rendering it, say, a spot of time) but, following Harootunian’s claims, through
                  a dialectic of vacancy and occupancy. In instances ranging from “hinge moments” in
                  Austen and Keats to double-takes in Wordsworth, the minimal unit surrenders to time
                  but not at the expense of either the unit’s eventfulness as such or the vacancy or
                  pause that, thanks to its unitary quality, prevents this suddenly “[a]pprehendable
                  present” (Kosselleck 22) from simply escaping or being negated.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I am concerned broadly speaking here with a polarity bounded by Benjamin’s sense of
                           a recurrent present and de Man’s sense of recurrent loss or what, with specific reference
                           to figuration, he describes as an authentically temporal destiny” (“Rhetoric” 206).</span></div>
                  </div> It is the case rather that the minimal unit in Romanticism maintains the uneasy status
                  of being in time as well as out of it: both temporalized as a condition of occurring
                  and sufficiently freestanding to withstand incorporation to any narrative in which
                  the present would be captured by the future (Koselleck’s notion) in becoming anterior
                  and contained or, in the case of Shelley’s “Mont Blanc,” in bringing “vacancy” to
                  some larger account.</p>
            </div>
            <p>And so what I’m describing here are instances of “stopped time” where time doesn’t
               really stop but proceeds just enough for something monadic to occur as a pathway (or
               detour) to something else—some other timescape, some other world or stratum, some
               recessive consciousness—of which the minimal unit is an apprehendable trace. For Harootunian
               this other world is nothing less than culture or cultural practice itself or what,
               with special focus on Japan, he calls “history’s disquiet”: the commonness of tradition
               lived in the everyday where both history and time appear motionless (155). And while
               there are ways, certainly, that the minimal unit, as I construe it, performs a cognate
               function in Romantic-period writing in focalizing a state of being that is typically
               missed or overlooked or discounted, especially in the welter of modernity where “one’s
               own time” is just a heartbeat from becoming “what went before” (241), what I’m after
               here is less wieldy even as it is by definition bounded.</p>
            <p>But it is, first and foremost, <em>minimal</em>: constrained to a present that, for all its alterity in the long run (as I’ve been
               arguing), is irreducibly unitary and/or the same. We can take as an example of such
               a unit the “hinge moment” in Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em>, where the phrase “Emma could not forgive her”—this in reference to the heroine’s
               same-aged counterpart, Jane Fairfax—closes one chapter only to inaugurate the chapter
               that follows immediately. (Another example from this same novel, working to quite
               different ends, would be the largely depersonalized and strangely vacant view from
               Ford’s store, where “a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing, and can
               see nothing that does not answer” [183].) In his characteristically brilliant brief
               on the hinge moment, D. A. Miller notes that, however out of place this repetition
               might appear, particularly for a writer “whose sentences frame everything with elegant
               edges, . . . . it becomes clear that a shift, a change, has occurred in the time or
               space between” the first “Emma could not forgive her” and its reiteration. “What generates
               the first ‘Emma could not forgive her,’” he observes, is <span class="quote">‘Emma’s own affective consciousness, intimately accessed and ironically inflected
                  by its free indirect narrative performance. What generates the second ‘Emma could
                  not forgive her’ is pure narration, a detached consciousness to which Emma’s own has
                  ceased to contribute having been reduced to a little bit of information useful to
                  the plot. By virtue of repeating the same formula (truly magical), we move from free
                  indirect style—for all its irony, always grounded in an intimate identificatory relation
                  to the image of a person—to mere omniscient narration, more remote in its detachment,
                  and less <em>engagé</em> in its impersonality. (64-65)’</span> Or maybe, just maybe, it’s the other way around: that the repetition, far from registering
               some stylistic progress, figures—by and through its very infelicity—something monadic
               (again) that, to borrow Walter Benjamin’s formula, blasts the protagonist, or a consciousness
               to be precise, out of the homogenous course of both developmental narrative, where
               Emma will eventually learn forgiveness (among other things), and the equally appointed
               course of narrative performance, where by Miller’s lights the narrator and her erstwhile
               double eventually, inevitably, part company. What gives the reiteration force, in
               other words, or enough force to interrupt progress of all kinds in <em>Emma</em>, is not the difference or change that Miller marks (however brilliantly) but a sameness,
               alternately subliminal and of the surface, in which a little bit of information achieves
               both unitary status and an exemption in the process from the operations of time by
               which either information, or more generally a given present, is captured by narrative
               and thereby vacated.</p>
            <p>But there is also, it turns out, something surprisingly vacant about this unit or
               about the rabbit hole, in effect, to which it proves tantamount. In the build-up to
               it, in fact, we are forewarned that the problem with Jane or with “her” to be exact,
               which the unit at once formalizes and amplifies, is not just a problem with the novel’s
               heroine (who is inclined to think “too well of herself” and too badly of others) but
               a problem, more importantly, in and <em>with</em> the present in which the narrative, the narrator, and even Emma are ultimately bystanders:
               <span class="quote">‘Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley
                  had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman,
                  which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly
                  refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience
                  could not quite acquit her. But “she could never get acquainted with her: she did
                  not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference
                  whether she pleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she
                  was made such a fuss with by everybody!—and it had been always imagined that they
                  were to be so intimate—because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they
                  must be so fond of each other.” These were her reasons—she had no better. (130-31)’</span> It bears noting that the word “her” appears no fewer than eight times in this passage
               and that in one remarkable instance it is used in reference to the now-culpable and,
               dare I say it, unforgiveable protagonist “herself.” And while there is surely some
               collusion with the narrator in assigning moral authority to Mr. Knightley, who is
               briefly introjected by Emma as someone who knows best, the equally remarkable feature
               here involves the various rationalizations that Emma—with no guidance or assistance—dismisses
               on her own by putting in quotations. By the time of the minimal unit, in other words—and
               that time, once again, is the present—the “unforgiveable her” is really all that’s
               left: a misogyny that, beginning with Emma’s self-loathing and with the vacancy into
               which it gradually morphs (“These were her reasons—she had no better”), is seemingly
               beyond justification.</p>
            <p>To be sure, there are enough characters in this novel, from Mrs. Elton to the absent,
               equally odious, Mrs. Churchill, who bear a special onus in which both the narrative
               apparatus and the narrator, who does not scruple to distribute blame, conspire. But
               it is clear too that the acts of containment and judgment that the narrative performs
               in partnership with time fail on balance to forgive “her,” which is to say any woman.
               Miss Bates, who is a victim surely and deserving of sympathy, is only the most obvious
               instance of this unregulated hatred. But it takes just a moment’s reflection to recognize
               that misogyny is unregulated in <em>Emma</em> because it is omnipresent: the substance of a now-time (if you will) that, depending
               on one’s perspective, is either accessory to the narrative and its regulatory operations
               over time or the oxygen that the novel continually breathes and a stratum to which
               the minimal unit effectively drills down. This explains, better than anything, why
               Miller is so invested in dissolving the minimal unit in tracing its temporal progress
               from point A to point B. For the monadic alternative, where the novel makes time for
               the present and for the social catastrophe that is the present, also stops time in
               virtually the same way that a broken phonograph record (in Miller’s analogy) stops
               it: as an irritant or “malfunction” (63) where narrative vanishes and where culture,
               for want of a better term, takes hold.</p>
            <p>The minimal unit does not always work to such miserable, if revelatory, ends. But
               in opening onto something continually present, it operates as a formal antidote to
               the consolations of form whether as narrative or, in the case now of Keats’s “Ode
               to a Nightingale,” poetical argument, which is another kind of narrative. In the case
               of the “Ode,” the narrative/argument is embedded in the famous closing question— “Do
               I wake or sleep?” (80)—which, for all its mimetic force in capturing the speaker’s
               confusion and in breaking, thereby highlighting, a temporal continuum, lopsidedly
               pits the escapism that the speaker has been dallying with throughout against an immersion
               in nature and in time (again) that the poem both advocates and celebrates. And yet,
               in the hinge moment, where the poem turns irrevocably to the present (“forlorn. .
               . . Forlorn! The very word is like a bell / To toll me back from thee to my sole self!”
               [70-72]), something irrupts (or returns) that complicates the poem’s management of
               time and the homology more specifically of world and time that is Keats’s version
               of the fabled “marriage” of mind and nature. While it purports, as a formal artifact,
               to represent the movement of the speaker’s mind in a present that, like the environment
               before him, is ongoing, what the “Ode” stages—with an assist once more from the minimal
               unit as I’ve been describing it—is a disconnect, where in seeming to capture the present
               the poem does precisely that. Thus for all the poem’s subscription to immediacy, or
               to an engagement in real time, it is increasingly clear that what is presented here
               as process is not really process but a simulation in which virtually all that follows
               in the wake of “My heart aches” (1) is relegated to a teleology where the commitment
               to wakefulness is preordained and a paradoxically closed affair (like a poem). And
               it is the minimal unit, once more, the echoing, monadic, present demarcated by “forlorn,”
               that reopens things, vacating the “Ode” of its fiction in real-time or what is presented
               as a working through in time by tolling back, however counterintuitively, to the here
               and now and to the pain that, like the social catastrophe of Austen’s world, is always
               there and untethered.</p>
            <p>This has become a more melancholy demonstration than I had intended, so I’ll conclude
               on what I take to be a happier note: with the floral arrangement in Wordsworth’s Great
               Ode, which opens onto a materially glorious present that remains a steady, if at times
               invisible, accompaniment to the Ode’s progress, both in tracking developments in time
               and as an argument. Wordsworth, as we know, began writing what eventually became the
               “Intimations Ode” in 1802 only to suspend composition for two years upon completing
               the fourth stanza ending in the question “Whither is fled the visionary gleam / Where
               is it now, the glory and the dream?” As a goad to blockage, rather than the rhetorical
               question it became in the completed poem, where an answer of sorts is eventually provided,
               the question as it stood in 1802 is almost always viewed as an index of despair. But
               as the “meanest flower” in the poem’s last lines eventually confirms, this initial
               stoppage was an instance more properly of “stopped time,” where a present abides against
               artifice of all kinds, including the mythologies here of both loss and gain:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">While Earth herself is adorning,</div>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Refusing to leave the present, even as it shifts perspective, the 1802 stanza goes
               from a “now” marked briefly by participatory <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> (though we should pay attention to the enjambed flowers as well), to one that demonstrably
               slows, beginning with the Tree and then the field before stopping finally with the
               pansy. And while the pansy’s status as a <span class="foreign">pensée</span> or pathetic fallacy would appear to transport it to a world and time elsewhere, there
               is a palpable tension between the figment of mind, on the one hand, to which the environment
               is indeed “gone” in this stanza, and the “it” or materiality, on the other, to which,
               as species of the “now,” the “glory and the dream” (and I’m assuming the pansy) potentially
               belong in the same way that “is” substitutes for “has” in the first interrogative:
               “whither <em>is</em> fled the visionary gleam.” In making time for the present or, better still, a parallel
               present in a text seemingly consumed by mutability, Wordsworth not only reaches a
               stopping point of considerable note; he reaches, however unbeknownst, a solution to
               the dilemma that he will proceed, as we all know, to belabor.</p>
            <p>That this is not how Wordsworth immediately perceived things, at least in 1802, may
               be reckoned a windfall for literary history. However, just as the speaker is tolled
               back to the present and to the very beginning of “Ode to a Nightingale” amid that
               poem’s procession through what purports to be real time, so it devolves on the minimal
               unit of stopped time—the flower’s thing- or “it”-ness as broached in stanza 4 and
               focalized in the abbreviated question “is it now”—to perform a cognate function in
               disposing of the argument eventually summarized in the poem’s subtitle (“Intimations
               of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood”) and prosecuted in the remainder
               of the poem. The “meanest flower” that brings the Ode to a final stop, rather than
               to closure, in largely bypassing its argument for trickle-down immortality, is simply
               a less adorned—if properly cryptic—version of a present that was stumbled upon when
               the poem first stopped and subsequently elided in the life-course that the poem outlines
               in preparation for the notably weak transcendence it eventually offers. But it is
               in the poem’s most famous passage arguably—“Though nothing can bring back the hour
               / Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; / We will grieve not, rather
               find / Strength in what remains behind” (180-83)—that the vacancy created by this
               timescape and the quite different vacancy or <em>durée</em> that defines the minimal unit (and the floral thinking to which it gives rise) are
               properly juxtaposed.</p>
            <p>I have already suggested that the hour or interval of glorying in the flower is a
               now-time rather than a placeholder for what is past and no longer available. Thus
               even as he insists that “nothing can bring back the hour . . . of glory in the flower,”
               the speaker is literally tripped up from “behind”—both in the lines just cited where
               the interval of stopped time is acknowledged along with the flower marking its immediacy
               (“is it now?”), and in the “behind” on which so much still depends. Moving seamlessly
               from an argumentative referent—a past that is fixed and lost even as it remains a
               resource going forward (as the poem elaborates)—to one that is far less argumentative—specifically
               a residue <em>in and of</em> the present—the hinge-work that “behind” performs is not a pun of sorts where past
               and present (or behind and behind) are conjoined in intimations of immortality from
               recollections of early childhood, but a narrowing of “time” to something minimal (as
               in “There was a time”) to which the poem, amid its bombast, reverts. This something
               minimal, it turns out, has a contemporaneous analogue in the famous caesura or pause
               of which Hölderlin speaks (and that de Man later mobilizes in discussing him), where
               in “a reversal of tone as well as . . . time,” an “end” (Hölderlin is referring specifically
               to the Oedipus plays) reestablishes a contact with the beginning which it seemed to
               have lost (<em>Romanticism</em> 72). And in Wordsworth, with impending confirmation from the meanest flower and the
               peculiar (but hardly tragic) vacancy it occupies on reflection (thoughts that lie
               too deep for tears), “behind,” in disregard of <em>any</em> progress or mythology that the poem tracks, figures a “remainder” (in the poem’s
               own language) where only the present or, better, only <em>a present</em> prevails.</p>
