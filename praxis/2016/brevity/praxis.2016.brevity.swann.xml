      <head>Keats’s Mask</head>
      <p>Two books on Keats published in the past twenty years—Andrew Bennett’s
        <title level="m">Keats, Narrative and Audience</title> and Stanley
        Plumly’s <title level="m">Posthumous Keats</title>—reproduce on their covers images of the
        life mask of the poet taken by Benjamin Haydon in 1816. The images fascinate in part for
        their promise, before the advent of photography, to capture Keats as he was: the distinctive
        countenance, and, perhaps, even, the look of being lost to some other scene—a look that
        charges even the life mask with the pathos of a death to come, an effect enhanced in the
        Bennett cover reproduction by the strong light source that picks out the abstractedness of
        the form. Reflecting on nineteenth-century likenesses of Keats, Plumly prefers the masks and
        a small handful of contemporary sketches of the poet to any of the myriad oil portraits,
        modeled on these earlier images, executed posthumously: for Plumly, the more formal
        portraits, which often show Keats in the posture of the thinker, chin in hand, or amidst his
        books, are guilty of generalizing the singular person into the type of the Poet (23-55). But
        the mask of course affects a similar conversion. The portraits awkwardly perform their
        taxidermical commemorative work—restoring the poet to his social character and to his place
        in the National Gallery’s full set of British poets. The mask, in contrast—the withdrawn,
        abstracted image, tenuously descended from the singular body whose imprint it bears—presents
        the Poet as allegorical figure, a relic of a prematurely abbreviated life that survives into
        the present in denatured form, evoking a loss that can feel constitutive to Romanticism
        itself, but can also feel like <emph>our</emph> loss. </p>
      <p>The way biographical fascination perversely clings to the poet of “no self,” of “no
        identity” (<title level="m">KL</title> I, 387)—the poet whose force, at least since modernism,
        has been seen to derive from his resistance to and critique of lyric modes of
        self-investigation and disclosure can feel exasperating to Keats critics. Thomas Pfau, for
        instance, charges Keats’s readers, including professional Romanticists, of being “forever
        enthralled by Keats’s death at age twenty-six in Rome” (336). I want to propose, though,
        that the spell cast by the idea of Keats’s brevity is not easily broken because, more than
        taxidermical efforts to revive a lively, sociable, virile, political, or otherwise
        historically contextualized Keats, it is deeply responsive to the impersonal, allegorical
        style that his most exciting contemporary readers, from Marjorie Levinson to Jacques Khalip
        and Pfau himself, see as central to the poetry’s radical modernity. </p>
      <p>Keats’s mask brings this truth into focus, even and especially in its aspect as a
        technologically reproducible cultural form that circulates, exists as museum display,
        participates in projects of nation-building, and shores up cultural institutions, but that
        works by soliciting affective responses that can feel private, individual, ungeneralizable.
        The mask, like the abstracted image of the Poet as it emerges in Romanticism, bears the
        trace of the singular lost person. Suggesting the capacity of the withdrawn, formal image of
        the biographical subject to mobilize affects of pathos and loss, the mask suggestively binds
        the “sentimental” treatment of Keats’s death to contemporary accounts of his work that
        locate its distinctiveness in its refusals and critiques of the gestures of lyric
        subjectivity. In the remainder of this essay, I would like to turn to the materials of what
        Keats famously and evocatively called his “posthumous life”—that interval between a death
        sentence and death—to explore the ways in which they open us to modes of memory that belong
        neither to subjective experience nor to constructive projects of historiography or
        commemoration. Ultimately I want to suggest that these modes of memory bear the
        as-yet-undetonated possibilities of Romanticism into its future.</p>
      <p>In the letters Joseph Severn wrote from Rome to Keats’s friends, he frequently remarks on
        the avidity of Keats’s embrace of his posthumous existence, seeing this as symptomatic of a
        singular and poetic cast of mind: “Keats is desiring his death with dreadfull earnestness .
        . . The strangeness of his mind every day surprisses us—no one feeling or one notion like
        any other being” (<title level="m">KL</title> II, 373). Especially
        striking and frustrating to Severn is his friend’s refusal to invest in possibility: rather,
        as a space of withdrawal, the posthumous life promises to relieve the poet from the
        obligation to show promise, to care about answering to the hopes of others, to perform the
        strenuous work of the imagination. This is Severn again:
      <quote>he will not bear the idea of living much less strive to live . . . he will not hear that
        his prospects are favorable—he will not hear that his future prospects are favorable—he says
        that the continued stretch of his imagination has killed him—and were he to recover he could
        not write another line—then his good friends in England—he only cherishes the idea of what
        they have done and this he turns to a load of care for the future—the high hopes of him—his
        certain success—his experience he shakes his head at it all and bids it farewell— (<title level="m">JS</title> 116])</quote>
      Instead, Keats flies ahead to another shore, and from there lays claim to an insulated,
        virtual existence, a life of mere duration: in his own words, “I have an habitual feeling of
        my real life having passed, and that I am leading a posthumous existence” (<title level="m">KL</title> II, 359); “every man who can row his boat and walk and talk seems a different
        being from myself—I do not feel in the world” (II, 349). </p>
      <p>Severn’s reports and Keats’s own accounts suggest that for Keats, posthumous life promises
        a respite from the shocks that inevitably befall the one who possesses the negative
        capability to be in “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts”
        (<title level="m">KL</title> I, 193), especially as these pertain to the
        vagaries that shape the hopeful narratives of love, poetic composition, and career: to seize
        on one’s death sentence is to opt out of indeterminacy. Poetry, Keats seems to think, has
        been lethal to him; posthumous life promises to afford relief from the burden of promiscuous
        responsivity and the uncertainties of the paths it opens. Yet, paradoxically, in his
        posthumous life he suffers from an intensified version of the plight of the poetical
        character, whose lack of proper identity, he claims in his famous letter, makes him always
        vulnerable to annihilation. In that letter, Keats describes poetical speculation as a
        defense against the pressures of sociality, for when he is not filling and informing the
        bodies of “characters,” in a strange but characteristic hydraulic calculus, the identities
        of those around him flood him: “When I am in a room with People if I ever am free from
        speculating on creations of my own brain, then not myself goes home to myself: but the
        identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me that, I am in a very little time
        annihilated” (I, 387). In his posthumous life, a withdrawn Keats is morbidly and viscerally
        susceptible to the suffocating existences of others: “a person I am not quite used to
        entering the rooms half choaks me” (II, 314); “a person I am not quite used to causes an
        oppression in my chest” (II, 321); “Don’t breathe on me—it comes like Ice” (II, 378). The
        references suggest a hypersensitivity to the surprise advent of anything that threatens an
        embraced insularity, figured at first as the chance appearances of strangers, but as he
        becomes more ill, of all phenomenal traces of abjured social attachments. Thus he becomes
        preoccupied with controlling incursions into his world: he instructs people to limit their
        visits, and then, when visiting ceases, to limit their notes to bearable brevity, and
        finally, to the most minimal of indicators (“+” or “-” )(II, 352). Eventually all
        communication ceases except what is “framed” to Keats’s ear through Severn’s mediation, for
        Keats, all attest, cannot bear the “hand” or any material reminders of persons (“to see her
        handwriting would break my heart” [II, 351-2];“I cannot bear the sight of any hand writing
        of a friend I love as much as I do you” [II, 360]; “a letter to Keats now would almost kill
        him” [II, 363]).</p>
      <p>If the posthumous life promises an escape from poetry, it ultimately delimits a terrain
        that is allegorical and melancholic, “poetical” in some of the ways we have come to
        associate with Keats’s work since Levinson and Pfau. Walter Benjamin’s description in
        “Central Park” of the way allegorical intention works—“that which the allegorical intention
        has fixed upon is sundered from the customary contexts of life: it is at once shattered and
        preserved” (143)—at once evokes a distinctive Keatsian style that works by plundering from
        and restaging the preserved materials of antique worlds, and the landscape of Keats’s
        prematurely posthumous existence. Keats’s litany of protests suggests a keen sense, not of
        his coming death, but that he himself is a relic of a lost context, improbably lasting into
        this brief afterlife—the lone survivor of a vanished and mourned world, the traces of which,
        obtruding by chance into <emph>his</emph> world, activate scenes and sense
        information lodged in memory, ruptured from any trajectory of hope or desire. The world, in
        turn, possesses its own emptied, virtual existence as it withdraws: “I eternally see her
        figure eternally vanishing” (II, 345). Refusing the work of remembrance, he is attacked by
        figures of illimitable loss; aggressively withholding from others the chance of a gradual
        and negotiated letting go, he ensures his survival in the form of image and phrases that
        erupt into and shatter consciousness; giving up poetry, he sustains around him a charged
        poetic world.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">For an earlier
          reflection on these materials from which this draws, see Swann 1998.</note></p>
      <p>The experiences described in these materials suggestively follow the paths Benjamin, in the
        later “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” adumbrates for impressions that manage to get around
        what he calls the “shock defense,” the defensive work of consciousness to ward off
        potentially traumatic incursions of information about the world. On the one hand, Benjamin
        suggests, there is the “shock,” the force of stimuli that manage to slip through this guard;
        on the other, the psychically disruptive
        <emph>memoire involontaire</emph>, the reactivation of the
        trace left by the rogue stimulus, triggered, perhaps, by accident—the eating, say, of a
        particular kind of cake dunked in the tea your grandmother used to serve (172-6). In “On
        Some Motifs,” Benjamin characterizes modern subjectivity as perpetually armed and vigilant
        against the shocks of life under capital, shocks that like Wordsworth before him he connects
        in part to the density of modern social life, with its multiplied possibilities of chance
        encounters (181-92), and in part to the ascendency of communication technologies that work
        to alienate subjects from authentic personal or collective experience. In Benjamin’s
        account, mass-mediated communication functions to bifurcate the way information comes to us
        and is registered: on the one hand, there is the “information” circulated, say, by way of
        the news—information that enters public consciousness, and that aims less to be assimilated
        into private and collective life than to be noted and forgotten, as news item follows news
        item; on the other hand, there is experience that slips by consciousness to become lodged in
        dwindling reservoirs of private and collective memory that are increasingly cut off from
        public life (172-4). </p>
      <p>If Wordsworth sees the introspective lyric as having salutary power vis-à-vis the shocks of
        modernity by virtue of the way it draws private, unconscious experience into collective
        life, for Benjamin, the waning of the lyric during the nineteenth century suggests that, in
        its traditional Romantic (that is, “introspective”) form, it no longer speaks to modern
        experience. Baudelaire, whose work has steadily gained readership during this period, would
        seem to be an exception (170-2). This, Benjamin suggests, has to do with the paradoxical way
        Baudelaire meets the “shocks” of modernity: he is at once theatrically and constantly <emph>en garde</emph> against them, and persistently failing to intercept them. The
        essay suggests that Baudelaire’s hyper-vigilance is that of a collector and connoisseur of
        shock, and indeed, comes out of a poet’s feeling for the special predicament of his times:
        Baudelaire parries so vigorously because only impressions that are <emph>not</emph> absorbed by consciousness, and thus <emph>not</emph> accessible to a
        poetic project of recovery, can become the materials of true experience and of true poetry
        (170-81).</p>
      <p>Benjamin is specifically concerned here with the work of memory, citing Theodor Reik in
        this context: “The function of memory (<foreign>Gedächtnis</foreign>) . . . is to
        protect our impressions; reminiscence (<foreign>Erinnerung</foreign>) aims at their
        dissolution. Memory is essentially conservative: reminiscence, destructive” (175). In an age
        of information, Reik’s “reminiscence,” the conscious and thus potentially public act of
        remembrance, is of a piece with forgetting, the necessary, constant shedding of information
        as the next thing comes along. Given the divide between “consciousness” and “experience” for
        Benjamin, for an event to become present to consciousness is “to isolate events from the
        realm in which they could affect the experience of the reader” (173). What <emph>can</emph> affect the reader—affect the reader <emph>in the form of memory
            unregistered by consciousness</emph>—can only come in the form of a shock that slips through
        a guard, and the subsequent, accidental detonation of its trace in a way that ruptures the
        conscious, public narratives and contexts into which “information” becomes installed. The
        achievement of Baudelaire’s poetry it that it at once blocks access to experience (that is,
        prevents experience from becoming registered as “information”) and effects the detonation
        and transmission of experience beyond its encryption in a singular psyche. That is, as
        Jennifer Bajorek argues in a fine account of the shock effect, it works in the manner of
        Proust’s <emph>madeleine</emph> (114).</p>
      <p>Benjamin’s essay on Baudelaire, in which Baudelaire’s poetry becomes the way that true
        experience, that is, experience blocked from consciousness, can move into collective memory,
        helps us think about both the dynamics of Keats’s posthumous life and the “sentimental”
        effects that dog his reception. For we could argue that the materials of Keats’s posthumous
        life, if they lay the ground for his posthumous fame, do so by modeling and creating the
        conditions for belatedly detonating memory: the “strangeness of Keats’s mind,” legible in
        the protests of what he cannot “bear” to think of—the letters that must remain closed and
        out of view; the “hands,” the material traces of singular persons, that accidently slip past
        the guard; the detonating phrases and images from the past; and the avidly refused telos of
        hope realized, promise fulfilled—all suggest a mode of experience that is private and
        singular but not “subjective,” and that can be transmitted—through these nuggets of speech,
        often embedded in Severn’s letters, which are then circulated among the friends whose
        letters won’t be opened and whose “hands” won’t be born—as an unassimilable burden of
        sociality. And we could extend our account of the movement of these materials into
        collective memory when we consider the sharp and unpredictable effects of pathos and loss
        that Keats’s poetry has historically prompted in its readers—effects generated by shards of
        verse that can randomly and unpredictably revive the <emph>memoire
          involontaire</emph> of the materials of the posthumous life. </p>
      <p>Reading Keats is always reading between the biographical and literary remains, which came
        before the public simultaneously, first in the pirated Galignani edition of 1829 and then in
        the editions of Richard Monckton Milnes of 1848. When reading Keats, the allegorical style
        concatenates with the relics of the singular biographical subject. This concatenation
        produces figures laden with more affective weight than they can perhaps sustain: on the one
        hand, a poetic corpus open to unpredictable affections and attachments; on the other, an
        allegorical image of the Poet—remote, abstracted, prematurely arrested, not of the order of
        ordinary consciousness and quotidian life, singled out to bear and fail to bear the shocks
        of a market-driven print culture and modern social arrangements. This is “the Poet” as
        represented by Keats’s mask: an abstracted, denatured appearance that yet carries the
        imprint of a unique and ungraspable loss, in a form that can be reproduced and circulated.
        If ultimately and historically this figure has functioned to shore up Keats’s and
        Romanticism’s capital, it simultaneously transmits the shocks of what cannot be assimilated
        into that project—the arrested experience and its detonating posthumous life. </p>
