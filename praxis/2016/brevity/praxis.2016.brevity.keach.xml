        <p rend="noCount">This essay addresses Percy Shelley’s exploration of linguistic brevity as a temporal and spatial phenomenon. Beginning with
          Shelley’s rethinking of John Horne Tooke’s account of grammatical abbreviation and of the tropological and iconographic significance of the
          figure of the wingéd Hermes (Mercury), the essay also draws intertextual connections in Shelley’s poetry to Horace’s “Ars Poetica” and to
          the “Homeric Hymn to Hermes.”</p>

        <p>The word <emph>brevity</emph> appears to derive from a troping of spatial linearity towards the temporal. The earliest examples of Latin
            <emph>brevis</emph> refer to shortness of “length in its different directions of breadth, height, or depth”—even to the length “of a
          circle, as merely a line, and without reference to the space enclosed” (Lewis and Short). The transfer of these spatial senses to temporal
          phenomena gives <emph>brevity</emph> an inherent spatiotemporal motility at issue in a long series of questions provoked by the topic of
          this volume. Among these questions is this one: are all our representations of time dependent on vocabularies of space?<note xml:id="ftn1"
            place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">For a useful overview of recent philosophical debate on this issue, see Robin Le Poidevin, “The
            Experience and Perception of Time,” <title level="m">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</title> (Fall 2011 Edition). Web.</note>
          Linked to this is the recognition that the Latin <foreign>brevis</foreign> and the English <emph>brief</emph> acquired, from very early in
          their histories, distinctly discursive and rhetorical significance. Thus the question of <emph>brevity</emph> carries important and
          difficult implications for ongoing debates about the materiality of language.</p>
        <p>One obvious place to turn in thinking about romantic brevity is John Horne Tooke’s unfinished dialogic book about language, <title
            level="m">ÉPEA PTERÓENTA, or the Diversions of Purley</title>. Before I continue with Tooke, let me give a brief indication of where I’m
          headed. Shelley ordered <title level="m">The Diversions of Purley</title> from his bookseller in December 1812 (<title level="m">Letters of
            PBS</title> 2: 345), certainly read it, and in the unpublished text we’ve come to call <title level="m">Speculations on
            Metaphysics</title> dissents sharply from what he takes to be Tooke’s efforts to reduce metaphysics to a “science of words” (Clark 185).
          Nevertheless, Tooke’s main theoretical concerns, together with his deployment of the figure of Hermes/Mercury, play an oblique but
          significant role in Shelley’s writing. </p>
        <p>The key analytical concept in Tooke’s sometimes brilliant, sometimes erroneous, sensationalist version of universal grammar is
            <emph>abbreviation</emph>. The term designates a dynamic that is both structural and historical. It emerges in the opening chapter from
          two interlocking and post-Lockean principles: (1) “The first aim of Language was to <emph>communicate</emph> our thoughts; the second to do
          it [quickly], with <emph>dispatch</emph>”; (2) “many words are merely <emph>abbreviations</emph> employed for dispatch, and are the signs
          [not of things or of ideas, but] of other words” (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 14). The process of
            <emph>abbreviation</emph> involves the derivation of conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, and the syntagmatic constructs they make
          possible from nouns and verbs. The cognitive act that supplies the etymological information <emph>abbreviation</emph> elides is what Tooke
          calls <emph>subaudition</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">For Tooke and <emph>subaudition</emph>, see Roy Harris
            and Talbot Taylor, <title level="m">Landmarks in Linguistic Thought</title> (London: Routledge, 2013), vol. 1, 168-69.</note> He
          elaborates these principles playfully as well as ponderously—and here I want to turn directly to the frontispiece of <title level="m">The
            Diversions of Purley</title> and its connections to the dialogue in Chapter 1 between Tooke and his skeptical friend Richard Beadon. </p>
        <p>The engraved figure of a young Hermes seated on a block of stone in the act of either putting on or taking off his winged sandals was
          designed and executed by William Sharpe, a well-known specialist in line engraving and Tooke’s friend and radical political ally. In broad
          terms the visual subject is familiar within one of the traditional representations of Hermes. But Sharpe’s figure differs in suggestive
          detail from this tradition—from the ancient Roman copy of a Lysippan bronze, for instance, as well as from eighteenth- and
          nineteenth-century versions of the subject in the Louvre. Sharpe’s Hermes is younger, his body more relaxed, the expression on his face more
          enigmatic as he looks at one of his pairs of wings. The pyramids in the background must allude to the syncretic identification of Hermes
          with Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing, and thus to Hermes Trismegistus. The caption beneath the image is from Horace’s <title level="m"
            >Ars Poetica</title> 25-6: “dum brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio” [while I labor to be brief, I become obscure].<note xml:id="ftn3"
            place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">I have been unable to determine the textual basis for the conjunction “dum” at the beginning of this
            quotation. All eighteenth-century and present-day editions I have looked at begin the sentence in the middle of line 25 with “Brevis esse
            laboro.” This is in itself ironic—maybe ironically predictable—since conjunctions are among the parts of speech that Tooke is most
            concerned with.</note>The bearing of this quotation on Tooke’s analysis and on Shelley’s response to it is ironic. On the one hand, as
          Zachary Sng argues, “[the] principle of dispatch and its faithful servant, abbreviation, turn out to be curiously opposed . . . to [the] aim
          of communication.” Brevity often produces obscurity. On the other hand, Sng observes, while the “way of error was thus shown by the god
          Hermes, . . . the way out of it is revealed by the same deity” (59-60). To this insight we may add that Horace’s words in Tooke’s
          frontispiece syntactically and prosodically perform the brevity, and not the obscurity, they refer to.</p>
        <p>In the Chapter 1 dialogue it is Tooke’s interlocutor Beadon who initiates an indirect commentary on the frontispiece by complaining that
          “you have . . . no[t] a single word to unfold to us by what means you suppose Hermes has blinded Philosophy” (<title level="m">Diversion of
            Purley</title> 1: 24). Tooke responds by elaborating the metaphor of “the vehicle of our thoughts,” on his way to declaring that
            “<emph>Abbreviations</emph> are the <emph>wheels</emph> of language, the <emph>wings</emph> of Mercury” (<title level="m">Diversions of
            Purley</title> 1. 25). It’s especially the “<emph>wings</emph>” that make evident why Tooke used the Homeric formula <emph>épea
            pteróenta</emph> (winged words) as his title. <quote>B.— . . . You mean to say that the errors of Grammarians have arisen from supposing
            all words to be <emph>immediately</emph> either the signs of things or the signs of ideas; whereas in fact many words are merely
              <emph>abbreviations</emph> employed for dispatch, and are the signs of other words. And that these are the artificial wings of Mercury,
            by means of which the Argus eyes of philosophy have been cheated.<lb/> H.—It is my meaning.<lb/> B.—Well. . . . Proceed, and strip him of
            his wings. They seem easy enough to be taken off: for it strikes me now . . . that they are indeed put on in a peculiar manner, and do
            not, like those of other winged deities, make a part of his body. You have only to loose the strings from his feet, and take off his cap.
            Come—Let us see what sort of figure he will make without them. (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 26-7)</quote> What
          interests me here is the connection between Tooke’s demystifying method and the visual:verbal figure of Hermes, whose mythologized bodily
          identity is made entirely dependent on a non-essential supplement. This supplement—the artificial vehicular wings—is represented in a way
          that disrupts both the conventional eighteenth-century image of language as the clothing or veiling of thought and the transcendental image
          of language as embodiment or incarnation. We might (somewhat tendentiously) call the analytical method that emerges from Tooke’s figure of
          Hermes a hermeneutics of abbreviation.</p>
        <p>Hermes’ winged sandals are Tooke’s figure for abbreviation-as-speed, for a discursive brevity understood not primarily as conciseness or
          compactness (as in the lines from Horace) but as sheer rapidity, quickness, “dispatch” (the Lockean term he uses repeatedly, with its
          implications of communication and of elimination). Speed may of course produce brevity—but it doesn’t do so necessarily: Shelley’s
          evocations of speed sometimes go on for a long time, for long stretches of verse. For Tooke, abbreviation is not a discursive phenomenon of
            <foreign>parole</foreign> subject to the agency of particular speakers or writers; it is an aspect of <foreign>langue</foreign> as
          historically evolved system. Tookian brevity is primarily a matter of syntactical grammar and only secondarily a function of phonetic or
          graphemic duration. </p>
        <p>There is, however, a persistent problem with Tooke’s conviction that “the <emph>composition</emph> of <emph>ideas</emph>” is “merely a
          contrivance of Language” (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> 1: 37) —or as Hans Aarsleff summarizes it, “that the operations of
          mind are really operations of language” (51). And this problem has specifically to do with abbreviation-as-speed. The development of thought
          is identical with the development of language—and yet, Tooke says, the speed of the former will always exceed the speed of the latter: 
        <quote> Words have been called <emph>winged</emph>; and they well deserve that name, when their abbreviations are compared with the progress which
          speech could make without these inventions; but, compared with the rapidity of thought, they have not the smallest claim to that title.
          Philosophers have calculated the difference of velocity between sound and light: but who will attempt to calculate the difference between
          speech and thought! What wonder then that the invention of all ages should have been upon the stretch to add such wings to their
          conversation as might enable it, if possible, to keep pace in some measure with their minds. (<title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title>
          1: 28-9) </quote>
        Language retains an otherness to thought here that, by implication, must have to do with what Saussure refers to as “the linearity of the
            signifer,”<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">The “linear character of the signal” is the second principle in Saussure’s
            chapter on the “Nature of the linguistic sign” (<title level="m">Course in General Linguistics</title>, 69-71). Roy Harris’s
              discussion of this principle in <title level="m">Reading Saussure</title> (55 ff., 69 ff., 124 ff.) is particularly
            helpful.</note> which persists in differentiating language as discursive system from the mental life it makes possible and otherwise
          constitutes. </p>
        <p>Shelley’s reading of Tooke would have foregrounded this problem, I suspect, and would have led him to understand abbreviation-as-speed
          rhetorically as well as grammatically. Language is “arbitrarily produced by the Imagination and has relation to thoughts alone,” Shelley
          writes in the <title level="m">Defence</title> (<title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> 513), and yet in British Romanticism’s
          best-known paradigm of inspirational and compositional brevity, “when composition begins, inspiration is already on the decline” (531). As a
          consequence, poetry must continually renew and reawaken the metaphoricity of language as a counterforce against its deteriorating into a
          system of “signs for portions or classes of thoughts” that is “dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse” (<title level="m"
            >Defence</title> 512). “[T]he copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar,” Shelley insists, “. . .are merely the
          catalogue and the form” of language that remains “vitally metaphorical.” Shelley’s attraction to swiftness, rapidity, and quickness might be
          read, then, as a rhetorical rewriting of Tooke’s grammatical abbreviation-as-speed. Where Tooke in his way disfigures Hermes to isolate the
          function of his wings, Shelley may be said to refigure the ties of these “artificial” wings to Hermes’ mythographic body. </p>
        <p>Such refiguration is at work in Shelley’s translation of the Homeric “Hymn to Mercury” (1820), parts of which read as an allegorizing of
            <foreign>poieisis</foreign>, including lyric temporality, in its Hermetic and Apollonian modes.<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot"
            resp="editors" n="5">See Kahan 147: “. . . through a turn away from the text, [Shelley’s] translation provides the formalization of a
              historic moment in Greek history when <foreign>techne</foreign>, as work primarily productive of an object, becomes
                <emph>praxis</emph>, work primarily defining a subject, and when the demiurge, not yet strictly artisan, is still thaumaturge as
              well.” </note> Rhetorically the poem capriciously (in some moments maliciously) narrates and dramatizes the first day of
          Mercury/Hermes’ life: twice he says explicitly (in English as in Greek) “I was born yesterday” (ll. 363, 497). Much of the poem depends on
          an extreme and comic durational abbreviation for which we might adapt Mieke Bal’s term “temporal foreshortening” (144). On his way to
          stealing Apollo’s cattle, the un-infant Mercury comes across a tortoise, “Moving his feet in a deliberate measure” (l. 30) and is instantly
          inspired to an act of gruesome creative violence. With a chisel “He bore[s] the life and soul out of the beast” (50) and turns its shell
          into the sounding-board of the world’s first lyre. Shelley makes this scene of lyric origination a moment of fiercely sadistic
          “dispatch”:
        <quote><lg>
        <l> Not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal</l>
        <l rendition="#indent1"> Darts through the tumult of a human breast</l>
        <l> Which thronging cares annoy,—not swifter wheel</l>
        <l rendition="#indent1"> The flashes of its torture and unrest</l>
        <l> Out of the dizzy eyes—than Maia’s son</l>
        <l> All that he did devise hath featly done. (ll. 51-6)</l></lg></quote>
       In his book on Shelley and translation, Timothy Webb observes that the “image of the wheel with its flashing spokes does not occur in the
          [Greek] original” (Webb 99). But the wheel image does occur in connection with the figure of Hermes’ speed in Tooke’s <title level="m">The
            Diversions of Purley</title> where, as we’ve seen, it instantly gives way to wings as a metaphor for the speed of grammatical
          abbreviation. In Shelley’s translation, via a negative simile, Hermes/Mercury fashions the artifact of lyric <foreign>energeia</foreign> by
          transmuting slowness into swiftness in a flash of perverse brevity.</p>
        <p>Shelley’s allegory of sonic intensity and duration turns towards a mercurial materiality of the letter in Mercury’s confrontation with
          Apollo over the theft of his cattle. To escape detection Mercury mysteriously makes his own and the cattles’ prints in the sand turn
          backwards, “So that the tracks which seemed before, were aft” (l. 98; Shelley is translating the phrase <foreign>íchni apostrépsas</foreign>
          in l. 76 of the Greek text). He then discards his (already winged?) sandals and substitutes for them sandals improvised out of tamarisk
          leaves that further obscure his footprints. The figure of linguistic signs as footprints is recurrent in Shelley and carries both
          inscriptive and tropological implications. In the “Hymn to Mercury” the image is comically played out when Apollo hauls Mercury before Jove
          and complains of (among other things) “the double kind of footsteps strange”:
        <quote><lg><l>
          <emph>His</emph> steps were most incomprehensible—</l>
        <l> I know not how I can describe in words</l>
        <l> Those tracks . . . (ll. 457-59)</l></lg></quote>
        The entire confrontation is framed by Mercury’s invention of the lyre and brought to a close by his passing on to Apollo an instrument
          imbued with mercurial rapidity, exploitation, and deception as well as with the potential of sublime pathos. </p>
        <p>Apollo is eventually undeceived by Mercury’s cryptic traces. But he has come to be indebted to Mercury’s artificial gift of lyric
            <foreign>energeia</foreign>—a quick, opportunistic performative brevity that exploits thought’s vexed interdependence with its material
          articulations. As Apollo launches into a concluding encomium of the “little contriving Wight” (l. 585), he is represented as doing so in
          Mercury’s own terms: “His words were wingèd with his swift delight” (l. 581).<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="editors" n="6">Near the
            end of her article Kahan argues that Mercury/Hermes, despite the appearance of compromise, ultimately wins: “. . . the kind of <foreign>to
              poiein</foreign> Shelley has in mind bears affinities to Hermes’ <foreign>poieisis</foreign> rather than to Apollo’s . . . Hermes, the
            Chthonian to Apollo’s Olympian, has . . . privileged access to magical powers and his utterance is accordingly marked by its transgressive
            ability to subdue rational argument” (168).</note> With the concluding exchange of lyre and caduceus, though, we may be left wondering
          about the terms on which mercurial/hermaic brevity can survive its normalizing Apollonian appropriation.</p>
