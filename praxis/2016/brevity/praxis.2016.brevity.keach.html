            <p>This essay addresses Percy Shelley’s exploration of linguistic brevity as a temporal
               and spatial phenomenon. Beginning with Shelley’s rethinking of John Horne Tooke’s
               account of grammatical abbreviation and of the tropological and iconographic significance
               of the figure of the wingéd Hermes (Mercury), the essay also draws intertextual connections
               in Shelley’s poetry to Horace’s “Ars Poetica” and to the “Homeric Hymn to Hermes.”</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The word <em>brevity</em> appears to derive from a troping of spatial linearity towards the temporal. The earliest
                  examples of Latin <em>brevis</em> refer to shortness of “length in its different directions of breadth, height, or depth”—even
                  to the length “of a circle, as merely a line, and without reference to the space enclosed”
                  (Lewis and Short). The transfer of these spatial senses to temporal phenomena gives <em>brevity</em> an inherent spatiotemporal motility at issue in a long series of questions provoked
                  by the topic of this volume. Among these questions is this one: are all our representations
                  of time dependent on vocabularies of space?

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a useful overview of recent philosophical debate on this issue, see Robin Le Poidevin,
                           “The Experience and Perception of Time,” The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall
                           2011 Edition). Web.</span></div>
                  </div> Linked to this is the recognition that the Latin <span class="foreign">brevis</span> and the English <em>brief</em> acquired, from very early in their histories, distinctly discursive and rhetorical
                  significance. Thus the question of <em>brevity</em> carries important and difficult implications for ongoing debates about the materiality
                  of language.</p>
            </div>
            <p>One obvious place to turn in thinking about romantic brevity is John Horne Tooke’s
               unfinished dialogic book about language, <em>ÉPEA PTERÓENTA, or the Diversions of Purley</em>. Before I continue with Tooke, let me give a brief indication of where I’m headed.
               Shelley ordered <em>The Diversions of Purley</em> from his bookseller in December 1812 (<em>Letters of PBS</em> 2: 345), certainly read it, and in the unpublished text we’ve come to call <em>Speculations on Metaphysics</em> dissents sharply from what he takes to be Tooke’s efforts to reduce metaphysics to
               a “science of words” (Clark 185). Nevertheless, Tooke’s main theoretical concerns,
               together with his deployment of the figure of Hermes/Mercury, play an oblique but
               significant role in Shelley’s writing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The key analytical concept in Tooke’s sometimes brilliant, sometimes erroneous, sensationalist
                  version of universal grammar is <em>abbreviation</em>. The term designates a dynamic that is both structural and historical. It emerges
                  in the opening chapter from two interlocking and post-Lockean principles: (1) “The
                  first aim of Language was to <em>communicate</em> our thoughts; the second to do it [quickly], with <em>dispatch</em>”; (2) “many words are merely <em>abbreviations</em> employed for dispatch, and are the signs [not of things or of ideas, but] of other
                  words” (<em>Diversions of Purley</em> 1: 14). The process of <em>abbreviation</em> involves the derivation of conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, and the syntagmatic
                  constructs they make possible from nouns and verbs. The cognitive act that supplies
                  the etymological information <em>abbreviation</em> elides is what Tooke calls <em>subaudition</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Tooke and subaudition, see Roy Harris and Talbot Taylor, Landmarks in Linguistic
                           Thought (London: Routledge, 2013), vol. 1, 168-69.</span></div>
                  </div> He elaborates these principles playfully as well as ponderously—and here I want to
                  turn directly to the frontispiece of <em>The Diversions of Purley</em> and its connections to the dialogue in Chapter 1 between Tooke and his skeptical friend
                  Richard Beadon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The engraved figure of a young Hermes seated on a block of stone in the act of either
                  putting on or taking off his winged sandals was designed and executed by William Sharpe,
                  a well-known specialist in line engraving and Tooke’s friend and radical political
                  ally. In broad terms the visual subject is familiar within one of the traditional
                  representations of Hermes. But Sharpe’s figure differs in suggestive detail from this
                  tradition—from the ancient Roman copy of a Lysippan bronze, for instance, as well
                  as from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century versions of the subject in the Louvre.
                  Sharpe’s Hermes is younger, his body more relaxed, the expression on his face more
                  enigmatic as he looks at one of his pairs of wings. The pyramids in the background
                  must allude to the syncretic identification of Hermes with Thoth, the Egyptian god
                  of writing, and thus to Hermes Trismegistus. The caption beneath the image is from
                  Horace’s <em>Ars Poetica</em> 25-6: “dum brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio” [while I labor to be brief, I become
                  obscure].
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I have been unable to determine the textual basis for the conjunction “dum” at the
                           beginning of this quotation. All eighteenth-century and present-day editions I have
                           looked at begin the sentence in the middle of line 25 with “Brevis esse laboro.” This
                           is in itself ironic—maybe ironically predictable—since conjunctions are among the
                           parts of speech that Tooke is most concerned with.</span></div>
                  </div>The bearing of this quotation on Tooke’s analysis and on Shelley’s response to it
                  is ironic. On the one hand, as Zachary Sng argues, “[the] principle of dispatch and
                  its faithful servant, abbreviation, turn out to be curiously opposed . . . to [the]
                  aim of communication.” Brevity often produces obscurity. On the other hand, Sng observes,
                  while the “way of error was thus shown by the god Hermes, . . . the way out of it
                  is revealed by the same deity” (59-60). To this insight we may add that Horace’s words
                  in Tooke’s frontispiece syntactically and prosodically perform the brevity, and not
                  the obscurity, they refer to.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the Chapter 1 dialogue it is Tooke’s interlocutor Beadon who initiates an indirect
               commentary on the frontispiece by complaining that “you have . . . no[t] a single
               word to unfold to us by what means you suppose Hermes has blinded Philosophy” (<em>Diversion of Purley</em> 1: 24). Tooke responds by elaborating the metaphor of “the vehicle of our thoughts,”
               on his way to declaring that “<em>Abbreviations</em> are the <em>wheels</em> of language, the <em>wings</em> of Mercury” (<em>Diversions of Purley</em> 1. 25). It’s especially the “<em>wings</em>” that make evident why Tooke used the Homeric formula <em>épea pteróenta</em> (winged words) as his title. </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">B.— . . . You mean to say that the errors of Grammarians have arisen from supposing
               all words to be <em>immediately</em> either the signs of things or the signs of ideas; whereas in fact many words are
               merely <em>abbreviations</em> employed for dispatch, and are the signs of other words. And that these are the artificial
               wings of Mercury, by means of which the Argus eyes of philosophy have been cheated.<br/> H.—It is my meaning.<br/> B.—Well. . . . Proceed, and strip him of his wings. They seem easy enough to be taken
               off: for it strikes me now . . . that they are indeed put on in a peculiar manner,
               and do not, like those of other winged deities, make a part of his body. You have
               only to loose the strings from his feet, and take off his cap. Come—Let us see what
               sort of figure he will make without them. (<em>Diversions of Purley</em> 1: 26-7)</blockquote>
            <p> What interests me here is the connection between Tooke’s demystifying method and
               the visual:verbal figure of Hermes, whose mythologized bodily identity is made entirely
               dependent on a non-essential supplement. This supplement—the artificial vehicular
               wings—is represented in a way that disrupts both the conventional eighteenth-century
               image of language as the clothing or veiling of thought and the transcendental image
               of language as embodiment or incarnation. We might (somewhat tendentiously) call the
               analytical method that emerges from Tooke’s figure of Hermes a hermeneutics of abbreviation.</p>
            <p>Hermes’ winged sandals are Tooke’s figure for abbreviation-as-speed, for a discursive
               brevity understood not primarily as conciseness or compactness (as in the lines from
               Horace) but as sheer rapidity, quickness, “dispatch” (the Lockean term he uses repeatedly,
               with its implications of communication and of elimination). Speed may of course produce
               brevity—but it doesn’t do so necessarily: Shelley’s evocations of speed sometimes
               go on for a long time, for long stretches of verse. For Tooke, abbreviation is not
               a discursive phenomenon of <span class="foreign">parole</span> subject to the agency of particular speakers or writers; it is an aspect of <span class="foreign">langue</span> as historically evolved system. Tookian brevity is primarily a matter of syntactical
               grammar and only secondarily a function of phonetic or graphemic duration.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is, however, a persistent problem with Tooke’s conviction that “the <em>composition</em> of <em>ideas</em>” is “merely a contrivance of Language” (<em>Diversions of Purley</em> 1: 37) —or as Hans Aarsleff summarizes it, “that the operations of mind are really
                  operations of language” (51). And this problem has specifically to do with abbreviation-as-speed.
                  The development of thought is identical with the development of language—and yet,
                  Tooke says, the speed of the former will always exceed the speed of the latter: <span class="quote">‘Words have been called <em>winged</em>; and they well deserve that name, when their abbreviations are compared with the
                     progress which speech could make without these inventions; but, compared with the
                     rapidity of thought, they have not the smallest claim to that title. Philosophers
                     have calculated the difference of velocity between sound and light: but who will attempt
                     to calculate the difference between speech and thought! What wonder then that the
                     invention of all ages should have been upon the stretch to add such wings to their
                     conversation as might enable it, if possible, to keep pace in some measure with their
                     minds. (<em>Diversions of Purley</em> 1: 28-9)’</span> Language retains an otherness to thought here that, by implication, must have to do
                  with what Saussure refers to as “the linearity of the signifer,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The “linear character of the signal” is the second principle in Saussure’s chapter
                           on the “Nature of the linguistic sign” (Course in General Linguistics, 69-71). Roy
                           Harris’s discussion of this principle in Reading Saussure (55 ff., 69 ff., 124 ff.)
                           is particularly helpful.</span></div>
                  </div> which persists in differentiating language as discursive system from the mental life
                  it makes possible and otherwise constitutes.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Shelley’s reading of Tooke would have foregrounded this problem, I suspect, and would
               have led him to understand abbreviation-as-speed rhetorically as well as grammatically.
               Language is “arbitrarily produced by the Imagination and has relation to thoughts
               alone,” Shelley writes in the <em>Defence</em> (<em>Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</em> 513), and yet in British Romanticism’s best-known paradigm of inspirational and compositional
               brevity, “when composition begins, inspiration is already on the decline” (531). As
               a consequence, poetry must continually renew and reawaken the metaphoricity of language
               as a counterforce against its deteriorating into a system of “signs for portions or
               classes of thoughts” that is “dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse”
               (<em>Defence</em> 512). “[T]he copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar,” Shelley
               insists, “. . .are merely the catalogue and the form” of language that remains “vitally
               metaphorical.” Shelley’s attraction to swiftness, rapidity, and quickness might be
               read, then, as a rhetorical rewriting of Tooke’s grammatical abbreviation-as-speed.
               Where Tooke in his way disfigures Hermes to isolate the function of his wings, Shelley
               may be said to refigure the ties of these “artificial” wings to Hermes’ mythographic
               body.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Such refiguration is at work in Shelley’s translation of the Homeric “Hymn to Mercury”
                  (1820), parts of which read as an allegorizing of <span class="foreign">poieisis</span>, including lyric temporality, in its Hermetic and Apollonian modes.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           the formalization of a historic moment in Greek history when techne, as work primarily
                           productive of an object, becomes praxis, work primarily defining a subject, and when
                           the demiurge, not yet strictly artisan, is still thaumaturge as well.”</span></div>
                  </div> Rhetorically the poem capriciously (in some moments maliciously) narrates and dramatizes
                  the first day of Mercury/Hermes’ life: twice he says explicitly (in English as in
                  Greek) “I was born yesterday” (ll. 363, 497). Much of the poem depends on an extreme
                  and comic durational abbreviation for which we might adapt Mieke Bal’s term “temporal
                  foreshortening” (144). On his way to stealing Apollo’s cattle, the un-infant Mercury
                  comes across a tortoise, “Moving his feet in a deliberate measure” (l. 30) and is
                  instantly inspired to an act of gruesome creative violence. With a chisel “He bore[s]
                  the life and soul out of the beast” (50) and turns its shell into the sounding-board
                  of the world’s first lyre. Shelley makes this scene of lyric origination a moment
                  of fiercely sadistic “dispatch”:

                  wheel with its flashing spokes does not occur in the [Greek] original” (Webb 99).
                  But the wheel image does occur in connection with the figure of Hermes’ speed in Tooke’s <em>The Diversions of Purley</em> where, as we’ve seen, it instantly gives way to wings as a metaphor for the speed
                  of grammatical abbreviation. In Shelley’s translation, via a negative simile, Hermes/Mercury
                  fashions the artifact of lyric <span class="foreign">energeia</span> by transmuting slowness into swiftness in a flash of perverse brevity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Shelley’s allegory of sonic intensity and duration turns towards a mercurial materiality
               of the letter in Mercury’s confrontation with Apollo over the theft of his cattle.
               To escape detection Mercury mysteriously makes his own and the cattles’ prints in
               the sand turn backwards, “So that the tracks which seemed before, were aft” (l. 98;
               Shelley is translating the phrase <span class="foreign">íchni apostrépsas</span> in l. 76 of the Greek text). He then discards his (already winged?) sandals and substitutes
               for them sandals improvised out of tamarisk leaves that further obscure his footprints.
               The figure of linguistic signs as footprints is recurrent in Shelley and carries both
               inscriptive and tropological implications. In the “Hymn to Mercury” the image is comically
               played out when Apollo hauls Mercury before Jove and complains of (among other things)
               “the double kind of footsteps strange”: </p>

            <p> The entire confrontation is framed by Mercury’s invention of the lyre and brought
               to a close by his passing on to Apollo an instrument imbued with mercurial rapidity,
               exploitation, and deception as well as with the potential of sublime pathos.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Apollo is eventually undeceived by Mercury’s cryptic traces. But he has come to be
                  indebted to Mercury’s artificial gift of lyric <span class="foreign">energeia</span>—a quick, opportunistic performative brevity that exploits thought’s vexed interdependence
                  with its material articulations. As Apollo launches into a concluding encomium of
                  the “little contriving Wight” (l. 585), he is represented as doing so in Mercury’s
                  own terms: “His words were wingèd with his swift delight” (l. 581).
