            </header>
            <p>I offer the phenomenon of “points” experienced in Georgian London patent theater as
               an example of brevity presenting itself as a central concern of Romantic thought and
               culture. “Points” are those avowed highpoints in theater entertainment when the audience
               breaks into applause, shouts, tears, or displays other signs of transport in response
               to a significant moment of acting on stage. They are highly anticipated in that they
               are both electrifying and expected, and are said both to transport audience members
               out of themselves and, more than any other aspect of the evening’s entertainment,
               guarantee their return another day. Points often coincide with textual highpoints
               which, by virtue of their being enacted, are heightened but also surpassed in becoming
               a point, whose power resides in its multi-sensorial and multi-mediated nature. As
               the <em>OED</em> states, a point is “a gesture, vocal inflection, or some other piece of theatrical
               technique used to underline a climactic moment in a speech, role, or situation; a
               moment so underlined” and cites as its first instance on 4 October 1822 this sentence
               in a letter written by the famous comic actor Charles Mathews: “I don’t know an instance
               of a point failing which I considered to be really good myself” (“Point”).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The date given is curious, since the phenomenon and term existed more than a century
                  earlier, even if its precise usage is difficult to stabilize and seems to move on
                  a continuum from tableau to show-stopper. Usually points are ascribed to the transformative
                  acting style of David Garrick, but Joseph Roach spots them in the “phenomenal success”
                  in 1708-09 of Cavaliere Nicolini Grimaldi, whose “mastery of physical expression”
                  inhered in his capacity to “stand motionless for a moment in an exceptionally expressive
                  pose,” an “attitude” that he held “until he had made his <em>point</em>” (69).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> But the <em>OED</em> definition is useful for my inquiry in characterizing a point both as a moment underlined
                  and as a growing concern to commentators on Romantic-era theater. It continues: “frequently
                  derogatory, suggesting a histrionic or exaggerated style, or with the implication
                  that the integrity of the performance as a whole is being subordinated to the desire
                  for immediate applause.” These derogatory implications have carried the day. The phenomenon
                  itself has died out as a desired feature of a legitimate theater experience, and the
                  histrionic and anti-poetic aspects of points capture in a nutshell why Romantic-era
                  drama and theater were neglected as valid aesthetic objects until the 1980s. Those
                  days have passed, leaving us to reconsider afresh what points tell us about aesthetic
                  moments as experienced in the theater of this era. Taken out from under the weight
                  of a Romantic ideology in criticism that still sidelines theatrical analyses of reality
                  in general discussions of Romantic thought and culture, my focus on points considers
                  how this “moment so underlined” in theater affects period discussions of transformation,
                  both psychic and socio-cultural.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Probably the two most famous examples of a point, in terms of their immediate and
                  lasting effectiveness, are David Garrick’s Hamlet first encountering the ghost of
                  his father and Sarah Siddons’s Lady Macbeth in the sleep-walking scene. Descriptions
                  of both highlight the basic constituents: (1) “painting” a passion “to the life” through
                  the (2) skillful integration of the actor’s body / language as measured by (3) the
                  rapturous responses of audience members. These descriptions also underscore the fundamental
                  paradox that makes theater so difficult to integrate into discussions of more exclusively
                  print-based types of literature: turning the ephemeral into a lasting impression.
                  In the case of these two points, the fame of their enactors was not only solidified
                  through them but also guaranteed repeated descriptions of them, often graphically
                  depicted—in biographies, memoirs of theater, and acting manuals. For example, Georg
                  Christoph Lichtenberg’s famous account of Garrick’s Hamlet enlists a host of words
                  to portray the body’s expressiveness and became a “stock in trade of German school
                  anthologies”: “Garrick turns sharply and at the same moment staggers back two or three
                  paces with his knees giving way under him; his hat falls to the ground, and both his
                  arms, especially the left, are stretched out nearly to their full length, with the
                  hands as high as his head, the right arm more bent and the hand lower, and the fingers
                  apart; his mouth is open: thus he stands rooted to the spot, with legs apart[.] .
                  . . His whole demeanor is so expressive of terror that it made my flesh creep even
                  before he began to speak” (8). Such descriptions highlight the intense cross-fertilization
                  (even chicken-egg circularity) of acting and painting in the eighteenth-century, as
                  the growing popularity of portraits and engravings of actors depict them in point
                  and as physiognomic depictions of individual passions are taken from acting and devoted
                  to training new actors and rhetoricians.

                  </div> Garrick is said to be the first to capitalize in his acting on its evocation of painting,
                  and Siddons’s fame resides not only in being perceived as statuesque but also serving
                  as the model in the first anatomically-informed manual of physiognomy.

                           Siddons in it. One of Siddons’s most famous points is the statue scene in The Winter’s

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Depictions of Siddons’s sleep-walking scene portray the extremes to which audience
                  transport can go but are no less exemplary in foregrounding that a point is realized—i.e.,
                  recognized as one—through responsiveness to it. On the occasion of her retiring from
                  the stage (29 June 1812), her enactment of this scene literally ended the performance,
                  “a nobly artistic audience insist[ing] that the curtain should there fall, so that
                  the last grand impression might not be disturbed”—a rare instance in the period of
                  a play being terminated as a sign of enthusiasm rather than protest (Baker 307). The
                  fame attributed to Siddons’s enactment relates to her striking innovation of setting
                  down the taper before engaging in hand-washing, a marked departure from Hannah Pritchard’s
                  interpretation of Lady Macbeth, which Siddons took on against the advice and pleas
                  of manager Thomas Sheridan (Campbell 186-87). This example underlines the epoch-marking
                  function of points, whereby audience reception determines whether an aspiring actor
                  can be said now to “own” the role, and where ownership inheres in fidelity to the
                  points more than to the role altogether. Fidelity is not faithful imitation but a
                  delicate balancing of novelty and expectation, where the most well-worn parts of a
                  play appear suddenly novel.

                           (Public Advertiser, 11 January 1786).</span></div>
                  </div> This means, too, that a successful point is co-created by actor and audience members.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To the extent that they have remained visible as a desirable theatrical phenomenon
               in the Romantic era, then, points work to signify the artistry of individual actors
               and apprehension of the naturalness of their depictions of the passions through sight
               and visual culture. Though viewed as capable of threatening poetry, connection to
               artistry generally keeps points high. My interest is how their co-created nature becomes
               more leveling and more transporting once we re-evaluate the linkage between sensationalism
               and lower-class or juvenile tastes. The two most prominent features of a point—perception
               of the exquisite body / language of an actor and the transport occasioned by it—already
               suggest the coordination of what is often figured as an opposition between dramatic
               and theatric flow. That is, both the sign and immediate consequence of an actor’s
               captivation of audience attention is an outbreak in shouts, claps, tears, or stunned
               silence that interrupts the flow of the action. Press accounts note these outbreaks
               and sometimes assess the timing of them with varying degrees of approval but rarely
               with the implication that such disruptions are in themselves negative or that they
               damage the capacity to re-engage plot, poetry, or action for those so inclined. In
               this respect, points reinforce what recent scholars of late-Georgian patent theaters
               claim about audience psychology. Theater-goers were not expecting an artistically
               integrated experience nor were they seeking a unified emotional experience, given
               that, over the course of an evening, “a company may put forth nearly the full range
               of genres, from five-act tragedies and comedies to comic operas, farces, re-enactments
               of current events, and musical romances” (xv). Proof by contrast is found in the transcribed
               lament of actors performing on the same evening as Siddons “that farces that used
               to raise mirth in an audience after a tragedy now fail of that effect from Mrs. Siddons
               having so absolutely depressed their spirits that the best comic actors cannot dispel
               the gloom” (Baker 237).</p>
            <p>Judith Pascoe’s inspired construction of <em>The Sarah Siddons Audio File</em> portrays points as peak experiences that strengthen connections between playgoers’
               memories and pleasures. Characterizing points as the “condensation of the romantic
               theatrical experience to a collection of emotionally, visually, or sonically intense
               scenes,” she notes how “audience members anticipated these particular moments, watched
               them play out, and compared them to versions they had already experienced or even
               enacted themselves” (72). Her emphasis on the “imprinting” of plays on the memory
               is fostered, I would argue, by two aspects of the condensation that points embody,
               both of which feature audiences as active. One involves distillation, points reducing
               the length, variety, and tedium of a play to a series of highlights, each intensified
               by this focalization. Points understood as peaks both require a sense of the whole
               and acquire a life of their own, this switch-word phenomenon being part of their efficacy.
               In their integrative function, points manifest the interdependence of text, speech,
               body, and mind; they relate part to whole in the multiple senses (role, body part,
               speaking part, part-object) on which theater draws and through the multiple senses
               that theatergoing activates. Moreover, these readings of mind-body integration also
               often are literal reading experiences, playtexts brought to and sold in the theaters
               so that spectators can read along, coordinating written to spoken and embodied word.
               The “Advertisement” prefatory to the first volume of [John] <em>Bell’s Edition of Shakespeare’s Plays as they are now performed at the Theatres Royal
                  in London </em>notes that, because “the THEATRES, especially of late, have been generally right in
               their omissions” of offensive scenes and passages in Shakespeare’s plays, “we have
               printed our <em>text</em> after their regulation” so that “those who took books to the theatre will not be
               so puzzled themselves to accompany the speaker; nor so apt to condemn performers for
               being imperfect, when they pass over what is designedly omitted” (11). At the same
               time, distillation makes points detachable and highly portable, key to their longevity
               and status as a negative disruption of drama. As play part-objects, points break free
               from their dramatic context and assume an independent life in theater as a “prelude
               or coda to other dramas” or as inspiring the “subgenre of thespian mimicry,” where
               one actor performs another <em>actor</em> performing a certain role (Pascoe 72). Outside of theater, their breaking-free occasions
               all kinds of repetition, both creative and banal, strengthening the theatrical dimensions
               of subjectivity and offering phenomenal analyses of the spaces and degrees to which
               transport moves one.</p>
            <p>Pursuing this dimension departs from the unifying function of condensation in both
               senses of departure. In the moment of perceiving a point in theater, the unity accorded
               to body and mind, hearing and viewing is apprehended <em>by</em> the audience’s reaction that in turn grants a picture of its collective responsiveness
               to a common humanity. In this regard, I take at face value hyperbolic and clichéd
               assertions in press accounts that “everyone” felt, wept over, or applauded a point
               as ratifying what their depiction in physiognomic manuals means to underscore: that
               points are studies in affect whose basic claim is that the body’s expressiveness has
               a special way of forming and uniting persons. But the phenomena of points viewed as
               Romantic-era affect studies register two further observations. Voice is a highly moving
               gesture. As Aranye Fradenburg writes, seeing precedes speaking in an infant’s development
               but sound precedes sight and is the sense through which space first becomes perceptual
               (240). Pascoe’s project to recover Siddons’s voice, inspired by Joseph Severn’s description
               of her “deep touching voice whose tones . . . were like the finest music,” the “grain”
               of which, according to Pascoe, made highly familiar speeches sound new and thus startling,
               underscores a general reality in theater that has worked to Romantic-era theater’s
               disadvantage: words are sensational (7, 45). The semiotic features of poetic language
               that are said to intensify the beauty of poetry are correlated with “dumb-show” in
               theater and thus perceived as threatening drama and poetry. A second observation is
               that the “truth” of our common humanity exemplified in points show recognition of
               it to be a fleeting, unpredictable, and highly mediated proposition.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Both the integrative and detachable aspects of condensation affect forms of agency
                  that we can attribute to theatergoers as a collectivity and as separate individuals.
                  Here is where the unity concretized in a point breaks apart in multiple directions.
                  The most obvious relates to the audience’s differentiation from actors and occasional
                  exertions of power over them—for the actor’s ownership of a point competes with theatergoers’
                  own senses of proprietorship over them. Exercised collectively within the theater,
                  audience ownership runs the gamut from refuting an actor’s claim to a role, to hissing
                  at this or that point but calling for the play’s repetition, to ratifying a new reign.

                           of his pauses, and chiefly in our opinion a deficiency of tact in seizing the disposition
                           of the house, and conforming himself to their tumultuous dictate” (London Times, 20…</span></div>
                  </div> “Woe to the actor,” summarizes W. B. Worthen, “who, under the misguided influence
                  of an original conception of his character, scanted the public’s keen anticipation
                  of Hamlet’s or Jaffeir’s or Sir John Brute’s familiar points” (72). One of the headiest
                  audience pleasures of witnessing an actor in a new role is anticipating the possibility
                  of crowning someone and thus overthrowing another—a visceral enactment of the power
                  of the people when unified. Revealed as well is the rarity of such unity in this setting
                  where entrance and seating arrangements enforce strict class distinctions and where
                  audience attention is scattered across an array of theatrical stimuli.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">

                  the democratizing implications of this accord, it is portrayed and reasserted as “theater
                  intelligence,” enacting the “extraordinary socializing potential” that Daniel O’Quinn
                  ascribes to the developing “rapid feedback loop” of press and theater in this era
                  (3, 1-42). What this unity also indicates is working people’s senses of ownership
                  and differential experiences of it in theater. They too have particular collections
                  of personal and class-meaningful points, whose “emotionally, visually, or sonically
                  intense” modes of manifestation underscore that theater literacy encompasses an array
                  of signifying practices that do not rely on or necessarily privilege being text-literate.

                  the agency affirmed by group or individual allegiances to points is deeply protective

                  </div> Oddly, this strategy, while it affirms the importance of points in the constitution
                  of one’s aesthetic identity, undercuts how the phenomenon of experiencing points effects
                  internal changes that are necessary but not usually sufficient to achieve changes
                  in thought, behavior, or action. In linking the “aesthetic moment” to the “search
                  for transformation,” Christopher Bollas examines condensation in its psychoanalytic
                  function as the most important of the laws of non-discursive thinking, suggesting
                  why points are both so group-charged and personally differentiating (40-49). Any one
                  symbol brings together multiple disparate meanings and thus affective histories. Here
                  one could say that the extent to which a person’s identity is felt to be formed by
                  and invested in aesthetic objects affects the nature and level of change that an aesthetic
                  moment experienced in theater activates. Conversions can be quite dramatic. Joseph
                  Severn recounts how, knocked unconscious by the press of the crowd to see Siddons
                  as Queen Katherine in <em>Henry VIII</em>, he came alive at the sound of her first speech, sat “‘as one entranced and conscious
                  of some new and vital influence in his life,’” and vowed from that moment to “live
                  the life of an artist” (Pascoe 2). Accounts of the child actor William Henry West
                  Betty cite his declaration at the age of ten that he “shall die” if not allowed to
                  “be a player” after experiencing Siddons’s Elvira in <em>Pizarro</em> (Merritt 2). More commonly, changes are momentary, primarily conversational, but in
                  this respect conducive to fostering the good-naturedness that critics like William
                  Hazlitt characterize as the cultural benefit of theatergoing; “Whoever sees a play
                  ought to be better and more sociable for it” (157).</p>

                  </div> Fradenburg notes how, from very early on, infants learn to coordinate gesture and
                  sound and rely on this felt-coordination for their sense of well-being. Romantic-era
                  theater draws adults as well as children back to the nonsense-makings of paralanguage
                  and its developmental precedence over speech. Interestingly, all the avowed “low”
                  points of Romantic-era theater run on this prioritizing, playing up what high-cultural
                  playwright Joanna Baillie recognizes as the primal allure of theater: demonstration
                  that “a love for active, varied movement in the objects before us; for striking contrasts
                  of light and shadow, for splendid decorations and magnificent scenery” is as “inherent”
                  in humans as the “interest we take in the representation of the natural passions and
                  characters” of them (232). Moreover, since the former sets the conditions for emergence
                  of the latter, appearance of character in theater is typically heightened, rather
                  than nullified or denigrated, by paralanguage. No form in the period plays on this
                  developmental reality as spectacularly as does pantomime, whose generic hallmark is
                  the outstripping of language by dumb-show. While analysis of pantomime is beyond my
                  purview, what I wish to emphasize is that its staging of transformation as a combination
                  of technical ingenuity and magical thinking recaptures our earliest, most pleasurable
                  modes of processing the world.</p>
            </div>
            <p>David Mayer’s identification of a shift over the course of the eighteenth century
               in how change is concretized and operationalized in the harlequinade suggests the
               visual affective-cognitive heightening that these low points both enable and require.
               Unlike Harlequin’s “trickwork, which required backcloths or built-up pieces abruptly
               transformed at the slap of his bat, Clown’s visual similes were elaborate ‘tricks
               of construction,’” where from an initial “hodgepodge of items,” usually stolen, Clown
               would assemble some new creation (“a grotesque human form, a carriage, a travesty
               of a military uniform, a sailing vessel”) that Harlequin would then animate (39-40).
               The fact that this shift in clowning technology is performed by the incomparable Joseph
               Grimaldi is a further example of how points at once enable distinctions between high
               and low and render them unsustainable, though therefore repeatedly asserted. Besides
               stressing that Clown’s assemblages are produced in real time and before a live audience,
               Mayer’s description introduces two further deliberate boundary confusions at which
               pantomime specializes and that seeing it disseminates: the role of props in expressivity,
               and their dependence on print mediation for legibility as recognized properties of
               a “human” done “to the life.” In the case of a “high” point, as we have seen, integration
               is asserted by the immediate multi-media perception (itself mediated by memories of
               prior renditions) and mediated print accounts of it, in both the next day’s news and
               theater history. To return to my initial example, part of the sensation attached to
               Garrick’s Hamlet was the debut of a fright-wig, engineered by one hair-dresser Perkins,
               that made his hair actually stand on end at the sight of the ghost—a contraption that
               was not portrayed as countering the naturalness of Garrick’s depiction of Hamlet’s
               fear (Roach 58-59). By contrast, the low-highs of Grimaldi’s Clown’s “tricks of construction”
               begin from dis-articulation, persons and things starting as component, often mechanized
               parts, whose appearance of unity is made live and thus revealed as temporary, a coming-together
               that is cobbled, not pre-existent, and that is forged through visual simile. </p>
            <p>Print mediation is even more crucial to rendering these highly ephemeral, minimally
               textual moments visible and legible. In the day, playbills often gave them top billing,
               and, thanks to Mayer’s and Jeffrey Cox’s painstaking efforts to decipher highly cryptic
               stage directions, we are gaining a rudimentary picture of how up-to-the-moment many
               of these scenes were, both in terms of technology and topical commentary. In attending
               to these scenes of transformation, I wish to highlight Mayer’s cross-modal “visual
               simile” as an apt description of the affective-cognitive processing that theater literacy
               cultivates. Call it wonder. Sometimes, the connections being forged in these scenes
               are before-unapprehended because both tenor and source signify “the new,” sets presenting
               the latest styles, trends, shops, and fashions in what Jeffrey Cox calls “an early
               version of product placement” (Cox, “‘Illegitimate’” 174). Sometimes, the simile is
               visual in order to escape apprehension by the Licenser of Plays, allowing pantomime,
               because of its circumventions of speech, to offer the most biting satire on stage
               (Mayer 50). In any case, these techno-magical transformations underscore O’Quinn’s
               and Gillian Russell’s claim that Georgian theater is a “multi-layered performance
               event, occurring on stage and in the auditorium” that is “mediated throughout the
               print public sphere,” and whose chief function is to reconvey the lived experience
               of cultural change (338 ). In either case, such sophisticated, under-articulated cross-modal
               live connection-making operations have remained unapprehended as poetry. </p>
            <p>Reconsideration of points in Romantic-era theater should change that. Even when prized
               as the peaks that constitute a star, a point is a feedback loop offering multiple
               vectors of flight. Some heighten drama and/or the transports envisioned in and through
               aesthetic moments experienced collectively as an individual. Some are taken to the
               streets, fostering conviviality, consumerism, spouting clubs, inventions, protest
               or agitation. Some heighten or depress private theatricals. Especially when viewed
               as peaks of ingenuity and cross-modal processing, points at whatever height recall
               an attractive feature of juvenile minds, belief that following this path, or that,
               could be interesting.</p>
