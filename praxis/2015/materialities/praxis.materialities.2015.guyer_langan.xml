            <div type="section">
               <p>In his landmark essay, <title level="a">The Secret Life of Things,</title> (1999),
                  a prelude to <title level="m">Thing Theory</title> (2003), Bill Brown acknowledges
                  that his title will bring to mind "a line from William Wordsworth or Percy
                  Shelley, or one of ETA Hoffmann's uncanny tales."  This gesture at once cites and
                  brackets Romantic writers, allowing them to reverberate in the background of an
                  argument in which Brown attends explicitly to the 1920s (as a period in which
                  "things emerge as the object of profound theoretical engagement" in Georg Lukács,
                  Martin Heidegger, and Walter Benjamin), and to a short story by Virginia Woolf,
                     <title level="a">Solid Objects</title> (1920). It somehow seems fitting that
                  Brown's reference to <emph>Romantic</emph> things should be so
                     <emph>vaguely</emph> allusive—not to say elusive—given the longstanding
                  tendency to oppose Romanticism and materialism.  But the inexactness of the
                  citation has the unexpectedly amplifying effect of allowing a palimpsest of lines
                  to spring to mind:  from <title level="a">Tintern Abbey</title> ("We see into the
                  life of things") "And I have felt... / a sense sublime/ Of something far more
                  deeply interfused... A motion and a spirit, that impels/ All thinking things, all
                  objects of all thought,/ And rolls through all things"; and from Shelley's <title
                     level="a">Mont Blanc</title> ("The everlasting universe of things/ Rolls
                  through the mind").  As this virtual universe of "thing" lines rolls through our
                  minds, it's worth stopping in our tracks a bit, to notice something to which Brown
                  does not pay attention:  the proximity of <emph>things</emph> to
                     <emph>thinking</emph> in these Romantic examples of "thing theory."</p>
               <p>One could cite many more examples of such proximity, but we'll content ourselves
                  with one of the most familiar, from Byron's <title level="m">Don Juan</title>: 
               <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>But words are things, and a small drop of ink,</l>
                        <l>Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces</l>
                        <l>That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think (3.793-95).</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                  To (re)read this passage in the context of Thing Theory is to imagine
                  that it was Byron, not William Godwin, who responded to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
                  own "call for papers": 
               <quote>I wish you would write a book on the power of words,
                     and the processes by which human feelings form affinities with them - in short,
                     I wish you to <emph>philosophize</emph> Horne Tooke's System, and to solve the
                     great Questions . . . Is <emph>thinking</emph> impossible without arbitrary
                     signs? . . . In something of this order I would endeavour to destroy the old
                     antithesis of <emph>Words &amp; Things</emph>, elevating, as it were, words
                     into Things, &amp; living Things too. All the nonsense of vibrations etc you
                     would of course dismiss. (Coleridge to William Godwin, 22 September, 1800,
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:625-26)</quote>
                     Many readers of <title
                     level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> will be familiar with John Horne
                  Tooke's etymological argument that "to think" bears a direct relation to "things":
                   "Remember, where we now say <emph>I think</emph>, the antient expression
                     was<emph>—Me thinketh</emph>, i.e., <emph>Me thingeth, It thingeth me</emph>"(609).
                   "Thinking things"—in the sense of (1) attributing thought to things; (2) thinking
                     <emph>about</emph> things; and (3) thinking <emph>through</emph> things—would
                  seem to be at the foundation of Romantic interest in the "<emph>real</emph>
                  language of men" (emphasis added, Brett &amp; Jones 241).</p>
               <p>No doubt the amount of ink (and other material supports for discourse) recently
                  expended on the topic of "things" in literature had the not-quite uncanny effect,
                  in 2011, of independently prompting the MLA's English Romantic Period and the
                  Comparative Romantic and Nineteenth Century Literature Divisions to convene panels
                  designed to explore how "things" might be thought Romantically.  Certainly these
                  sessions were not in any way the first to wonder what a <hi rend="italic"
                     >Romantic</hi> thing theory might look like; Colin Jager in 2007 and Eric
                  Lindstrom in 2010 both suggested the subtitle of William Godwin's <title level="m"
                     >Caleb Williams</title>—<title level="a">Things as They Are</title>—ought to be
                  considered as a point of departure.  This "astringent, jointly
                  metaphysical/political" phrase (Lindstrom 481) implicitly opposes itself to
                  "things as they might be" (Jager par. 7).  And at more or less the same time as
                  our panelists were presenting their papers, Mary Jacobus' book <title level="m"
                     >Romantic Things: A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud</title> (Chicago, 2012) appeared.
                   </p>
               <p>Jacobus' <title level="m">Romantic Things</title> makes only passing reference to
                  thing theory, but in linking the objects of her subtitle to such other putative
                  "things" as death, absence, and vacancy, she makes a case for Wordsworth as "the
                  negative phenomenologist of Romantic thingness" (129).  Not clouds but "/cloud/"—
                  Hubert Damisch's name for what in painting "is the sign of the volume repressed by
                  modern painting's fixation on the flatness of the representational surface"
                  (12)—is the paradigm for this negative phenomenology:a phenomenology which notably
                  undermines <emph>both</emph> idealism <emph>and</emph> the materialism which
                  counters it.  In one chapter, "Touching Things," Jacobus suggests why Romantic
                  writers should be so interested in <emph>intangibles</emph>—in things that are not
                  immaterial, but whose materiality is evidenced less by direct perception than in
                  their aftereffects.  Drawing a parallel between the poem, "unable to speak for
                  itself," and other things that lack standing as subjects or objects, Jacobus hints
                  at the relation of Romantic practice not only to thing theory, but to so-called
                  "object-oriented ontology." </p>
               <p>As Steven Shaviro explains (in an essay whose title, <title level="a">The Universe
                     of Things,</title> references Shelley's "Mont Blanc"),
                  aesthetics has a central status in object-oriented ontology:
               <quote>For aesthetics
                     is about the <emph>singularity</emph> and <emph>supplementarity</emph> of
                     things. That is to say, it has to do with things insofar as they cannot be
                     cognized, or subordinated to concepts; and also insofar as they cannot be
                     utilized, or normatively regulated, or defined according to rules. No matter
                     how deeply I comprehend a thing, and no matter how pragmatically or
                     instrumentally I make use of it, there is still something of it that escapes my
                     categorizations. Even when I obliterate a thing, or consume it utterly, there
                     is still something of it that I have not managed to incorporate, some force to
                     it that I have not been able to subsume. Aesthetics involves feeling an object
                        <emph>for its own sake</emph>, beyond those aspects of it that can be
                     understood or used. The thing withdraws into its network, luring me into the
                     shadows; and it bursts forth in a splendour that dazzles and blinds me. In
                     these cases, the understanding is frustrated, and the will reaches the limits
                     of its power. It is only aesthetically, beyond understanding and will, that I
                     can appreciate the <foreign>actus</foreign> of the thing being what it is, in
                     what [Graham] Harman calls "the sheer sincerity of existence."</quote> 
               If a
                  "Romantic" thing theory is one dialectically related both to things as they are
                  and things as they might be, it would also seem to resist the idea that attention
                  to "things" represents a supercession or redemption of the supposed "abstractions"
                  of theory.  Partly in the spirit of a resistance to the final dominion of
                  things—and that spirit of resistance is perhaps a shibboleth, a specifically
                  Romantic inflection of thing theory—both of the initial calls for the papers
                  included here also encouraged dialectical or resistant engagement. Titling the
                  English session <title level="a">This is Not a Thing,</title> the committee wished
                  the allusion to René Magritte to suggest a certain distrust of the "thing" as a
                  repudiation of, or correction for, Romantic <emph>theory</emph>.  More subtly, by
                  elevating the deictic "this" as its <emph>object</emph>, it raised the question of
                  how to understand the materiality of Romantic words and letters.</p>
               <p>The Comparative Literature Division accomplished a similar end by devoting two
                  complementary sessions to <title level="a">Romantic Ideality</title> and <title
                     level="a">Romantic Materiality,</title> staging a chiasmus such that at the
                  very moment in which one thought (even hoped) to think on one side of things, that
                  thought turned out to be inextricable from ideas, idealism, and ideality. Essays
                  delivered at both of these comparative sessions—on ideality and materiality—appear
                  in this special issue.  These two panels were initially prompted by the way that
                  object-oriented ontology seems to have troubled anew the assumed opposition
                  between materialism and idealism.  In actuality though, each of the essays that
                  appears here is held together by a rethinking and reanimation of Paul de Man's
                  subtle account of linguistic materiality.  These essays are preoccupied with the
                  matter of words and letters, and the undoing of any sustainable opposition between
                  formal and material approaches to literature and culture.  </p>
               <p>While object-oriented ontology sets out from the re-introduction of realism into a
                  theoretical terrain that since Immanuel Kant had given up on its legitimacy, the
                  question remains whether this thinking has a precedent or parallel in some
                  readings of Romanticism, in particular, those that, at least since de Man (the
                  explicit subject of Tom Toreman's and Mario Ortiz-Robles' essays and a key
                  intertext, if not the implicit subject, of essays by Anna Kornbluh and Brian
                  McGrath) have focused on "Kant's Materialism."  These essays hold on to
                  materialism, but do so in order redescribe materiality as a possibly displaced
                  name for a linguistic predicament.  Put another way, the essays collected here
                  lead us to ask whether Romantic materialities say more or less the same thing as
                  "Speculative Realism"? Do they, far from collapsing into relativism, instead
                  embrace a sense of things in their very awareness of linguistic force? </p>
               <p>Put another way, just as the essays we have collected here register the emergence
                  of new methods and ways of thinking, they also remind us of the endurance of an
                  earlier account of radical—and radically unconventional—materiality, one that
                  Jacques Derrida registers as a "nothing" that operates as "a force of resistance,"
                  neither substance not matter, but rather a "materiality without matter" (350).
                  Resistance, whether or not it takes shape, emerges in this sense as materiality
                  itself. This is the resistance to which the <emph>this</emph> of "this is not a
                  thing" bears witness.</p>

                     Atom,</title> by Amanda Goldstein—were destined for other publications)
                  concentrate our attention on the strange way in which the process of reading might
                  be understood to exhibit the imbrication of things and thought.  In her essay
                     <title level="a">What Wordsworth Touched,</title> Sonia Hofkosh challenges the
                  prevailing conception of Wordsworth as a poet averse to "the touch of the real,"
                  as a poet who instead favored encounters with "phantom" reality (Hartman).   Yet
                  Hofkosh's focus is on the <emph>text</emph> as a thing: reinterpreting "the touch
                  of earthly years" not as nostalgia or mortality but as "somatic pressure," Hofkosh
                  describes reading as a process of "tandem touching" ("what we touch touches us"). </p>
               <p>In a similar vein, Yoon Sun Lee brilliantly characterizes (an apt word) the Gothic
                  novel as "both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky
                  reliance on formula and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its
                  superficial character appears to indicate the existence of something deeper, or
                  even unconscious."  Evidence of the dissolved opposition between things and
                  persons, objects and subjects, exhibits itself in Ann Radcliffe's (narrative)
                  passages about passages, often located within the walls of castles whose
                  mouldering condition likewise suggests the collapse of boundaries.  In Radcliffe,
                  when a door opens, it appears to do so of its own accord.  Tracing the strange
                  effects of Gothic patterns, Lee offers us a ground-shifting (deterritorializing)
                  way of reading Gothic descriptions as "assemblages" that fail to produce a single
                  mental image, but instead register "the failure of things to persist." And if Lee
                  is right to suggest that materiality, when understood as a shifting force field of
                  intensities, is always already at risk of dissolving, emerging, and changing, then
                  Wordsworth's apparent aversion to the "real" may instead register the poet's most
                  profound attachment to the material.  For, as Hofkosh notes, the poet's attachment
                  to "things which are not things" required Wordsworth to produce stories "about how things
                  (entities, objects, bodies) change over time, must change, in order to
                  endure."</p>
               <p>The remaining papers were presented at the two Comparative Literature sessions:
                  those by Anna Kornbluh, Brian McGrath, and Mario Ortiz-Robles composed a panel on
                     <title level="a">Romantic Materialities,</title> and Tom Toremans, together
                  with David Clark and Tilottama Rajan (both of whom had committed their essays
                  elsewhere) spoke on the <title level="a">Romantic Idealities</title> panel. </p>
               <p>Two of these essays focus explicitly on Paul de Man whether in an effort to
                  characterize agency as a literary effect, an example of what Mario Ortiz-Robles
                  calls "literary immanence," or in order to situate the several texts devoted to
                  materiality within their original context—the Messenger Lectures at Cornell
                  University—and to reread them from that vantage (the aim of Toreman's essay).
                   McGrath and Kornbluh also turn to de Man, even if only by turning away from him.
                  Indeed, while they allegorically treat our contemporary experience of
                  virtuality—from the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath to the new
                  knowledge economy—they do so by way of an analysis of "material events."  While
                  Kornbluh makes a point of insisting that her essay will not repeat the gesture
                  whereby reading Karl Marx after de Man, a conventionally understood materialism
                  and a more enigmatic linguistic one seem not as different as one would otherwise
                  presume, her subtle approach to Marx remains thoroughly informed by the mode of
                  rhetorical reading that is de Man's signature.  The same can be said of Brian
                  McGrath's essay.</p>
               <p>Like Jane Bennett, Brian McGrath sets out from Henry David Thoreau. While Bennett
                  loops Thoreau through Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, in order to propose an
                  alternative materialism to the dominant Marxist one, and in order to develop an
                  account of "lively" or "vibrant" matter, McGrath takes us straight to the
                  clouds—to Wordsworth's cloud and to cloud computing.  More specifically, McGrath's
                  essay is a patient, but also wandering, reflection on the line "I wandered lonely
                  as a cloud," which leads us to think through the economic and ecological costs of
                  mobility that our contemporary fascination with clouds—specifically with the cloud
                  in which, among other things, the words you are now reading are stored—reveals. In
                  doing so, McGrath stages a canny reversal, whereby the emblem of poetic—and above
                  all <emph>Romantic</emph>—immateriality turns out to be materiality itself. In
                  McGrath's reading, Wordsworth turns out to be less a dreamy idealist than a vibrant
                  materialist, attending to the life of things or the thingly life.  But McGrath
                  doesn't see this as the end of the so-called linguistic turn, but rather, just as
                  the theorists of objects have set out to recover the matter apparently lost by the
                  acceptance of social or linguistic construction, McGrath turns this thinking of
                  materiality resolutely back to Romanticism and to a renewed reflection upon its
                  figures.</p>
               <p>Taken together, the six essays that we have collected here suggest that
                  Romanticism exposes us to a materialism that cannot merely be overcome and an
                  idealism with which it is not identical. By reading beyond the texts
                  conventionally associated with Romanticism, and by recasting the critical
                  tendencies—from thing theory to object oriented ontology—through the poets,
                  genres, and critics of Romanticism, these essays position Romanticism (and show
                  how Romanticism may always have been positioned) in another relation to
                     <emph>things as they are</emph>—or may be.</p>
