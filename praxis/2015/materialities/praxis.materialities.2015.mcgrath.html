            <p class="noCount">“Material Excursions” teases two questions. How does the general mobility and flexibility
               of late capitalism, increased—if not inaugurated—by cloud computing, leave material
               traces? And, given romantic poetry's preoccupation with clouds, how does romantic
               poetry, specifically the poetry of William Wordsworth, help us to think the material
               traces of cloud computing and the knowledge economy differently? The essay draws from
               the accidental convergence of Apple’s rhetoric surrounding iCloud and Wordsworth’s
               “I wandered lonely as a cloud.”</p>

                     at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the
                     hills and fields absolutely free from all worldly engagements. . . . When sometimes
                     I am reminded that the mechanics and shop-keepers stay in their shops not only all
                     the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as
                     if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they
                     deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago. — Henry David Thoreau

               <div class="epigraph"><span class="quote">‘What purchase might there be for loosening the grip of capitalism as an oppressive
                     instance? . . . One critical orientation, which is seemingly paradoxical given that
                     mobility and liberation have hitherto been closely associated, is to be sought in
                     challenging mobility as a prerequisite and incontestable value. Is the project of
                     liberation still compatible with an unlimited extension of the exigency of mobility,
                     contact and connection which . . . can be a source of new forms of exploitation and
                     new existential tensions? — Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello (468)’</span></div>
               <p>Mobility for Thoreau offers respite from a capitalist economy that exploits workers.
                  For Boltanski and Chiapello, however, it represents capitalism's latest and most advanced
                  form of oppression. In the new spirit of capitalism, mobility is key to a knowledge
                  economy that idealizes workers who are flexible, creative, and reprogrammable—workers
                  who, following William Wordsworth, wander as clouds through the Cloud. As Boltanski
                  and Chiapello explore, mobility and flexibility today are sources for new social anxieties.
                  What once offered respite from capitalism for Thoreau is now a source of anxiety for
                  workers capable of imagining a near future when they may no longer be mobile or flexible
                  enough to compete for jobs that provide adequate material resources. In an economy
                  that values mobility and flexibility, one is expendable when others are more mobile
                  and flexible—code in the new knowledge economy for a purely formal process of substitution
                  or interchangeability. This essay begins with two questions: how does the general
                  mobility and flexibility of late capitalism, increased—if not inaugurated—by cloud
                  computing, leave material traces? And (risking seeming a bit simple minded), given
                  Romantic poetry's preoccupation with clouds, how does Romantic poetry—specifically
                  the poetry of William Wordsworth—help us to think the material traces of cloud computing
                  and the knowledge economy differently?</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Romanticism and Materialism</span></h2>
               <p>To think about Romanticism—and in particular Romantic poetry—and materialism today
                  may still strike some as quite odd. Aren't poets the least materialist of writers
                  and Romantic poets the least materialist of the poets? This at least is how Jerome
                  McGann characterized Romantic poetry so powerfully in <em>Romantic Ideology</em>, where he argued that Romantic poetry "is everywhere marked by extreme forms of displacement
                  and poetic conceptualization whereby the actual human issues with which the poetry
                  is concerned are resituated in a variety of idealized localities" (1). What distinguishes
                  Romantic poetry is the recurring displacement of material life.</p>
               <p>Many readers of Romantic poetry have worked against McGann's accusation for years,
                  but recent publications by contemporary poets and specialists in contemporary poetry
                  and poetics continue to align Romanticism with idealism, showing that the dominant
                  narrative exerts great power. Marjorie Perloff's <em>Uncreative Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century</em>, Kevin Goldsmith's <em>Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age</em>, and Craig Dworkin and Kevin Goldsmith's <em>Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing</em> show how contemporary writing has distanced itself from the tropes that preoccupied—or
                  have been understood to preoccupy—Romantic poets: genius, imagination, individuality,
                  creativity, emotion, and so on. Dreams of originality strongly associated with Romantic
                  discourse have themselves been transformed by technologies that enable new writing
                  practices. As Goldsmith writes: "writers are exploring ways of writing that have been
                  thought, traditionally, to be outside the scope of literary practice: word programming,
                  databasing, recycling, appropriation, intentional plagiarism, identity ciphering,
                  and intensive programming, to name but a few" (2). Summarizing Perloff, he explains:
                  "because of changes brought on by technology and the Internet, our notion of genius—a
                  romantic isolated figure—is outdated" (1).</p>
               <p>Technological change in recent years is largely responsible for an increase in non-expressive,
                  conceptual, and material poetics: a poetry, following Charles Olson, that aims to
                  get "rid of [the] lyrical interference of the individual as ego" so strongly associated
                  with Romanticism and embrace self-consciously "unoriginal" practices common in the
                  digital age (qtd. in Dworkin, 
                  “Against Expression”
                  xliii). In 
                  “The Fate of Echo,”
                  Dworkin's introduction to <em>Against Expression</em>, he describes the original online collection from which <em>Against Expression</em> emerged, which <span class="quote">‘happened to gather a particular kind of writing to make a secondary argument: some
                     of the presumed hallmarks of poetry—the use of metaphor and imagery, a soigné edited
                     craft, the sincere emotional expression of especially sensitive individuals—might
                     be radically reconsidered, and poetry might be reclaimed as a venue for intellect
                     rather than sentiment. (xliii)’</span> In the original forward published online at UbuWeb, Dworkin contrasts recent developments
                  in contemporary poetry and poetics with Romanticism, and with Wordsworth in particular.
                  He writes: "what would a non-expressive poetry look like? A poetry of intellect rather
                  than emotion? One in which the substitution at the heart of metaphor and image were
                  replaced by the direct presentation of language itself, with 'spontaneous overflow'
                  supplanted by meticulous procedure and exhaustively logical process?" (<em>UbuWeb</em>). A metonym for Romanticism, "spontaneous overflow" stands for a poetry skewed toward
                  transparency and immateriality. Unlike an expressive poetry that foregrounds the lyric
                  ego and aims to transmit or communicate some expressive content, non-expressive poetry
                  renders words opaque and material, thus making possible forms of "social, economic,
                  and political critique" (Goldsmith 61). Dan Graham's 
                  “Schema”
                  is one of Dworkin's examples of non-expressive poetry, "where the self-regard of narcissistic
                  confession [is] rejected in favor of laying bare the potential for linguistic self-reflexiveness"
                  (<em>Against Expression</em> xliii). Graham's poem consists of publishing information about the appearance of
                  the page upon which the "poem" is printed. As Dworkin explains: "Graham submits a
                  template—not unlike the portion of XML source used to order and display the information
                  pulled from various databases—which the editor of the magazine was to calculate and
                  complete, providing information about the physical characteristics of the publication.
                  Rigorously and recursively self-referential, the completed piece parses itself, collapsing
                  form and content. The result focuses attention onto the most minute particulars of
                  the physical aspects of print" (289). The scheme, and so the text of the poem, includes
                  the weight of the paper sheet, the type of paper stock, the name of the typeface,
                  etc.; and of the pages selected, the number of words, the number of adjectives, the
                  percentage of area occupied by type. The poem attempts to turn attention to the materiality
                  of the printed object. It has no "content" but its material context. Dworkin continues:
                  "The radical implications of Graham's work follow from that combination of an insistence
                  on the cultural materiality of language and a rejection of the romantic author as
                  a unified locus of interior authority" (290). In this way, the poem forces readers
                  to attend to a material context that more often is ignored by a tradition of Romantic
                  poetry, to return to McGann, that privileges an ideal or idealized content over historical,
                  material context. In several important ways, 2011 was a very un-Romantic year.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Few readers would confuse Wordsworth's 
                     “I wandered lonely as a cloud”
                      with Graham's 
                     “Schema,”
                      yet I wonder if Romanticism need so forcefully be aligned with the immateriality of
                     "narcissistic confession," and so defined as complicit with and not critical of the
                     social, economic, and political status quo. I wonder, to put this differently, how
                     easy it is to gain access to "materiality." Unlike an expressive poetry structured
                     by figure (and the various forms of substitution figurative language foregrounds in
                     a poem like 
                     “I wandered lonely as a cloud”
                     ), a non-expressive poetry would "replace" metaphor with what Dworkin describes as
                     the "direct presentation of language itself." The readily apparent difficulty of such
                     a presentation arises from the fact that the effort to "replace" "the substitution
                     at the heart of metaphor" already depends on the logic of substitution—or replacement—that
                     defines metaphor. To supplant "spontaneous overflow" with the direct presentation
                     of language itself is already to participate in the logic of substitution that defines
                     figurative or expressive poetry.

                              procedure in non-expressive poetry and poetics.</span></div>
                     </div> The poet's effort to substitute for metaphor the direct presentation of language depends

               </div>
               <p>An assertion that Romanticism is outdated may reproduce certain "Romantic" structures
                  and preoccupations. What distinguishes Romantic poems may be their attempts to move
                  away from Romanticism. Goldsmith, for example, begins <em>Uncreative Writing</em> with something of a Wordsworthian problem: "faced with an unprecedented amount of
                  available text, the problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn
                  to negotiate the vast quantity that exists" (1). Goldsmith develops "uncreative" writing
                  practices to manage, parse, and organize "this thicket of information," just as Wordsworth
                  offers <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> to "manage" the rapid communication of intelligence (Wordsworth, <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> 294). Famously, Wordsworth laments the craving for extraordinary incidents produced
                  in the minds of readers by the proliferation of information (newspapers, for instance)
                  and argues for poetry to play a role in offsetting the blunting of the mind that results
                  from this craving. In some significant ways, Goldsmith and Wordsworth respond to the
                  same problem. Similarly, Dworkin characterizes the shift from expressive to non-expressive
                  poetry and poetics using familiar Romantic tropes: contemporary non-expressive poets
                  choose Echo over Romanticism's—perhaps specifically Wordsworth's—Narcissus, language
                  over ego, materiality over ideal-ity. Such an opposition is complicated, though, by
                  the very poetry under discussion. The opposition Dworkin sets up between Echo and
                  Narcissus maps too easily onto the opposition John Keats, for instance, sets up between
                  William Shakespeare and John Milton. Shakespeare was always already something of a
                  re-mixer and a model of sorts for Keats, i.e. Romanticism, too. Like the poets Dworkin
                  celebrates, Keats distinguishes the poetical character from Wordsworth's "egotistical
                  sublime." "A poet," writes Keats in a letter to Richard Woodhouse from October of
                  1818, "is the most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no Identity"
                  (Keats 195). Dan Graham's 
                  “Schema,”
                  like Keats's poet, is similarly empty of content of its own. Perhaps 2011 was a very
                  romantic year for contemporary poetics.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I started by suggesting that poets are the least material of writers, and Romantic
                     poets the least material of poets. This is true, of course, only if one defines Romanticism
                     in the terms employed by those who collapse Romanticism and idealism, a drifting into
                     mind of language merely as a vehicle to explore the self. But what if the Romantic
                     poet's turn inward is not a turn away from materiality, but a turn toward the question:
                     where is the material? When? Where or when is the encounter with what cannot be known
                     or understood about language, and how does this encounter, this event, offer some
                     form of registering materiality—however defined, however removed from consciousness,
                     for example? The rejection of Romanticism common in contemporary poetics—a rejection
                     that aligns Romanticism with idealism and contemporary poetry with materialism—always
                     risks transforming materialism into an ideal idealism, as the auto-referentiality
                     of text becomes indistinguishable from Wordsworth's ego-ideal.

               <p>Recent advances in technology are helping us not only develop new writing practices,
                  but also rethink what we mean by matter, material, materiality, and so call for what
                  Diane Coole and Samantha Frost term "new materialisms." The more we come to understand
                  about atoms—but also genes, networks, etc.—the less comfortably solid material becomes,
                  for, as Coole and Frost write, "the microscopic atom consists of a positively charged
                  nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike, three-dimensional wave of spinning electrons" (11).
                  They continue: <span class="quote">‘Even when vast numbers of atoms are assembled in the kind of macrostructures we experience
                     in the 'condensed matter' of the perceptible world, their subatomic behavior consists

                     of charge: which is to say that they demonstrate none of the comforting stability
                     or solidity we take for granted. (11)’</span> What formerly we thought "material" is now, we discover, more dispersed, cloudlike
                  than we might prefer. To be a good materialist today, one cannot simply kick a stone
                  and feel good about having returned oneself to the hard stuff that matters most. We
                  cannot, as Wordsworth famously did when confronted by the immateriality of self and
                  world, simply reach for some tree branch or wall. As he explains in his discussion
                  of 
                  “Ode: Intimations of Immortality,”
                  "I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence, and
                  I communed with all that I saw as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own
                  immaterial nature. Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree
                  to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality" (Wordsworth, <em>Fenwick Notes</em> 61). Wordsworth's fear when a boy was that he would fall into an abyss of idealism,
                  and so he grasped for wall or tree in an effort to encounter a world that threatened
                  to disappear—as the world became merely an extension of his own immaterial self. The
                  threat is oneself, one's own immateriality, and the chance that there is or soon will
                  be nothing but this immateriality. In later years, of course, Wordsworth's fear is
                  the reverse: that the world is too much with us, a large stone on a small chest.</p>
               <p>Bruno Latour begins <em>Pandora's Hope</em> with a question from a colleague that takes him by surprise. It's a question that
                  seems to follow from many of the social, cultural, and scientific discussions that
                  have become more and more common in the 20<span class="sup">th</span>and 21<span class="sup">st</span> centuries: "'I have a question for you,' he said, taking out of his pocket a crumpled
                  piece of paper on which he had scribbled a few key words. He took a breath: 'Do you
                  believe in reality?'" (1). In other words, the question from Latour's colleague is—given
                  the various concerns over reality as socially constructed, as virtual—is it still
                  possible to "believe" in reality? The colleague is here the young Wordsworth and Latour
                  simply the closest wall or tree. What happened to the material world? In "Why Has
                  Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern," Latour expresses
                  quite powerfully his worry that "a certain form of critical spirit has sent us down
                  the wrong path" (231). He draws a parallel between PhD programs "still running to
                  make sure that good American kids are learning the hard way that facts are made up,
                  that there is no such thing as natural, unmediated, unbiased access to truth" and
                  extremists who "are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy
                  hard-won evidence" (227). What is the difference, he concludes, "between conspiracists
                  and a popularized, that is a teachable version of social critique?" (228). Latour's
                  colleague in <em>Pandora's Hope</em> is forced to ask his question in part because forms of social critique have successfully
                  questioned the very idea of matters of fact. The fact that the so-called linguistic
                  or cultural turn has made it possible to ask such a question is precisely what Coole
                  and Frost identify as a reason for the necessity of new materialisms: "the more textual
                  approaches associated with the so-called cultural turn are increasingly being deemed
                  inadequate for understanding contemporary society, particularly in light of some of
                  its most urgent challenges regarding environmental, demographic, geopolitical, and
                  economic change" (3). Textual approaches have left us with nothing but the immaterial.
                  Like Latour's colleague, we reach for something else, something more, something more
                  material—or at least we should be reaching. But the act itself repeats Wordsworth's
                  question. If Romanticism is nothing other than an effort away from Romanticism, is
                  idealism nothing other than the effort out of idealism? If the effort out of Romanticism
                  merely puts us back in Romanticism, does the effort out of idealism merely put us
                  back in idealism?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Latour, however, foregrounds a form of material textuality in his opening anecdote,
                     as his colleague takes from his pocket a scrap of paper upon which he has written
                     a few key words. Given the scene, the colleague's question appears possible at all
                     only because of and through his encounter with writing, and so Latour's opening foregrounds
                     technologies of inscription even as the colleague's question seems to lament a linguistic
                     turn that embraces theories of textuality that threaten—or are perceived to threaten—reality.
                     In his posthumously published book <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>, Paul de Man argues that the encounter with something one might call matter or materiality
                     occurs not when textual approaches are eschewed, but only "by way of an epistemological
                     critique of tropes" (132). What Coole and Frost refer to as "textual approaches"are
                     deemed inadequate in <em>New Materialisms</em>because language does not offer access to materiality; as if the world, reality, materiality
                     (as Latour's colleague worries) is destroyed as soon as we represent it with or through
                     signs. At moments like this, however, it can appear that a purely formal, fully tropological
                     model for language is the legacy of post-structuralism, deconstruction, and the linguist
                     and cultural turns; as if this model were not always part of what Paul de Man calls
                     aesthetic ideology and something the epistemological critique of tropes is meant to
                     oppose.

                     </div> For de Man, literary attention to signs, words, tropes, does not result in a rejection
                     of materiality; it offers an attempt to encounter, in whatever minimal way possible,
                     materiality. Materiality is not opposed to writing, even if it is "opposed to some
                     extent to the notion of cognition" (<em>Aesthetic Ideology</em> 132). But this does not negate Latour's larger point, that certain extremists today
                     are perfectly willing to use the very constructivist arguments utilized by the left
                     for decades to make revisionist historical and counter-factual claims. The question
                     is how—when—does the language of trope become something else; when does formalism
                     become formalization, a dislocation from within—however brief—of what de Man calls
                     aesthetic ideology? If critique for Latour has run out of steam, this may be because
                     critical reading is not attending enough today to its own tropes, even a trope like
                     steam so familiar—if in slightly revised form—to Romantic poets.</p>

                     given a little puff of mist to, and then the cloud does all the heavy thinking for
                     everybody. I don't mean there's <em>really</em> a cloud. I just mean it's something <em>like</em> that. . . . All I can say is, there aren't any meetings" — Kurt Vonnegut (274)’</span></div>
               <p>The aesthetic for de Man is a principle of articulation, and yet in the contemporary
                  university Vonnegut imagines, there no longer are any meetings, by which I think he
                  means to lampoon the great number of meetings scheduled in universities in which very
                  little gets done. But just as there are no meetings, there is no articulation. Here,
                  the principle of articulation is the absence of articulation, which can seem a form
                  of resistance to aesthetics, but is just as likely the advanced form aesthetics has
                  adopted in late capitalism. Vonnegut lampoons the university that has become a fully
                  closed system in which the aberrantly referential effects of language are foreclosed
                  from the start by the very absence of articulation. He somewhat playfully—if also
                  accidentally—anticipates Bill Reading's argument in <em>The University in Ruins</em>, where Readings famously argues that the corporate bureaucratization of the University
                  leads to an emerging purely formal discourse of excellence empty of content: "the
                  contemporary University of Excellence should now be understood as a bureaucratic system
                  whose internal regulation is entirely self-interested" (40). "What gets taught or
                  researched matters less than the fact that it be excellently taught or researched"
                  (13). In the contemporary University, as in late capitalism, content concerns are
                  eclipsed as purely formal structures of substitution and exchange become the only
                  defining content. Without certain attempts at articulation between form and content
                  conditioned by the aesthetic, there is no chance for the occurrence of materiality,
                  which de Man defines as the passage from one conception of language to another, from
                  a language of trope to a language of performance. The absence of articulation and
                  something like absolute connectivity, a purely formal system, are indistinguishable.

                  <p>Descriptions of Apple's new iCloud come quite close to Vonnegut's imagined university,

                     "iCloud is so much more than a hard drive in the sky. It makes it quick and effortless

                     in "Has Critique run out of Steam" and embraced at moments by contemporary poets,
                     who develop and celebrate a fully auto-referential poetics that draws attention to
                     the materiality of language itself. Though, as Goldsmith makes clear in <em>Uncreative Writing</em>, there may be no way to remove expression fully, as the choices made by poets more
                     interested in uncreative than creative writing mark a poetic subject even as he or
                     she disappears; in other words, a materialist poetics cannot rid itself of idealism,
                     and an idealist poetics that aspires to wander as a cloud (Wordsworth) may not be
                     able to rid itself of materialism.</p>

               <p>When Coole and Frost write that "the microscopic atom consists of a positively charged
                  nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike, three-dimensional wave of spinning electrons,"
                  they mean, of course, that to be a good materialist today one need take an interest
                  in clouds. If this is true, then there may be no more materialist a poet than Wordsworth,
                  famous for beginning both of his long epic poems with clouds and subjecting himself
                  to ridicule for 
                  “I wandered lonely as a cloud.”
                  Cloud computing makes possible new forms of mobility embraced and supported by late
                  capitalism. But even Wordsworth, however great his ego-ideal, never went quite so
                  far as Apple. 
                  “I wandered lonely as a cloud”
                  is still a far cry from "iCloud," as the simile in Wordsworth's poem makes conspicuous
                  the figurative potential of language. There is a meeting, a chance occurrence—perhaps
                  we might call it an event—here as Wordsworth's preoccupation with clouds, once perhaps
                  read as a sign of Wordsworth's idealism—his collapsing of subject and object, his
                  embrace of the immaterial self as it disperses, colonizing a world by making it lighter—gives
                  way to parataxis: not "I . . . as a cloud" but "iCloud."</p>

                     embrace of its own idealist position—as Wordsworth frees the poetic ego burdened on

                     </div> David Simpson notes in <em>Wordsworth, Commodification and Social Concern</em>, following de Man's readings of Friedrich Schiller and Heinrich von Kleist in <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, that dance is a common figure within aesthetic ideology for a social and political
                     model in which all works in harmony, but a harmony designed to conceal the violence
                     that makes it possible. While Wordsworth's poem is often read "as a standard expression
                     of Romantic pantheism" (168), Simpson argues that Wordsworth's dancing daffodils anticipate
                     Karl Marx's dancing table, Marx's figure for the commodity in <em>Capital</em>. In becoming a commodity, the table "changes into a thing which transcends sensuousness
                     while remaining sensible."

                     156). In the poem Wordsworth gives himself vaporous form, but in giving himself vaporous
                     form he both transcends the material world and stages the becoming-commodity of ghostly
                     things, even the becoming-commodity of ghostly things like poets and poems.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Capitalism and commodity form are built on the same power of exchange and so structured
                  by the figurative potential of language even as this structure is disguised. Similarly,
                  a post-industrial knowledge economy is built on a worker's ability to "wander" "lonely"
                  even as the very chance for wandering is foreclosed, as the cloud follows one wherever
                  one goes. The somewhat accidental articulation of Wordsworth's poem and Apple's iCloud
                  helps make visible the degree to which late capitalism disguises its own figurative
                  structure even as it becomes ubiquitous. As all things become increasingly "exchangeable,"
                  the system becomes more purely formal; the apparent absence of figurative language
                  (iCloud as compared to "as a Cloud") becomes an ideal as the rhetorical structures
                  disappear from view. One can think about this structure in slightly different terms:
                  iCloud (and cloud computing more generally) makes possible absolute connectivity,
                  mobility, and flexibility while disguising the basic material structures that make
                  connection, mobility, and flexibility possible. In a recent report written by Gary
                  Cook and Jodie Van Horn and published by Greenpeace on the energy use of data centers
                  in the United States and their carbon footprint, the "cloud" is described as IT's
                  biggest innovation and disruption in recent years. The authors explain: "Cloud computing
                  is converting our work, finances, health and relationships into invisible data, centralized
                  in out-of-the-way storage facilities or data centers. . . . In the US, which hosts
                  approximately 40% of the world's data center servers, it is estimated that server
                  farms consume close to 3% of the national power supply" (4). "Apple's new $1bn US
                  dollar 'iData Center' in North Carolina, necessary for iCloud, is estimated to require
                  as much as 100MW of power, equivalent to about 80,000 US homes or 250,000 EU homes"
                  (12). Making data invisible, in other words, requires a lot of energy, made visible
                  by the increased consumption of coal and nuclear energy and the material effects of
                  such consumption. While Apple has plans to build a solar farm near their iData Center,
                  the energy required to run server banks is increasing in the United States by 12%
                  a year.</p>
               <p>Echoing Boltanski and Chiapello, Alan Liu in <em>The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information</em> explores the subtly destructive effects of a late capitalism that privileges a worker's
                  ability to wander with the help of a cloud that promotes new forms of creative knowledge
                  work. Mobility and flexibility are now a source, suggests Liu, for new anxieties as
                  "global competition legitimates restructuring, downsizing, outsourcing, and the replacement
                  of career workers with permatemps—the social law of a new nomadism" (292). In a postindustrial
                  sociality, "'lifelong learning' demands perpetual reeducation at 'Internet speed,'
                  but bodily, family, community, ethnic, gender, and other duties of everyday life pose
                  an incalculably great counter-demand that makes it almost impossible, for instance,
                  to study at night" (293-294). One must remain always mobile, flexible, and connected
                  else one will lose touch with the "cool" and find oneself replaced, exchanged. Absolute
                  mobility, which is pitched as freedom to roam or surf, increases insecurity and insecurity
                  is the oldest way to keep one from thinking or criticizing. The cloud does all the
                  thinking for everybody.</p>
               <p>
                  “I wandered lonely as a cloud”
                  is perhaps a poem about removing oneself from the discomfort of the material world
                  through the power of imagination: "For oft, when on my couch I lie / In vacant or
                  in pensive mood, / They [the daffodils] flash upon that inward eye" (ll. 19-21). The
                  couch is now such a powerful figure for emotional disquiet on the one hand and general
                  apathy on the other. Instead of getting off the couch, one might argue, Wordsworth
                  finds a way to live there happily. If so, then Wordsworth's poem and the idealist
                  position it advances can easily be read as contributing to a work ethic that cloud
                  computing fully realizes. One no longer needs to leave the couch to work all of the
                  time. And for this reason, contemporary poetry's distrust of the lyric ego, legible
                  through its turn toward the materiality of the letter, offers some resistance to an
                  aesthetic ideology that displaces material life.</p>
               <p>But what Wordsworth's presumed idealism—his collapsing of subject and object—cannot
                  have controlled is itself newly legible with the insistent presence of "as," the conspicuous
                  use of figure now removed from Apple's rewriting of the poem's first line: "iCloud
                  / That floats on high o'er hills and vales." The process of articulation that names
                  aesthetics has become the absence of articulation as Wordsworth's conspicuous use
                  of figure disappears. In this way late capitalism sells us back Wordsworth's dream
                  as the imagined disarticulation of Wordsworth's dream. Whichever way one chooses,
                  one cannot miss one's way. If the aesthetics of late capitalism now includes the elimination
                  of figure (figured here by iCloud as compared to "I . . . as a cloud"), an elimination
                  of figure because there is nothing but figure—all parts are interchangeable—then paradoxically,
                  it is now Wordsworth's simile that stubbornly remains immobile. Perhaps there's a
                  chance for materialism even if it is indistinguishable from idealism. Wordsworth,
                  of course, never leaves the couch—at least not within the world the lyric imagines—but
                  what the insistence of "as" makes legible—and this might be the simplest if also the
                  most pun-ny way to put it by way of conclusion—Wordsworth is unwilling to work his
                  "as" off. What we have not yet come to terms with are the ways that the absolutely
                  formal system of late capitalism—one that advances absolute mobility and interchangeability—needs,
                  somewhat paradoxically, to eliminate the very figurative potential of language it
                  seems structured by.</p>
