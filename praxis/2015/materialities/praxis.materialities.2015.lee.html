               and folds. Radcliffe's Gothic narratives can be seen as assemblages that generate
               transpersonal affects and intensities. Their conservatism can be seen in how they
               conceive of agency as a force that arrests or works against the constant movement

            <p>Gothic things can create embarrassment—for example, the gigantic helmet that crashes
               down from the sky at the beginning of Horace Walpole's <em>The Castle of Otranto</em> (1764), or the inevitable trapdoor that appears in the floor, the candle that goes
               out just when you know it will, or the door that seems to bolt or unbolt itself. As
               Jane Austen suggests when <em>Northanger Abbey</em>'s heroine finds herself captivated by a mysterious lacquered cabinet, objects have
               a way of leading to the subject's mortification. But the problem is not simply one
               of animation, or the extension of human qualities to inanimate objects. A certain
               restless openness characterizes both human subjects and things. Gothic fiction can
               extinguish conceptual distinctions and narrative relations between subject and object
               in a radical manner. The contact is too intimate, too close, and too unmediated; the
               giant helmet and the puny body crushed under it form a grotesque material assemblage,
               as do Catherine Morland's "trembling hands [and] the hasp of the lock" (Austin 119).
               When Catherine examines and finally opens that cabinet in her room, furniture, heroine,
               and ambient environment meld into a fear-producing machine. Sounds within the body
               and those outside the room blend together, while motions ("the lock of her door was
               agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter") travel freely from environment
               to supposed inhabitant ("Catherine trembled from head to foot") and back again (124-5).</p>

               <p>The Gothic novel, that staple of Romantic publishing and reading, has always seemed
                  both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky reliance on formula
                  and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its superficial character appears
                  to indicate the existence of something deeper, or even unconscious. "The superficial
                  and the formulaic," as Elizabeth Napier puts it, "form the very heart of the Gothic"
                  (29). Marshall Brown has shown how Gothic fiction's clichés perform the function of
                  Freud's dream-work, communicating incommunicable desires.

                  </div> But I want to step back from this assumed paradox and ask whether this genre, particularly
                  in Radcliffe's handling, assumes anything distinctive about human consciousness: anything
                  that distinguishes it ontologically from the hollow caves and passages, mountains
                  and watchtowers, clouds, sounds, and effects of light and weather that fill its pages.
                  Or even more radically: is there anything but movement on the surface? Does the phenomenon
                  of interiority matter? Are subjects defined by their interiority or by intensities
                  that freely wander across forms and surfaces, coming and going? Do affects have anything
                  other than a temporary location? Does narrative have an inherent direction?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To ask this is to put into question some basic assumptions of reading: that subjects
                  are the subject, that landscape constitutes a background, that the novel is an exercise
                  in representation analogous to consciousness, or, more recently, that the novel is
                  an exercise in social will or construction.

                  </div> This essay engages a different set of assumptions and pursues a different, materialist
                  protocol of reading. It will examine Ann Radcliffe's <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em> (1794) as a phenomenon of continuous material surfaces and folds, rather than as a
                  reflection of consciousness or a purposive ideological construction. It will look
                  at how different elements of the novel move, rest, and collect into varied, manifold
                  assemblages that express a single intensive materiality. The Radcliffean novel will
                  be viewed as "a project of composition and synergy," to borrow a phrase from a recent
                  interpreter of Benedictus de Spinoza (Sharp 13). Humans and non-humans, affects and
                  things are brought into contact and combination in ways that defy conventional models
                  of agency, causality, or narrative teleology. In other words, Radcliffe's Gothic represents
                  a certain materialist vision of the world, but it does more than this. It accretes
                  and flexes its own materiality as a supple discursive thing, extended in time as well
                  as in space.

            <p>What emerges in Radcliffe's novels can be described as a vibrant materiality, to borrow
               a phrase from political theorist Jane Bennett. According to Bennett, what so-called
               new materialists study is "not a world... of subjects and objects, but of various
               materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations... a world populated less
               by individuals than by groups or compositions that shift over time" (354). They reject
               the Cartesian view of matter as "extended, uniform, and inert... solid, bounded objects
               that occupy space and whose movements... are predictable, controllable, and replicable"
               (Coole and Frost 7-8). Drawing on post-Newtonian science, they emphasize "matter's
               immanent vitality," the way that matter materializes as "excess, force... relationality"
               (8). Such approaches may seem incongruous in this context, a latter-day attempt to
               revive interest in Radcliffe by associating her with strange new worlds of theory.
               So it is surprising to discover, not only within Radcliffe's novels, but in the contemporary
               context of their production and reception, a similar way of thinking about materialism
               along these lines of impersonal transformations and transpersonal assemblages. The
               explanation may have to do more with Spinoza than with Deleuze: as Marjorie Levinson
               has recently shown in relation to William Wordsworth and Spinoza, questions of "social
               ontology," or of "being numerous" may well be as vital to the project of Romanticism
               as the Hegelian questions of representation and self-consciousness that have long
               dominated critical discourse (643).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The tendentious distinction between the natural and the social that Bruno Latour calls
                  the constitution of modernity was a preoccupation of the popular fiction of the time
                  as well as of the poetry. The natural world of things, "the mute and material multitude
                  of objects," is understood to stand over and apart from the clamorous social world
                  of human subjects, each world following its own laws and asserting its autonomy from
                  the other (29). Yet everywhere, as Latour argues, person-thing and fact-interpretation
                  hybrids proliferated, as it became modernity's distinctive self-given task to try
                  to sort them out, to restore the autonomy of human subjects from the world of things.
                  But their mutual imbrication has always been known. Readers and critics of Gothic
                  novels reserved their gravest concern not for what these novels represented, but for
                  what they seemed to do to the humans who consumed them.

                  </div> They worried about the physiological effects of repeated encounters with these types
                  of objects, about the loss of distinction and identity perceptible everywhere. Books,
                  authors, and readers switched places and blended identities within what might be called
                  a social-physical-narrative network. Critics deplored the tendency for boundaries
                  between subjects and things to dissolve, for powers to be communicated, and for unpredictable
                  affects to be generated. John Keats, for example, in his well-known tribute to the
                  romances of "Damosel Radcliffe," genially threatens to "cavern you and grotto you
                  and... wood you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous sound you and solitude you,"
                  offering a remarkable instance of what Deleuze and Guattari would call the deterritorialization
                  of language. Signifiers, signifieds, referents, and speaking subjects become nearly
                  indistinguishable: woods, rocks, solitude, and you become sounds, events of playful
                  aggression.

            <p>Radcliffe's novels present a materiality composed of shifting, heterogeneous assemblages.
               They are striated by rhythms of movement and rest that include environment, characters,
               and discourse. But there is another twist to this story. Radcliffe's plots are to
               an unusual extent comprised of nothing but movement and stasis, in dialectical relation
               to each other. This characteristic draws attention to the nature of narrative itself
               as an uninterrupted material flow of discourse; as a result, I want to suggest, the
               concept of <em>conatus</em> undergoes a subtle shift. In Spinoza's thought, <em>conatus</em> refers to a "striving to persevere in existence," an intrinsic force by which each
               thing tries to maintain itself (Sharp 125, 133-34). It is "a force of existence unique
               to each thing... a power of self-organization, self-maintenance" (133). Each entity
               tries to remain itself as far as possible. Radcliffe greatly relies on, but also greatly
               downgrades, this force as something within matter: things strive to persist but dissolve,
               materiality changes shape and form without pause. She thus creates a tentatively reflexive
               function in her narratives, a function that could be seen as a kind of melancholic
               agency. This function consists in explicitly recognizing sameness, persistence, or
               repetition.</p>
            <p>While the notoriously repetitive quality of Radcliffe's novels has often been remarked,
               what has gone less examined is the degree to which they pose the question of identity
               over time. Sometimes it is actually a question. In <em>The Italian</em> (1797): is this monk the same as the monk I saw before? At other times, it is an
               occasion for a certain affect: "'There!' she would exclaim, 'there are the very cliffs,
               there the wood of pines.... There, too, under the crag of that mountain, is the cottage...
               which he bade me remember, and copy with my pencil...!'" (<em>Udolpho</em> 92). Remembering and copying, which are equivalent, enable a subject to do one thing:
               to point out persistence, identity over time. In Radcliffe's novels, subjects seem
               to be composed, like everything else, as ratios of rest and motion, speed and slowness.
               They blend indifferently or dissolve ecstatically into larger assemblages. But Radcliffe
               strikingly invokes a special function of recognizing sameness and a particular form
               of pathos. Persistence over time is linked to an overarching affect of loss and absence.
               In other words, everything strives—and mostly fails—to persist in its own form, but
               only certain super-agents seem capable of keeping track, of perceiving vacancy and
               negativity, and of retaining consciously the traces of former combinations. There
               are two more points to make about this exiguous form of agency. First, it describes
               what Radcliffe's narrative itself does: the material flow of discourse continuously
               shifts and evolves into varying assemblages, repeats itself, but it also keeps track.
               Second, the affective charge given to persistence can be seen as making a deep, almost
               subliminal, case for a generically conservative stance. Material persistence can even
               be regarded as an achievement productive of the most powerful affects; it is not something
               to be taken lightly.</p>
            <p>In these novels so often thematized as novels about confinement, imprisoning structures
               have an inexplicable habit of opening themselves. In <em>The Italian</em>, characters find themselves trapped in a subterranean vault: "the door closed, with
               a thundering clap that echoed through all the vaults." It appears impenetrable. "The
               thick wood was inlaid with solid bars of iron; and was of such unconquerable strength,
               that it evidently guarded what had been designed for a prison" (76). Yet typically,
               this boundary dematerializes when, one chapter and a few hours later, they discover
               that the door "stood a little open": "He could scarcely believe his senses, since...
               he had not heard its ponderous bolts undrawn..." The hero, Vivaldi, darts out, "breathless
               with speed" (99). Confinement in <em>Udolpho</em> also leads to mysterious releases and then into prolonged states of wandering for
               no reason. Those heavy doors or walls rarely, if ever, exert a blocking or containing
               function, as we are reminded by countless crumbling castles— "shattered battlements
               and half-demolished walls" that have simply "from age and neglect, fallen to decay"
               (<em>Udolpho</em> 606). The boundaries may be hollowed out. Doors in the castles of Udolpho and Le
               Blanc frequently lead into a passage "formed within the thickness of the walls..."
               Emily is informed "that there are many passages of the same kind concealed within
               the prodigious walls of the edifice" (458). A supposed prisoner, Dupont, wanders around
               Udolpho, passing through these hollow walls, even hearing and speaking through them:
               "the shell of the wall was there so thin... that I could distinctly hear every word,
               spoken on the other side" (459). And as everyone knows, he takes the opportunity to
               become himself a disembodied, inhuman echo: "I listened closely to Montoni... joined
               my voice, and repeated his last words" (460), provoking much consternation. Such passages
               do not lead anywhere; they pass by and connect, joining places, voices, and affective
               possibilities.</p>
            <p>But more than architectural boundaries seem to be porous. Objects frequently dissolve,
               losing their shapes, identities, and even substance. Emily goes in search of her aunt,
               and perceives "a track of blood, upon a stair." She follows it to a door, enters and
               sees "something lying in an obscure corner of the room." In a strange discursive skip
               in being, Emily "hurried towards the object that excited her terror, when, perceiving
               the clothes of some person on the floor, she caught hold of them, and found in her
               grasp the old uniform of a soldier, beneath which appeared a heap of pikes and other
               arms" (323). Emily's movement toward the object is interrupted when the object becomes
               something else mid-sentence, a "heap" of blood-stained clothes that itself merely
               conceals discarded weapons. That collection gives way narratively to another "track
               of blood... upon the stairs," which prompts further inconclusive movements by Emily,
               down and up, forward and back. <em>The Italian</em> offers a similar moment in which "an object" becomes without warning a moving heap
               of "remains," only to resolve later in the chapter into "part of the habiliment of
               a monk" (76-78). These could be read as moments of successive discovery, but they
               can also be read as curious moments of shape-shifting or even thing-shifting. Rather
               than existing as solid, bounded things, Radcliffe's objects are restless. They can
               become movements or itineraries in the discourse: "Dorothée was telling of a door,
               that opened from a gallery, leading from the great stair-case into the last anti-room
               of the saloon" (<em>Udolpho</em> 560).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">

                  that also replicate themselves (Coole and Frost 15). Characters are often indistinguishable,
                  not only because they resemble each other (though they often do: in Terry Castle's
                  witty formulation, "Every other looks like every other other," and we could add that
                  every self looks the same as well), but because perceptions and affects travel freely
                  across and between them (128).

                           as a historically determined attitude (137).</span></div>
                  </div> In Chapter Five of the fourth volume, it soothes Emily's "pensive mind" to take long
                  walks in the woods in the evening, "watching, in tranquil melancholy, the gradual
                  effect of evening over the extensive prospect, till the gray waters of the Mediterranean
                  and the massy woods were almost the only features of the scene, that remained visible"
                  (540). Some fifty pages later, we encounter the same set of emotions and perceptions
                  moving across another set of characters in motion. Blanche, her father, and her lover
                  St. Foix are travelling through the Pyrenees, but any other class-appropriate characters
                  could be substituted here. Blanche, Emily's inexplicable double, is the first in this
                  scene to be assigned "a pensive pleasure, as she watched the progress of twilight
                  gradually spreading its tints over the woods and mountains, and stealing from the
                  eye every minuter feature of the scene, till the grand outlines of nature alone remained"
                  (598). The affect is next embodied in the lines of a poem in which the absent Emily
                  had already created a trope for this love of liminality ("To the Bat"). The poem addresses
                  its subject: "Thou lov'st to sport upon the twilight air, Mocking the eye, that would
                  thy course pursue... Thou flit'st athwart the pensive wand'rer's way..." (598). The
                  affect of pleasure seems to be itself a flickering materiality that crosses and recrosses
                  the path of the now-generalized "pensive wanderer." The biological substrate of "the
                  young St. Foix" is next in line as the temporary location of this affect. In this
                  scene and throughout the novel, affects are strangely impersonal or transpersonal
                  types of matter that float through various contingent locations. It would be an understatement
                  to say that character is underdetermined; their names barely serve to register the
                  frailest shade of distinction between them.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Radcliffe's materiality seems to consist in intensities rather than in solid, bounded
               extension. Thus, the distinction between inside and outside becomes irrelevant. Instead
               of measuring dimensions or referring to objects, Radcliffe's narrative typically tracks
               continuous gradations of intensity: heat and light, speed and slowness, relative concentrations
               of color. A representative passage in <em>Udolpho</em> notes "[t]he solitary grandeur of the objects that immediately surrounded her, the
               mountain-region towering above, the deep precipices that fell beneath, the waving
               blackness of the forests..." before ending with "the wide horizon, where the same
               melting blue tint seemed to unite earth and sky" (166). How can plural objects be
               solitary? How can Emily be "immediately surrounded" by regions "towering above" and
               "[falling] beneath"? What is a "waving blackness"? The scene is constituted not by
               things but by qualitative intensities or vague essences: aroundness, aboveness, beneathness,
               blackness. In order to track fluctuations of intensity rather than the fixed locations
               of objects, the narrative creates what Deleuze and Guattari refer to as smooth or
               nomadic space: "an open space through which things-flows are distributed, rather than...
               a closed space for linear and solid things" (361). In this mode, there is "no line
               separating earth and sky"; it is "a tactile space, or rather 'haptic,' a sonorous
               much more than a visual space" (382). As in the passages above, the erasure of the
               horizon seems to repeat, and to initiate a broader openness to which flickering or
               "vortical" movements draw attention. Smooth space is not uniform, but rather open
               to "becoming and heterogeneity, as opposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical,
               the constant" (361). This is the space within which local variations occur, to which
               the names of characters are sometimes given and sometimes denied. "To a warm imagination,
               the dubious forms that float, half veiled in darkness, afford a higher delight, than
               the most distinct scenery that the sun can shew" (<em>Udolpho</em> 598). The "warm" imagination is an intensity that merges imperceptibly and almost
               haptically with others, unlike the eye, too prone to perceive the dimensions of objects
               over against itself.</p>
            <p>The scene inaugurated by that statement is constituted as fluctuating or flowing intensities
               of energy. Standing a little apart from the rest of the group, which has taken shelter
               from a storm in a shallow cave, St. Foix views: <span class="quote">‘with emotions of awful sublimity, the long volumes of sulphureous clouds, that floated
                  along the upper and middle regions of the air; and the lightnings that flashed from
                  them, sometimes silently, and at others, followed by sullen peals of thunder, which
                  the mountains feebly prolonged, while the whole horizon, and the abyss, on which he
                  stood, were discovered in the momentary light. Upon the succeeding darkness, the fire,
                  which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam... on the surrounding figures
                  it threw a strong, though pale gleam... while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch,
                  that impended its shade over the cliff above, appeared a red, dusky tint, deepening
                  almost imperceptibly into the blackness of night. (601) ’</span> What this impersonal focalization offers are "regions" localized by varying intensities
               of energy—contained in the clouds, discharged as lightning (of different intensities),
               contained and released by the fire, and dissipating as light in a continuum of energy.
               The material world represented is constituted by the differences and continuities
               between the "partial gleam" and the "strong gleam," the "dusky tint" and the "blackness
               of night," and the continuities are not merely at the level of the signified, but
               at the acoustic and visual level of discourse as well. Even things more solid than
               light are thus constituted as "forces, energies, and intensities... and complex, even
               random processes" (Coole and Frost 13). Human subjects, too, are complex processes
               that intersect or join their environment; in any given landscape Valancourt (or Dupont)
               may be "standing upon the bank of the road, resting on his pike with folded arms"
               (37), while Emily (or Blanche) "wanders away" nomadically to merge into this spectrum
               of intensity, "listening in deep silence" (37).</p>
            <p>I have, of course, been discussing what Radcliffe's novels represent, the sort of
               materiality that they seem to show or imagine for us. But the peculiar power of these
               novels lies in the way that they often seem to bypass this power of representing.
               They distribute discursive material through a smooth or nomadic space, at times intensifying
               its energy through concentration and at other times dissipating it. Another way to
               put this is that Radcliffe constructs discursive assemblages that produce powerful
               affects more through spatial contiguity and density than through syntactical relations.
               Representation requires elements to be put together in a certain way in order to produce
               a picture, whether you think of Kant's transcendental unity of apperception or of
               the rules of language. I would argue that Radcliffe's famed descriptive effects gesture
               toward a different use of discourse, one in which elements are linked neither hypotactically
               nor paratactically, but in a flexible linguistic assemblage or network that can be
               compressed or stretched out, usually over many pages. A typical assemblage from <em>Udolpho</em> might comprise the following: a cave—the sound of a dog barking—a rude bridge—an
               opposite cliff—a light—voices—"a single watch-tower"—a story—"a cloudy moon" (601-605).
               The representational or referential dimension of this assemblage cannot be entirely
               dismissed, but that dimension is tenuous, untotalizable in its shifting from visual
               to haptic to acoustic references. Its affective power seems to derive from the ways
               in which these signifiers do not add up to a single, fixed composition or mental image.</p>
            <p>Assemblages bring or join things together in a way that is inherently dynamic or non-totalizable.
               Radcliffe's narrative discourse moves continually, imbuing its regions with different
               quantities of intensity, creating densely- or sparsely-populated assemblages. It is
               motion rather than logic, smooth space rather than syntax that gives rise to the assemblage.
               The ancient fortress where Blanche's party takes shelter is another such heterogeneous
               assemblage: silence—path—summit—gate—view of main body—grey stone—an arch—shattered
               battlements—remains of a giant oak (606). The continual restless and recursive movement
               of Radcliffe's discourse draws attention to the looseness with which its parts are
               conjoined, including the part we generally call meaning or signification. Assemblages
               may feature flashes of reference, allusions to meaning, as in this one: curiosity
               of Blanche—Emily smiling—grave silence of Dorothée—the spectacle in the chamber of
               Udolpho—"the alarming words that had accidentally met her eye in the MS papers"—the
               black veil (491). The logical, or even narrative, relation between such elements counts
               for little; pure discursive or material proximity matters far more because it is only
               this contact or combination that can produce powerful affects. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is well known that contemporary critics condemned Gothic novels because they could
                  and did "produce so powerful an effect" on their readers (<em>Monthly Review</em>, qtd. in Watt 115). It is not inaccurate to say that Radcliffe's readers saw her
                  novels as material assemblages that affected them through direct physical contact.
                  In E.J. Clery's account, "the distracted mass audience absorbs the [novels] osmotically,
                  habitually," through "tactile appropriation" (152). In <em>Northanger Abbey</em>'s sharp parody, we recall, Henry Tilney boasts of literally appropriating his sister's
                  copy of <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em>, "running away with the volume which... was her own, particularly her own" (78).
                  Physical contact with the volume brings about an explosion of motion (ending in "the
                  Hermitage-walk"). Tilney argues that he was compelled or propelled "in my eagerness
                  to get on, refusing to wait only five minutes"; his consumption of the novel is measured
                  in terms of time and somatic effect ("finishing it in two days—my hair standing on
                  end the whole time" [77]). Readers and novels form grotesque assemblages, not unlike
                  the disorienting swarms and multitudes that were identified with Gothic architecture.

                  </div> The products of the Minerva Press had a way of blurring all identities. As Clery notes,
                  such novels were generally published anonymously or under a pseudonym, and sometimes
                  were merely reshuffled and repackaged versions of other novels (138).

                  to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern" (82). The identities of authors or
                  even the function of representation became less important than the sheer material
                  proliferation of these novels, as lending libraries established themselves in "booksellers...engravers,
                  and picture-framers, grocers, jewellers, confectioners, tobacconists, perfumers, ironmongers"
                  (qtd. Clery 136).</p>

                  (Deleuze and Guattari 88). This was a powerful kind of agency, an ability to make

                  </div> Gothic novels linked bodies and discourse together to produce strong affects that
                  transcended individual personhood and agency. The favored tropes of Gothic criticism
                  reflect an awareness of this process. Gothic novels are consistently represented as
                  itineraries, recipes, or a set of transformational procedures to be performed. They
                  instruct their readers, critics complain, that "a young person [should] walk at night
                  upon the battlements of an old castle... creep hands and feet along a narrow passage"
                  (qtd. in Watt 81). Gothic novels produce and reproduce themselves, barely requiring
                  the intervention of persons: "Take—An old castle... a long gallery, with a great many
                  doors... Noise, whispers, and groans... Mix them together..." (qtd. Clery 147). Another
                  critic gives instructions: "[f]rom any romance to make a novel. Where you find...
                  A Castle..... put An house. A cavern... A bower. A groan... A sigh," presenting two
                  parallel substitutable series of elements side by side: "The same table of course
                  answers for transmuting a novel into a romance."

                  </div> A Gothic novel is itself a loose, non-linear material assemblage that cares little
                  for the exact number, location, or identity of its parts. What counts is occurrence,
                  recurrence, combination, and connection. One point can connect to any other point,
                  in rhizomatic fashion, and the more connections, the better.</p>
            </div>
            <p>There is a paradox that emerges in the criticism and even simply in the reading of
               these novels: we could call it familiar surprise, or predictable unpredictability.
               The novel's discourse continually moves and changes in order to present us with the
               same: yet another animal-vegetable-mineral-light-sonority assemblage. In <em>Udolpho</em>, assemblages form, fade, decay, and then inexplicably reappear. Volume 4 is another
               Volume 1, retracing the same combinations of motion and rest, speed and slowness,
               offering remarkably similar moments, affects, assemblages. But such conjunctures are
               not supposed to be predictable or measurable; affective power is tied to surprise.
               But how can surprise coexist with such a high degree of repetition? The answer, I
               think, points toward a crucial feature of Radcliffe's narrative ontology, one that
               ties her to the so-called new materialism. Instead of being assumed to be static,
               substantial, and unchanging, materiality is understood as a contingent conjuncture
               or fragile assemblage that does not stay the same. It is a slow-motion flicker or
               flash. The assemblage is always gradually fading, disappearing, or evanescing; this
               is as true of the novel's discourse itself, its ceaseless flow of words, as of the
               represented dimension. Instead of posing the question of how beings can change, in
               other words, Radcliffe's discourse asks how things or assemblages can stay the same
               or repeat, how the same encounter can occur again. Persistence is always a surprise;
               recurrence nothing short of a miracle. Emily ends many chapters waiting for once-heard
               music to return: <span class="quote">‘almost expecting, that... the sounds would return....Emily continued to listen, but
                  no music came... Thus passed the hour in watchfulness... but no sounds returned; and,
                  after remaining at the casement, till the light tint of dawn began to edge the mountain-tops
                  and steal upon the night-shade, she concluded, that they would not return. (340)’</span> Yet, though Emily fails to hear them, Radcliffe's sonorous assemblages are able to
               exert a powerful force in the narrative.</p>
            <p>Expectation and the capacity for disappointment give crucial hints as to Radcliffe's
               peculiar notion of agency. Agency is conceived not as a force that brings about change,
               but as that which lags behind change, or anticipates repetition, incorporating an
               otherwise inconceivable dimension of negativity into this material world. The distinction
               between subjects and objects is not necessary to maintain. Agency can be thought of
               as something like matter's own memory and expectation: that which preserves traces,
               keeps track of former iterations and assemblages, an after-intensity. It can be exercised
               by things or people, or distributed over assemblages: "there are the very cliffs,
               there are the wood of pines... There.. is the cottage," Emily notes when returning
               home at the beginning of the novel (92). She gives a local voice to a striving to
               persist that is not otherwise much in evidence. The last volume notes "the very avenue"
               that Emily had walked earlier; Emily points out to herself "the same high trees that
               used to wave over the terrace, and these the same flowery thickets... and there, too,
               on that bank, are the very plants" (583). This is in some ways the opposite of remembering;
               it is simply the awareness of persistence. Emily repeats the same assemblages: those
               steps, the terrace, the pavilion, Valancourt. In terms of the plot, persistence over
               time becomes visible against the ground of non-identity; in this case, the belief
               that Valancourt has changed morally: "he was no longer the same Valancourt." From
               this point of view, non-identity amounts almost to annihilation: "Valancourt seemed
               to be annihilated" (581). Yet the agency of retracing is so strong as to summon him
               into presence as part of this assemblage. "These recollections becoming too painful
               to be endured, she abruptly left the pavilion.. As she passed along the terrace, she
               perceived a person, walking... Valancourt! ...Emily, her eyes fixed on the place...
               remained, for some moments, unable to quit the spot, and scarcely conscious of existence"
               (586). Agency in this scene can be considered as the force that slows Emily down,
               reassembles an earlier conjuncture (pavilion—terrace—Valancourt), and fixes her to
               the spot, "scarcely conscious," thing-like. It seems to exist in excess of the immanent,
               ceaseless flow of materiality.</p>
            <p>As an arresting, persisting, or retracing dimension, agency belongs most strongly
               to the most notorious thing in Udolpho: what lies behind the black veil. We recall
               that Emily first approaches this object as part of a conscious effort "[t]o withdraw
               her thoughts... from the subject of her misfortunes" (248). It succeeds in withdrawing
               not only her thoughts but her consciousness. The horror produced by the "veiled picture,"
               the narrative announces, "awakened all [her] powers" only to extinguish them when
               she perceives that the object behind the veil "was no picture" (249). Only in the
               final pages of the novel, to the eternal chagrin of readers, we learn that it was
               "a waxen image, made to resemble a human body in the state, to which it is reduced
               after death" (662). But from a material or ontological point of view, it is nothing
               to dismiss. It is not a picture, but neither is it "the murdered body of the lady
               Laurentini" (553). We could say of this body of wax that "an energetic materiality
               overspills the prepared matter" (Deleuze and Guattari 410). Its material agency certainly
               extends beyond its particular form or blurred figure. "A member of the house of Udolpho
               had been condemned to the penance of contemplating [it] during certain hours of the
               day"; and had "made it a condition in his will, that his descendants should preserve
               the image..." (<em>Udolpho</em> 662). The body of wax preserves its impressions and is itself preserved, "suffered
               to retain its station in the wall of the chamber" (663). But what it preserves, what
               seems to give it its uniquely petrifying effect on its observers, is the very frozen
               essence of materiality: "a human figure of ghastly paleness, stretched at its length,
               and dressed in the habiliments of the grave... the face appeared partly decayed and
               disfigured by worms, which were visible on the features and hands. On such an object...no
               person could endure to look twice" (662). There is the official horror of the <em>memento mori</em>, the reminder of flesh's decay. But beyond this, the object's powerful affect comes
               from the way it artificially arrests a certain material conjuncture, captures materiality
               in the act of decaying intensity, of changing phase and form. It attempts to stop
               the narrative's constant movement through this material image, and succeeds in more
               than one sense: putting a stop to the motor force of the reader's desire to look on
               the other side of the black veil. The agency of this object is powerful indeed, its
               pure persistence underlined by its apparent effect on viewers: "no person could endure
               to look twice."</p>
            <p>What this reading has tried to do is to question the relation between the novel and
               the individual, and to question the methodological individualism that still drives
               even recent critiques of the genre. Many important studies of the novel have focused
               on how the novel relies on, or alternatively, constitutes the subjectivity located
               within the boundaries of an individual human body. Nancy Armstrong, for example, has
               recently argued that "the novel was not made to think beyond the individual" (25).
               Radcliffe's novels, falling as they do within the general category of what Armstrong
               and many others have called the "literature of sensibility," may not seem to seriously
               challenge such arguments; indeed, Armstrong specifically maintains that such literature
               "opposes this individualism" through the mechanism of affective contagion (16). Armstrong
               also points out that after Radcliffe it became essential for the mainstream novel
               to include "Gothic elements" (12). However, the "gothic elements" in question need
               not be defined in terms of supernatural events, ghosts, creepy castles, and so forth.
               Rather, I would like to suggest that the gothic or Radcliffean element resides, on
               the one hand, in a persistent depersonalization of affect, and on the other hand,
               in an awareness of materiality as vital, in motion, and possessed of agency. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The depersonalization of affect in Radcliffe is extreme: a feeling can be anyone's
                  feeling, even if a story is usually somebody's story.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> But we need to consider affect not so much as delimited, defined sensations but as
                  "an encounter between bodies that involves...a qualitative change... in the intensity
                  of a being's power to persevere," in Hasana Sharp's gloss (26-29). Thus, affect cannot
                  be the property of a single person; it is a relation that occurs at what might be
                  called a molecular or micro-level. And the connection that Sharp makes between depersonalization
                  and freedom, that "freedom involves a kind of depersonalization," seems to me central
                  to any appeal that novels might possess (139).

                           and is intended to offer an alternative to the Hegelian politics of recognition, which
                           aims ultimately at the reinforcement of self-conscious identity through the consciousness
                           of the other.</span></div>
                  </div> In other words, the difference between particular affects—and even individual characters—may
                  not be as important as the transactions or contacts that occur between them. Novels
                  create links and assemblages, though not always as visibly as in the case of Radcliffe.
                  We might even say, in Bennett's words, that they reveal "not a world... of subjects
                  and objects, but of various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations...
                  groupings or compositions that shift over time" (354). Drawing attention to what he
                  calls "romantic physicalism," Colin Jager has suggested the importance in Romantic
                  and post-Romantic discourse of the consciousness-matter relation. I would agree with
                  Jager that one important consequence of reformulating the debate, of bringing matter
                  back into it, is a change in how political terms get defined: "it deflates the language
                  of progressive and conservative because it deflates the oppositions (mind/nature,
                  subject/object) in which that particular political debate is embedded, and returns
                  us to the more defined—if no less mysterious—terrain of the mind-body problem" (47).
                  I would add that it doesn't simply deflate the idea of conservatism, but rather situates
                  it at a molecular level. Radcliffe's understanding of matter as in constant, swerving
                  movement places a high value on persistence, on the preservation of traces; the phenomenon
                  of persistence even amounts to a special kind of agency. This is the level, I think,
                  at which her novels' conservatism can be examined. Phenomena of revolution and counter-revolution
                  can be grasped not only in structures of affect, temporality, or suspended action
                  (as in the "agonized waiting" that Mary Favret describes in her study of Romantic
                  war-time temporality), but in the ways that narratives spin out their own shifting
                  networks of materiality (75). Finally, Radcliffe's notion of materiality also overturns
                  the idea that narrative consists in change and difference (in things happening to
                  people, or people making things happen); it suggests a way of reading narrative not
                  as chained sequences of cause and effect, but as heterogeneous assemblages and chance
                  conjunctures of effects that sometimes cut transversely across the linear duration
                  of the narrative, and sometimes rely on that duration to accrete a certain thickness
                  or intensity. Radcliffe's narratives themselves illustrate the melancholic, conservative
                  agency of tracing the same assemblages again and again.</p>
