               <p rend="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael
                  Quilligan and Kyle Bickoff, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial
                  transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref
                     target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI
                  markup modifications according to RC house style applied by Michael Quilligan and Kyle Bickoff. TEI
                  renders text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura
                  Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT
                  transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref>
                  that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this
                  volume includes elements from <ref

               <p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is
                  devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation
                  of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the
                  circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <title
                     level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where
                  Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a
                  plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold
                  on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <title level="j"
                     >RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most
                  exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
