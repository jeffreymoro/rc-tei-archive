                    <p>Sitting on the sofa in his comfortable library, or perhaps at the desk in his
                        attic study with a view of the hills and the lake beyond, a man rather
                        advanced in years turns the pages of a book of poetry, other volumes by the
                        same author arrayed on the shelf or on the table nearby. He reads some lines
                        of verse aloud or recites them from memory; he knows the words well and very
                        much enjoys repeating them. As he slowly turns the pages looking at poems
                        written over the course of a fifty year career, he reflects on the
                        circumstances of their creation; he recalls the particular experiences which
                        impelled him to compose them, for the poems he peruses are in fact his own.
                        He shares his reflections with a friend who devotedly sits with him for many
                        hours day after day for the many days it takes to look through seven volumes
                        of verse. The friend faithfully transcribes what he says, filling one
                        hundred and eighty leaves of a notebook with a history of a writing life and
                        an archeology of a poetic practice.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                            I am indebted to the account of the retrospective project in the
                            “Introduction” to <title level="m">The Fenwick Notes of William
                                Wordsworth</title>, ed. Jared Curtis (Penrith: Humanities-Ebooks,
                            2007), 12-28.</note> Fenwick, who had moved to Ambleside in 1838 to be
                        near the Wordsworths, encouraged and then collaborated on the poet’s project
                        of intensive retrospection which began when they sat down together in
                        January 1843, Fenwick’s pen poised to take dictation as Wordsworth opened
                        the first volume of the most recently published edition of his writings,
                        Edward Moxon’s 1841 <title level="m">Poetical Works</title>, turned the
                        pages past the frontispiece portrait (the white-haired Bard of Rydal Mount),
                        to recall a lifetime of writing poems, beginning with those referring to the
                        period of childhood. They finished their retrospective project six months
                        later in June 1843 with Wordsworth’s commentary on <title level="m">The
                            Excursion</title>, which extends to more than twenty leaves of Fenwick’s
                        notebook. This commentary includes circumstances he remembers about the
                        specific places and persons and situations from the past that he considers
                        the originating ground of the poem and thus its claim to a certain kind of
                        truth value (as he repeatedly insists, “every particular was exactly as I
                        have related”),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Ibid., 209. Future page
                            references will appear in the body of the essay.</note> but it also
                        registers the passage of time since writing it in a sense of loss or regret
                        infused into his present experience—for example, he notes the recent death
                        of his “lamented friend Southey” (195) and his “utter detestation” of an
                        ostentatious boat-house “now” (206) being built in Grasmere which will mar
                        the beauty and seclusion of that beloved lakeshore, as well as more public
                        sorrows such as the failure of “the present session of Parliament” to
                        improve the lot of children laboring in factories (214). Such references to
                        current events and feelings within his account of a poem written decades
                        earlier suggests the contingency not just of that particular creation, but
                        of the retrospective project itself. Memory unfolds here in real time,
                        opening the past in and to present circumstances and effects.</p>
                    <p>I will be looking at a particular piece of Wordsworth’s retrospective
                        project—his much cited remarks on the poem he refers to in 1843 simply as
                        “The Ode”—but it is worth noticing the temporal chiasmus operating in this
                        retrospective enterprise more broadly. When he sits down to read his own
                        poems once again, he engages in a redoubled and especially sustained process
                        of recollection in which looking back day after day enacts retrospection
                        going forward, as duration, a condition of the on-going present if not also
                        of the possible futures to which that present is always giving way.
                        Temporalities converge and intersect. The past acquires its particular form
                        and inflection from the present; it becomes, we might say, always already
                            new.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Insofar as Wordsworth’s
                            reflections on writing his poems can be understood as a remediation of
                            sorts, as I try to suggest here, Lisa Gitelman’s idea that new media
                            arise out of old and function as “socially embedded sites for the
                            ongoing negotiation of meaning ” would aptly describe his collaborative
                            enterprise with Fenwick. See Lisa Gitelman, <title level="m">Always
                                Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture</title>
                            (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2008), 6. See also Jay David Bolter and Richard
                            Grusin, <title level="m">Remediation: Understanding New Media</title>
                            (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000).</note> Let me mention that during the
                        months Wordsworth is thus engaged he turns seventy-three and is also
                        appointed Poet Laureate, an honor he initially refuses because he thinks
                        himself too old. He is in fact producing very little new work at this time,
                        though new editions of his previous writing continue to appear and he will
                        in the years ahead arrange for the posthumous publication of an authorized
                        biography as well as of the poem he calls “the long Poem on my own
                        education” or “the poem on the growth of my own Mind” (188) known to us as
                            <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. Though the ambitious annotation
                        project the poet undertakes late in his career may not constitute a wholly
                        “new idiom” such as Edward Said sees great artists developing near the end
                        of their lives, still we may find that the aging poet’s retrospective
                        account of his poetic practice does revisionary work and thereby offers an
                        opportunity for us to rethink some of the central and abiding formulations
                        of his (and Romantic) literary history. The old Wordsworth may be the new
                        Wordsworth for our time.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Said,

                    <p>As concerned as he had been at least since the poems and prefaces of <title
                            level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> with the question of reading,
                        especially of reading poetry, the Fenwick project highlights the extent to
                        which Wordsworth was a continuous reader and re-reader of his own writing,
                        and correlatively, the extent to which his writing entails and embeds the
                        supplement of reading. But I invoke the scene of the aging poet sitting with
                        Isabella Fenwick in the library or study at Rydal Mount in addition to
                        remind us how much Wordsworth’s writing was always and fundamentally a
                        social and embodied phenomenon, coming into being in the nexus of specific
                        relationships to individuals and communities and in the context of specific
                        situations, environments, and material conditions. The Fenwick notes
                        repeatedly attest to the circumstantial and materially determined nature of
                        poetic invention. His gloss on “We are Seven,” for instance, famously
                        recounts what Wordsworth calls “one of the most remarkable facts in my own
                        poetic career” (39)—that is, the inception of <title level="m">Lyrical

                        Coleridge in the Spring of 1798, or, more exactly, in their determination to
                        compose a poem to send to the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> to
                        finance that trip. Moreover, the scene of the production of the Fenwick
                        notes itself reminds us that poems are objects within a particular (if
                        changing) field of embodied activity and experience. When he holds the book
                        of poems, turning the pages to read them and reflect aloud on the details of
                        their composition—how they came to be the particular poems they are, and
                        thus how he came to be the poet he is, sitting there, turning the pages,
                        reading them—Wordsworth touches something that is one among the things in
                        the world that thereby touch him in return, for inevitably, what we touch,
                        touches us.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I am here adapting the terms

                        earthly years” ("A Slumber"), what the aging poet reviewing his life’s work
                        in the unavoidable knowledge of its approaching end must feel not just in
                        the abstract—as nostalgia, for instance, or as emotion recollected in
                        tranquility—but somatically, as a palpable pressure, however slight or
                        fleeting, a mild sensation on the surface of his skin, felt on the flesh, if
                        not also in the blood or along the heart. His hand upon the page, such

                        mutual between the toucher and the touched. It is at this interstitial point
                        or plane of contact, an interface between person and thing, that the body,
                        according to Jean-Luc Nancy, would experience “its own weight,”<note

                        say, the very lightness, of its own corporeal being. Nancy proposes that
                            “<emph>touching</emph>—happens in writing all the time” (11): “. . . the
                        page itself is a touching (of my hand while it writes, and your hands while
                        they hold the book) . . . a slight, resistant, fine texture, the
                        infinitesimal dust of a contact” (51); this dust, he suggests, is “the
                        ob-jected matter of the sub-ject” (29). To put it another way, let us
                        extrapolate from Theodor Adorno’s dialectical model of the relations of
                        subject and object to consider that when Wordsworth turns the pages upon
                        which his poems are printed, “subjectivity is grasped as the object’s form”:
                        in its encounter with the object, even or especially the object of its own
                        making, the subject can no longer—at least for the moment that they
                        touch—persist in “forgetting how much it is an object itself.”<note

                        his poetry, arguing that while his language aspires to material
                        efficacy—words as things—even such a rhetorical near approach to the
                        tangible is threatening, “marked with death and effacement.”<note

                        Isabella Fenwick writes down as he turns the pages of the volume he holds in
                        his hands (and to which I will return), “objects of sight” such as the wall
                        or tree at which he would many times grasp to remind himself that “external
                        things [have] external existence.” For Hartman, as for Nancy, all art may
                        involve a “kind of touching” (22), especially, for Hartman, mimetic art, in
                        that representation subsists in some relation to reality, whether regressive
                        or restorative or substitutive. But despite his early compulsion to grasp
                        the wall or tree, Wordsworth is not ultimately a poet of touch, or the
                        tangible, or even the visible in Hartman’s influential analysis; instead,
                        his poetry “almost transcends representation,” seeming to exist, Hartman
                        says, “without the material density of poetic texture—without imagistic or
                        narrative detail” (27) or, we might add, without the book or the pages he
                        turns when he reviews his writing at Rydal Mount in 1843.<note place="foot"

                    <p>I keep coming back to the prosaic scene of the poet turning the pages of the
                        book in his hand to draw attention to the mostly unacknowledged and yet
                        fundamental materiality at issue in the everyday practices of reading and
                        writing and thus in the apprehension of the literary artifact as such, both
                        what it is and what it may become for its writer and its readers. Even as I
                        write (or, rather, type) this sentence, that materiality and those practices
                        are undergoing significant transformation. The page is now often digitized,
                        as this one is; we might turn it by tapping on a button or swiping a finger
                        across the surface of a screen. The specific situation in which the body
                        encounters the work of art is always under construction. In looking with
                        some insistence at Wordsworth turning the pages of his book as Isabella
                        Fenwick transcribes his commentary on his creative process, I do not mean to
                        claim that the medium is the message; I do, however, want to suggest that
                        specific and changing forms of mediation constitute a “material density” at
                        the conceptual ground of the literary enterprise and it is in relation to
                        such materiality that the meanings and values the work of art variously
                        acquires and confers are determined. Further, I want to suggest that however
                        infinitesimal its dust, Wordsworth implicitly understood the force and
                        consequence of such materiality as foundational to the operation of the
                        imagination and to the identity of the poet as agental subject or creative
                        consciousness. </p>
                    <p>As a retrospective project, the Fenwick notes remember the making of each
                        poem, and crucially thereby the making of the poet <foreign>qua</foreign>
                        poet; moreover, in the very quotidian drama (“little, nameless, unremembered
                        acts”) of the hand turning the pages of the book, that project in addition
                        does not forget that poem as well as poet are always being grasped in
                        material form, or, in Nancy’s terms, as ob-jected matter. While his early
                        poetics may be constructed specifically against what Stephan Uhlig calls
                        “poetic objecthood,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephan H. Uhlig,

                        unavoidable reliance on (even his investment in) the materiality of his
                        poetic practice. The poet performs even if he does not theorize the everyday
                        efficacy of objects in the Romantic imaginary. And yet, he does offer a kind
                        of thing theory in the Fenwick notes. His reflections on the origins of each
                        poem collectively articulate a logic of embodiment—that poems come into
                        being as situated phenomena, that they are written and read as singular
                        artifacts within a complex and contingent relational field. Wordsworth had
                        of course long aspired in his poetry to keep the reader “in the company of
                        flesh and blood” (“Preface” to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>).
                        Perhaps we might go so far as to say that in the Fenwick project as he sits
                        turning pages and she sits with him taking dictation, he is thinking through
                        the body as the very condition for making and apprehending the work of art.
                        To say this is not to claim primacy in the production of meaning and value,
                        either for the hand turning the page, or for the inanimate object, the book
                        or the paper; it is not to argue for a strictly materialist ontology that
                        would exclude any/thing not immediately available to the senses. But it is
                        to return, as Wordsworth himself does in the note I want to look at briefly
                        in closing, to the question of the subject’s relation to the object and to
                        the function of the intimate contact—the touch—that puts them into that
                        relation. </p>
                    <p>Paul De Man rejected the problematic of the subject’s relation to the
                        object—the mind to nature—as an “impasse” in the discourse of Romanticism, a
                        “pseudo dialectic” that masks the “painful knowledge” of time, and death,
                        and the difference of the self from the non-self that is expressed in a
                        rhetoric of temporality, as allegory or irony.<note place="foot"

                        of vertigo, and in particular in reading Wordsworth, locates it at the

                        even illusory: “the experience hits as a sudden feeling of dizziness, a
                        falling or a threat of falling, a vertige of which there are many examples

                        contact of subject and object that Wordsworth acknowledges temporality and
                        the condition of being a body in time. </p>

                        external existence” (159): <quote>I communed with all that I saw as

                            myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that time I was
                            afraid of such processes. In later periods of life I have deplored, as

                        to open for the young Wordsworth is significantly not a function of the
                        difference of the self from the non-self but of the total assimilation or
                        abstraction of the material world into or as the subject, “the world of his

                        also inevitably conduces to its own constraining effects (“subjugation,” or
                        what “The Ode” calls “shades of the prison-house” [67]). What he touches,
                        touches him. But if the child who touches the wall or tree as an anchor
                        against idealist free-fall is father to the man who deplores the limits thus
                        imposed upon his imagination by “sense and outward things” (145), the note
                        also intimates that the transformative capacity of being in time can turn
                        fear into rejoicing even as it leaves its traces on the aging body, the
                        infinitesimal dust of a contact. </p>
                    <p> I have only begun to suggest how this note condenses the story the Fenwick
                        project implicitly tells about what Wordsworth touched. This is a story not
                        just about the past, about remembering things that existed and how they came
                        to be, but also about how things (objects, bodies) change over time—must
                        change—in order to endure. When in the process of the retrospective exercise
                        he undertakes with Isabella Fenwick in 1843 he thus necessarily makes
                        contact with external things that have external existence, including the
                        pages of books, he is not so much proclaiming an “ontic unity of all things,
                        including human things,” as Paul Fry has recently argued.<note place="foot"

                        affirming a deep ecology that comprehends “all thinking things, all objects
                        of all thought” (“Lines” 102) as “one life” (<title level="m">The

                            123.2 (March 2008): 390-404.</note> Rather, as when he was a boy
                        repeatedly reaching out to grasp a wall or tree, the old man’s touch
                        establishes a relationality that is fluctuating and fragile at the point or
                        plane where the self is distinguished from the non-self, where the subject
                        in its very intimacy with the object becomes the particular subject it is,
                        limited to and by a particular body. The old man’s touch lingers, day after
                        day, an infinitesimal dust. No impasse, this may be the everyday prose of
                        poetry: it conveys that we feel most in and of the world, situated, embodied
                        in relation to external things when we feel how tenuous our hold on those
                        things is, and yet hold them close as if our own life depended on it.</p>
