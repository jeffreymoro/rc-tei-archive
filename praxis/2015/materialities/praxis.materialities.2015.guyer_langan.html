               <p>In his landmark essay, 
                  “The Secret Life of Things,”
                  (1999), a prelude to <em>Thing Theory</em> (2003), Bill Brown acknowledges that his title will bring to mind "a line from William
                  Wordsworth or Percy Shelley, or one of ETA Hoffmann's uncanny tales."  This gesture
                  at once cites and brackets Romantic writers, allowing them to reverberate in the background
                  of an argument in which Brown attends explicitly to the 1920s (as a period in which
                  "things emerge as the object of profound theoretical engagement" in Georg Lukács,
                  Martin Heidegger, and Walter Benjamin), and to a short story by Virginia Woolf, 
                  “Solid Objects”
                  (1920). It somehow seems fitting that Brown's reference to <em>Romantic</em> things should be so <em>vaguely</em> allusive—not to say elusive—given the longstanding tendency to oppose Romanticism
                  and materialism.  But the inexactness of the citation has the unexpectedly amplifying
                  effect of allowing a palimpsest of lines to spring to mind:  from 
                  “Tintern Abbey”
                  ("We see into the life of things") "And I have felt... / a sense sublime/ Of something
                  far more deeply interfused... A motion and a spirit, that impels/ All thinking things,
                  all objects of all thought,/ And rolls through all things"; and from Shelley's 
                  “Mont Blanc”
                  ("The everlasting universe of things/ Rolls through the mind").  As this virtual universe
                  of "thing" lines rolls through our minds, it's worth stopping in our tracks a bit,
                  to notice something to which Brown does not pay attention:  the proximity of <em>things</em> to <em>thinking</em> in these Romantic examples of "thing theory."</p>
               <p>One could cite many more examples of such proximity, but we'll content ourselves with
                  one of the most familiar, from Byron's <em>Don Juan</em>: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">But words are things, and a small drop of ink,</div>
                     <div class="l">Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces</div>
                     <div class="l">That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think (3.793-95).</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> To (re)read this passage in the context of Thing Theory is to imagine that it was
                  Byron, not William Godwin, who responded to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's own "call for
                  papers": <span class="quote">‘I wish you would write a book on the power of words, and the processes by which human
                     feelings form affinities with them - in short, I wish you to <em>philosophize</em> Horne Tooke's System, and to solve the great Questions . . . Is <em>thinking</em> impossible without arbitrary signs? . . . In something of this order I would endeavour
                     to destroy the old antithesis of <em>Words &amp; Things</em>, elevating, as it were, words into Things, &amp; living Things too. All the nonsense
                     of vibrations etc you would of course dismiss. (Coleridge to William Godwin, 22 September,
                     1800, <em>Letters</em>, 1:625-26)’</span> Many readers of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> will be familiar with John Horne Tooke's etymological argument that "to think" bears
                  a direct relation to "things":  "Remember, where we now say <em>I think</em>, the antient expression was<em>—Me thinketh</em>, i.e., <em>Me thingeth, It thingeth me</em>"(609).  "Thinking things"—in the sense of (1) attributing thought to things; (2)
                  thinking <em>about</em> things; and (3) thinking <em>through</em> things—would seem to be at the foundation of Romantic interest in the "<em>real</em> language of men" (emphasis added, Brett &amp; Jones 241).</p>
               <p>No doubt the amount of ink (and other material supports for discourse) recently expended
                  on the topic of "things" in literature had the not-quite uncanny effect, in 2011,
                  of independently prompting the MLA's English Romantic Period and the Comparative Romantic
                  and Nineteenth Century Literature Divisions to convene panels designed to explore
                  how "things" might be thought Romantically.  Certainly these sessions were not in
                  any way the first to wonder what a <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic</span> thing theory might look like; Colin Jager in 2007 and Eric Lindstrom in 2010 both
                  suggested the subtitle of William Godwin's <em>Caleb Williams</em>—
                  “Things as They Are”
                  —ought to be considered as a point of departure.  This "astringent, jointly metaphysical/political"
                  phrase (Lindstrom 481) implicitly opposes itself to "things as they might be" (Jager
                  par. 7).  And at more or less the same time as our panelists were presenting their
                  papers, Mary Jacobus' book <em>Romantic Things: A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud</em> (Chicago, 2012) appeared.  </p>
               <p>Jacobus' <em>Romantic Things</em> makes only passing reference to thing theory, but in linking the objects of her subtitle
                  to such other putative "things" as death, absence, and vacancy, she makes a case for
                  Wordsworth as "the negative phenomenologist of Romantic thingness" (129).  Not clouds
                  but "/cloud/"— Hubert Damisch's name for what in painting "is the sign of the volume
                  repressed by modern painting's fixation on the flatness of the representational surface"
                  (12)—is the paradigm for this negative phenomenology:a phenomenology which notably
                  undermines <em>both</em> idealism <em>and</em> the materialism which counters it.  In one chapter, "Touching Things," Jacobus suggests
                  why Romantic writers should be so interested in <em>intangibles</em>—in things that are not immaterial, but whose materiality is evidenced less by direct
                  perception than in their aftereffects.  Drawing a parallel between the poem, "unable
                  to speak for itself," and other things that lack standing as subjects or objects,
                  Jacobus hints at the relation of Romantic practice not only to thing theory, but to
                  so-called "object-oriented ontology."</p>
               <p>As Steven Shaviro explains (in an essay whose title, 
                  “The Universe of Things,”
                  references Shelley's "Mont Blanc"), aesthetics has a central status in object-oriented
                  ontology: <span class="quote">‘For aesthetics is about the <em>singularity</em> and <em>supplementarity</em> of things. That is to say, it has to do with things insofar as they cannot be cognized,
                     or subordinated to concepts; and also insofar as they cannot be utilized, or normatively
                     regulated, or defined according to rules. No matter how deeply I comprehend a thing,
                     and no matter how pragmatically or instrumentally I make use of it, there is still
                     something of it that escapes my categorizations. Even when I obliterate a thing, or
                     consume it utterly, there is still something of it that I have not managed to incorporate,
                     some force to it that I have not been able to subsume. Aesthetics involves feeling
                     an object <em>for its own sake</em>, beyond those aspects of it that can be understood or used. The thing withdraws into
                     its network, luring me into the shadows; and it bursts forth in a splendour that dazzles
                     and blinds me. In these cases, the understanding is frustrated, and the will reaches
                     the limits of its power. It is only aesthetically, beyond understanding and will,
                     that I can appreciate the <span class="foreign">actus</span> of the thing being what it is, in what [Graham] Harman calls "the sheer sincerity
                     of existence."’</span> If a "Romantic" thing theory is one dialectically related both to things as they
                  are and things as they might be, it would also seem to resist the idea that attention
                  to "things" represents a supercession or redemption of the supposed "abstractions"
                  of theory.  Partly in the spirit of a resistance to the final dominion of things—and
                  that spirit of resistance is perhaps a shibboleth, a specifically Romantic inflection
                  of thing theory—both of the initial calls for the papers included here also encouraged
                  dialectical or resistant engagement. Titling the English session 
                  “This is Not a Thing,”
                  the committee wished the allusion to René Magritte to suggest a certain distrust of
                  the "thing" as a repudiation of, or correction for, Romantic <em>theory</em>.  More subtly, by elevating the deictic "this" as its <em>object</em>, it raised the question of how to understand the materiality of Romantic words and
                  letters.</p>
               <p>The Comparative Literature Division accomplished a similar end by devoting two complementary
                  sessions to 
                  “Romantic Ideality”
                  and 
                  “Romantic Materiality,”
                  staging a chiasmus such that at the very moment in which one thought (even hoped)
                  to think on one side of things, that thought turned out to be inextricable from ideas,
                  idealism, and ideality. Essays delivered at both of these comparative sessions—on
                  ideality and materiality—appear in this special issue.  These two panels were initially
                  prompted by the way that object-oriented ontology seems to have troubled anew the
                  assumed opposition between materialism and idealism.  In actuality though, each of
                  the essays that appears here is held together by a rethinking and reanimation of Paul
                  de Man's subtle account of linguistic materiality.  These essays are preoccupied with
                  the matter of words and letters, and the undoing of any sustainable opposition between
                  formal and material approaches to literature and culture.  </p>
               <p>While object-oriented ontology sets out from the re-introduction of realism into a
                  theoretical terrain that since Immanuel Kant had given up on its legitimacy, the question
                  remains whether this thinking has a precedent or parallel in some readings of Romanticism,
                  in particular, those that, at least since de Man (the explicit subject of Tom Toreman's
                  and Mario Ortiz-Robles' essays and a key intertext, if not the implicit subject, of
                  essays by Anna Kornbluh and Brian McGrath) have focused on "Kant's Materialism."  These
                  essays hold on to materialism, but do so in order redescribe materiality as a possibly
                  displaced name for a linguistic predicament.  Put another way, the essays collected
                  here lead us to ask whether Romantic materialities say more or less the same thing
                  as "Speculative Realism"? Do they, far from collapsing into relativism, instead embrace
                  a sense of things in their very awareness of linguistic force? </p>
               <p>Put another way, just as the essays we have collected here register the emergence
                  of new methods and ways of thinking, they also remind us of the endurance of an earlier
                  account of radical—and radically unconventional—materiality, one that Jacques Derrida
                  registers as a "nothing" that operates as "a force of resistance," neither substance
                  not matter, but rather a "materiality without matter" (350). Resistance, whether or
                  not it takes shape, emerges in this sense as materiality itself. This is the resistance
                  to which the <em>this</em> of "this is not a thing" bears witness.</p>
               <p>The two papers from the English Romantic Period session represented here (the others—
                  “Specimen Poetics: Reanimating the Romantic Object,”
                  by Dahlia Porter, and 
                  “Marx's Romantic Atom,”
                  by Amanda Goldstein—were destined for other publications) concentrate our attention
                  on the strange way in which the process of reading might be understood to exhibit
                  the imbrication of things and thought.  In her essay 
                  “What Wordsworth Touched,”
                  Sonia Hofkosh challenges the prevailing conception of Wordsworth as a poet averse
                  to "the touch of the real," as a poet who instead favored encounters with "phantom"
                  reality (Hartman).   Yet Hofkosh's focus is on the <em>text</em> as a thing: reinterpreting "the touch of earthly years" not as nostalgia or mortality
                  but as "somatic pressure," Hofkosh describes reading as a process of "tandem touching"
                  ("what we touch touches us").</p>
               <p>In a similar vein, Yoon Sun Lee brilliantly characterizes (an apt word) the Gothic
                  novel as "both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky reliance
                  on formula and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its superficial character
                  appears to indicate the existence of something deeper, or even unconscious."  Evidence
                  of the dissolved opposition between things and persons, objects and subjects, exhibits
                  itself in Ann Radcliffe's (narrative) passages about passages, often located within
                  the walls of castles whose mouldering condition likewise suggests the collapse of
                  boundaries.  In Radcliffe, when a door opens, it appears to do so of its own accord.
                   Tracing the strange effects of Gothic patterns, Lee offers us a ground-shifting (deterritorializing)
                  way of reading Gothic descriptions as "assemblages" that fail to produce a single
                  mental image, but instead register "the failure of things to persist." And if Lee
                  is right to suggest that materiality, when understood as a shifting force field of
                  intensities, is always already at risk of dissolving, emerging, and changing, then
                  Wordsworth's apparent aversion to the "real" may instead register the poet's most
                  profound attachment to the material.  For, as Hofkosh notes, the poet's attachment
                  to "things which are not things" required Wordsworth to produce stories "about how
                  things (entities, objects, bodies) change over time, must change, in order to endure."</p>
               <p>The remaining papers were presented at the two Comparative Literature sessions: those
                  by Anna Kornbluh, Brian McGrath, and Mario Ortiz-Robles composed a panel on 
                  “Romantic Materialities,”
                  and Tom Toremans, together with David Clark and Tilottama Rajan (both of whom had
                  committed their essays elsewhere) spoke on the 
                  “Romantic Idealities”
                  panel.</p>
               <p>Two of these essays focus explicitly on Paul de Man whether in an effort to characterize
                  agency as a literary effect, an example of what Mario Ortiz-Robles calls "literary
                  immanence," or in order to situate the several texts devoted to materiality within
                  their original context—the Messenger Lectures at Cornell University—and to reread
                  them from that vantage (the aim of Toreman's essay).  McGrath and Kornbluh also turn
                  to de Man, even if only by turning away from him. Indeed, while they allegorically
                  treat our contemporary experience of virtuality—from the financial crisis of 2008
                  and its aftermath to the new knowledge economy—they do so by way of an analysis of
                  "material events."  While Kornbluh makes a point of insisting that her essay will
                  not repeat the gesture whereby reading Karl Marx after de Man, a conventionally understood
                  materialism and a more enigmatic linguistic one seem not as different as one would
                  otherwise presume, her subtle approach to Marx remains thoroughly informed by the
                  mode of rhetorical reading that is de Man's signature.  The same can be said of Brian
                  McGrath's essay.</p>
               <p>Like Jane Bennett, Brian McGrath sets out from Henry David Thoreau. While Bennett
                  loops Thoreau through Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, in order to propose an alternative
                  materialism to the dominant Marxist one, and in order to develop an account of "lively"
                  or "vibrant" matter, McGrath takes us straight to the clouds—to Wordsworth's cloud
                  and to cloud computing.  More specifically, McGrath's essay is a patient, but also
                  wandering, reflection on the line "I wandered lonely as a cloud," which leads us to
                  think through the economic and ecological costs of mobility that our contemporary
                  fascination with clouds—specifically with the cloud in which, among other things,
                  the words you are now reading are stored—reveals. In doing so, McGrath stages a canny
                  reversal, whereby the emblem of poetic—and above all <em>Romantic</em>—immateriality turns out to be materiality itself. In McGrath's reading, Wordsworth
                  turns out to be less a dreamy idealist than a vibrant materialist, attending to the
                  life of things or the thingly life.  But McGrath doesn't see this as the end of the
                  so-called linguistic turn, but rather, just as the theorists of objects have set out
                  to recover the matter apparently lost by the acceptance of social or linguistic construction,
                  McGrath turns this thinking of materiality resolutely back to Romanticism and to a
                  renewed reflection upon its figures.</p>
               <p>Taken together, the six essays that we have collected here suggest that Romanticism
                  exposes us to a materialism that cannot merely be overcome and an idealism with which
                  it is not identical. By reading beyond the texts conventionally associated with Romanticism,
                  and by recasting the critical tendencies—from thing theory to object oriented ontology—through
                  the poets, genres, and critics of Romanticism, these essays position Romanticism (and
                  show how Romanticism may always have been positioned) in another relation to <em>things as they are</em>—or may be.</p>
