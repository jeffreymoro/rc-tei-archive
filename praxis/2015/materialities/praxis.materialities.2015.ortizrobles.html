            <p class="noCount">This essay considers the problem of materialism in literature from the perspective
               of linguistic empiricism. It takes as a its point of departure Paul de Man's treatment
               of linguistic materiality to argue that a specifically literary description of agency
               ought to take into account the event of literature as such. It then turns to Gilles
               Deleuze's formulation of immanence to offer a reading of a key scene in Dicken's <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> that illustrates how literature stages its coming-alive.</p>

                     “Literary Immanence”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>To judge by recent trends in literary criticism that fall under the general rubric
               of material culture studies—practices as varied as history-of-the-book, thing theory,
               and various types of quantitative methods in the humanities—the matter of what counts
               as materialism in literature is far from settled. These trends tend to read literature's
               materiality literally, considering matter, objects, and things as the physical remainders
               of a pragmatic phenomenalism whose ultimate horizon of inquiry is the referential
               context in which the literary operates, rather than the operations of the literary
               itself as a historical referent. Much methodological stock is put into the work of
               analogy, so that, by treating the literary object as just another object in a world
               of objects, literature's historical impact is determined by tracing the specific modes
               of production, distribution, and consumption that make literature a cultural commodity
               in the global marketplace. And even when the literary object is understood as a symbolic
               repository of material history, an object that contains other objects, it is its formidable
               mimetic powers that are made to account almost entirely for its cultural work. The
               historicity of literature, in this view, rests on its ability to influence, coerce,
               or otherwise discipline its readers, who are often portrayed as the always-already
               interpellated subjects of an ideology literature can do no more than re-inscribe as
               a narrative of subject construction. </p>
            <p>The materiality of literature, in any case, remains elusive: on the one hand, to study
               literature as an object is to bracket its defining characteristic as a literary work–the
               fact of its literariness; on the other, to limit the historical role of the novel
               to the effects it has on its readers is to subscribe uncritically to its referential
               function–the fact that it can only be read literally, as a medium to the material
               culture that is said to exist outside of, and in spite of, its qualities as literature.
               Accordingly, despite the claims they make about literature's historical impact, these
               accounts tend to occlude the materiality of that which makes literature matter: its
               language. This is a surprising occlusion, not least because there has been a longstanding
               awareness of the materiality of the literary that in many cases predates current critical
               trends within material culture studies and object-centered literary analyses that
               ostensibly seek to specify literature's historical role. </p>
            <p>I don't wish to suggest that we should rehabilitate the notion of linguistic materiality
               uncritically, but we ought nevertheless to recall its speculative force in the arguments
               we make about literature's material history, if only as a first step toward providing
               a more robust account of the specificities of literary practice as well as its institutional
               determinations. A very partial critical genealogy—from Roland Barthes's formulation
               of the "<span class="foreign">le degré zéro de l'écriture</span>," through Lacan's "agency of the letter," and Paul de Man's formulation of materialism
               as a "radical formalism," to more recent elaborations by Catherine Malabou of a material
               plasticity that would reject the literary as a quasi-metaphysical category—suggests,
               at any rate, that critical debates on the materiality of the literary are far from
               having been exhausted. The challenge is to find a new way of formulating literary
               empiricism that lends specificity to the literariness of the literary object while
               enhancing its claims to historical relevance.</p>
            <p>In what follows I address in a preliminary and provisional way two questions that
               move in this direction: 1) Can a meaningful distinction be made between linguistic
               and literary materiality? And, if so, 2) is there a conceptual advantage in construing
               this singular essence of the literary as a form of immanence? </p>
            <p>The most commonly cited model of linguistic materiality is the one formulated by Paul
               de Man in his reading of Immanuel Kant's third <em>Critique</em> (1981, but not published until 1996). In the essay 
               “Kant's Materialism,”
               de Man refers to the radical formalism of the language of poets, who, according to
               Kant, look at the world as one sees it ("<span class="foreign">wie man ihn sieht</span>"), as an absolute materialism of language that entertains no notion of reference
               or semiosis. To the extent that language at its limit does not act as a repository
               or conveyor of meaning, it can no longer be said to be the immaterial medium of communication
               that we assume to be operative when we speak of the inside of a text and of its outside
               referent. Yet, however distant from a materialist conception of culture or history
               this definition of materialism may seem at first glance, de Man insists that it is
               precisely the "a-referential, a-phenomenal, a-pathetic" nature of this materialism
               that allows Kant to gain access to the "moral world of practical reason, practical
               law, and rational politics" (128).</p>
            <p>In de Man's formulation, materialism is a non-phenomenalizable attribute of language
               that nevertheless has effects in the world that are empirically verifiable, insofar
               as they belong to a pragmatic order of discourse. This form of materialism is therefore
               historical in a strong sense, even if it does not strictly conform, in this telling,
               to what we would recognize as "historical materialism." When, in <em>The Political Unconscious</em> (1981), Frederic Jameson makes a distinction between a mechanical form of materialism
               of the sort found in Lacan (the phallus as "material signifier") and the properly
               historical materialism elaborated by Karl Marx, he is trying to distinguish a conception
               of matter that corresponds to signifying systems, and thus to bourgeois ideology,
               from a notion of materialism determined by the mode of production. For Jameson, literary
               labor can at best be subsumed under the rubric of ideology critique; it cannot, at
               any rate, be assimilated to "real work on the assembly line and to the experience
               of the resistance of matter in genuine manual labor" (45). De Man's formulation of
               materialism is not dialectical in the way Jameson suggests a properly historical materialism
               ought to be, but it is nevertheless closer to this mechanical model of history than
               would at first glance appear to be the case.</p>
            <p>Indeed, even among Marxist critics who focus on the "mode of production," there is
               no consensus regarding the best method of approaching the materiality of literature.
               In a 1991 essay aptly, though perhaps optimistically, titled 
               “The Moment of Materialism,”
               David Simpson notes: "[T]he very popularization of materialist methods, with their
               accumulating adjectival qualifiers—cultural materialism, historical materialism, and
               (let us not forget) dialectical materialism—brings with it another anxiety of definition"
               (6). For Simpson, this anxiety has to do less with matter as such than with history.
               To make this point, he goes on to quote Engels, who wrote in 1890: "In general, the
               word 'materialist' serves many of the younger writers of Germany as a mere phrase
               with which anything and everything is labelled without further study, that is, they
               stick on this label and then consider the question disposed of. But our conception
               of history is above all a guide to study, not a lever for construction after the Hegelian
               manner. All history must be studied afresh" (qtd. in Simpson 6). Leaving aside the
               question of whether or not literary criticism uses the term "materialism" as a "lever
               for construction," it does seem to be the case that, to judge from the process of
               redefinition to which it is periodically submitted, the history of the term, if not
               history itself, is certainly "studied afresh."</p>
            <p>Frances Ferguson makes a valuable distinction between what she calls "deconstructive
               materialism" and "social materialism" on the basis of the relation between language
               and the objects to which it refers. In the latter, objects are endowed with meaning
               to the extent that they can enter or be entered into a causal relation with individuals;
               the former, in contrast, emphasizes the "primacy of the material signifier in both
               embodying and interfering with any and all such casual accounts" (10). It follows
               that the view of language as a referential relay that transparently connects our perceptions
               of objects with the objects themselves comes under suspicion as the materiality of
               the letter becomes itself an object of knowledge whose very opacity seems to be derived
               from its apparent insubstantiality. </p>
            <p>In de Man, the materiality of language is what remains when the text is evacuated
               of its historical and humanistic determinations, and can therefore only be accessed
               in language by means of its allegorizations—even—or especially, when these are of
               a performative order. It is tempting in this context to equate the materiality of
               language with the institutional history of performative speech acts so as to be able
               to claim that literature is itself an act of speech that has real effects in the world.
               But this would be to confuse, as de Man once put it, "the materiality of the signifier
               with the materiality of what it signifies." Andrzej Warminski coins the term "super-performative"
               to designate not a performative that "functions <em>within</em> an established juridico-political system, but rather one that itself is the inaugural
               act of positing that puts such a system into place in the first place" (26). When
               Derrida refers to what de Man, at the closural moment of his essay 
               “Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant,”
               calls the "prosaic materiality of the letter" as a materiality that is not a thing
               or a body but that yet "operates" and "forces," a "materiality without matter" (350),
               he is attempting to preserve the radical unreappropriability of this force of language
               to language itself.</p>
            <p>Formulated in these terms, the materiality of language seems to be an attribute of
               language that operates without recourse to any properly literary function. It is "prosaic"
               in that it would not even be determined by language itself. Yet, the "absolute, radical
               formalism" that marks for de Man, in his reading of Kant, the passage from reference
               to performativity should be read literally. It makes sense from this perspective to
               speak of a literary materialism as opposed to a linguistic materialism, provided we
               revise our commonsense notion of the literary as a referential medium that captures
               objects, things, matter. We must understand literature, in other words, as poets do;
               that is, as language itself. </p>
            <p>But how can we access the historical, empirical effects of language-as-literature?
               What form of historical agency does it constitute? Gilles Deleuze's conceptualization
               of immanence (or the plane of immanence) can help us stage an empirical thinking of
               the literary that might provide an alternative model for historical agency. In 
               “Immanence, A Life,”
               Deleuze maintains that the virtualities, events, and singularities that constitute
               life elude the transcendence of both subject and object. The transcendental is distinguished
               from the transcendent in that the empiricism of the transcendental plane is unencumbered
               from the appeals of Some Thing as a unity superior to all things, or of a Subject
               as an act that brings about a synthesis. Immanence is not immanent to anything other
               than itself. Can a description of literary immanence equally elude the insertion of
               subject and object as categories mediated by a consciousness that would reabsorb them
               as transcendents?</p>
            <p>Consider how Deleuze illustrates his notion of immanence: "No one," writes Deleuze,
               "has described what <em>a</em> life is better than Charles Dickens, if we take the indefinite article as an index
               of the transcendental" (28). Deleuze goes on to describe the passage from <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> in which Rogue Riderhood, found nearly dead in the river, is revived before the expectant
               eyes of his neighbors, whose sympathy swiftly evaporates as soon as they realize Riderhood
               is once again restored as Riderhood. This is how Deleuze glosses it: "The life of
               the individual gives way to an impersonal yet singular life that releases a pure event
               freed from the accidents of internal and external life, that is, from the subjectivity
               and objectivity of what happens...a life of pure immanence, neutral, beyond good and
               evil, for it was only the subject that incarnated it in the midst of things that made
               it good or bad" (28-9).</p>
            <p>Deleuze does not quote Dicken's text directly, but something similar can be said about
               the way Dickens himself renders the moment of Riderhood's death and his curious resurrection.
               At first, Riderhood's inert body inspires a modicum of sympathy from those whom Riderhood,
               in life, has otherwise alienated. <span class="quote">‘Doctor examines the dank carcase, and pronounces, not hopefully, that it is worth
                  while trying to reanimate the same. All the best means are at once in action, and
                  everybody present lends a hand, and a heart and soul. No one has the least regard
                  for the man; with them all, he has been an object of avoidance, suspicion, and aversion;
                  but the spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now, and they
                  have a deep interest in it, probably because it IS life, and they are living and must
                  die. (Dickens 443)’</span> Notice in this passage the use of the present tense, a device common enough in Dickens
               when a sense of urgency gives narrative expediency to the event being described, but
               here explicitly bracketing Riderhood's reanimation as though the chapter as a whole
               in which it is effected had emerged—had come alive in the present or been restored—from
               an otherwise conventional narrative flow rendered in the preterite. The preterite
               tense, as Barthes notes in <em>Le Degré zéro de l'écriture</em>, is one of the Signs of Literature, together with third-person narration, that gives
               the Novel the "formal guarantee of the real" (33). The preterite is a mythological
               object that appeals to the ideology of the real and, at the same time, points to the
               artificial nature of novelistic narration. Dickens's deliberate use of the present
               tense in this extended episode has the effect of making it an object of literary curiosity
               while momentarily deadening the rest of the narrative.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when the passage apostrophizes Riderhood directly, as though to call him
               back to life, the structure of address breaks with convention by creating a first-person
               plural subject position from which those attending to the "flabby lump of mortality,"
               and possibly those "below," are all given voice. <span class="quote">‘If you are not gone for good, Mr. Riderhood, it would be something to know where
                  you are hiding at present. This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with
                  such patient perseverance, yields no sign of you. If you are gone for good, Rogue,
                  it is very solemn, and if you are coming back, it is hardly less so. Nay, in the suspense
                  and mystery of the latter question, involving that of where you may be now, there
                  is a solemnity even added to that of death, making us who are in attendance alike
                  afraid to look on you and to look off you, and making those below start at the least
                  sound of a creaking plank in the floor. (444)’</span> The distance separating the more formal "Mr. Riderhood" and the familiar name "Rogue"
               with which most of the characters in the novel refer to him is also marked as a grammatical
               distinction between a form of address that would refer to him as though absent in
               the third person and a positing of the name that would make him a familiar presence.
               Moreover, the phrase "no sign of you" both signals Riderhood's precarious hold on
               life, and also, if read literally, the absence of the "you" being apostrophized, as
               though the sign "you" had no purchase in the scene of address staged between life-and-death.
               The effect is a radical suspension of reference that yields no "you"—or, for that
               matter, no "I"—that could become a subject of enunciation, whether plural or singular,
               and thereby suspends the action of the novel insofar as the subject pronoun carries
               the narrative. Indeed, it is the "he," according to Barthes, that performs the service
               of both signifying the novelistic as artifice and naturalizing this artifice as the
               "real."</p>
            <p>Riderhood's precarious narrative existence is accompanied (indeed accomplished) by
               a process of formal de-realization that Dickens began in this episode by reversing
               and displacing conventional novelistic forms of utterance such as grammatical tense
               and narrative voice. This process is radicalized by a virtual suspension of novelistic
               discourse itself. <span class="quote">‘Stay! Did that eyelid tremble? So the doctor, breathing low, and closely watching,

                  out, or it may glow and expand, but see! (444)’</span> The almost theatrical disposition of this paratactic passage (almost because the
               "No"s could hardly be staged) suggests the rejection or the abandonment of novelistic
               convention, as thought the convention that would portray Riderhood coincided with
               his ability to remain alive. To be sure, the iteration of "No" in this passage marks
               the interruption of narrative coherence and representational verisimilitude, but the
               loss of referential logic also makes visible a linguistic struggle whose stakes are
               nothing short of "life" itself. The use of the "No" seems at first to negate the force
               of the exclamation "Stay!" (a locution with no stated subject of enunciation) and
               of the doctor's questions, asked in silence, to himself, "breathing low." Yet, the
               insistence of the evidentiary "See!" and the ambiguously referential "a token of life!"
               (ambiguous because while "life" has no adequate referent in reality, the use of "token"
               in the phrase suggests that it is figuratively accessible) constitute a catachrestic
               positing of the materiality of language itself. The performative force of the utterance
               "No" may well deflate the attempt to reanimate Rogue through the mere act of naming,
               but a rhetorical counterweight is found to take the place of a nominal accounting
               of "Mr. Riderhood" in the figure of the "spark."</p>
            <p>The figure of the "spark" returns in another passage that marks Rogue's reinscription
               into the social coordinates of his past life, and thus into the novelistic elaboration
               of his identity. Indeed, the language of the passage hints at a return to conventional
               novelistic modality: <span class="quote">‘The spark of life was deeply interesting while it was in abeyance, but now that it
                  has got established in Mr. Riderhood, there appears to be a general desire that circumstances
                  had admitted of its being developed in anybody else, rather than that gentleman. (446-7)’</span> The radical formalism of the entire episode makes the rendering of a life a matter
               of great literary interest, as though the text itself were coming alive before our
               very eyes. The text's use of the "spark of life" to mark this passage suggests that,
               as a figure for life—for a life, as Deleuze reads it—the "spark of life" can also
               be read as a figure for what I have been calling literary immanence, a material existence
               that renders literature alive. This rendering-alive of literature might get us closer
               to a thinking of empiricism from which the historical, doubly empirical determinations
               so familiar to material culture studies could be used to think of agency as a material
               becoming of the literary.</p>
