            <p class="noCount">This paper explores the occasion of Wordsworth’s retrospective commentary on his poetry
               as recorded by Elizabeth Fenwick in notes take at Rydal Mount in 1843. Focusing on
               the aging poet turning the pages of the book he holds in his hand as he reads and
               recalls writing his poems, the argument considers touch as a form of mediation that
               in bringing the subject into relation with the object also brings him into relation
               with his own material being. Wordsworth’s retrospective project reminds us that such
               materiality is an inevitable if also a fragile and changing condition of making poets
               as well as poems.</p>

                  <p>Sitting on the sofa in his comfortable library, or perhaps at the desk in his attic
                     study with a view of the hills and the lake beyond, a man rather advanced in years
                     turns the pages of a book of poetry, other volumes by the same author arrayed on the
                     shelf or on the table nearby. He reads some lines of verse aloud or recites them from
                     memory; he knows the words well and very much enjoys repeating them. As he slowly
                     turns the pages looking at poems written over the course of a fifty year career, he
                     reflects on the circumstances of their creation; he recalls the particular experiences
                     which impelled him to compose them, for the poems he peruses are in fact his own.
                     He shares his reflections with a friend who devotedly sits with him for many hours
                     day after day for the many days it takes to look through seven volumes of verse. The
                     friend faithfully transcribes what he says, filling one hundred and eighty leaves
                     of a notebook with a history of a writing life and an archeology of a poetic practice.

                     </div> Fenwick, who had moved to Ambleside in 1838 to be near the Wordsworths, encouraged
                     and then collaborated on the poet’s project of intensive retrospection which began
                     when they sat down together in January 1843, Fenwick’s pen poised to take dictation
                     as Wordsworth opened the first volume of the most recently published edition of his
                     writings, Edward Moxon’s 1841 <em>Poetical Works</em>, turned the pages past the frontispiece portrait (the white-haired Bard of Rydal
                     Mount), to recall a lifetime of writing poems, beginning with those referring to the
                     period of childhood. They finished their retrospective project six months later in
                     June 1843 with Wordsworth’s commentary on <em>The Excursion</em>, which extends to more than twenty leaves of Fenwick’s notebook. This commentary
                     includes circumstances he remembers about the specific places and persons and situations
                     from the past that he considers the originating ground of the poem and thus its claim
                     to a certain kind of truth value (as he repeatedly insists, “every particular was
                     exactly as I have related”),

                     </div> but it also registers the passage of time since writing it in a sense of loss or regret
                     infused into his present experience—for example, he notes the recent death of his
                     “lamented friend Southey” (195) and his “utter detestation” of an ostentatious boat-house
                     “now” (206) being built in Grasmere which will mar the beauty and seclusion of that
                     beloved lakeshore, as well as more public sorrows such as the failure of “the present
                     session of Parliament” to improve the lot of children laboring in factories (214).
                     Such references to current events and feelings within his account of a poem written
                     decades earlier suggests the contingency not just of that particular creation, but
                     of the retrospective project itself. Memory unfolds here in real time, opening the
                     past in and to present circumstances and effects.</p>

                  <p>I will be looking at a particular piece of Wordsworth’s retrospective project—his
                     much cited remarks on the poem he refers to in 1843 simply as “The Ode”—but it is
                     worth noticing the temporal chiasmus operating in this retrospective enterprise more
                     broadly. When he sits down to read his own poems once again, he engages in a redoubled
                     and especially sustained process of recollection in which looking back day after day
                     enacts retrospection going forward, as duration, a condition of the on-going present
                     if not also of the possible futures to which that present is always giving way. Temporalities
                     converge and intersect. The past acquires its particular form and inflection from
                     the present; it becomes, we might say, always already new.

                              of sorts, as I try to suggest here, Lisa Gitelman’s idea that new media arise out
                              of old and function as “socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning
                              ” would aptly describe his collaborative enterprise with Fenwick. See Lisa Gitelman,
                              Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture (Cambridge: MIT Press,
                              2008), 6. See also Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin, Remediation: Understanding
                              New Media (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000).</span></div>
                     </div> Let me mention that during the months Wordsworth is thus engaged he turns seventy-three
                     and is also appointed Poet Laureate, an honor he initially refuses because he thinks
                     himself too old. He is in fact producing very little new work at this time, though
                     new editions of his previous writing continue to appear and he will in the years ahead
                     arrange for the posthumous publication of an authorized biography as well as of the
                     poem he calls “the long Poem on my own education” or “the poem on the growth of my
                     own Mind” (188) known to us as <em>The Prelude</em>. Though the ambitious annotation project the poet undertakes late in his career may
                     not constitute a wholly “new idiom” such as Edward Said sees great artists developing
                     near the end of their lives, still we may find that the aging poet’s retrospective
                     account of his poetic practice does revisionary work and thereby offers an opportunity
                     for us to rethink some of the central and abiding formulations of his (and Romantic)
                     literary history. The old Wordsworth may be the new Wordsworth for our time.

                  <p>As concerned as he had been at least since the poems and prefaces of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> with the question of reading, especially of reading poetry, the Fenwick project highlights
                     the extent to which Wordsworth was a continuous reader and re-reader of his own writing,
                     and correlatively, the extent to which his writing entails and embeds the supplement
                     of reading. But I invoke the scene of the aging poet sitting with Isabella Fenwick
                     in the library or study at Rydal Mount in addition to remind us how much Wordsworth’s
                     writing was always and fundamentally a social and embodied phenomenon, coming into
                     being in the nexus of specific relationships to individuals and communities and in
                     the context of specific situations, environments, and material conditions. The Fenwick
                     notes repeatedly attest to the circumstantial and materially determined nature of
                     poetic invention. His gloss on “We are Seven,” for instance, famously recounts what
                     Wordsworth calls “one of the most remarkable facts in my own poetic career” (39)—that
                     is, the inception of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in a walking tour with his sister and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in the Spring of 1798,
                     or, more exactly, in their determination to compose a poem to send to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> to finance that trip. Moreover, the scene of the production of the Fenwick notes itself
                     reminds us that poems are objects within a particular (if changing) field of embodied
                     activity and experience. When he holds the book of poems, turning the pages to read
                     them and reflect aloud on the details of their composition—how they came to be the
                     particular poems they are, and thus how he came to be the poet he is, sitting there,
                     turning the pages, reading them—Wordsworth touches something that is one among the
                     things in the world that thereby touch him in return, for inevitably, what we touch,
                     touches us.

                     for instance, or as emotion recollected in tranquility—but somatically, as a palpable
                     pressure, however slight or fleeting, a mild sensation on the surface of his skin,
                     felt on the flesh, if not also in the blood or along the heart. His hand upon the

                     being. Nancy proposes that “<em>touching</em>—happens in writing all the time” (11): “. . . the page itself is a touching (of my
                     hand while it writes, and your hands while they hold the book) . . . a slight, resistant,
                     fine texture, the infinitesimal dust of a contact” (51); this dust, he suggests, is
                     “the ob-jected matter of the sub-ject” (29). To put it another way, let us extrapolate
                     from Theodor Adorno’s dialectical model of the relations of subject and object to
                     consider that when Wordsworth turns the pages upon which his poems are printed, “subjectivity
                     is grasped as the object’s form”: in its encounter with the object, even or especially

                     “objects of sight” such as the wall or tree at which he would many times grasp to
                     remind himself that “external things [have] external existence.” For Hartman, as for
                     Nancy, all art may involve a “kind of touching” (22), especially, for Hartman, mimetic
                     art, in that representation subsists in some relation to reality, whether regressive
                     or restorative or substitutive. But despite his early compulsion to grasp the wall
                     or tree, Wordsworth is not ultimately a poet of touch, or the tangible, or even the
                     visible in Hartman’s influential analysis; instead, his poetry “almost transcends
                     representation,” seeming to exist, Hartman says, “without the material density of
                     poetic texture—without imagistic or narrative detail” (27) or, we might add, without
                     the book or the pages he turns when he reviews his writing at Rydal Mount in 1843.

               <p>I keep coming back to the prosaic scene of the poet turning the pages of the book
                  in his hand to draw attention to the mostly unacknowledged and yet fundamental materiality
                  at issue in the everyday practices of reading and writing and thus in the apprehension
                  of the literary artifact as such, both what it is and what it may become for its writer
                  and its readers. Even as I write (or, rather, type) this sentence, that materiality
                  and those practices are undergoing significant transformation. The page is now often
                  digitized, as this one is; we might turn it by tapping on a button or swiping a finger
                  across the surface of a screen. The specific situation in which the body encounters
                  the work of art is always under construction. In looking with some insistence at Wordsworth
                  turning the pages of his book as Isabella Fenwick transcribes his commentary on his
                  creative process, I do not mean to claim that the medium is the message; I do, however,
                  want to suggest that specific and changing forms of mediation constitute a “material
                  density” at the conceptual ground of the literary enterprise and it is in relation
                  to such materiality that the meanings and values the work of art variously acquires
                  and confers are determined. Further, I want to suggest that however infinitesimal
                  its dust, Wordsworth implicitly understood the force and consequence of such materiality
                  as foundational to the operation of the imagination and to the identity of the poet
                  as agental subject or creative consciousness. </p>

                     </div> the scene at Rydal Mount in 1843 demonstrates Wordsworth’s unavoidable reliance on
                     (even his investment in) the materiality of his poetic practice. The poet performs
                     even if he does not theorize the everyday efficacy of objects in the Romantic imaginary.
                     And yet, he does offer a kind of thing theory in the Fenwick notes. His reflections
                     on the origins of each poem collectively articulate a logic of embodiment—that poems
                     come into being as situated phenomena, that they are written and read as singular
                     artifacts within a complex and contingent relational field. Wordsworth had of course
                     long aspired in his poetry to keep the reader “in the company of flesh and blood”
                     (“Preface” to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>). Perhaps we might go so far as to say that in the Fenwick project as he sits turning
                     pages and she sits with him taking dictation, he is thinking through the body as the
                     very condition for making and apprehending the work of art. To say this is not to
                     claim primacy in the production of meaning and value, either for the hand turning
                     the page, or for the inanimate object, the book or the paper; it is not to argue for
                     a strictly materialist ontology that would exclude any/thing not immediately available
                     to the senses. But it is to return, as Wordsworth himself does in the note I want
                     to look at briefly in closing, to the question of the subject’s relation to the object
                     and to the function of the intimate contact—the touch—that puts them into that relation.</p>

                        as is expressed in the lines ‘obstinate questionings &amp;c.’ (160)’</span> The abyss that threatens to open for the young Wordsworth is significantly not a function
                     of the difference of the self from the non-self but of the total assimilation or abstraction
                     of the material world into or as the subject, “the world of his own mind”; the boy
                     recalls himself <em>from</em> even as the older poet would recall him <em>in</em> such “dizzy raptures” (“Lines” 86) by touching something—a wall or tree, or a volume
                     of verse. The note suggests that grasping the external existence of material things
                     is stabilizing, but also inevitably conduces to its own constraining effects (“subjugation,”
                     or what “The Ode” calls “shades of the prison-house” [67]). What he touches, touches
                     him. But if the child who touches the wall or tree as an anchor against idealist free-fall
                     is father to the man who deplores the limits thus imposed upon his imagination by
                     “sense and outward things” (145), the note also intimates that the transformative
                     capacity of being in time can turn fear into rejoicing even as it leaves its traces
                     on the aging body, the infinitesimal dust of a contact.</p>

                     how things (objects, bodies) change over time—must change—in order to endure. When
                     in the process of the retrospective exercise he undertakes with Isabella Fenwick in
                     1843 he thus necessarily makes contact with external things that have external existence,
                     including the pages of books, he is not so much proclaiming an “ontic unity of all

                     old man’s touch establishes a relationality that is fluctuating and fragile at the
                     point or plane where the self is distinguished from the non-self, where the subject
                     in its very intimacy with the object becomes the particular subject it is, limited
                     to and by a particular body. The old man’s touch lingers, day after day, an infinitesimal
                     dust. No impasse, this may be the everyday prose of poetry: it conveys that we feel
                     most in and of the world, situated, embodied in relation to external things when we
                     feel how tenuous our hold on those things is, and yet hold them close as if our own

               of sorts, as I try to suggest here, Lisa Gitelman’s idea that new media arise out
               of old and function as “socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning
               ” would aptly describe his collaborative enterprise with Fenwick. See Lisa Gitelman,

               writing touch involves “what Derrida calls ‘tact,’ the tact not to touch, or the untouchable”
               and thus informs an ethics or ecopoetics of distance or withholding. See especially
               Chapter 3. Jacobus’s resonant discussion focuses on natural objects (trees, rocks,
               clouds), while I want to consider the efficacy of the artifactual or the handmade
               (the wall as well as the tree).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
