               <p rend="noCount">This essay, an introduction to the collection "Romantic
                  Materialities, or 'This is not a Thing," provides an overview of the essays
                  included in the issue in the context of historic and recent accounts of the place
                  of things in Romanticism, showing how a Romantic account of things helps to
                  situate contemporary theory, from Deconstruction to Thing Theory to Object
                  Oriented Ontology.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>In his landmark essay, <title level="a">The Secret Life of Things,</title> (1999),
                  a prelude to <title level="m">Thing Theory</title> (2003), Bill Brown acknowledges
                  that his title will bring to mind "a line from William Wordsworth or Percy
                  Shelley, or one of ETA Hoffmann's uncanny tales."  This gesture at once cites and
                  brackets Romantic writers, allowing them to reverberate in the background of an
                  argument in which Brown attends explicitly to the 1920s (as a period in which
                  "things emerge as the object of profound theoretical engagement" in Georg Lukács,
                  Martin Heidegger, and Walter Benjamin), and to a short story by Virginia Woolf,
                     <title level="a">Solid Objects</title> (1920). It somehow seems fitting that
                  Brown's reference to <emph>Romantic</emph> things should be so
                     <emph>vaguely</emph> allusive—not to say elusive—given the longstanding
                  tendency to oppose Romanticism and materialism.  But the inexactness of the
                  citation has the unexpectedly amplifying effect of allowing a palimpsest of lines
                  to spring to mind:  from <title level="a">Tintern Abbey</title> ("We see into the
                  life of things") "And I have felt... / a sense sublime/ Of something far more
                  deeply interfused... A motion and a spirit, that impels/ All thinking things, all
                  objects of all thought,/ And rolls through all things"; and from Shelley's <title level="a">Mont Blanc</title> ("The everlasting universe of things/ Rolls
                  through the mind").  As this virtual universe of "thing" lines rolls through our
                  minds, it's worth stopping in our tracks a bit, to notice something to which Brown
                  does not pay attention:  the proximity of <emph>things</emph> to
                     <emph>thinking</emph> in these Romantic examples of "thing theory."</p>
                  <p>One could cite many more examples of such proximity, but we'll content ourselves
                  with one of the most familiar, from Byron's <title level="m">Don Juan</title>:

                  To (re)read this passage in the context of Thing Theory is to imagine
                  that it was Byron, not William Godwin, who responded to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
                  own "call for papers": 
               <quote>I wish you would write a book on the power of words,
                     and the processes by which human feelings form affinities with them - in short,
                     I wish you to <emph>philosophize</emph> Horne Tooke's System, and to solve the
                     great Questions . . . Is <emph>thinking</emph> impossible without arbitrary
                     signs? . . . In something of this order I would endeavour to destroy the old
                     antithesis of <emph>Words &amp; Things</emph>, elevating, as it were, words
                     into Things, &amp; living Things too. All the nonsense of vibrations etc you
                     would of course dismiss. (Coleridge to William Godwin, 22 September, 1800,
                        <title level="m">Letters</title>, 1:625-26)</quote>
                     Many readers of <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> will be familiar with John Horne
                  Tooke's etymological argument that "to think" bears a direct relation to "things":
                   "Remember, where we now say <emph>I think</emph>, the antient expression
                     was<emph>—Me thinketh</emph>, i.e., <emph>Me thingeth, It thingeth me</emph>"(609).
                   "Thinking things"—in the sense of (1) attributing thought to things; (2) thinking
                     <emph>about</emph> things; and (3) thinking <emph>through</emph> things—would
                  seem to be at the foundation of Romantic interest in the "<emph>real</emph>
                  language of men" (emphasis added, Brett &amp; Jones 241).</p>
                  <p>No doubt the amount of ink (and other material supports for discourse) recently
                  expended on the topic of "things" in literature had the not-quite uncanny effect,
                  in 2011, of independently prompting the MLA's English Romantic Period and the
                  Comparative Romantic and Nineteenth Century Literature Divisions to convene panels
                  designed to explore how "things" might be thought Romantically.  Certainly these
                  sessions were not in any way the first to wonder what a <hi rend="italic">Romantic</hi> thing theory might look like; Colin Jager in 2007 and Eric
                  Lindstrom in 2010 both suggested the subtitle of William Godwin's <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>—<title level="a">Things as They Are</title>—ought to be
                  considered as a point of departure.  This "astringent, jointly
                  metaphysical/political" phrase (Lindstrom 481) implicitly opposes itself to
                  "things as they might be" (Jager par. 7).  And at more or less the same time as
                  our panelists were presenting their papers, Mary Jacobus' book <title level="m">Romantic Things: A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud</title> (Chicago, 2012) appeared.
                   </p>
                  <p>Jacobus' <title level="m">Romantic Things</title> makes only passing reference to
                  thing theory, but in linking the objects of her subtitle to such other putative
                  "things" as death, absence, and vacancy, she makes a case for Wordsworth as "the
                  negative phenomenologist of Romantic thingness" (129).  Not clouds but "/cloud/"—
                  Hubert Damisch's name for what in painting "is the sign of the volume repressed by
                  modern painting's fixation on the flatness of the representational surface"
                  (12)—is the paradigm for this negative phenomenology:a phenomenology which notably
                  undermines <emph>both</emph> idealism <emph>and</emph> the materialism which
                  counters it.  In one chapter, "Touching Things," Jacobus suggests why Romantic
                  writers should be so interested in <emph>intangibles</emph>—in things that are not
                  immaterial, but whose materiality is evidenced less by direct perception than in
                  their aftereffects.  Drawing a parallel between the poem, "unable to speak for
                  itself," and other things that lack standing as subjects or objects, Jacobus hints
                  at the relation of Romantic practice not only to thing theory, but to so-called
                  "object-oriented ontology." </p>
                  <p>As Steven Shaviro explains (in an essay whose title, <title level="a">The Universe
                     of Things,</title> references Shelley's "Mont Blanc"),
                  aesthetics has a central status in object-oriented ontology:
               <quote>For aesthetics
                     is about the <emph>singularity</emph> and <emph>supplementarity</emph> of
                     things. That is to say, it has to do with things insofar as they cannot be
                     cognized, or subordinated to concepts; and also insofar as they cannot be
                     utilized, or normatively regulated, or defined according to rules. No matter
                     how deeply I comprehend a thing, and no matter how pragmatically or
                     instrumentally I make use of it, there is still something of it that escapes my
                     categorizations. Even when I obliterate a thing, or consume it utterly, there
                     is still something of it that I have not managed to incorporate, some force to
                     it that I have not been able to subsume. Aesthetics involves feeling an object
                        <emph>for its own sake</emph>, beyond those aspects of it that can be
                     understood or used. The thing withdraws into its network, luring me into the
                     shadows; and it bursts forth in a splendour that dazzles and blinds me. In
                     these cases, the understanding is frustrated, and the will reaches the limits
                     of its power. It is only aesthetically, beyond understanding and will, that I
                     can appreciate the <foreign>actus</foreign> of the thing being what it is, in
                     what [Graham] Harman calls "the sheer sincerity of existence."</quote> 
               If a
                  "Romantic" thing theory is one dialectically related both to things as they are
                  and things as they might be, it would also seem to resist the idea that attention
                  to "things" represents a supercession or redemption of the supposed "abstractions"
                  of theory.  Partly in the spirit of a resistance to the final dominion of
                  things—and that spirit of resistance is perhaps a shibboleth, a specifically
                  Romantic inflection of thing theory—both of the initial calls for the papers
                  included here also encouraged dialectical or resistant engagement. Titling the
                  English session <title level="a">This is Not a Thing,</title> the committee wished
                  the allusion to René Magritte to suggest a certain distrust of the "thing" as a
                  repudiation of, or correction for, Romantic <emph>theory</emph>.  More subtly, by
                  elevating the deictic "this" as its <emph>object</emph>, it raised the question of
                  how to understand the materiality of Romantic words and letters.</p>
                  <p>The Comparative Literature Division accomplished a similar end by devoting two
                  complementary sessions to <title level="a">Romantic Ideality</title> and <title level="a">Romantic Materiality,</title> staging a chiasmus such that at the
                  very moment in which one thought (even hoped) to think on one side of things, that
                  thought turned out to be inextricable from ideas, idealism, and ideality. Essays
                  delivered at both of these comparative sessions—on ideality and materiality—appear
                  in this special issue.  These two panels were initially prompted by the way that
                  object-oriented ontology seems to have troubled anew the assumed opposition
                  between materialism and idealism.  In actuality though, each of the essays that
                  appears here is held together by a rethinking and reanimation of Paul de Man's
                  subtle account of linguistic materiality.  These essays are preoccupied with the
                  matter of words and letters, and the undoing of any sustainable opposition between
                  formal and material approaches to literature and culture.  </p>
                  <p>While object-oriented ontology sets out from the re-introduction of realism into a
                  theoretical terrain that since Immanuel Kant had given up on its legitimacy, the
                  question remains whether this thinking has a precedent or parallel in some
                  readings of Romanticism, in particular, those that, at least since de Man (the
                  explicit subject of Tom Toreman's and Mario Ortiz-Robles' essays and a key
                  intertext, if not the implicit subject, of essays by Anna Kornbluh and Brian
                  McGrath) have focused on "Kant's Materialism."  These essays hold on to
                  materialism, but do so in order redescribe materiality as a possibly displaced
                  name for a linguistic predicament.  Put another way, the essays collected here
                  lead us to ask whether Romantic materialities say more or less the same thing as
                  "Speculative Realism"? Do they, far from collapsing into relativism, instead
                  embrace a sense of things in their very awareness of linguistic force? </p>
                  <p>Put another way, just as the essays we have collected here register the emergence
                  of new methods and ways of thinking, they also remind us of the endurance of an
                  earlier account of radical—and radically unconventional—materiality, one that
                  Jacques Derrida registers as a "nothing" that operates as "a force of resistance,"
                  neither substance not matter, but rather a "materiality without matter" (350).
                  Resistance, whether or not it takes shape, emerges in this sense as materiality
                  itself. This is the resistance to which the <emph>this</emph> of "this is not a
                  thing" bears witness.</p>
                  <p>The two papers from the English Romantic Period session represented here (the
                     others—<title level="a">Specimen Poetics: Reanimating the Romantic
                     Object,</title> by Dahlia Porter, and <title level="a">Marx's Romantic
                     Atom,</title> by Amanda Goldstein—were destined for other publications)
                  concentrate our attention on the strange way in which the process of reading might
                  be understood to exhibit the imbrication of things and thought.  In her essay
                     <title level="a">What Wordsworth Touched,</title> Sonia Hofkosh challenges the
                  prevailing conception of Wordsworth as a poet averse to "the touch of the real,"
                  as a poet who instead favored encounters with "phantom" reality (Hartman).   Yet
                  Hofkosh's focus is on the <emph>text</emph> as a thing: reinterpreting "the touch
                  of earthly years" not as nostalgia or mortality but as "somatic pressure," Hofkosh
                  describes reading as a process of "tandem touching" ("what we touch touches us"). </p>
                  <p>In a similar vein, Yoon Sun Lee brilliantly characterizes (an apt word) the Gothic
                  novel as "both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky
                  reliance on formula and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its
                  superficial character appears to indicate the existence of something deeper, or
                  even unconscious."  Evidence of the dissolved opposition between things and
                  persons, objects and subjects, exhibits itself in Ann Radcliffe's (narrative)
                  passages about passages, often located within the walls of castles whose
                  mouldering condition likewise suggests the collapse of boundaries.  In Radcliffe,
                  when a door opens, it appears to do so of its own accord.  Tracing the strange
                  effects of Gothic patterns, Lee offers us a ground-shifting (deterritorializing)
                  way of reading Gothic descriptions as "assemblages" that fail to produce a single
                  mental image, but instead register "the failure of things to persist." And if Lee
                  is right to suggest that materiality, when understood as a shifting force field of
                  intensities, is always already at risk of dissolving, emerging, and changing, then
                  Wordsworth's apparent aversion to the "real" may instead register the poet's most
                  profound attachment to the material.  For, as Hofkosh notes, the poet's attachment
                  to "things which are not things" required Wordsworth to produce stories "about how things
                  (entities, objects, bodies) change over time, must change, in order to
                  endure."</p>
                  <p>The remaining papers were presented at the two Comparative Literature sessions:
                  those by Anna Kornbluh, Brian McGrath, and Mario Ortiz-Robles composed a panel on
                     <title level="a">Romantic Materialities,</title> and Tom Toremans, together
                  with David Clark and Tilottama Rajan (both of whom had committed their essays
                  elsewhere) spoke on the <title level="a">Romantic Idealities</title> panel. </p>
                  <p>Two of these essays focus explicitly on Paul de Man whether in an effort to
                  characterize agency as a literary effect, an example of what Mario Ortiz-Robles
                  calls "literary immanence," or in order to situate the several texts devoted to
                  materiality within their original context—the Messenger Lectures at Cornell
                  University—and to reread them from that vantage (the aim of Toreman's essay).
                   McGrath and Kornbluh also turn to de Man, even if only by turning away from him.
                  Indeed, while they allegorically treat our contemporary experience of
                  virtuality—from the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath to the new
                  knowledge economy—they do so by way of an analysis of "material events."  While
                  Kornbluh makes a point of insisting that her essay will not repeat the gesture
                  whereby reading Karl Marx after de Man, a conventionally understood materialism
                  and a more enigmatic linguistic one seem not as different as one would otherwise
                  presume, her subtle approach to Marx remains thoroughly informed by the mode of
                  rhetorical reading that is de Man's signature.  The same can be said of Brian
                  McGrath's essay.</p>
                  <p>Like Jane Bennett, Brian McGrath sets out from Henry David Thoreau. While Bennett
                  loops Thoreau through Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, in order to propose an
                  alternative materialism to the dominant Marxist one, and in order to develop an
                  account of "lively" or "vibrant" matter, McGrath takes us straight to the
                  clouds—to Wordsworth's cloud and to cloud computing.  More specifically, McGrath's
                  essay is a patient, but also wandering, reflection on the line "I wandered lonely
                  as a cloud," which leads us to think through the economic and ecological costs of
                  mobility that our contemporary fascination with clouds—specifically with the cloud
                  in which, among other things, the words you are now reading are stored—reveals. In
                  doing so, McGrath stages a canny reversal, whereby the emblem of poetic—and above
                  all <emph>Romantic</emph>—immateriality turns out to be materiality itself. In
                  McGrath's reading, Wordsworth turns out to be less a dreamy idealist than a vibrant
                  materialist, attending to the life of things or the thingly life.  But McGrath
                  doesn't see this as the end of the so-called linguistic turn, but rather, just as
                  the theorists of objects have set out to recover the matter apparently lost by the
                  acceptance of social or linguistic construction, McGrath turns this thinking of
                  materiality resolutely back to Romanticism and to a renewed reflection upon its
                  figures.</p>
                  <p>Taken together, the six essays that we have collected here suggest that
                  Romanticism exposes us to a materialism that cannot merely be overcome and an
                  idealism with which it is not identical. By reading beyond the texts
                  conventionally associated with Romanticism, and by recasting the critical
                  tendencies—from thing theory to object oriented ontology—through the poets,
                  genres, and critics of Romanticism, these essays position Romanticism (and show
                  how Romanticism may always have been positioned) in another relation to
                     <emph>things as they are</emph>—or may be.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This paper explores the occasion of Wordsworth’s retrospective
                        commentary on his poetry as recorded by Elizabeth Fenwick in notes take at Rydal
                        Mount in 1843. Focusing on the aging poet turning the pages of the book he holds
                        in his hand as he reads and recalls writing his poems, the argument considers
                        touch as a form of mediation that in bringing the subject into relation with the
                        object also brings him into relation with his own material being. Wordsworth’s
                        retrospective project reminds us that such materiality is an inevitable if also a
                        fragile and changing condition of making poets as well as poems.</p>

                  <p>Sitting on the sofa in his comfortable library, or perhaps at the desk in his
                        attic study with a view of the hills and the lake beyond, a man rather
                        advanced in years turns the pages of a book of poetry, other volumes by the
                        same author arrayed on the shelf or on the table nearby. He reads some lines
                        of verse aloud or recites them from memory; he knows the words well and very
                        much enjoys repeating them. As he slowly turns the pages looking at poems
                        written over the course of a fifty year career, he reflects on the
                        circumstances of their creation; he recalls the particular experiences which
                        impelled him to compose them, for the poems he peruses are in fact his own.
                        He shares his reflections with a friend who devotedly sits with him for many
                        hours day after day for the many days it takes to look through seven volumes
                        of verse. The friend faithfully transcribes what he says, filling one
                        hundred and eighty leaves of a notebook with a history of a writing life and
                        an archeology of a poetic practice.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                            I am indebted to the account of the retrospective project in the
                            “Introduction” to <title level="m">The Fenwick Notes of William
                                Wordsworth</title>, ed. Jared Curtis (Penrith: Humanities-Ebooks,
                            2007), 12-28.</note> Fenwick, who had moved to Ambleside in 1838 to be
                        near the Wordsworths, encouraged and then collaborated on the poet’s project
                        of intensive retrospection which began when they sat down together in
                        January 1843, Fenwick’s pen poised to take dictation as Wordsworth opened
                        the first volume of the most recently published edition of his writings,
                        Edward Moxon’s 1841 <title level="m">Poetical Works</title>, turned the
                        pages past the frontispiece portrait (the white-haired Bard of Rydal Mount),
                        to recall a lifetime of writing poems, beginning with those referring to the
                        period of childhood. They finished their retrospective project six months
                        later in June 1843 with Wordsworth’s commentary on <title level="m">The
                            Excursion</title>, which extends to more than twenty leaves of Fenwick’s
                        notebook. This commentary includes circumstances he remembers about the
                        specific places and persons and situations from the past that he considers
                        the originating ground of the poem and thus its claim to a certain kind of
                        truth value (as he repeatedly insists, “every particular was exactly as I
                        have related”),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Ibid., 209. Future page
                            references will appear in the body of the essay.</note> but it also
                        registers the passage of time since writing it in a sense of loss or regret
                        infused into his present experience—for example, he notes the recent death
                        of his “lamented friend Southey” (195) and his “utter detestation” of an
                        ostentatious boat-house “now” (206) being built in Grasmere which will mar
                        the beauty and seclusion of that beloved lakeshore, as well as more public
                        sorrows such as the failure of “the present session of Parliament” to
                        improve the lot of children laboring in factories (214). Such references to
                        current events and feelings within his account of a poem written decades
                        earlier suggests the contingency not just of that particular creation, but
                        of the retrospective project itself. Memory unfolds here in real time,
                        opening the past in and to present circumstances and effects.</p>
                  <p>I will be looking at a particular piece of Wordsworth’s retrospective
                        project—his much cited remarks on the poem he refers to in 1843 simply as
                        “The Ode”—but it is worth noticing the temporal chiasmus operating in this
                        retrospective enterprise more broadly. When he sits down to read his own
                        poems once again, he engages in a redoubled and especially sustained process
                        of recollection in which looking back day after day enacts retrospection
                        going forward, as duration, a condition of the on-going present if not also
                        of the possible futures to which that present is always giving way.
                        Temporalities converge and intersect. The past acquires its particular form
                        and inflection from the present; it becomes, we might say, always already
                            new.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Insofar as Wordsworth’s
                            reflections on writing his poems can be understood as a remediation of
                            sorts, as I try to suggest here, Lisa Gitelman’s idea that new media
                            arise out of old and function as “socially embedded sites for the
                            ongoing negotiation of meaning ” would aptly describe his collaborative
                            enterprise with Fenwick. See Lisa Gitelman, <title level="m">Always
                                Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture</title>

                            (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000).</note> Let me mention that during the
                        months Wordsworth is thus engaged he turns seventy-three and is also
                        appointed Poet Laureate, an honor he initially refuses because he thinks
                        himself too old. He is in fact producing very little new work at this time,
                        though new editions of his previous writing continue to appear and he will
                        in the years ahead arrange for the posthumous publication of an authorized
                        biography as well as of the poem he calls “the long Poem on my own
                        education” or “the poem on the growth of my own Mind” (188) known to us as
                            <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. Though the ambitious annotation
                        project the poet undertakes late in his career may not constitute a wholly
                        “new idiom” such as Edward Said sees great artists developing near the end
                        of their lives, still we may find that the aging poet’s retrospective
                        account of his poetic practice does revisionary work and thereby offers an
                        opportunity for us to rethink some of the central and abiding formulations
                        of his (and Romantic) literary history. The old Wordsworth may be the new
                        Wordsworth for our time.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Said,

                  <p>As concerned as he had been at least since the poems and prefaces of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> with the question of reading,
                        especially of reading poetry, the Fenwick project highlights the extent to
                        which Wordsworth was a continuous reader and re-reader of his own writing,
                        and correlatively, the extent to which his writing entails and embeds the
                        supplement of reading. But I invoke the scene of the aging poet sitting with
                        Isabella Fenwick in the library or study at Rydal Mount in addition to
                        remind us how much Wordsworth’s writing was always and fundamentally a
                        social and embodied phenomenon, coming into being in the nexus of specific
                        relationships to individuals and communities and in the context of specific
                        situations, environments, and material conditions. The Fenwick notes
                        repeatedly attest to the circumstantial and materially determined nature of
                        poetic invention. His gloss on “We are Seven,” for instance, famously
                        recounts what Wordsworth calls “one of the most remarkable facts in my own
                        poetic career” (39)—that is, the inception of <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> in a walking tour with his sister and Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge in the Spring of 1798, or, more exactly, in their determination to
                        compose a poem to send to the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> to
                        finance that trip. Moreover, the scene of the production of the Fenwick
                        notes itself reminds us that poems are objects within a particular (if
                        changing) field of embodied activity and experience. When he holds the book
                        of poems, turning the pages to read them and reflect aloud on the details of
                        their composition—how they came to be the particular poems they are, and
                        thus how he came to be the poet he is, sitting there, turning the pages,
                        reading them—Wordsworth touches something that is one among the things in
                        the world that thereby touch him in return, for inevitably, what we touch,
                        touches us.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I am here adapting the terms

                        earthly years” ("A Slumber"), what the aging poet reviewing his life’s work
                        in the unavoidable knowledge of its approaching end must feel not just in
                        the abstract—as nostalgia, for instance, or as emotion recollected in
                        tranquility—but somatically, as a palpable pressure, however slight or
                        fleeting, a mild sensation on the surface of his skin, felt on the flesh, if
                        not also in the blood or along the heart. His hand upon the page, such
                        contact of the body with the world of tactile objects—here, the book or the
                        paper—instantiates what one philosopher of the haptic calls “something
                        mutual between the toucher and the touched.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mark Paterson, <title level="a">The Human Touch,</title>

                        </note> For the philosopher of the haptic, this “something”—which is not
                        itself a thing—evokes Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s argument about the reciprocal
                        relation between embodied consciousness and the external world. Something
                        mutual between the toucher and the touched. It is at this interstitial point
                        or plane of contact, an interface between person and thing, that the body,
                        according to Jean-Luc Nancy, would experience “its own weight,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean-Luc Nancy, <title level="m">Corpus</title>, trans. Richard A. Rand (New York: Fordham
                            University Press, 2008).</note> that is, the very gravity, or we might
                        say, the very lightness, of its own corporeal being. Nancy proposes that
                            “<emph>touching</emph>—happens in writing all the time” (11): “. . . the
                        page itself is a touching (of my hand while it writes, and your hands while
                        they hold the book) . . . a slight, resistant, fine texture, the
                        infinitesimal dust of a contact” (51); this dust, he suggests, is “the
                        ob-jected matter of the sub-ject” (29). To put it another way, let us
                        extrapolate from Theodor Adorno’s dialectical model of the relations of
                        subject and object to consider that when Wordsworth turns the pages upon
                        which his poems are printed, “subjectivity is grasped as the object’s form”:
                        in its encounter with the object, even or especially the object of its own
                        making, the subject can no longer—at least for the moment that they
                        touch—persist in “forgetting how much it is an object itself.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Subject and Object” in <title level="m">The Adorno Reader</title>, ed. Brian O’Connor (Malden &amp; Oxford,

                  <p>Although he defined poetry as “the history or science of feelings” (in his
                        note to “The Thorn”) and designed his works to be affecting (are we not
                        “moved,” like the narrator of “The Ruined Cottage,” by Margaret’s woeful
                        tale?), Wordsworth is not generally considered a poet of the haptic. Francis
                        O’Gorman has explored Wordsworth’s reticence about depicting human touch in
                        his poetry, arguing that while his language aspires to material
                        efficacy—words as things—even such a rhetorical near approach to the
                        tangible is threatening, “marked with death and effacement.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Francis O’Gorman, “Wordsworth and Touch,”

                        the poet is primarily understood to be reacting to “a ghostliness” or a

                        were present” (<title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title>), rather than by what he will call, in a comment
                        Isabella Fenwick writes down as he turns the pages of the volume he holds in
                        his hands (and to which I will return), “objects of sight” such as the wall
                        or tree at which he would many times grasp to remind himself that “external
                        things [have] external existence.” For Hartman, as for Nancy, all art may
                        involve a “kind of touching” (22), especially, for Hartman, mimetic art, in
                        that representation subsists in some relation to reality, whether regressive
                        or restorative or substitutive. But despite his early compulsion to grasp
                        the wall or tree, Wordsworth is not ultimately a poet of touch, or the
                        tangible, or even the visible in Hartman’s influential analysis; instead,
                        his poetry “almost transcends representation,” seeming to exist, Hartman
                        says, “without the material density of poetic texture—without imagistic or
                        narrative detail” (27) or, we might add, without the book or the pages he
                        turns when he reviews his writing at Rydal Mount in 1843.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In her recent discussion of the “elusive matter of lyric

                            Jacobus suggests that in Wordsworth’s writing touch involves “what
                            Derrida calls ‘tact,’ the tact not to touch, or the untouchable” and
                            thus informs an ethics or ecopoetics of distance or withholding. See
                            especially Chapter 3. Jacobus’s resonant discussion focuses on natural
                            objects (trees, rocks, clouds), while I want to consider the efficacy of
                            the artifactual or the handmade (the wall as well as the tree).

                        what it is and what it may become for its writer and its readers. Even as I
                        write (or, rather, type) this sentence, that materiality and those practices
                        are undergoing significant transformation. The page is now often digitized,
                        as this one is; we might turn it by tapping on a button or swiping a finger
                        across the surface of a screen. The specific situation in which the body
                        encounters the work of art is always under construction. In looking with
                        some insistence at Wordsworth turning the pages of his book as Isabella
                        Fenwick transcribes his commentary on his creative process, I do not mean to
                        claim that the medium is the message; I do, however, want to suggest that
                        specific and changing forms of mediation constitute a “material density” at
                        the conceptual ground of the literary enterprise and it is in relation to
                        such materiality that the meanings and values the work of art variously
                        acquires and confers are determined. Further, I want to suggest that however
                        infinitesimal its dust, Wordsworth implicitly understood the force and
                        consequence of such materiality as foundational to the operation of the
                        imagination and to the identity of the poet as agental subject or creative
                        consciousness. </p>
                  <p>As a retrospective project, the Fenwick notes remember the making of each
                        poem, and crucially thereby the making of the poet <foreign>qua</foreign>
                        poet; moreover, in the very quotidian drama (“little, nameless, unremembered
                        acts”) of the hand turning the pages of the book, that project in addition
                        does not forget that poem as well as poet are always being grasped in
                        material form, or, in Nancy’s terms, as ob-jected matter. While his early
                        poetics may be constructed specifically against what Stephan Uhlig calls
                        “poetic objecthood,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephan H. Uhlig,
                            “Poetic Objecthood in 1798,” <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Poetic

                            36-42.</note> the scene at Rydal Mount in 1843 demonstrates Wordsworth’s
                        unavoidable reliance on (even his investment in) the materiality of his
                        poetic practice. The poet performs even if he does not theorize the everyday
                        efficacy of objects in the Romantic imaginary. And yet, he does offer a kind
                        of thing theory in the Fenwick notes. His reflections on the origins of each
                        poem collectively articulate a logic of embodiment—that poems come into
                        being as situated phenomena, that they are written and read as singular
                        artifacts within a complex and contingent relational field. Wordsworth had
                        of course long aspired in his poetry to keep the reader “in the company of
                        flesh and blood” (“Preface” to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>).
                        Perhaps we might go so far as to say that in the Fenwick project as he sits
                        turning pages and she sits with him taking dictation, he is thinking through
                        the body as the very condition for making and apprehending the work of art.
                        To say this is not to claim primacy in the production of meaning and value,
                        either for the hand turning the page, or for the inanimate object, the book
                        or the paper; it is not to argue for a strictly materialist ontology that
                        would exclude any/thing not immediately available to the senses. But it is
                        to return, as Wordsworth himself does in the note I want to look at briefly
                        in closing, to the question of the subject’s relation to the object and to
                        the function of the intimate contact—the touch—that puts them into that
                        relation. </p>
                  <p>Paul De Man rejected the problematic of the subject’s relation to the
                        object—the mind to nature—as an “impasse” in the discourse of Romanticism, a
                        “pseudo dialectic” that masks the “painful knowledge” of time, and death,
                        and the difference of the self from the non-self that is expressed in a
                        rhetoric of temporality, as allegory or irony.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> de Man, “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” 187-228; 198;
                            207; 198.</note> De Man describes this negative self-knowledge as a kind
                        of vertigo, and in particular in reading Wordsworth, locates it at the
                        moment when the bond between subject and object is revealed as unstable or
                        even illusory: “the experience hits as a sudden feeling of dizziness, a
                        falling or a threat of falling, a vertige of which there are many examples
                        in Wordsworth.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Time and History in

                        least one such example is invoked in the commentary Isabella Fenwick records
                        in her notebook at Rydal Mount. Here, however, it is crucially in the very
                        contact of subject and object that Wordsworth acknowledges temporality and
                        the condition of being a body in time. </p>
                  <p>In his comments on “The Ode,” the poem Hartman has called “Wordsworth’s
                            <title level="m">Being and Time</title>,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Wordsworth Before Heidegger,”<title level="j">The
                                Unremarkable Wordsworth</title>, 202.</note> the aging poet recounts
                        how difficult it was for him as a boy “to admit the notion of death as a
                        state applicable to my own being” or “to think of external things as having
                        external existence” (159): <quote>I communed with all that I saw as
                            something not apart from but inherent in my own immaterial nature. Many
                            times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall
                            myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that time I was
                            afraid of such processes. In later periods of life I have deplored, as
                            we all have reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character &amp;
                            have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines
                            ‘obstinate questionings &amp;c.’ (160)</quote> The abyss that threatens
                        to open for the young Wordsworth is significantly not a function of the
                        difference of the self from the non-self but of the total assimilation or
                        abstraction of the material world into or as the subject, “the world of his
                        own mind”; the boy recalls himself <emph>from</emph> even as the older poet
                        would recall him <emph>in</emph> such “dizzy raptures” (“Lines” 86) by
                        touching something—a wall or tree, or a volume of verse. The note suggests
                        that grasping the external existence of material things is stabilizing, but
                        also inevitably conduces to its own constraining effects (“subjugation,” or
                        what “The Ode” calls “shades of the prison-house” [67]). What he touches,
                        touches him. But if the child who touches the wall or tree as an anchor
                        against idealist free-fall is father to the man who deplores the limits thus
                        imposed upon his imagination by “sense and outward things” (145), the note
                        also intimates that the transformative capacity of being in time can turn
                        fear into rejoicing even as it leaves its traces on the aging body, the
                        infinitesimal dust of a contact. </p>
                  <p> I have only begun to suggest how this note condenses the story the Fenwick
                        project implicitly tells about what Wordsworth touched. This is a story not
                        just about the past, about remembering things that existed and how they came
                        to be, but also about how things (objects, bodies) change over time—must
                        change—in order to endure. When in the process of the retrospective exercise
                        he undertakes with Isabella Fenwick in 1843 he thus necessarily makes
                        contact with external things that have external existence, including the
                        pages of books, he is not so much proclaiming an “ontic unity of all things,
                        including human things,” as Paul Fry has recently argued.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Paul Fry, <title level="m">Wordsworth and the Poetry of
                                What We Are</title> (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press,
                            2008), 6.</note> Nor, as Adam Potkay has similarly proposed, is he
                        affirming a deep ecology that comprehends “all thinking things, all objects
                        of all thought” (“Lines” 102) as “one life” (<title level="m">The
                            Prelude</title> 2:430).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Adam Potkay,
                            “Wordsworth and the Ethics of Things,” <title level="j">PMLA</title>
                            123.2 (March 2008): 390-404.</note> Rather, as when he was a boy
                        repeatedly reaching out to grasp a wall or tree, the old man’s touch
                        establishes a relationality that is fluctuating and fragile at the point or
                        plane where the self is distinguished from the non-self, where the subject
                        in its very intimacy with the object becomes the particular subject it is,
                        limited to and by a particular body. The old man’s touch lingers, day after
                        day, an infinitesimal dust. No impasse, this may be the everyday prose of
                        poetry: it conveys that we feel most in and of the world, situated, embodied
                        in relation to external things when we feel how tenuous our hold on those
                        things is, and yet hold them close as if our own life depended on it.</p>

               <p>Though Karl Marx stands an irrefutable and even obligatory
                  touchstone in most trajectories of materialism, his historical materialist
                  analysis of capital proceeds by way of a number of formulations that subsequent
                  Marxists would, and do, critique as idealist: conceiving labor as a differential
                  substance that “is more than it has” and that marks the human’s distinction from
                  animals (or, at least, from “bees” as the example goes) by virtue of its
                  ineluctably ideational aspect; conceiving capital as “illusory, but (with) its own
                  laws of motion for all that”; conceiving value as “in reality impossible”; and
                  conceiving capitalism as a mode of production that is simultaneously a
                  metaphysical system. As our present financial crisis has prompted various returns
                  to Marx, particularly to his theory of fictitious capital, this entwining of the
                  material and the ideal once again demands critical attention. This paper focuses
                  on a few signal moments when thinking capitalism requires a materialism merged
                  with its other – moments when it is a necessity, rather than a weakness, for
                  Marxian materialism to have been something more multifaceted than we epigones
                  generally avow.</p>

                  <p>Along with zombie banks and toxic assets, it is apparently so much fallout of the
                  present global financial crisis that we are all materialists now. In the
                  advertising campaigns for Detroit automakers ("this was once a country where
                  people made things") and in the liberal left political discourse of Naomi Klein,
                  Joseph Stiglitz, and others (finance is "entirely divorced from the real
                  economy"), a hard line inscribes itself between "things" and finance, Jeep Grand
                  Cherokee and Credit Default Swaps.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Chrysler

                  to be a materialist line—a line contouring the real and cordoning the unreal,
                  severing the sensuous from the imaginative, the raw material from the cooked
                  ideal. And who better than Karl Marx could serve as the foremost referee of that
                  line? He apparently judges "the material" to be "the means of subsistence" in
                  human society ('land, bread, housing' and labor), and rules everything else out of
                     bounds.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Karl Marx, <title level="a">First

                        Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organization of these
                        individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature...Men can be
                        distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion, or anything else
                        you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as
                        soon as they being to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is
                        conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of
                        subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material

                  </p>
                  <p>Unsurprisingly, in our present crisis it is to Marx's writings on "fictitious
                  capital" that political economists, cultural theorists, and even the mainstream
                  media have frequently turned when they desire to contrast "the material basis" of
                  value (as David Harvey puts it) and mere "claims or titles" of value (95).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Harvey frequently defines "fictitious capital" in
                     contrast to the "material," as in "money that is thrown into circulation as
                     capital without any material basis in commodities or productive activity" (95).
                     Marx's discussion of fictitious capital in Volume 3, Chapters 25 and 29 makes
                     no such distinction, focusing instead on the specificity of the "titular"
                     quality of the "claims to value" made by financial instruments, in connection
                     with the claims to value made by the process of commodity exchange.</note> From
                  the Latin <foreign>fingere</foreign>: to form or feign, "fictitious" in
                  "fictitious capital" indexes the putative opposite of Harvey's "material basis":
                  immaterial superstructural representation. For the materialism that founds this
                  particular critique of finance, industrial bodies that matter clash with financial
                  figures that don't, and we'd all be better off if we could just banish those pesky
                  representations. </p>
                  <p>Whatever the political benefits of such a "strategic materialism" (and I don't
                  dispute that there are some), my modest proposal here is that it ought not be
                  attributed to Marx. Precisely in the theory of fictitious capital, I argue, the
                  Marxian <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> problematizes any materialism that would exclude
                  representation from the material realm. In seeking to account for capitalism, but
                  also (one wagers) in materialisms beyond that accounting, Marx repeatedly grapples
                  with representation that materializes itself. His discussion of fictitious capital
                  pivots on this uncanny mediation, recapitulating a problematic which repeatedly
                  recurs across his writing—in interpreting finance, fetishism, valorized exchange,
                  labor, and even the natural world: a strange materiality whose existence is
                  unaccountable in terms of previously available matter, a material that dynamically
                  mediates itself into existence. </p>
                  <p>In Romanticist circles, this mediation is likely more recognizable under the sign
                  of "positing power" or "force." As those signs direct, one could arrive at this
                  modest proposal by reading Marx with Paul de Man and/or Jacques Derrida—and
                  indeed, crucial arguments by Jennifer Bajorek, J. Hillis Miller, and Werner
                  Hamacher have formidably educed the resonances between Marx's materialism and a
                  materialism of language.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Bajorek; Miller;
                     Werner Hamacher, <title level="a">Lingua Amissa: The Messianism of Commodity
                        Language and Derrida's Specters of Marx</title> in Derrida.</note> The route
                  I take in this essay is a more mundanely materialist one: reading Marx's texts
                  alongside the archive of Victorian financial journalism he extensively drew upon.
                  In that archive, which chronicled the financial revolution's rapid legalization of
                  the institutions and instruments of finance such as the corporate person and
                  derivatives, financial reporters continually formulated the enigmatic materiality
                  of finance and queried the metaphysics of "fictitious capital." Citing this
                  journalism at length, Marx's discourse attempts to educe the systematic
                  consequences of this phenomenon. </p>
                  <p>By the time Marx settled in London in 1848, the Victorians had endured the first
                  two in what would become a chain of constantly recurring large-scale financial
                  crises, in 1837, 1839, 1847, 1857, 1866, 1873, and 1878. In every mainstream
                  publication—from <title level="j">The Morning Chronicle</title> (the most
                  prominent daily) to Charles Dickens's <title level="j">Household Words</title> to
                     <title level="j">The Economist</title>—these crises were explicitly attributed
                  to the strange matter of fictitious capital.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For

                        Trade</title>, and Evans.</note> For years, these publications were Marx's
                  daily bread, littering his desk at the British Library, to which he had applied
                  for membership immediately upon settling in London, and where his very first order
                  of business was to read all the extant back issues of <title level="j">The

                  <p>In the passages of <title level="m">Capital</title> Volume 3 that are, even in
                  their obscurity, more familiar to us than this Victorian discourse, Marx
                  denominates fictitious capital as "interest," "claims" to future interest, "the
                  mother of all insane forms" (when "a debt, for example, appears in the mind of a
                  banker as a commodity"—read here "mortgage backed securities"), "self-propelling
                  value," the "majority […] component of banker's capital" and, above all, an
                  "illusion […] purely illusory" (<title level="m">Capital</title> vol. 3, ch. 29).
                  An illusion with many material modes of appearance, fictitious capital in the
                  Victorian press meant above all else a representation of wealth that could itself
                  beget wealth, a simulation that could, in their idiom, "realize capital."<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to Dr. Johnson's dictionary, when
                     "realize" first came into financial usage in the eighteenth century, it meant
                     "to convert money into land." The Victorian usage, by contrast, connotes the
                     conversion of land into money, the conversion of assets, whether "real" estate
                     or virtual futures, into the realer real of capital.</note> As critical
                  expository pieces in that era's press were keen to uncover, a crucial peculiarity
                  of the London Stock Exchange created the conditions for this precipitation of
                  value by feint. After the corporation was legalized in 1825, all Victorian
                  corporations conducted IPOs before they commenced operations, utilizing the public
                  stock market as their venture capital forum.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For
                     a history of the corporation in England, see Alborn.</note> If an entrepreneur
                  wanted to launch a business, he would assemble a corporate board and offer shares
                  in the business on the prospect that eventually the business would indeed
                  operate/construct/manufacture, etc. These shares would be sold to the public, who
                  would not pay in cash, but rather in the form of a promise—a "subscription" whose
                  bill would come due only on a bimonthly "Accounting Day." If, by the time of the
                  Accounting Day, the price of the company's share had risen—either due to hype
                  about subscriptions or to the availability of new information—an investor could
                  "realize" a profit by immediately turning over his shares without settling for his
                     subscription.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For exemplary expository essays
                     from the Victorian press on these dynamics, see <title level="a">The Stock

                  only moment in the process at which money changed hands, the reality of the profit
                  obtaining in a different register than shareholder dividends, since the companies
                  did not exist, and different too from exploitation, since no labor had been
                  performed. "Fictitious capital" thus signifies the differential reality of
                  promises (the prospectus, the subscription) that profit (creating a new state of
                  affairs, the actual money), speech acts whose eccentric felicity we could deem
                  "material events."<note place="foot" resp="editors">On promises that create new

                  <p>In light of this attention to performativity, it should not be surprising that the
                  Victorian financial discourse broadly audited financial tropes, frequently
                  synonymizing fictitious capital and "the poetry of banking."<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="a">The Poetry of Banking,</title>

                     the stroke of a pen."</note> After all, periodicals that went so far as to
                  quote Plato in their definition of fictitious capital as "a matter of figures
                  representing as existing that which has no real existence," could not long dally
                  without some harsh words for poetry (<title level="a">Banking Morality</title>
                  595, 597, passim). I won't myself dally on these recurrent references to chains of
                  figuration in which stock certificates function as "the representative of a
                  representative of a representative," but let us simply quote one: <quote>many of
                     the objects and events of {banking} are in their nature highly poetic. Like
                     Moliere's character who had been speaking prose for forty years without knowing
                     it, we talk, and think, and act poetry, without being at all conscious of the
                     fact. (<title level="a">Poetry of Banking</title>" 151) </quote> Unbeknowst to
                  us, poetry is the medium of financial life, the essence of the financial mode of
                  production—making things with words. But just as poetry in the restricted
                  sense—representations of representation, derivative and devoid of being—is
                  enveloped within poetry in the general sense ("<foreign>poiesis</foreign> means
                  simply creation...any action which is the cause of a thing emerging from
                  non-existence into existence"), it is hard to argue that the poetry of banking is
                  the only poetic phase of capitalism (Plato 205c).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the Romantic importance of Plato's slipping distinctions, see Shelley's

                  the Victorian press involves the illustration that the advent of money is already
                  a poetic estrangement. He insists that money must not be analogous to language in
                  general, but to language in the sway of becoming-foreign (a good definition of
                  poetry): <quote>To compare money with language is...erroneous...Ideas which have

                     </quote> As a kind of representation that makes a claim to value—a claim to
                  represent an abstraction that lacks ontological positivity—money contrives to
                  effectuate the concrete existence of that abstract substance. Such a contrivance
                  is aligned not with language in its quotidian or referential function, but with
                  language in its defamiliarizing tropological character. </p>
                  <p>Even more fundamentally—logically prior to the valorization of labor by
                  money—labor itself, Marx's formulations suggest, is already bound up with this
                  same foreign representation. The restricted sense of poiesis is not the exception,
                  but rather the archetype of the general sense; making out of illusion is the
                  condition of all human making: <quote>Labor is, first of all, a process between
                     man and nature, a process by which man mediates...We understand labor in a form
                     that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble
                     those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the
                     construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the
                     best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination
                     before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labor-process, we get a
                     result that already existed in the imagination of the laborer at its
                     commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he
                     works, but he also realises a purpose of his own. (<title level="m">Capital</title> vol. 1, ch. 7, sec. 1, 284) </quote> While the bee fulfills
                  needs by changing the form of natural materials, man forms an idea, an imaginative
                  projection, of both needs and their fulfillment. Labor for Marx, Bajorek notes,
                  must thus be defined as the mediation of material and ideal (48). Crucial
                  affinities therefore entwine labor and language (especially language conceived of
                  as inherently imaginative)—which is why, in defining human nature, Marx lit upon
                  Milton: "Milton produced <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> in the same way
                  that a silkworm produces silk, as the activation of his own nature" (1044).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  the exemplar of natural production: literary making is natural making. </p>
                  <p>This dynamism of natural making also underlies Marx's thought about the raw
                  material of nature. In his letters to Engels for almost a decade, which prompted
                  Engels's composition of the <foreign>Anti-Duhring</foreign>, Marx conceived nature
                  as perhaps the foundational instance of strange matter, theorizing the "leap" by
                  which "a transition is made from the realm of non-sensation to the realm of
                  sensation" when nature materializes itself, and regularly using the term
                     "<foreign>naturwuchsig</foreign>" (nature-grown / nature-made) to classify
                  spontaneous making accountable neither as effect of labor nor as a sum of natural
                     causes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on Marx's use of the term
                        "<foreign>naturwuchsig</foreign>" see Karatani.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have followed the silkworm's thread down this rabbit hole in which even the
                  most immediate referent for "material" is itself riven by speculative enigmas, we
                  can return again to the question of whether banking is the only poetic phase of
                  capital—that is, whether there is a distinctive historical moment of fictitious
                  capital from which we might find it politically desirable to regress. When Marx
                  first introduces fictitious capital in his writings, he does so by quoting a
                  report to Parliament in which officials warn of the "dangerous expansion" of an
                  "enormous superstructure" (Marx inserts an exclamation mark here) of credit atop a
                  "base" of the Bank of England's monetary reserve, finding that the gross economic
                  output was not only one in which credit exchanges had vastly exceeded cash
                  transactions, but one in which the volume of credit transactions undertaken to
                  settle other credit transactions amounted to a situation in which "it is
                  impossible to decide what arises out of real, bona fide transactions, or what part
                  is fictitious" (Leatham 44). <note place="foot" resp="editors">The report was
                     published in 1840 by Leatham.</note> "Fictitious" thus from the beginning
                  bespeaks not the opposite of the real, but its indistinguishable twin. Indeed,
                  Marx's chapter on <title level="a">Credit and Fictitious Capital</title> stresses
                  the additive rather than adversative function of the copula "and"—he assembles a
                  series of quotes from the financial press and from economic history texts that, in
                  their very definitions of ostensibly more legitimate, more collateralized forms of
                  credit, render credit as such indistinguishable from fictitious credit. In
                  economic discourse itself, his assemblage punctuates, it is impossible to decide
                  on the line between real and fictitious capital.</p>
                  <p>For Marx, this impossible indeterminacy indicates precisely that something within
                  all capital is fictitious, that capitalist exchange is ontologically unstable,
                  logically ungrounded. From the opening pages of <title level="m">Capital</title>,
                  it is clear that speculation occurs long before the advent of the stock market and
                  futures contracts: it takes place as soon as any exchange of goods is mediated by
                  the abstraction "value." Value hypostasizes the commensurability of two
                  qualitatively different goods, in two different spatio-temporal situations—a
                  commensurability that Marx underscores is "in reality impossible" (<foreign>in
                     Wahrheit unmöglich</foreign>) (<title level="m">Capital</title> vol. 1, 151).
                  The idea of value overcomes this impossibility by providing a "makeshift"
                     (<foreign>Notbehelf</foreign>) an image that Marx designates "foreign to the
                  true nature of things" (<foreign>etwas der wahren Natur der Dinge
                     Fremdes</foreign>). In overcoming impossibility and mediating "true nature,"
                  valorization surges into actuality, wreaking foreignness in its wake. Not just
                  finance, but every act of valorized exchange entails this lurching
                  effectivity—this precipitous makeshifting from material to immaterial and back
                  again—which Marx repeatedly designates with verbs of "jerking," "hurling,"
                  "flinging," and "throwing"—going so far as to define the drive momentum of capital
                  accumulation as a "glitching circuit" (<foreign>fehlerhaften Kreislauf</foreign>)
                     (<title level="m">Capital</title> 873). He also likes the noun "leap"—when
                  money comes to stand for value and becomes the third party in exchange,
                  commodities make a "mortal leap" (<foreign>salto mortale</foreign>) into the body
                  of money; when the argument in <title level="m">Capital</title> reaches
                  insurmountable paradoxes it makes a leap to start anew (<foreign>Hic Rhodus, hic
                     salta</foreign>!), and also when nature materializes itself, as in the passage
                  from the <foreign>Anti-Duhring</foreign> (<title level="m">Capital</title> 200,
                     260).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also <title level="m">Contribution
                        to the Critique of Political Economy</title>. </note> A consistent Marxian
                  motif (which Kiarina Kordela argues to be understood as Spinozan "immanent
                  causality") is this notion of that which does not exist but in its effects defines
                  every moment of capital, from mediated value to hedged futures (<title level="m">Surplus</title>). Thus Marx's strongest assertion about fictitious capital
                  formalizes the phenomenon he has been tracing all along: "fictitious capital
                  is...purely illusory, yet it has its own laws of motion for all that"
                     (<foreign>seine eigne Bewegung</foreign>) (vol. 3, ch. 29, 596). </p>
                  <p>As he repeatedly limns the strange material events of self-positing
                  performativity, Marx broaches the insight that all capital is galvanized by the
                  leap which fictitious capital perfects, prompting his denomination of fictitious
                  capital "the most complete fetish" in its consummation of the fetishism of
                  commodities and the fetishism of the "makeshift" (<title level="m">Theories</title> 453). Fictitious capital comprises not only naked short sales
                  and collateralized debt obligations, but stock, credit, money, and value itself.
                  For this reason, we must rigorously refrain from romanticizing the non-fictitious
                  "reality" of earlier capitalism when talking about finance: although empirically
                  speaking, the world of the past did not <emph>fully</emph> concretize the
                  universal structure of capital, structurally speaking, this fictitious virtuosity
                  has always been with us.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This contrast between
                     empirical and structural is a variation on that between phenomenological and

                  materialism we could name Marxian is thus not the tired arrest of speculative
                  velocity by kissing the ground, embracing a substance—for that would be
                  materialism made ideal. It is rather a "materialism without matter"—what Marx
                  called the "ruthless criticism of everything existing": the relentless analysis of
                  the material events by which capital posits its own preconditions while poetry
                  makes the world, and of the mediations that might one day unbind the two.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Letter, <ref target="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_09.htm">Marx to Ruge</ref>, September 1843.</note>

               <p rend="noCount">This article examines Radcliffe's writing as a phenomenon of
                  continuous material surfaces and folds. Radcliffe's Gothic narratives can be seen
                  as assemblages that generate transpersonal affects and intensities. Their
                  conservatism can be seen in how they conceive of agency as a force that arrests or
                  works against the constant movement inherent in materiality.</p>

               <p> Gothic things can create embarrassment—for example, the gigantic helmet that crashes
               down from the sky at the beginning of Horace Walpole's <title level="m">The Castle of
                  Otranto</title> (1764), or the inevitable trapdoor that appears in the floor, the
               candle that goes out just when you know it will, or the door that seems to bolt or
               unbolt itself. As Jane Austen suggests when <title level="m">Northanger
               Abbey</title>'s heroine finds herself captivated by a mysterious lacquered cabinet,
               objects have a way of leading to the subject's mortification. But the problem is not
               simply one of animation, or the extension of human qualities to inanimate objects. A
               certain restless openness characterizes both human subjects and things. Gothic
               fiction can extinguish conceptual distinctions and narrative relations between
               subject and object in a radical manner. The contact is too intimate, too close, and
               too unmediated; the giant helmet and the puny body crushed under it form a grotesque
               material assemblage, as do Catherine Morland's "trembling hands [and] the hasp of the
               lock" (Austin 119). When Catherine examines and finally opens that cabinet in her
               room, furniture, heroine, and ambient environment meld into a fear-producing machine.
               Sounds within the body and those outside the room blend together, while motions ("the
               lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter") travel
               freely from environment to supposed inhabitant ("Catherine trembled from head to
               foot") and back again (124-5).</p>
               <p> The Gothic novel, that staple of Romantic publishing and reading, has always seemed
               both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky reliance on
               formula and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its superficial character
               appears to indicate the existence of something deeper, or even unconscious. "The
               superficial and the formulaic," as Elizabeth Napier puts it, "form the very heart of
               the Gothic" (29). Marshall Brown has shown how Gothic fiction's clichés perform the
               function of Freud's dream-work, communicating incommunicable desires. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Brown 161-182, as well as Duncan 20-50. </note>
               But I want to step back from this assumed paradox and ask whether this genre,
               particularly in Radcliffe's handling, assumes anything distinctive about human
               consciousness: anything that distinguishes it ontologically from the hollow caves and
               passages, mountains and watchtowers, clouds, sounds, and effects of light and weather
               that fill its pages. Or even more radically: is there anything but movement on the
               surface? Does the phenomenon of interiority matter? Are subjects defined by their
               interiority or by intensities that freely wander across forms and surfaces, coming
               and going? Do affects have anything other than a temporary location? Does narrative
               have an inherent direction?</p>
               <p> To ask this is to put into question some basic assumptions of reading: that subjects
               are the subject, that landscape constitutes a background, that the novel is an
               exercise in representation analogous to consciousness, or, more recently, that the
               novel is an exercise in social will or construction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Armstrong.</note> This essay engages a different set of
               assumptions and pursues a different, materialist protocol of reading. It will examine
               Ann Radcliffe's <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> (1794) as a phenomenon
               of continuous material surfaces and folds, rather than as a reflection of
               consciousness or a purposive ideological construction. It will look at how different
               elements of the novel move, rest, and collect into varied, manifold assemblages that
               express a single intensive materiality. The Radcliffean novel will be viewed as "a
               project of composition and synergy," to borrow a phrase from a recent interpreter of
               Benedictus de Spinoza (Sharp 13). Humans and non-humans, affects and things are
               brought into contact and combination in ways that defy conventional models of agency,
               causality, or narrative teleology. In other words, Radcliffe's Gothic represents a
               certain materialist vision of the world, but it does more than this. It accretes and
               flexes its own materiality as a supple discursive thing, extended in time as well as
               in space.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On perdurance theory, or the idea that you
                  have different temporal parts as well as different spatial parts, see Hawley
                  10-11.</note>
               </p>
               <p> What emerges in Radcliffe's novels can be described as a vibrant materiality, to
               borrow a phrase from political theorist Jane Bennett. According to Bennett, what
               so-called new materialists study is "not a world... of subjects and objects, but of
               various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations... a world
               populated less by individuals than by groups or compositions that shift over time"
               (354). They reject the Cartesian view of matter as "extended, uniform, and inert...
               solid, bounded objects that occupy space and whose movements... are predictable,
               controllable, and replicable" (Coole and Frost 7-8). Drawing on post-Newtonian
               science, they emphasize "matter's immanent vitality," the way that matter
               materializes as "excess, force... relationality" (8). Such approaches may seem
               incongruous in this context, a latter-day attempt to revive interest in Radcliffe by
               associating her with strange new worlds of theory. So it is surprising to discover,
               not only within Radcliffe's novels, but in the contemporary context of their
               production and reception, a similar way of thinking about materialism along these
               lines of impersonal transformations and transpersonal assemblages. The explanation
               may have to do more with Spinoza than with Deleuze: as Marjorie Levinson has recently
               shown in relation to William Wordsworth and Spinoza, questions of "social ontology,"
               or of "being numerous" may well be as vital to the project of Romanticism as the
               Hegelian questions of representation and self-consciousness that have long dominated
               critical discourse (643).</p>
               <p> The tendentious distinction between the natural and the social that Bruno Latour
               calls the constitution of modernity was a preoccupation of the popular fiction of the
               time as well as of the poetry. The natural world of things, "the mute and material
               multitude of objects," is understood to stand over and apart from the clamorous
               social world of human subjects, each world following its own laws and asserting its
               autonomy from the other (29). Yet everywhere, as Latour argues, person-thing and
               fact-interpretation hybrids proliferated, as it became modernity's distinctive
               self-given task to try to sort them out, to restore the autonomy of human subjects
               from the world of things. But their mutual imbrication has always been known. Readers
               and critics of Gothic novels reserved their gravest concern not for what these novels
               represented, but for what they seemed to do to the humans who consumed them.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Watt 8. </note> They worried about the
               physiological effects of repeated encounters with these types of objects, about the
               loss of distinction and identity perceptible everywhere. Books, authors, and readers
               switched places and blended identities within what might be called a
               social-physical-narrative network. Critics deplored the tendency for boundaries
               between subjects and things to dissolve, for powers to be communicated, and for
               unpredictable affects to be generated. John Keats, for example, in his well-known
               tribute to the romances of "Damosel Radcliffe," genially threatens to "cavern you and
               grotto you and... wood you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous sound you and
               solitude you," offering a remarkable instance of what Deleuze and Guattari would call
               the deterritorialization of language. Signifiers, signifieds, referents, and speaking
               subjects become nearly indistinguishable: woods, rocks, solitude, and you become
               sounds, events of playful aggression.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Keats to J.H.

               </p>
               <p> Radcliffe's novels present a materiality composed of shifting, heterogeneous
               assemblages. They are striated by rhythms of movement and rest that include
               environment, characters, and discourse. But there is another twist to this story.
               Radcliffe's plots are to an unusual extent comprised of nothing but movement and
               stasis, in dialectical relation to each other. This characteristic draws attention to
               the nature of narrative itself as an uninterrupted material flow of discourse; as a
               result, I want to suggest, the concept of <emph>conatus</emph> undergoes a subtle
               shift. In Spinoza's thought, <emph>conatus</emph> refers to a "striving to persevere
               in existence," an intrinsic force by which each thing tries to maintain itself (Sharp
               125, 133-34). It is "a force of existence unique to each thing... a power of
               self-organization, self-maintenance" (133). Each entity tries to remain itself as far
               as possible. Radcliffe greatly relies on, but also greatly downgrades, this force as
               something within matter: things strive to persist but dissolve, materiality changes
               shape and form without pause. She thus creates a tentatively reflexive function in
               her narratives, a function that could be seen as a kind of melancholic agency. This
               function consists in explicitly recognizing sameness, persistence, or repetition. </p>
               <p> While the notoriously repetitive quality of Radcliffe's novels has often been
               remarked, what has gone less examined is the degree to which they pose the question
               of identity over time. Sometimes it is actually a question. In <title level="m">The
                  Italian</title> (1797): is this monk the same as the monk I saw before? At other
               times, it is an occasion for a certain affect: "'There!' she would exclaim, 'there
               are the very cliffs, there the wood of pines.... There, too, under the crag of that
               mountain, is the cottage... which he bade me remember, and copy with my pencil...!'"
                  (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 92). Remembering and copying, which are
               equivalent, enable a subject to do one thing: to point out persistence, identity over
               time. In Radcliffe's novels, subjects seem to be composed, like everything else, as
               ratios of rest and motion, speed and slowness. They blend indifferently or dissolve
               ecstatically into larger assemblages. But Radcliffe strikingly invokes a special
               function of recognizing sameness and a particular form of pathos. Persistence over
               time is linked to an overarching affect of loss and absence. In other words,
               everything strives—and mostly fails—to persist in its own form, but only certain
               super-agents seem capable of keeping track, of perceiving vacancy and negativity, and
               of retaining consciously the traces of former combinations. There are two more points
               to make about this exiguous form of agency. First, it describes what Radcliffe's
               narrative itself does: the material flow of discourse continuously shifts and evolves
               into varying assemblages, repeats itself, but it also keeps track. Second, the
               affective charge given to persistence can be seen as making a deep, almost
               subliminal, case for a generically conservative stance. Material persistence can even
               be regarded as an achievement productive of the most powerful affects; it is not
               something to be taken lightly. </p>
               <p> In these novels so often thematized as novels about confinement, imprisoning
               structures have an inexplicable habit of opening themselves. In <title level="m">The
                  Italian</title>, characters find themselves trapped in a subterranean vault: "the
               door closed, with a thundering clap that echoed through all the vaults." It appears
               impenetrable. "The thick wood was inlaid with solid bars of iron; and was of such
               unconquerable strength, that it evidently guarded what had been designed for a
               prison" (76). Yet typically, this boundary dematerializes when, one chapter and a few
               hours later, they discover that the door "stood a little open": "He could scarcely
               believe his senses, since... he had not heard its ponderous bolts undrawn..." The
               hero, Vivaldi, darts out, "breathless with speed" (99). Confinement in <title level="m">Udolpho</title> also leads to mysterious releases and then into prolonged states
               of wandering for no reason. Those heavy doors or walls rarely, if ever, exert a
               blocking or containing function, as we are reminded by countless crumbling castles—
               "shattered battlements and half-demolished walls" that have simply "from age and
               neglect, fallen to decay" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 606). The boundaries may
               be hollowed out. Doors in the castles of Udolpho and Le Blanc frequently lead into a
               passage "formed within the thickness of the walls..." Emily is informed "that there
               are many passages of the same kind concealed within the prodigious walls of the
               edifice" (458). A supposed prisoner, Dupont, wanders around Udolpho, passing through
               these hollow walls, even hearing and speaking through them: "the shell of the wall
               was there so thin... that I could distinctly hear every word, spoken on the other
               side" (459). And as everyone knows, he takes the opportunity to become himself a
               disembodied, inhuman echo: "I listened closely to Montoni... joined my voice, and
               repeated his last words" (460), provoking much consternation. Such passages do not
               lead anywhere; they pass by and connect, joining places, voices, and affective
               possibilities. </p>
               <p> But more than architectural boundaries seem to be porous. Objects frequently
               dissolve, losing their shapes, identities, and even substance. Emily goes in search
               of her aunt, and perceives "a track of blood, upon a stair." She follows it to a
               door, enters and sees "something lying in an obscure corner of the room." In a
               strange discursive skip in being, Emily "hurried towards the object that excited her
               terror, when, perceiving the clothes of some person on the floor, she caught hold of
               them, and found in her grasp the old uniform of a soldier, beneath which appeared a
               heap of pikes and other arms" (323). Emily's movement toward the object is
               interrupted when the object becomes something else mid-sentence, a "heap" of
               blood-stained clothes that itself merely conceals discarded weapons. That collection
               gives way narratively to another "track of blood... upon the stairs," which prompts
               further inconclusive movements by Emily, down and up, forward and back. <title level="m">The Italian</title> offers a similar moment in which "an object" becomes
               without warning a moving heap of "remains," only to resolve later in the chapter into
               "part of the habiliment of a monk" (76-78). These could be read as moments of
               successive discovery, but they can also be read as curious moments of shape-shifting
               or even thing-shifting. Rather than existing as solid, bounded things, Radcliffe's
               objects are restless. They can become movements or itineraries in the discourse:
               "Dorothée was telling of a door, that opened from a gallery, leading from the great
               stair-case into the last anti-room of the saloon" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title>
               560). </p>
               <p> The boundaries of subjects are even less able to be defined; the majority of
               characters subsist only as an echo of another.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dupont's existence for much of the middle section of the novel is as a faint
                  voice heard from beneath Emily's window, eventually identified as singing a
                  familiar song (439-440); when finally revealed, he is simply an echo of an earlier
                  lover, Valancourt, repeating Valancourt's emotions as well as his songs.</note>
               Humans and animals alike seem to exist as "open, complex systems with porous
               boundaries"—systems that also replicate themselves (Coole and Frost 15). Characters
               are often indistinguishable, not only because they resemble each other (though they
               often do: in Terry Castle's witty formulation, "Every other looks like every other
               other," and we could add that every self looks the same as well), but because
               perceptions and affects travel freely across and between them (128).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Castle's reading proceeds from many of the same
                  observations about the novel as mine, but moves to a diametrically opposed
                  conclusion, asserting a fundamental diremption between subjective fantasm and
                  objective reality that she links to a "denial of corporeality" as a historically
                  determined attitude (137).</note> In Chapter Five of the fourth volume, it soothes
               Emily's "pensive mind" to take long walks in the woods in the evening, "watching, in
               tranquil melancholy, the gradual effect of evening over the extensive prospect, till
               the gray waters of the Mediterranean and the massy woods were almost the only
               features of the scene, that remained visible" (540). Some fifty pages later, we
               encounter the same set of emotions and perceptions moving across another set of
               characters in motion. Blanche, her father, and her lover St. Foix are travelling
               through the Pyrenees, but any other class-appropriate characters could be substituted
               here. Blanche, Emily's inexplicable double, is the first in this scene to be assigned
               "a pensive pleasure, as she watched the progress of twilight gradually spreading its
               tints over the woods and mountains, and stealing from the eye every minuter feature
               of the scene, till the grand outlines of nature alone remained" (598). The affect is
               next embodied in the lines of a poem in which the absent Emily had already created a
               trope for this love of liminality ("To the Bat"). The poem addresses its subject:
               "Thou lov'st to sport upon the twilight air, Mocking the eye, that would thy course
               pursue... Thou flit'st athwart the pensive wand'rer's way..." (598). The affect of
               pleasure seems to be itself a flickering materiality that crosses and recrosses the
               path of the now-generalized "pensive wanderer." The biological substrate of "the
               young St. Foix" is next in line as the temporary location of this affect. In this
               scene and throughout the novel, affects are strangely impersonal or transpersonal
               types of matter that float through various contingent locations. It would be an
               understatement to say that character is underdetermined; their names barely serve to
               register the frailest shade of distinction between them.</p>
               <p> Radcliffe's materiality seems to consist in intensities rather than in solid,
               bounded extension. Thus, the distinction between inside and outside becomes
               irrelevant. Instead of measuring dimensions or referring to objects, Radcliffe's
               narrative typically tracks continuous gradations of intensity: heat and light, speed
               and slowness, relative concentrations of color. A representative passage in <title level="m">Udolpho</title> notes "[t]he solitary grandeur of the objects that
               immediately surrounded her, the mountain-region towering above, the deep precipices
               that fell beneath, the waving blackness of the forests..." before ending with "the
               wide horizon, where the same melting blue tint seemed to unite earth and sky" (166).
               How can plural objects be solitary? How can Emily be "immediately surrounded" by
               regions "towering above" and "[falling] beneath"? What is a "waving blackness"? The
               scene is constituted not by things but by qualitative intensities or vague essences:
               aroundness, aboveness, beneathness, blackness. In order to track fluctuations of
               intensity rather than the fixed locations of objects, the narrative creates what
               Deleuze and Guattari refer to as smooth or nomadic space: "an open space through
               which things-flows are distributed, rather than... a closed space for linear and
               solid things" (361). In this mode, there is "no line separating earth and sky"; it is
               "a tactile space, or rather 'haptic,' a sonorous much more than a visual space"
               (382). As in the passages above, the erasure of the horizon seems to repeat, and to
               initiate a broader openness to which flickering or "vortical" movements draw
               attention. Smooth space is not uniform, but rather open to "becoming and
               heterogeneity, as opposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical, the constant"
               (361). This is the space within which local variations occur, to which the names of
               characters are sometimes given and sometimes denied. "To a warm imagination, the
               dubious forms that float, half veiled in darkness, afford a higher delight, than the
               most distinct scenery that the sun can shew" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 598).
               The "warm" imagination is an intensity that merges imperceptibly and almost
               haptically with others, unlike the eye, too prone to perceive the dimensions of
               objects over against itself. </p>
               <p> The scene inaugurated by that statement is constituted as fluctuating or flowing
               intensities of energy. Standing a little apart from the rest of the group, which has
               taken shelter from a storm in a shallow cave, St. Foix views: <quote>with emotions of
                  awful sublimity, the long volumes of sulphureous clouds, that floated along the
                  upper and middle regions of the air; and the lightnings that flashed from them,
                  sometimes silently, and at others, followed by sullen peals of thunder, which the
                  mountains feebly prolonged, while the whole horizon, and the abyss, on which he
                  stood, were discovered in the momentary light. Upon the succeeding darkness, the
                  fire, which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam... on the
                  surrounding figures it threw a strong, though pale gleam... while upon the foliage
                  of a gigantic larch, that impended its shade over the cliff above, appeared a red,
                  dusky tint, deepening almost imperceptibly into the blackness of night. (601)
               </quote> What this impersonal focalization offers are "regions" localized by varying
               intensities of energy—contained in the clouds, discharged as lightning (of different
               intensities), contained and released by the fire, and dissipating as light in a
               continuum of energy. The material world represented is constituted by the differences
               and continuities between the "partial gleam" and the "strong gleam," the "dusky tint"
               and the "blackness of night," and the continuities are not merely at the level of the
               signified, but at the acoustic and visual level of discourse as well. Even things
               more solid than light are thus constituted as "forces, energies, and intensities...
               and complex, even random processes" (Coole and Frost 13). Human subjects, too, are
               complex processes that intersect or join their environment; in any given landscape
               Valancourt (or Dupont) may be "standing upon the bank of the road, resting on his
               pike with folded arms" (37), while Emily (or Blanche) "wanders away" nomadically to
               merge into this spectrum of intensity, "listening in deep silence" (37).</p>
               <p> I have, of course, been discussing what Radcliffe's novels represent, the sort of
               materiality that they seem to show or imagine for us. But the peculiar power of these
               novels lies in the way that they often seem to bypass this power of representing.
               They distribute discursive material through a smooth or nomadic space, at times
               intensifying its energy through concentration and at other times dissipating it.
               Another way to put this is that Radcliffe constructs discursive assemblages that
               produce powerful affects more through spatial contiguity and density than through
               syntactical relations. Representation requires elements to be put together in a
               certain way in order to produce a picture, whether you think of Kant's transcendental
               unity of apperception or of the rules of language. I would argue that Radcliffe's
               famed descriptive effects gesture toward a different use of discourse, one in which
               elements are linked neither hypotactically nor paratactically, but in a flexible
               linguistic assemblage or network that can be compressed or stretched out, usually
               over many pages. A typical assemblage from <title level="m">Udolpho</title> might
               comprise the following: a cave—the sound of a dog barking—a rude bridge—an opposite
               cliff—a light—voices—"a single watch-tower"—a story—"a cloudy moon" (601-605). The
               representational or referential dimension of this assemblage cannot be entirely
               dismissed, but that dimension is tenuous, untotalizable in its shifting from visual
               to haptic to acoustic references. Its affective power seems to derive from the ways
               in which these signifiers do not add up to a single, fixed composition or mental
               image. </p>
               <p> Assemblages bring or join things together in a way that is inherently dynamic or
               non-totalizable. Radcliffe's narrative discourse moves continually, imbuing its
               regions with different quantities of intensity, creating densely- or
               sparsely-populated assemblages. It is motion rather than logic, smooth space rather
               than syntax that gives rise to the assemblage. The ancient fortress where Blanche's
               party takes shelter is another such heterogeneous assemblage:
               silence—path—summit—gate—view of main body—grey stone—an arch—shattered
               battlements—remains of a giant oak (606). The continual restless and recursive
               movement of Radcliffe's discourse draws attention to the looseness with which its
               parts are conjoined, including the part we generally call meaning or signification.
               Assemblages may feature flashes of reference, allusions to meaning, as in this one:
               curiosity of Blanche—Emily smiling—grave silence of Dorothée—the spectacle in the
               chamber of Udolpho—"the alarming words that had accidentally met her eye in the MS
               papers"—the black veil (491). The logical, or even narrative, relation between such
               elements counts for little; pure discursive or material proximity matters far more
               because it is only this contact or combination that can produce powerful affects. </p>
               <p> It is well known that contemporary critics condemned Gothic novels because they
               could and did "produce so powerful an effect" on their readers (<title level="j">Monthly Review</title>, qtd. in Watt 115). It is not inaccurate to say that
               Radcliffe's readers saw her novels as material assemblages that affected them through
               direct physical contact. In E.J. Clery's account, "the distracted mass audience
               absorbs the [novels] osmotically, habitually," through "tactile appropriation" (152).
               In <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>'s sharp parody, we recall, Henry Tilney
               boasts of literally appropriating his sister's copy of <title level="m">Mysteries of
                  Udolpho</title>, "running away with the volume which... was her own, particularly
               her own" (78). Physical contact with the volume brings about an explosion of motion
               (ending in "the Hermitage-walk"). Tilney argues that he was compelled or propelled
               "in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait only five minutes"; his consumption of
               the novel is measured in terms of time and somatic effect ("finishing it in two
               days—my hair standing on end the whole time" [77]). Readers and novels form grotesque
               assemblages, not unlike the disorienting swarms and multitudes that were identified
               with Gothic architecture.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Napier 71.</note> The
               products of the Minerva Press had a way of blurring all identities. As Clery notes,
               such novels were generally published anonymously or under a pseudonym, and sometimes
               were merely reshuffled and repackaged versions of other novels (138).<note place="foot" resp="editors">"The trade seemed to resemble a chaos of shifting
                  identities, mysterious reduplications or multiple repetitions" (Clery 138).</note>
               Only the materiality of Gothic novels was iconic: in Austen's description, "three
               duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to
               the first, of two tombstones and a lantern" (82). The identities of authors or even
               the function of representation became less important than the sheer material
               proliferation of these novels, as lending libraries established themselves in
               "booksellers...engravers, and picture-framers, grocers, jewellers, confectioners,
               tobacconists, perfumers, ironmongers" (qtd. Clery 136).</p>
               <p> The "multitude of readers" (qtd. Clery 151) combined with the multitude of Gothic
               novels to form a productive assemblage, in Deleuze's terms: "a machinic assemblage of
               bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of bodies reacting to one another"
               (Deleuze and Guattari 88). This was a powerful kind of agency, an ability to make
               things happen.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Austen, of course, mocks this in
                  Eleanor Tilney's misapprehension of Catherine's remark that "something very
                  shocking indeed, will soon come out in London" (81).</note> Gothic novels linked
               bodies and discourse together to produce strong affects that transcended individual
               personhood and agency. The favored tropes of Gothic criticism reflect an awareness of
               this process. Gothic novels are consistently represented as itineraries, recipes, or
               a set of transformational procedures to be performed. They instruct their readers,
               critics complain, that "a young person [should] walk at night upon the battlements of
               an old castle... creep hands and feet along a narrow passage" (qtd. in Watt 81).
               Gothic novels produce and reproduce themselves, barely requiring the intervention of
               persons: "Take—An old castle... a long gallery, with a great many doors... Noise,
               whispers, and groans... Mix them together..." (qtd. Clery 147). Another critic gives
               instructions: "[f]rom any romance to make a novel. Where you find... A Castle.....
               put An house. A cavern... A bower. A groan... A sigh," presenting two parallel
               substitutable series of elements side by side: "The same table of course answers for
               transmuting a novel into a romance."<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="m">The Age; A Poem</title> (1810), in Napier 28.</note> A Gothic novel
               is itself a loose, non-linear material assemblage that cares little for the exact
               number, location, or identity of its parts. What counts is occurrence, recurrence,
               combination, and connection. One point can connect to any other point, in rhizomatic
               fashion, and the more connections, the better.</p>
               <p> There is a paradox that emerges in the criticism and even simply in the reading of
               these novels: we could call it familiar surprise, or predictable unpredictability.
               The novel's discourse continually moves and changes in order to present us with the
               same: yet another animal-vegetable-mineral-light-sonority assemblage. In <title level="m">Udolpho</title>, assemblages form, fade, decay, and then inexplicably
               reappear. Volume 4 is another Volume 1, retracing the same combinations of motion and
               rest, speed and slowness, offering remarkably similar moments, affects, assemblages.
               But such conjunctures are not supposed to be predictable or measurable; affective
               power is tied to surprise. But how can surprise coexist with such a high degree of
               repetition? The answer, I think, points toward a crucial feature of Radcliffe's
               narrative ontology, one that ties her to the so-called new materialism. Instead of
               being assumed to be static, substantial, and unchanging, materiality is understood as
               a contingent conjuncture or fragile assemblage that does not stay the same. It is a
               slow-motion flicker or flash. The assemblage is always gradually fading,
               disappearing, or evanescing; this is as true of the novel's discourse itself, its
               ceaseless flow of words, as of the represented dimension. Instead of posing the
               question of how beings can change, in other words, Radcliffe's discourse asks how
               things or assemblages can stay the same or repeat, how the same encounter can occur
               again. Persistence is always a surprise; recurrence nothing short of a miracle. Emily
               ends many chapters waiting for once-heard music to return: <quote>almost expecting,
                  that... the sounds would return....Emily continued to listen, but no music came...
                  Thus passed the hour in watchfulness... but no sounds returned; and, after
                  remaining at the casement, till the light tint of dawn began to edge the
                  mountain-tops and steal upon the night-shade, she concluded, that they would not
                  return. (340)</quote> Yet, though Emily fails to hear them, Radcliffe's sonorous
               assemblages are able to exert a powerful force in the narrative.</p>
               <p> Expectation and the capacity for disappointment give crucial hints as to Radcliffe's
               peculiar notion of agency. Agency is conceived not as a force that brings about
               change, but as that which lags behind change, or anticipates repetition,
               incorporating an otherwise inconceivable dimension of negativity into this material
               world. The distinction between subjects and objects is not necessary to maintain.
               Agency can be thought of as something like matter's own memory and expectation: that
               which preserves traces, keeps track of former iterations and assemblages, an
               after-intensity. It can be exercised by things or people, or distributed over
               assemblages: "there are the very cliffs, there are the wood of pines... There.. is
               the cottage," Emily notes when returning home at the beginning of the novel (92). She
               gives a local voice to a striving to persist that is not otherwise much in evidence.
               The last volume notes "the very avenue" that Emily had walked earlier; Emily points
               out to herself "the same high trees that used to wave over the terrace, and these the
               same flowery thickets... and there, too, on that bank, are the very plants" (583).
               This is in some ways the opposite of remembering; it is simply the awareness of
               persistence. Emily repeats the same assemblages: those steps, the terrace, the
               pavilion, Valancourt. In terms of the plot, persistence over time becomes visible
               against the ground of non-identity; in this case, the belief that Valancourt has
               changed morally: "he was no longer the same Valancourt." From this point of view,
               non-identity amounts almost to annihilation: "Valancourt seemed to be annihilated"
               (581). Yet the agency of retracing is so strong as to summon him into presence as
               part of this assemblage. "These recollections becoming too painful to be endured, she
               abruptly left the pavilion.. As she passed along the terrace, she perceived a person,
               walking... Valancourt! ...Emily, her eyes fixed on the place... remained, for some
               moments, unable to quit the spot, and scarcely conscious of existence" (586). Agency
               in this scene can be considered as the force that slows Emily down, reassembles an
               earlier conjuncture (pavilion—terrace—Valancourt), and fixes her to the spot,
               "scarcely conscious," thing-like. It seems to exist in excess of the immanent,
               ceaseless flow of materiality.</p>
               <p> As an arresting, persisting, or retracing dimension, agency belongs most strongly to
               the most notorious thing in Udolpho: what lies behind the black veil. We recall that
               Emily first approaches this object as part of a conscious effort "[t]o withdraw her
               thoughts... from the subject of her misfortunes" (248). It succeeds in withdrawing
               not only her thoughts but her consciousness. The horror produced by the "veiled
               picture," the narrative announces, "awakened all [her] powers" only to extinguish
               them when she perceives that the object behind the veil "was no picture" (249). Only
               in the final pages of the novel, to the eternal chagrin of readers, we learn that it
               was "a waxen image, made to resemble a human body in the state, to which it is
               reduced after death" (662). But from a material or ontological point of view, it is
               nothing to dismiss. It is not a picture, but neither is it "the murdered body of the
               lady Laurentini" (553). We could say of this body of wax that "an energetic
               materiality overspills the prepared matter" (Deleuze and Guattari 410). Its material
               agency certainly extends beyond its particular form or blurred figure. "A member of
               the house of Udolpho had been condemned to the penance of contemplating [it] during
               certain hours of the day"; and had "made it a condition in his will, that his
               descendants should preserve the image..." (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 662). The
               body of wax preserves its impressions and is itself preserved, "suffered to retain
               its station in the wall of the chamber" (663). But what it preserves, what seems to
               give it its uniquely petrifying effect on its observers, is the very frozen essence
               of materiality: "a human figure of ghastly paleness, stretched at its length, and
               dressed in the habiliments of the grave... the face appeared partly decayed and
               disfigured by worms, which were visible on the features and hands. On such an
               object...no person could endure to look twice" (662). There is the official horror of
               the <emph>memento mori</emph>, the reminder of flesh's decay. But beyond this, the
               object's powerful affect comes from the way it artificially arrests a certain
               material conjuncture, captures materiality in the act of decaying intensity, of
               changing phase and form. It attempts to stop the narrative's constant movement
               through this material image, and succeeds in more than one sense: putting a stop to
               the motor force of the reader's desire to look on the other side of the black veil.
               The agency of this object is powerful indeed, its pure persistence underlined by its
               apparent effect on viewers: "no person could endure to look twice." </p>
               <p> What this reading has tried to do is to question the relation between the novel and
               the individual, and to question the methodological individualism that still drives
               even recent critiques of the genre. Many important studies of the novel have focused
               on how the novel relies on, or alternatively, constitutes the subjectivity located
               within the boundaries of an individual human body. Nancy Armstrong, for example, has
               recently argued that "the novel was not made to think beyond the individual" (25).
               Radcliffe's novels, falling as they do within the general category of what Armstrong
               and many others have called the "literature of sensibility," may not seem to
               seriously challenge such arguments; indeed, Armstrong specifically maintains that
               such literature "opposes this individualism" through the mechanism of affective
               contagion (16). Armstrong also points out that after Radcliffe it became essential
               for the mainstream novel to include "Gothic elements" (12). However, the "gothic
               elements" in question need not be defined in terms of supernatural events, ghosts,
               creepy castles, and so forth. Rather, I would like to suggest that the gothic or
               Radcliffean element resides, on the one hand, in a persistent depersonalization of
               affect, and on the other hand, in an awareness of materiality as vital, in motion,
               and possessed of agency. </p>
               <p> The depersonalization of affect in Radcliffe is extreme: a feeling can be anyone's
               feeling, even if a story is usually somebody's story.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The allusion to Catherine Gallagher's study, <title level="m">Nobody's Story: The Vanishing Acts of Women Writers in the
                  Marketplace</title>, is intentional.</note> But we need to consider affect not so
               much as delimited, defined sensations but as "an encounter between bodies that
               involves...a qualitative change... in the intensity of a being's power to persevere,"
               in Hasana Sharp's gloss (26-29). Thus, affect cannot be the property of a single
               person; it is a relation that occurs at what might be called a molecular or
               micro-level. And the connection that Sharp makes between depersonalization and
               freedom, that "freedom involves a kind of depersonalization," seems to me central to
               any appeal that novels might possess (139).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This
                  insight lies at the heart of what Sharp calls "the politics of renaturalization,"
                  and is intended to offer an alternative to the Hegelian politics of recognition,
                  which aims ultimately at the reinforcement of self-conscious identity through the
                  consciousness of the other.</note> In other words, the difference between
               particular affects—and even individual characters—may not be as important as the
               transactions or contacts that occur between them. Novels create links and
               assemblages, though not always as visibly as in the case of Radcliffe. We might even
               say, in Bennett's words, that they reveal "not a world... of subjects and objects,
               but of various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations...
               groupings or compositions that shift over time" (354). Drawing attention to what he
               calls "romantic physicalism," Colin Jager has suggested the importance in Romantic
               and post-Romantic discourse of the consciousness-matter relation. I would agree with
               Jager that one important consequence of reformulating the debate, of bringing matter
               back into it, is a change in how political terms get defined: "it deflates the
               language of progressive and conservative because it deflates the oppositions
               (mind/nature, subject/object) in which that particular political debate is embedded,
               and returns us to the more defined—if no less mysterious—terrain of the mind-body
               problem" (47). I would add that it doesn't simply deflate the idea of conservatism,
               but rather situates it at a molecular level. Radcliffe's understanding of matter as
               in constant, swerving movement places a high value on persistence, on the
               preservation of traces; the phenomenon of persistence even amounts to a special kind
               of agency. This is the level, I think, at which her novels' conservatism can be
               examined. Phenomena of revolution and counter-revolution can be grasped not only in
               structures of affect, temporality, or suspended action (as in the "agonized waiting"
               that Mary Favret describes in her study of Romantic war-time temporality), but in the
               ways that narratives spin out their own shifting networks of materiality (75).
               Finally, Radcliffe's notion of materiality also overturns the idea that narrative
               consists in change and difference (in things happening to people, or people making
               things happen); it suggests a way of reading narrative not as chained sequences of
               cause and effect, but as heterogeneous assemblages and chance conjunctures of effects
               that sometimes cut transversely across the linear duration of the narrative, and
               sometimes rely on that duration to accrete a certain thickness or intensity.
               Radcliffe's narratives themselves illustrate the melancholic, conservative agency of
               tracing the same assemblages again and again. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">“Material Excursions” teases two questions. How does the
                  general mobility and flexibility of late capitalism, increased—if not
                  inaugurated—by cloud computing, leave material traces? And, given romantic
                  poetry's preoccupation with clouds, how does romantic poetry, specifically
                  the poetry of William Wordsworth, help us to think the material traces of
                  cloud computing and the knowledge economy differently? The essay draws from
                  the accidental convergence of Apple’s rhetoric surrounding iCloud and
                  Wordsworth’s “I wandered lonely as a cloud.”</p>

                     <quote>I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits unless I spend four
                     hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the
                     woods and over the hills and fields absolutely free from all worldly
                     engagements. . . . When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and
                     shop-keepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the
                     afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as if the legs were
                     made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they deserve some
                     credit for not having all committed suicide long ago. — Henry David Thoreau

                     <quote>What purchase might there be for loosening the grip of capitalism as an
                     oppressive instance? . . . One critical orientation, which is seemingly
                     paradoxical given that mobility and liberation have hitherto been closely
                     associated, is to be sought in challenging mobility as a prerequisite and
                     incontestable value. Is the project of liberation still compatible with an
                     unlimited extension of the exigency of mobility, contact and connection which .
                     . . can be a source of new forms of exploitation and new existential tensions?
                     — Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello (468)</quote>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Mobility for Thoreau offers respite from a capitalist economy that exploits
                  workers. For Boltanski and Chiapello, however, it represents capitalism's latest
                  and most advanced form of oppression. In the new spirit of capitalism, mobility is
                  key to a knowledge economy that idealizes workers who are flexible, creative, and
                  reprogrammable—workers who, following William Wordsworth, wander as clouds
                  through the Cloud. As Boltanski and Chiapello explore, mobility and flexibility
                  today are sources for new social anxieties. What once offered respite from
                  capitalism for Thoreau is now a source of anxiety for workers capable of imagining
                  a near future when they may no longer be mobile or flexible enough to compete for
                  jobs that provide adequate material resources. In an economy that values mobility
                  and flexibility, one is expendable when others are more mobile and flexible—code
                  in the new knowledge economy for a purely formal process of substitution or
                  interchangeability. This essay begins with two questions: how does the general
                  mobility and flexibility of late capitalism, increased—if not inaugurated—by cloud
                  computing, leave material traces? And (risking seeming a bit simple minded), given
                  Romantic poetry's preoccupation with clouds, how does Romantic poetry—specifically the poetry of William Wordsworth—help us to think the material
                  traces of cloud computing and the knowledge economy differently?</p>

                  <head>Romanticism and Materialism</head>
                  <p>To think about Romanticism—and in particular Romantic poetry—and materialism
                  today may still strike some as quite odd. Aren't poets the least materialist of
                  writers and Romantic poets the least materialist of the poets? This at least is
                  how Jerome McGann characterized Romantic poetry so powerfully in <title level="m">Romantic Ideology</title>, where he argued that Romantic poetry "is everywhere
                  marked by extreme forms of displacement and poetic conceptualization whereby the
                  actual human issues with which the poetry is concerned are resituated in a variety
                  of idealized localities" (1). What distinguishes Romantic poetry is the recurring
                  displacement of material life. </p>
                  <p>Many readers of Romantic poetry have worked against McGann's accusation for years, but recent publications by contemporary poets and specialists in contemporary
                  poetry and poetics continue to align Romanticism with idealism, showing that the
                  dominant narrative exerts great power. Marjorie Perloff's <title level="m">Uncreative Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century</title>, Kevin
                  Goldsmith's <title level="m">Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital
                     Age</title>, and Craig Dworkin and Kevin Goldsmith's <title level="m">Against
                     Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing</title> show how contemporary
                  writing has distanced itself from the tropes that preoccupied—or have been
                  understood to preoccupy—Romantic poets: genius, imagination, individuality,
                  creativity, emotion, and so on. Dreams of originality strongly associated with
                  Romantic discourse have themselves been transformed by technologies that enable new
                  writing practices. As Goldsmith writes: "writers are exploring ways of writing
                  that have been thought, traditionally, to be outside the scope of literary
                  practice: word programming, databasing, recycling, appropriation, intentional
                  plagiarism, identity ciphering, and intensive programming, to name but a few" (2).
                  Summarizing Perloff, he explains: "because of changes brought on by technology and
                  the Internet, our notion of genius—a romantic isolated figure—is outdated"
                  (1).</p>
                  <p>Technological change in recent years is largely responsible for an increase in
                  non-expressive, conceptual, and material poetics: a poetry, following Charles
                  Olson, that aims to get "rid of [the] lyrical interference of the individual as
                  ego" so strongly associated with Romanticism and embrace self-consciously
                  "unoriginal" practices common in the digital age (qtd. in Dworkin, <title level="a">Against Expression</title> xliii). In <title level="a">The Fate of
                     Echo,</title> Dworkin's introduction to <title level="m">Against
                     Expression</title>, he describes the original online collection from which
                     <title level="m">Against Expression</title> emerged, which <quote>happened to
                  gather a particular kind of writing to make a secondary argument: some of the
                  presumed hallmarks of poetry—the use of metaphor and imagery, a soigné edited
                  craft, the sincere emotional expression of especially sensitive individuals—might
                  be radically reconsidered, and poetry might be reclaimed as a venue for intellect
                  rather than sentiment. (xliii)</quote> In the original forward published online at
                  UbuWeb, Dworkin contrasts recent developments in contemporary poetry and poetics
                  with Romanticism, and with Wordsworth in particular. He writes: "what would a
                  non-expressive poetry look like? A poetry of intellect rather than emotion? One in
                  which the substitution at the heart of metaphor and image were replaced by the
                  direct presentation of language itself, with 'spontaneous overflow' supplanted by
                  meticulous procedure and exhaustively logical process?" (<title level="m">UbuWeb</title>). A metonym for Romanticism, "spontaneous overflow" stands for
                  a poetry skewed toward transparency and immateriality. Unlike an expressive poetry
                  that foregrounds the lyric ego and aims to transmit or communicate some expressive
                  content, non-expressive poetry renders words opaque and material, thus making
                  possible forms of "social, economic, and political critique" (Goldsmith 61). Dan
                  Graham's <title level="a">Schema</title> is one of Dworkin's examples of
                  non-expressive poetry, "where the self-regard of narcissistic confession [is]
                  rejected in favor of laying bare the potential for linguistic self-reflexiveness"
                     (<title level="m">Against Expression</title> xliii). Graham's poem consists
                  of publishing information about the appearance of the page upon which the "poem"
                  is printed. As Dworkin explains: "Graham submits a template—not unlike the portion
                  of XML source used to order and display the information pulled from various
                  databases—which the editor of the magazine was to calculate and complete,
                  providing information about the physical characteristics of the publication.
                  Rigorously and recursively self-referential, the completed piece parses itself,
                  collapsing form and content. The result focuses attention onto the most minute
                  particulars of the physical aspects of print" (289). The scheme, and so the text of the poem, includes the
                  weight of the paper sheet, the type of paper stock, the name of the typeface,
                  etc.; and of the pages selected, the number of words, the number of adjectives,
                  the percentage of area occupied by type. The poem attempts to turn attention to
                  the materiality of the printed object. It has no "content" but its material
                  context. Dworkin continues: "The radical implications of Graham's work follow from
                  that combination of an insistence on the cultural materiality of language and a
                  rejection of the romantic author <!-- KB: SHOULD THIS BE 'Romantic author'?? -->as a unified locus of interior authority" (290). In this way, the poem forces
                  readers to attend to a material context that more often is ignored by a tradition
                  of Romantic poetry, to return to McGann, that privileges an ideal or idealized
                  content over historical, material context. In several important ways, 2011 was a
                  very un-Romantic year. </p>
                  <p>Few readers would confuse Wordsworth's <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a
                     cloud</title> with Graham's <title level="a">Schema,</title> yet I wonder if
                  Romanticism need so forcefully be aligned with the immateriality of "narcissistic
                  confession," and so defined as complicit with and not critical of the social,
                  economic, and political status quo. I wonder, to put this differently, how easy it
                  is to gain access to "materiality." Unlike an expressive poetry structured by
                  figure (and the various forms of substitution figurative language foregrounds in a
                  poem like <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title>), a non-expressive
                  poetry would "replace" metaphor with what Dworkin describes as the "direct
                  presentation of language itself." The readily apparent difficulty of such a
                  presentation arises from the fact that the effort to "replace" "the substitution
                  at the heart of metaphor" already depends on the logic of substitution—or
                  replacement—that defines metaphor. To supplant "spontaneous overflow" with the
                  direct presentation of language itself is already to participate in the logic of
                  substitution that defines figurative or expressive poetry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Eric Lindstrom, who offers an interesting contrast with
                     Dworkin's use of "supplanted" in his description of how the spontaneous
                     overflow of emotion is supplanted by meticulous procedure in non-expressive
                     poetry and poetics.</note> The poet's effort to substitute for metaphor the
                  direct presentation of language depends upon metaphor.</p>
                  <p>An assertion that Romanticism is outdated may reproduce certain "Romantic"
                  structures and preoccupations. What distinguishes Romantic poems may be their
                  attempts to move away from Romanticism. Goldsmith, for example, begins <title level="m">Uncreative Writing</title> with something of a Wordsworthian problem:
                  "faced with an unprecedented amount of available text, the problem is not needing
                  to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that
                  exists" (1). Goldsmith develops "uncreative" writing practices to manage, parse,
                  and organize "this thicket of information," just as Wordsworth offers <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> to "manage" the rapid communication of
                  intelligence (Wordsworth, <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 294).
                  Famously, Wordsworth laments the craving for extraordinary incidents produced in
                  the minds of readers by the proliferation of information (newspapers, for instance)
                  and argues for poetry to play a role in offsetting the blunting of the mind that
                  results from this craving. In some significant ways, Goldsmith and Wordsworth
                  respond to the same problem. Similarly, Dworkin characterizes the shift from
                  expressive to non-expressive poetry and poetics using familiar Romantic tropes:
                  contemporary non-expressive poets choose Echo over Romanticism's—perhaps
                  specifically Wordsworth's—Narcissus, language over ego, materiality over
                  ideal-ity. Such an opposition is complicated, though, by the very poetry under
                  discussion. The opposition Dworkin sets up between Echo and Narcissus maps too
                  easily onto the opposition John Keats, for instance, sets up between William Shakespeare and John Milton. Shakespeare was always already something of a re-mixer and a model of
                  sorts for Keats, i.e. Romanticism, too. Like the poets Dworkin celebrates, Keats
                  distinguishes the poetical character from Wordsworth's "egotistical sublime." "A
                  poet," writes Keats in a letter to Richard Woodhouse from October of 1818, "is the
                  most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no Identity" (Keats
                  195). Dan Graham's <title level="a">Schema,</title> like Keats's poet, is
                  similarly empty of content of its own. Perhaps 2011 was a very romantic year for
                  contemporary poetics.</p>
                  <p>I started by suggesting that poets are the least material of writers, and Romantic
                  poets the least material of poets. This is true, of course, only if one defines
                  Romanticism in the terms employed by those who collapse Romanticism and idealism,
                  a drifting into mind of language merely as a vehicle to explore the self. But what
                  if the Romantic poet's turn inward is not a turn away from materiality, but a turn
                  toward the question: where is the material? When? Where or when is the encounter
                  with what cannot be known or understood about language, and how does this
                  encounter, this event, offer some form of registering materiality—however defined,
                  however removed from consciousness, for example? The rejection of Romanticism
                  common in contemporary poetics—a rejection that aligns Romanticism with idealism
                  and contemporary poetry with materialism—always risks transforming materialism
                  into an ideal idealism, as the auto-referentiality of text becomes
                  indistinguishable from Wordsworth's ego-ideal.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Contemporary poet Christian Bök provocatively suggests that
                     in the future poetry will be written by machines for other machines to read

                  one discovers it instead dispersed, a cloud; when one thinks one has finally rid

                  <head>New Materialisms</head>
                  <p>Recent advances in technology are helping us not only develop new writing
                  practices, but also rethink what we mean by matter, material, materiality, and so
                  call for what Diane Coole and Samantha Frost term "new materialisms." The more we
                  come to understand about atoms—but also genes, networks, etc.—the less comfortably
                  solid material becomes, for, as Coole and Frost write, "the microscopic atom
                  consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike,
                  three-dimensional wave of spinning electrons" (11). They continue: <quote>Even when vast
                  numbers of atoms are assembled in the kind of macrostructures we experience in the
                  'condensed matter' of the perceptible world, their subatomic behavior consists in
                  the constant emergence, attraction, repulsion, fluctuation, and shifting of nodes
                  of charge: which is to say that they demonstrate none of the comforting stability
                  or solidity we take for granted. (11)</quote> What formerly we thought "material" is now,
                  we discover, more dispersed, cloudlike than we might prefer. To be a good
                  materialist today, one cannot simply kick a stone and feel good about having
                  returned oneself to the hard stuff that matters most. We cannot, as Wordsworth
                  famously did when confronted by the immateriality of self and world, simply reach
                  for some tree branch or wall. As he explains in his discussion of <title level="a">Ode: Intimations of Immortality,</title> "I was often unable to think of
                  external things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as
                  something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature. Many times
                  while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this
                  abyss of idealism to the reality" (Wordsworth, <title level="m">Fenwick
                     Notes</title> 61). Wordsworth's fear when a boy was that he would fall into an
                  abyss of idealism, and so he grasped for wall or tree in an effort to encounter a
                  world that threatened to disappear—as the world became merely an extension of his
                  own immaterial self. The threat is oneself, one's own immateriality, and the chance
                  that there is or soon will be nothing but this immateriality. In later years, of
                  course, Wordsworth's fear is the reverse: that the world is too much with us, a
                  large stone on a small chest.</p>
                  <p> Bruno Latour begins <title level="m">Pandora's Hope</title> with a question from
                  a colleague that takes him by surprise. It's a question that seems to follow from
                  many of the social, cultural, and scientific discussions that have become more and
                  more common in the 20<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>and 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> centuries: "'I have a question for you,' he said, taking out of his
                  pocket a crumpled piece of paper on which he had scribbled a few key words. He
                  took a breath: 'Do you believe in reality?'" (1). In other words, the question
                  from Latour's colleague is—given the various concerns over reality as socially
                  constructed, as virtual—is it still possible to "believe" in reality? The
                  colleague is here the young Wordsworth and Latour simply the closest wall or tree.
                  What happened to the material world? In "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From
                  Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern," Latour expresses quite powerfully his
                  worry that "a certain form of critical spirit has sent us down the wrong path"
                  (231). He draws a parallel between PhD programs "still running to make sure that
                  good American kids are learning the hard way that facts are made up, that there is
                  no such thing as natural, unmediated, unbiased access to truth" and extremists who
                  "are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won
                  evidence" (227). What is the difference, he concludes, "between conspiracists and a
                  popularized, that is a teachable version of social critique?" (228). Latour's
                  colleague in <title level="m">Pandora's Hope</title> is forced to ask his question
                  in part because forms of social critique have successfully questioned the very
                  idea of matters of fact. The fact that the so-called linguistic or cultural turn
                  has made it possible to ask such a question is precisely what Coole and Frost
                  identify as a reason for the necessity of new materialisms: "the more textual
                  approaches associated with the so-called cultural turn are increasingly being
                  deemed inadequate for understanding contemporary society, particularly in light of
                  some of its most urgent challenges regarding environmental, demographic,
                  geopolitical, and economic change" (3). Textual approaches have left us with
                  nothing but the immaterial. Like Latour's colleague, we reach for something else,
                  something more, something more material—or at least we should be reaching. But the
                  act itself repeats Wordsworth's question. If Romanticism is nothing other than an
                  effort away from Romanticism, is idealism nothing other than the effort out of
                  idealism? If the effort out of Romanticism merely puts us back in Romanticism,
                  does the effort out of idealism merely put us back in idealism? </p>
                  <p>Latour, however, foregrounds a form of material textuality in his opening anecdote,
                  as his colleague takes from his pocket a scrap of paper upon which he has written
                  a few key words. Given the scene, the colleague's question appears possible at all
                  only because of and through his encounter with writing, and so Latour's opening
                  foregrounds technologies of inscription even as the colleague's question seems to
                  lament a linguistic turn that embraces theories of textuality that threaten—or are
                  perceived to threaten—reality. In his posthumously published book <title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>, Paul de Man argues that the encounter
                  with something one might call matter or materiality occurs not when textual
                  approaches are eschewed, but only "by way of an epistemological critique of tropes"
                  (132). What Coole and Frost refer to as "textual approaches"are deemed inadequate
                  in <title level="m">New Materialisms</title>because language does not offer access
                  to materiality; as if the world, reality, materiality (as Latour's colleague
                  worries) is destroyed as soon as we represent it with or through signs. At moments
                  like this, however, it can appear that a purely formal, fully tropological model
                  for language is the legacy of post-structuralism, deconstruction, and the linguist
                  and cultural turns; as if this model were not always part of what Paul de Man
                  calls aesthetic ideology and something the epistemological critique of tropes is
                  meant to oppose.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for
                     instance, Orrin N. C. Wang's reading in <title level="m">Romantic
                        Sobriety</title>, p. 92.</note> For de Man, literary attention to signs,
                  words, tropes, does not result in a rejection of materiality; it offers an attempt
                  to encounter, in whatever minimal way possible, materiality. Materiality is not
                  opposed to writing, even if it is "opposed to some extent to the notion of
                  cognition" (<title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title> 132). But this does not
                  negate Latour's larger point, that certain extremists today are perfectly willing
                  to use the very constructivist arguments utilized by the left for decades to make
                  revisionist historical and counter-factual claims. The question is how—when—does
                  the language of trope become something else; when does formalism become
                  formalization, a dislocation from within—however brief—of what de Man calls
                  aesthetic ideology? If critique for Latour has run out of steam, this may be
                  because critical reading is not attending enough today to its own tropes, even a
                  trope like steam so familiar—if in slightly revised form—to Romantic poets.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The aesthetic for de Man is a principle of articulation, and yet in the
                  contemporary university Vonnegut imagines, there no longer are any meetings, by
                  which I think he means to lampoon the great number of meetings scheduled in
                  universities in which very little gets done. But just as there are no meetings,
                  there is no articulation. Here, the principle of articulation is the absence of
                  articulation, which can seem a form of resistance to aesthetics, but is just as
                  likely the advanced form aesthetics has adopted in late capitalism. Vonnegut
                  lampoons the university that has become a fully closed system in which the
                  aberrantly referential effects of language are foreclosed from the start by the
                  very absence of articulation. He somewhat playfully—if also
                  accidentally—anticipates Bill Reading's argument in <title level="m">The University
                     in Ruins</title>, where Readings famously argues that the corporate
                  bureaucratization of the University leads to an emerging purely formal discourse
                  of excellence empty of content: "the contemporary University of Excellence should
                  now be understood as a bureaucratic system whose internal regulation is entirely
                  self-interested" (40). "What gets taught or researched matters less than the fact
                  that it be excellently taught or researched" (13). In the contemporary University,
                  as in late capitalism, content concerns are eclipsed as purely formal structures
                  of substitution and exchange become the only defining content. Without certain
                  attempts at articulation between form and content conditioned by the aesthetic,
                  there is no chance for the occurrence of materiality, which de Man defines as the
                  passage from one conception of language to another, from a language of trope to
                  a language of performance. The absence of articulation and something like absolute
                  connectivity, a purely formal system, are indistinguishable. "Everybody's in it

                  "Has Critique run out of Steam" and embraced at moments by contemporary poets, who
                  develop and celebrate a fully auto-referential poetics that draws attention to the
                  materiality of language itself. Though, as Goldsmith makes clear in <title level="m">Uncreative Writing</title>, there may be no way to remove expression
                  fully, as the choices made by poets more interested in uncreative than creative
                  writing mark a poetic subject even as he or she disappears; in other words, a
                  materialist poetics cannot rid itself of idealism, and an idealist poetics that
                  aspires to wander as a cloud (Wordsworth) may not be able to rid itself of
                  materialism.</p>
                  <p>When Coole and Frost write that "the microscopic atom consists of a positively
                  charged nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike, three-dimensional wave of spinning

                  take an interest in clouds. If this is true, then there may be no more materialist
                  a poet than Wordsworth, famous for beginning both of his long epic poems with
                  clouds and subjecting himself to ridicule for <title level="a">I wandered lonely
                     as a cloud.</title> Cloud computing makes possible new forms of mobility

                     a cloud</title> is still a far cry from "iCloud," as the simile in Wordsworth's
                  poem makes conspicuous the figurative potential of language. There is a meeting, a
                  chance occurrence—perhaps we might call it an event—here as Wordsworth's
                  preoccupation with clouds, once perhaps read as a sign of Wordsworth's idealism—his collapsing of subject and object, his embrace of the immaterial self as it
                  disperses, colonizing a world by making it lighter—gives way to parataxis: not "I
                  . . . as a cloud" but "iCloud." </p>

                  own idealist position—as Wordsworth frees the poetic ego burdened on the couch to

                  Friedrich Schiller and Heinrich von Kleist in <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, that
                  dance is a common figure within aesthetic ideology for a social and political
                  model in which all works in harmony, but a harmony designed to conceal the violence
                  that makes it possible. While Wordsworth's poem is often read "as a standard
                  expression of Romantic pantheism" (168), Simpson argues that Wordsworth's dancing
                  daffodils anticipate Karl Marx's dancing table, Marx's figure for the commodity in
                     <title level="m">Capital</title>. In becoming a commodity, the table "changes
                     into a thing which transcends sensuousness while remaining sensible."<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Simpson 156. For the full Marx
                     quote, see <title level="m">Capital</title> p. 163.</note> The table-as-commodity becomes ghostly, a "sensible-supersensible" thing (Simpson 156). In the
                  poem Wordsworth gives himself vaporous form, but in giving himself vaporous form he
                  both transcends the material world and stages the becoming-commodity of ghostly
                  things, even the becoming-commodity of ghostly things like poets and poems. </p>
                  <p> Capitalism and commodity form are built on the same power of exchange and so structured by the
                  figurative potential of language even as this structure is disguised. Similarly, a
                  post-industrial knowledge economy is built on a worker's ability to "wander"
                  "lonely" even as the very chance for wandering is foreclosed, as the cloud follows
                  one wherever one goes. The somewhat accidental articulation of Wordsworth's poem
                  and Apple's iCloud helps make visible the degree to which late capitalism
                  disguises its own figurative structure even as it becomes ubiquitous. As all
                  things become increasingly "exchangeable," the system becomes more purely formal;
                  the apparent absence of figurative language (iCloud as compared to "as a Cloud")
                  becomes an ideal as the rhetorical structures disappear from view. One can think about
                  this structure in slightly different terms: iCloud (and cloud computing more
                  generally) makes possible absolute connectivity, mobility, and flexibility while
                  disguising the basic material structures that make connection, mobility, and
                  flexibility possible. In a recent report written by Gary Cook and Jodie Van Horn
                  and published by Greenpeace on the energy use of data centers in the United States
                  and their carbon footprint, the "cloud" is described as IT's biggest innovation
                  and disruption in recent years. The authors explain: "Cloud computing is
                  converting our work, finances, health and relationships into invisible data,
                  centralized in out-of-the-way storage facilities or data centers. . . . In the US,
                  which hosts approximately 40% of the world's data center servers, it is estimated
                  that server farms consume close to 3% of the national power supply" (4). "Apple's
                  new $1bn US dollar 'iData Center' in North Carolina, necessary for iCloud, is
                  estimated to require as much as 100MW of power, equivalent to about 80,000 US
                  homes or 250,000 EU homes" (12). Making data invisible, in other words, requires a
                  lot of energy, made visible by the increased consumption of coal and nuclear energy
                  and the material effects of such consumption. While Apple has plans to build a
                  solar farm near their iData Center, the energy required to run server banks is
                  increasing in the United States by 12% a year.</p>
                  <p>Echoing Boltanski and Chiapello, Alan Liu in <title level="m">The Laws of Cool:
                     Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information</title> explores the subtly
                  destructive effects of a late capitalism that privileges a worker's ability to
                  wander with the help of a cloud that promotes new forms of creative knowledge
                  work. Mobility and flexibility are now a source, suggests Liu, for new anxieties
                  as "global competition legitimates restructuring, downsizing, outsourcing, and the
                  replacement of career workers with permatemps—the social law of a new nomadism"
                  (292). In a postindustrial sociality, "'lifelong learning' demands perpetual
                  reeducation at 'Internet speed,' but bodily, family, community, ethnic, gender,
                  and other duties of everyday life pose an incalculably great counter-demand that
                  makes it almost impossible, for instance, to study at night" (293-294). One must
                  remain always mobile, flexible, and connected else one will lose touch with the "cool"
                  and find oneself replaced, exchanged. Absolute mobility, which is pitched as
                  freedom to roam or surf, increases insecurity and insecurity is the oldest way to
                  keep one from thinking or criticizing. The cloud does all the thinking for
                  everybody.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title> is perhaps a poem about
                  removing oneself from the discomfort of the material world through the power of
                  imagination: "For oft, when on my couch I lie / In vacant or in pensive mood, /
                  They [the daffodils] flash upon that inward eye" (ll. 19-21). The couch is now
                  such a powerful figure for emotional disquiet on the one hand and general apathy
                  on the other. Instead of getting off the couch, one might argue, Wordsworth finds
                  a way to live there happily. If so, then Wordsworth's poem and the idealist
                  position it advances can easily be read as contributing to a work ethic that cloud
                  computing fully realizes. One no longer needs to leave the couch to work all of the
                  time. And for this reason, contemporary poetry's distrust of the lyric ego, legible
                  through its turn toward the materiality of the letter, offers some resistance to an
                  aesthetic ideology that displaces material life. </p>
                  <p>But what Wordsworth's presumed idealism—his collapsing of subject and
                  object—cannot have controlled is itself newly legible with the insistent presence
                  of "as," the conspicuous use of figure now removed from Apple's rewriting of the
                  poem's first line: "iCloud / That floats on high o'er hills and vales." The
                  process of articulation that names aesthetics has become the absence of
                  articulation as Wordsworth's conspicuous use of figure disappears. In this way
                  late capitalism sells us back Wordsworth's dream as the imagined disarticulation
                  of Wordsworth's dream. Whichever way one chooses, one cannot miss one's way. If
                  the aesthetics of late capitalism now includes the elimination of figure (figured
                  here by iCloud as compared to "I . . . as a cloud"), an elimination of figure
                  because there is nothing but figure—all parts are interchangeable—then
                  paradoxically, it is now Wordsworth's simile that stubbornly remains immobile.
                  Perhaps there's a chance for materialism even if it is indistinguishable from
                  idealism. Wordsworth, of course, never leaves the couch—at least not within the
                  world the lyric imagines—but what the insistence of "as" makes legible—and this
                  might be the simplest if also the most pun-ny way to put it by way of conclusion—Wordsworth is unwilling to work his "as" off. What we have not yet come to terms
                  with are the ways that the absolutely formal system of late capitalism—one that
                  advances absolute mobility and interchangeability—needs, somewhat paradoxically,
                  to eliminate the very figurative potential of language it seems structured by.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay considers the problem of materialism in literature from
                  the perspective of linguistic empiricism. It takes as a its point of departure
                  Paul de Man's treatment of linguistic materiality to argue that a specifically
                  literary description of agency ought to take into account the event of literature
                  as such. It then turns to Gilles Deleuze's formulation of immanence to offer a
                  reading of a key scene in Dicken's <title level="m">Our Mutual Friend</title> that
                  illustrates how literature stages its coming-alive.</p>

               <p>To judge by recent trends in literary criticism that fall under the general rubric of
               material culture studies—practices as varied as history-of-the-book, thing theory,
               and various types of quantitative methods in the humanities—the matter of what counts
               as materialism in literature is far from settled. These trends tend to read
               literature's materiality literally, considering matter, objects, and things as the
               physical remainders of a pragmatic phenomenalism whose ultimate horizon of inquiry is
               the referential context in which the literary operates, rather than the operations of
               the literary itself as a historical referent. Much methodological stock is put into
               the work of analogy, so that, by treating the literary object as just another object
               in a world of objects, literature's historical impact is determined by tracing the
               specific modes of production, distribution, and consumption that make literature a
               cultural commodity in the global marketplace. And even when the literary object is
               understood as a symbolic repository of material history, an object that contains
               other objects, it is its formidable mimetic powers that are made to account almost
               entirely for its cultural work. The historicity of literature, in this view, rests on
               its ability to influence, coerce, or otherwise discipline its readers, who are often
               portrayed as the always-already interpellated subjects of an ideology literature can
               do no more than re-inscribe as a narrative of subject construction. </p>
               <p>The materiality of literature, in any case, remains elusive: on the one hand, to
               study literature as an object is to bracket its defining characteristic as a literary
               work–the fact of its literariness; on the other, to limit the historical role of the
               novel to the effects it has on its readers is to subscribe uncritically to its
               referential function–the fact that it can only be read literally, as a medium to the
               material culture that is said to exist outside of, and in spite of, its qualities as
               literature. Accordingly, despite the claims they make about literature's historical
               impact, these accounts tend to occlude the materiality of that which makes literature
               matter: its language. This is a surprising occlusion, not least because there has
               been a longstanding awareness of the materiality of the literary that in many cases
               predates current critical trends within material culture studies and object-centered
               literary analyses that ostensibly seek to specify literature's historical role. </p>
               <p>I don't wish to suggest that we should rehabilitate the notion of linguistic
               materiality uncritically, but we ought nevertheless to recall its speculative force
               in the arguments we make about literature's material history, if only as a first step
               toward providing a more robust account of the specificities of literary practice as
               well as its institutional determinations. A very partial critical genealogy—from
               Roland Barthes's formulation of the "<foreign>le degré zéro de l'écriture</foreign>,"
               through Lacan's "agency of the letter," and Paul de Man's formulation of materialism
               as a "radical formalism," to more recent elaborations by Catherine Malabou of a
               material plasticity that would reject the literary as a quasi-metaphysical
               category—suggests, at any rate, that critical debates on the materiality of the
               literary are far from having been exhausted. The challenge is to find a new way of
               formulating literary empiricism that lends specificity to the literariness of the
               literary object while enhancing its claims to historical relevance. </p>
               <p>In what follows I address in a preliminary and provisional way two questions that
               move in this direction: 1) Can a meaningful distinction be made between linguistic
               and literary materiality? And, if so, 2) is there a conceptual advantage in
               construing this singular essence of the literary as a form of immanence? </p>
               <p>The most commonly cited model of linguistic materiality is the one formulated by Paul
               de Man in his reading of Immanuel Kant's third <title level="m">Critique</title>
               (1981, but not published until 1996). In the essay <title level="a">Kant's
                  Materialism,</title> de Man refers to the radical formalism of the language of
               poets, who, according to Kant, look at the world as one sees it ("<foreign>wie man
                  ihn sieht</foreign>"), as an absolute materialism of language that entertains no
               notion of reference or semiosis. To the extent that language at its limit does not
               act as a repository or conveyor of meaning, it can no longer be said to be the
               immaterial medium of communication that we assume to be operative when we speak of
               the inside of a text and of its outside referent. Yet, however distant from a
               materialist conception of culture or history this definition of materialism may seem
               at first glance, de Man insists that it is precisely the "a-referential,
               a-phenomenal, a-pathetic" nature of this materialism that allows Kant to gain access
               to the "moral world of practical reason, practical law, and rational politics"
               (128).</p>
               <p>In de Man's formulation, materialism is a non-phenomenalizable attribute of language
               that nevertheless has effects in the world that are empirically verifiable, insofar
               as they belong to a pragmatic order of discourse. This form of materialism is
               therefore historical in a strong sense, even if it does not strictly conform, in this
               telling, to what we would recognize as "historical materialism." When, in <title level="m">The Political Unconscious</title> (1981), Frederic Jameson makes a
               distinction between a mechanical form of materialism of the sort found in Lacan (the
               phallus as "material signifier") and the properly historical materialism elaborated
               by Karl Marx, he is trying to distinguish a conception of matter that corresponds to
               signifying systems, and thus to bourgeois ideology, from a notion of materialism
               determined by the mode of production. For Jameson, literary labor can at best be
               subsumed under the rubric of ideology critique; it cannot, at any rate, be
               assimilated to "real work on the assembly line and to the experience of the
               resistance of matter in genuine manual labor" (45). De Man's formulation of
               materialism is not dialectical in the way Jameson suggests a properly historical
               materialism ought to be, but it is nevertheless closer to this mechanical model of
               history than would at first glance appear to be the case. </p>
               <p>Indeed, even among Marxist critics who focus on the "mode of production," there is no
               consensus regarding the best method of approaching the materiality of literature. In
               a 1991 essay aptly, though perhaps optimistically, titled <title level="a">The Moment
                  of Materialism,</title> David Simpson notes: "[T]he very popularization of
               materialist methods, with their accumulating adjectival qualifiers—cultural
               materialism, historical materialism, and (let us not forget) dialectical
               materialism—brings with it another anxiety of definition" (6). For Simpson, this
               anxiety has to do less with matter as such than with history. To make this point, he
               goes on to quote Engels, who wrote in 1890: "In general, the word 'materialist'
               serves many of the younger writers of Germany as a mere phrase with which anything
               and everything is labelled without further study, that is, they stick on this label
               and then consider the question disposed of. But our conception of history is above
               all a guide to study, not a lever for construction after the Hegelian manner. All
               history must be studied afresh" (qtd. in Simpson 6). Leaving aside the question of
               whether or not literary criticism uses the term "materialism" as a "lever for
               construction," it does seem to be the case that, to judge from the process of
               redefinition to which it is periodically submitted, the history of the term, if not
               history itself, is certainly "studied afresh." </p>
               <p>Frances Ferguson makes a valuable distinction between what she calls "deconstructive
               materialism" and "social materialism" on the basis of the relation between language
               and the objects to which it refers. In the latter, objects are endowed with meaning
               to the extent that they can enter or be entered into a causal relation with
               individuals; the former, in contrast, emphasizes the "primacy of the material
               signifier in both embodying and interfering with any and all such casual accounts"
               (10). It follows that the view of language as a referential relay that transparently
               connects our perceptions of objects with the objects themselves comes under suspicion
               as the materiality of the letter becomes itself an object of knowledge whose very
               opacity seems to be derived from its apparent insubstantiality. </p>
               <p>In de Man, the materiality of language is what remains when the text is evacuated of
               its historical and humanistic determinations, and can therefore only be accessed in
               language by means of its allegorizations—even—or especially, when these are of a
               performative order. It is tempting in this context to equate the materiality of
               language with the institutional history of performative speech acts so as to be able
               to claim that literature is itself an act of speech that has real effects in the
               world. But this would be to confuse, as de Man once put it, "the materiality of the
               signifier with the materiality of what it signifies." Andrzej Warminski coins the
               term "super-performative" to designate not a performative that "functions
                  <emph>within</emph> an established juridico-political system, but rather one that
               itself is the inaugural act of positing that puts such a system into place in the
               first place" (26). When Derrida refers to what de Man, at the closural moment of his
               essay <title level="a">Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant,</title> calls the
               "prosaic materiality of the letter" as a materiality that is not a thing or a body
               but that yet "operates" and "forces," a "materiality without matter" (350), he is
               attempting to preserve the radical unreappropriability of this force of language to
               language itself. </p>
               <p> Formulated in these terms, the materiality of language seems to be an attribute of
               language that operates without recourse to any properly literary function. It is
               "prosaic" in that it would not even be determined by language itself. Yet, the
               "absolute, radical formalism" that marks for de Man, in his reading of Kant, the
               passage from reference to performativity should be read literally. It makes sense
               from this perspective to speak of a literary materialism as opposed to a linguistic
               materialism, provided we revise our commonsense notion of the literary as a
               referential medium that captures objects, things, matter. We must understand
               literature, in other words, as poets do; that is, as language itself. </p>
               <p>But how can we access the historical, empirical effects of language-as-literature?
               What form of historical agency does it constitute? Gilles Deleuze's conceptualization
               of immanence (or the plane of immanence) can help us stage an empirical thinking of
               the literary that might provide an alternative model for historical agency. In <title level="a">Immanence, A Life,</title> Deleuze maintains that the virtualities,
               events, and singularities that constitute life elude the transcendence of both
               subject and object. The transcendental is distinguished from the transcendent in that
               the empiricism of the transcendental plane is unencumbered from the appeals of Some
               Thing as a unity superior to all things, or of a Subject as an act that brings about
               a synthesis. Immanence is not immanent to anything other than itself. Can a
               description of literary immanence equally elude the insertion of subject and object
               as categories mediated by a consciousness that would reabsorb them as transcendents? </p>
               <p>Consider how Deleuze illustrates his notion of immanence: "No one," writes Deleuze,
               "has described what <emph>a</emph> life is better than Charles Dickens, if we take
               the indefinite article as an index of the transcendental" (28). Deleuze goes on to
               describe the passage from <title level="m">Our Mutual Friend</title> in which Rogue
               Riderhood, found nearly dead in the river, is revived before the expectant eyes of
               his neighbors, whose sympathy swiftly evaporates as soon as they realize Riderhood is
               once again restored as Riderhood. This is how Deleuze glosses it: "The life of the
               individual gives way to an impersonal yet singular life that releases a pure event
               freed from the accidents of internal and external life, that is, from the
               subjectivity and objectivity of what happens...a life of pure immanence, neutral,
               beyond good and evil, for it was only the subject that incarnated it in the midst of
               things that made it good or bad" (28-9).</p>
               <p>Deleuze does not quote Dicken's text directly, but something similar can be said
               about the way Dickens himself renders the moment of Riderhood's death and his curious
               resurrection. At first, Riderhood's inert body inspires a modicum of sympathy from
               those whom Riderhood, in life, has otherwise alienated. <quote>Doctor examines the
                  dank carcase, and pronounces, not hopefully, that it is worth while trying to
                  reanimate the same. All the best means are at once in action, and everybody
                  present lends a hand, and a heart and soul. No one has the least regard for the
                  man; with them all, he has been an object of avoidance, suspicion, and aversion;
                  but the spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now, and they
                  have a deep interest in it, probably because it IS life, and they are living and
                  must die. (Dickens 443)</quote> Notice in this passage the use of the present
               tense, a device common enough in Dickens when a sense of urgency gives narrative
               expediency to the event being described, but here explicitly bracketing Riderhood's
               reanimation as though the chapter as a whole in which it is effected had emerged—had
               come alive in the present or been restored—from an otherwise conventional narrative
               flow rendered in the preterite. The preterite tense, as Barthes notes in <title level="m">Le Degré zéro de l'écriture</title>, is one of the Signs of Literature,
               together with third-person narration, that gives the Novel the "formal guarantee of
               the real" (33). The preterite is a mythological object that appeals to the ideology
               of the real and, at the same time, points to the artificial nature of novelistic
               narration. Dickens's deliberate use of the present tense in this extended episode has
               the effect of making it an object of literary curiosity while momentarily deadening
               the rest of the narrative. </p>
               <p>Similarly, when the passage apostrophizes Riderhood directly, as though to call him
               back to life, the structure of address breaks with convention by creating a
               first-person plural subject position from which those attending to the "flabby lump
               of mortality," and possibly those "below," are all given voice. <quote>If you are not
                  gone for good, Mr. Riderhood, it would be something to know where you are hiding
                  at present. This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such
                  patient perseverance, yields no sign of you. If you are gone for good, Rogue, it
                  is very solemn, and if you are coming back, it is hardly less so. Nay, in the
                  suspense and mystery of the latter question, involving that of where you may be
                  now, there is a solemnity even added to that of death, making us who are in
                  attendance alike afraid to look on you and to look off you, and making those below
                  start at the least sound of a creaking plank in the floor. (444)</quote> The
               distance separating the more formal "Mr. Riderhood" and the familiar name "Rogue"
               with which most of the characters in the novel refer to him is also marked as a
               grammatical distinction between a form of address that would refer to him as though
               absent in the third person and a positing of the name that would make him a familiar
               presence. Moreover, the phrase "no sign of you" both signals Riderhood's precarious
               hold on life, and also, if read literally, the absence of the "you" being
               apostrophized, as though the sign "you" had no purchase in the scene of address
               staged between life-and-death. The effect is a radical suspension of reference that
               yields no "you"—or, for that matter, no "I"—that could become a subject of
               enunciation, whether plural or singular, and thereby suspends the action of the novel
               insofar as the subject pronoun carries the narrative. Indeed, it is the "he,"
               according to Barthes, that performs the service of both signifying the novelistic as
               artifice and naturalizing this artifice as the "real." </p>
               <p>Riderhood's precarious narrative existence is accompanied (indeed accomplished) by a
               process of formal de-realization that Dickens began in this episode by reversing and
               displacing conventional novelistic forms of utterance such as grammatical tense and
               narrative voice. This process is radicalized by a virtual suspension of novelistic
               discourse itself. <quote>Stay! Did that eyelid tremble? So the doctor, breathing low,
                  and closely watching, asks himself.</quote>
                  <quote>No. </quote>
                  <quote>Did that nostril twitch? </quote>
                  <quote>No. </quote>
                  <quote>This artificial respiration ceasing, do I feel any faint flutter under my hand
                  upon the chest? </quote>
                  <quote>No. </quote>
                  <quote>Over and over again No. No. But try over and over again, nevertheless. </quote>
                  <quote>See! A token of life! An indubitable token of life! The spark may smoulder and
                  go out, or it may glow and expand, but see! (444)</quote> The almost theatrical
               disposition of this paratactic passage (almost because the "No"s could hardly be
               staged) suggests the rejection or the abandonment of novelistic convention, as
               thought the convention that would portray Riderhood coincided with his ability to
               remain alive. To be sure, the iteration of "No" in this passage marks the
               interruption of narrative coherence and representational verisimilitude, but the loss
               of referential logic also makes visible a linguistic struggle whose stakes are
               nothing short of "life" itself. The use of the "No" seems at first to negate the
               force of the exclamation "Stay!" (a locution with no stated subject of enunciation)
               and of the doctor's questions, asked in silence, to himself, "breathing low." Yet,
               the insistence of the evidentiary "See!" and the ambiguously referential "a token of
               life!" (ambiguous because while "life" has no adequate referent in reality, the use
               of "token" in the phrase suggests that it is figuratively accessible) constitute a
               catachrestic positing of the materiality of language itself. The performative force
               of the utterance "No" may well deflate the attempt to reanimate Rogue through the
               mere act of naming, but a rhetorical counterweight is found to take the place of a
               nominal accounting of "Mr. Riderhood" in the figure of the "spark." </p>
               <p>The figure of the "spark" returns in another passage that marks Rogue's reinscription
               into the social coordinates of his past life, and thus into the novelistic
               elaboration of his identity. Indeed, the language of the passage hints at a return to
               conventional novelistic modality: <quote>The spark of life was deeply interesting
                  while it was in abeyance, but now that it has got established in Mr. Riderhood,
                  there appears to be a general desire that circumstances had admitted of its being
                  developed in anybody else, rather than that gentleman. (446-7)</quote> The radical
               formalism of the entire episode makes the rendering of a life a matter of great
               literary interest, as though the text itself were coming alive before our very eyes.
               The text's use of the "spark of life" to mark this passage suggests that, as a figure
               for life—for a life, as Deleuze reads it—the "spark of life" can also be read as a
               figure for what I have been calling literary immanence, a material existence that
               renders literature alive. This rendering-alive of literature might get us closer to a
               thinking of empiricism from which the historical, doubly empirical determinations so
               familiar to material culture studies could be used to think of agency as a material
               becoming of the literary.</p>

                  context of his later writings on aesthetic ideology and materiality. By
                  restoring de Man's essay on Walter Benjamin to its original context of the
                  1983 Messenger Lectures, it elicits from these later writings a concept of
                  translation that might be of particular relevance for a closer investigation
                  of the interplay between translation and aesthetic theory in the writings of

                  <p>Without doubt one of the most incisive critical inquiries into (post-)Romantic
                  notions of materiality to date was pursued in Paul de Man's later essays on
                  aesthetic ideology, and more particularly in the Messenger Lectures he delivered
                  at Cornell in 1983. In a parenthetical remark in his <title level="m">Mémoires:
                     for Paul de Man</title>, Jacques Derrida located in de Man's work an "original
                  materialism" that precedes "the metaphysical oppositions in which the concept of
                  matter and materialist theories are generally inscribed": <quote>([...] There is a
                     theme of "materiality," indeed an original materialism in de Man. It concerns a
                     "matter" which does not fit the classical philosophical definitions of
                     metaphysical materialisms any more than the sensible representations or the
                     images of matter defined by the opposition between the sensible and the
                     intelligible. Matter, a matter without presence and without substance, is what
                     resists these oppositions. [...] Matter of this sort, "older" than the
                     metaphysical oppositions in which the concept of matter and materialist
                     theories are generally inscribed, is, we might say, "in memory" of what
                     precedes these oppositions. But by this very fact [...] it retains an essential
                     relation with fiction, figurality, rhetoricity. <title level="m">Matière et
                        Mémoire</title> is the title I could have given to this long parenthesis
                     [...]). (52-53)</quote> Later in the <title level="m">Mémoires</title> Derrida
                  adds that "[o]ne cannot understand this privileging of allegory –I was long
                  puzzled by it for thus very reason—if one is not familiar with the internal
                  debates of Anglo-American criticism concerning Romanticism" (77). Driven by the
                  desire to locate a "sort of affirmative thought" (66) in de Man's relentless
                  rhetorical reading, Derrida parenthetically puts the notion of materiality at the
                  center of his reading of de Man's analysis of G.F.W. Hegel in <title level="a">Sign and Symbol in Hegel's <emph>Aesthetics</emph>
                     </title> (1982), and briefly
                  allows the Anglo-American Romantic critical tradition to enter his argument when
                  he turns to de Man's comments on Coleridge in <title level="a">The Rhetoric of
                     Temporality</title> (1969). In the questions that conclude his lecture, Derrida
                  marks "a kind of spacing, a gap that is not contradiction" (85) between both
                  essays and their respective analyses of allegory and irony. Without entering into
                  the complex questions of the relation between de Man's early and later writings
                  (and between de Man and Derrida, for that matter),<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an interesting commentary on the theoretical intricacies
                     involved in trying to impose a "historical" development from early to late de

                     (esp. the lengthy eighth footnote on p. 35-37), the concluding chapter of

                     </note> my purpose here is to pick up Derrida's suggestion and address this gap in
                  terms of the renegotiation of the relation between materiality, Romanticism, and
                  translation in the Messenger Lectures. As the structural unity of the argument
                  developed over the six lectures has suffered somewhat from their posthumous
                  dispersion over different volumes,<note place="foot" resp="editors">The six
                     Messenger Lectures were delivered in the spring of 1983, just months before de
                     Man's death in December of that year. The lectures were: <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in Baudelaire</title> (published as <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric</title> in <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, 239–62), <title level="a">Kleist's <emph>Über das Marionettentheater</emph>

                        Romanticism</title>, 263–90), <title level="a">Hegel on the Sublime</title>
                     (published in <title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>, 105–18), <title level="a">Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant</title> (published in <title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>, 70–90), <title level="a">Kant and

                        Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'</title> in <title level="m">The
                        Resistance to Theory</title>, 73–105). For commentaries on the lectures and
                     the notion of materiality on which they center, see the essays included in
                        <title level="m">Material Events</title> and <title level="m">

                     relation to his theory of rhetorical reading, see my <title level="a">Surfacing
                        Materiality.</title>
                     </note> this renegotiation has been insufficiently
                  explored in their critical reception. Symptomatic of this fragmented reception is
                  the systematic isolation of the famous concluding lecture on Walter Benjamin from
                  this broader argumentative context.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a useful
                     situation of the essay in the broader context of de Man's other writings, see
                     Martin McQuillan's <title level="m">Paul de Man</title>. Within the field of
                     translation studies, de Man mainly figures, with Derrida, as an example of
                     deconstructionist appropriation of Benjamin. As has been noted by Eve Tavor
                     Bennet and Kevin Attell, however, their respective readings do diverge on
                     decisive points. An interesting new development in the essay's reception was
                     the recent publication of <title level="m">Theory and the Disappearing Future:
                        On de Man, On Benjamin</title>, containing a transcript (and facsimile
                     print) of de Man's handwritten notes for the lecture, with critical
                     commentaries by Tom Cohen, Claire Colebrook and J. Hillis Miller.</note>
                  Restoring de Man's reading of Benjamin to its original context of the Messenger
                  Lectures, I argue, allows for a more accurate analysis of the proximity of his
                  critique of translation to the notion of materiality introduced in his reading of
                  Immanuel Kant's <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>, which constitutes
                  the central event of the lecture series. This closer analysis, moreover, refers de
                  Man's later writings back to the British Romantic tradition, more specifically to
                  the initial forging of an English critical idiom in the translation of German
                  Idealist philosophy by, among others, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle.
                  As an elaborate analysis of the latter by far exceeds the limitations of this
                  essay, my aim here is to prepare the ground for such a return to British Romantic
                  aesthetic theory through de Man by means of a close reading of the latter's
                  critique of translation. In a coda, I will briefly sketch the form that such a
                  re-entry into the rhetorical complexity of the <title level="m">Biographia
                     Literaria</title> and <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title> in terms of
                  materiality and translation can take.</p>
                  <p> Although, as Rodolphe Gasché has noted, translation already figures in <title level="m">Allegories of Reading</title> as referring both to the totalizing
                  drive of metaphor and its disarticulation in rhetorical reading,<note place="foot" resp="editors">In fact, Gasché's review of <title level="m">Allegories of
                        Reading</title> highlights the intricate proliferation of the issue of
                     translation as a process including de Man's own critical praxis into a dynamic
                     of translation, re-translation, and de-translation, characterizing de Man's
                     rhetorical readings as "retranslations" that are "de-translations, i.e.
                     operations by means of which the static and closed off instances of totality
                     are referred back to the 'original' mechanics of the text" (49). Although it is
                     certainly an essential part of further inquiry into the issue of translation in
                     de Man's writings, the inclusion of the latter in such an interminable process
                     of translation will only be indirectly addressed in this essay, since it would
                     complicate matters beyond the scope of my present argument. Another commentary
                     to take into account in this context is Cynthia Chase's <title level="a">Translating Romanticism.</title>
                     </note> it is in <title level="a">Conclusions: Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'</title> that de
                  Man most directly addresses the issue of translation as a concrete process that
                  allows him to reconfigure the terms of his rhetorical critique of Romantic
                  aesthetics. De Man's turn to translation in the essay in fact concludes an
                  elaborate argument developed over six lectures, the main theme of which was
                  announced in the opening lecture on <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in
                     the Lyric</title> as "the major crux of all critical philosophies and
                  'Romantic' literatures," i.e. "the continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment"
                  (239) or "the seamless articulation, by way of language, of sensory and aesthetic
                  experience with the intellectual assurance of affirmation" (244). From rhetorical
                  readings of Charles Baudelaire and Heinrich von Kleist, the lecture series
                  progresses to a discussion of the Hegelian sublime, to the disarticulation of the
                  category of the aesthetic in Kant and its humanistic recuperation recuperation in
                  Friedrich Schiller, so as to finally arrive at a reading of Benjamin's comments on
                  translation in his famous preface to his own translation of Baudelaire's <title level="a">Tableaux Parisiens.</title> Baudelaire is not the only element
                  endowing the Messenger Lectures with a certain circularity, as they are structured
                  as a series of disarticulations of received notions of the aesthetic, ideology,
                  history, and translation that center on the notion of materiality introduced
                  halfway through the lecture series in <title level="a">Phenomenality and
                     Materiality in Kant.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <title level="a">Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant,</title> de Man locates
                  "a deep, perhaps fatal, break or discontinuity" (79) at the center of the <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>. In the concluding section of the
                  analytics of the sublime, at the moment when one would have expected the emergence
                  of "a phenomenalized, empirically manifest principle" that would provide the
                  necessary causal link between "a purely conceptual and an empirically determined
                  discourse" (73) that would ultimately guarantee the architectonic unity of Kant's
                  transcendental philosophy, sublime vision ends up as "purely material" and "purely
                  formal, devoid of any semantic depth and reducible to the formal mathematization
                  or geometrization of pure optics." This formal materialism "runs counter to all
                  values and characteristics associated with aesthetic experience" (83) and, as de
                  Man discusses at length in the fifth lecture on <title level="a">Kant and
                     Schiller,</title> has been overlooked and reinscribed into an organic aesthetic
                  from Schiller onwards. To be sure, this reinscription is inevitable, and also
                  occurs in Kant's own critical philosophy: the purely material architectonic of
                  nature, de Man argues, is juxtaposed to the organic architectonics of Pure Reason
                  described near the end of the First Critique, in which the pure formality of
                  sublime vision is reinscribed into an organic tropology of body and limbs. The
                  confrontation of both versions of the architectonic occurs as one between the
                  organic metaphor of the unity of modes of cognition as a body of articulated limbs
                  that grows from the inside in, on the one hand, and the materiality of the sublime
                  vision of the ocean and the heavens, on the other. Ultimately, then, both nature
                  and the body end up disarticulated in the Third Critique, and instead of providing
                  the eventual establishment of the aesthetic as the category that would secure the
                  organic congruity between perception and cognition, it instead "marks the undoing
                  of the aesthetic as a valid category" and leaves us "with a materialism that
                  Kant's posterity has not yet begun to face up to" (89). </p>
                  <p>Crucially, this disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic also affects
                  language as such. Asking himself what the equivalent of this formal materialism
                  would be "in the order of language," de Man at the very end of his lecture spells
                  out the most radical consequence of his critique of the aesthetic, stating that
                  "[t]o the dismemberment of the body corresponds a dismemberment of language, as
                  meaning-producing tropes are replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and
                  propositions into discrete words, or the fragmentation of words into syllables or
                  finally letters" (89). The pure, nonteleological, and nonorganic formality of
                  nature is transferred to language itself, so that an irrecoverable
                     <emph>linguistic</emph> materiality emerges that resists inscription into an
                  organically conceived process of meaning production.<note place="foot" resp="editors">If, as Marc Redfield has argued, aesthetic ideology depends on
                     the production of transparency and the obliteration of linguistic mediation,
                     language resists this effacing gesture and persists "not as meaning, not as
                     semantic or intersubjective communication, but as an opacity, a stumbling, a
                     transport or drift or mutation irreducible to meaning or intention." In other
                     words, language "persists <emph>as language</emph>, as the technical supplement
                     that in itself can never properly exist" (23). As de Man states in <title level="a">The Resistance to Theory</title> (another late essay, which first
                     got rejected by MLA, was subsequently delivered at Amherst College in 1981, and
                     finally published in the volume with the same title), the analysis of this
                     resistance marks the beginning of literary theory as such: "Literary theory can
                     be said to come into being when the approach to literary texts is no longer
                     based on non-linguistic, that is to say historical and aesthetic,
                     considerations or, to put it somewhat less crudely, when the object of
                     discussion is no longer the meaning or the value but the modalities of
                     production and of reception of meaning and of value prior to their
                     establishment" (7).</note> From the dismemberment of language emerges "the
                  prosaic materiality of the letter and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can
                  transform this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment"
                  (90). That this linguistic materiality is to be taken in its most literal sense is
                  clear from the examples de Man provides: not only does he refer to the literary
                  example of Kleist's play with the word <foreign>Fall</foreign> (fall) and
                     <foreign>Falle</foreign> (trap), which he discussed at length in the second
                  Messenger Lecture on <title level="a">Aesthetic Formalization,</title> but he also
                  refers to Kant's own language, stating that <quote>[n]o such artful moments seem
                     to occur, at first sight, in Kant. But just try to translate one single
                     somewhat complex sentence of Kant, or just consider what the efforts of
                     entirely competent translators have produced, and you will soon notice how
                     decisively determining the play of the letter and of the syllable, the way of
                     saying (<foreign>Art des Sagens</foreign>) as opposed to what is being said
                        (<foreign>das Gesagte</foreign>)—to quote Walter Benjamin—is in this most
                     unconspicuous of stylists. (89)</quote> The example, concluding de Man's
                  lecture on Kant, already prefigures his lecture on Benjamin, not only in its
                  explicit reference, but also—and more importantly—in the observation that
                  translation foregrounds the linguistic materiality that results from the
                  dismemberment of language that took place in Kant's text. If, earlier in the
                  lecture, de Man had introduced the notion of materiality as "the only word that
                  comes to mind," and had added that "how this materiality is to be understood in
                  linguistic terms is not, as yet, clearly intelligible" (82), the final example of
                  his lecture anticipates his further exploration of this question in terms of
                  translation in his concluding lecture on Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>As de Man says at the beginning of the lecture, he will "repeat once more what I
                  have been saying since the beginning, using another text in order to have still
                  another version [...] of some of the questions with which we have been concerned
                  throughout these series" (73). This repetition is most clearly legible in the
                  lecture's argument as the gradual stripping of the Benjaminian concept of
                     <foreign>reine Sprache</foreign> from its "prophetic, religiously messianic"
                  (76) overtones and reading it instead as another version of the linguistic
                  materiality de Man had located in Kant. De Man's turn to Benjamin's text occurs as
                  a structural repetition of the concluding example of the lecture on Kant:
                  highlighting shifts and errors in Harry Zohn's and Maurice de Gandillac's French
                  translations of Benjamin's "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers," de Man foregrounds the
                  materiality of Benjamin's own language and its emergence in translation. By
                  subsequently repositioning translation towards poetry, philosophy, criticism, and
                  history, de Man establishes it as a practice particularly privileged to address
                  this linguistic materiality and its disarticulating effect. Unlike poetry, which
                  is aimed at conveying (extralinguistic) meaning, translation "is a relation from
                  language to language." Like philosophy—and more specifically like Kant's critical
                  epistemology—translation is critical of imitation. As Benjamin indicates, a proper
                  understanding of the relation between the original and its translation would imply
                  a critical reflection similar to the epistemological critique of "a theory of
                  simple imitation" (82). This comparison is crucial to de Man's argument, since it
                  draws a parallel between Kant's critical philosophy and Benjamin's concept of
                  translation, which will eventually end in the convergence of both in their
                  rigorous exploration of pure materiality. As is the case with criticism—Benjamin's
                  reference is to the German Romantics and to Friedrich Schlegel in particular—the
                  original when translated is "put in motion, de-canonized, questioned in a way
                  which undoes its claim to canonical authority" (83). Finally, like history,
                  translation should be understood as a non-organic, non-natural, non-dialectic
                  process. Just as we should not conceive of history as a natural process of growth
                  and movement, de Man's Benjamin says, translation should not be seen as an organic
                  process of imitation. Rather it is the other way around: instead of looking at the
                  translation as somehow growing out of the original, we should look at the original
                  from the perspective of the translation, as the latter makes us see the original
                  in a different way—allows for the emergence of an instability that was already
                  there. Translation lifts texts out of the safe haven of an organically and
                  dialectically developing history and redelivers them, as it were, as the
                  essentially linguistic, non-organic, non-human events that they always already
                  were. It is this deliverance that relates translation to linguistic materiality as
                  it emerged in Kant.</p>
                  <p>At the end of this series of comparisons, translation emerges as an exemplary
                  activity that allows for a reconceptualization of philosophy, theory, and history
                  as essentially "intralinguistic." If all three are also derived activities (from
                  perception, literature, and action, respectively), they relate "to what in the
                  original belongs to language, and not to meaning as an extralinguistic correlate
                  susceptible of paraphrase and imitation." It is in the subsequent elaboration of
                  the exemplary critical thrust of the process of translation (one that decisively
                  transcends "the empirical act of translating") that de Man most programmatically
                  defines it in terms of linguistic materiality. <emph>As</emph> translations,
                  philosophy, theory, and history <quote>reveal that their failure, which seems to
                     be due to the fact that they are secondary in relation to the original, reveals
                     [...] an essential disarticulation which was already there in the original.
                     They kill the original, by discovering that the original was already dead. They
                     read the original from the perspective of a pure language (<foreign>reine
                        Sprache</foreign>), a language that would be entirely freed of the illusion
                     of meaning – pure form if you want [...]. (84)</quote> In its progression from
                  poetry to philosophy, criticism, and history, de Man's concluding lecture ends up
                  providing another version of the disarticulation of the organic congruity between
                  language and meaning and the emergence of an irreducible linguistic materiality.
                  Translation is presented as the process <foreign>par excellence</foreign> that
                  allows this materiality to be addressed: "to the extent that it disarticulates the
                  original, to the extent that it is pure language and is only concerned with
                  language," translation gets drawn into "the bottomless depth, something
                  essentially destructive, which is in language itself" (84).</p>
                  <p>Like in his lecture on Kant, de Man subsequently concludes his argument by
                  providing a specifically <emph>linguistic</emph> account of the disarticulating
                  dynamics of translation, which derives from a threefold disjunction. In the first
                  place, language displays a disjunction between the hermeneutic and the poetic,
                  between "<foreign>das Gemeinte</foreign>" and the "<foreign>Art des
                     Meinens</foreign>"—meaning and the way in which a work means. Benjamin, de Man
                  argues, counters the Schillerian humanistic account of language, instead staging
                  language as non-organic and non-intentional. The second disjunction is between
                  grammar and meaning, foregrounding "the materiality of the letter" (89) as
                  potentially disruptive of meaning and making it uncontrollable, the material
                  disruption of what is assumed to be organic. The third and final disjunction,
                  between "the symbol and what is being symbolized" (89), highlights "the
                  unreliability of rhetoric as a system of tropes which would be productive of a
                  meaning" (91), foregrounding the way in which Benjamin's own tropology, contrary
                  to first impressions, in fact disarticulates its own symbolism (i.e. the symbol of
                  the amphora) so as to perform the disjunction it addresses through
                  translation.</p>
                  <p>De Man's comments on translation to some extent repeat well-known aspects of his
                  rhetorical critique of (post-)Romantic literature, yet they at the same time
                  provide this critique with additional theoretical and historical incisiveness. On
                  a theoretical level, de Man's earlier critique of metaphor is supplemented with a
                  critique of organic conceptions of meaning production and phenomenological models
                  of language, deriving from the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in
                  Kant. Precisely to the extent that this disarticulation affects language as
                  phenomenal embodiment of meaning, the linguistic materiality that results from it
                  can never be addressed <emph>in</emph> language without reinscribing it into the
                  organic tropological model of language that this materiality resists. The
                  materiality in question, in other words, has no substance, is without matter, and
                  can only be witnessed as an event. In terms of de Man's reading of Benjamin, pure
                  language is something that happens <emph>in translation</emph>, be it in
                  interlingual translation or in critical reading. In the "Conclusions" it is
                  translation and the movement it causes in the original that makes this event
                  happen, as it hovers around linguistic materiality and alienates language from the
                  human and the organic as such. <foreign>Reine Sprache</foreign>, which has come to
                  refer to linguistic materiality, has no substance, does not exist, except <emph>in
                     translation</emph>. <quote>This movement of the original is a wandering, an
                        <emph>errance</emph>, a kind of permanent exile if you wish, but it is not
                     really an exile, for there is no homeland [...]. Least of all is there
                     something like a <foreign>reine Sprache</foreign>, a pure language, which does
                     not exist except as a permanent disjunction which inhabits all languages as
                     such, including and especially the language one calls one's own. What is to be
                     one's own language is the most displaced, the most alienated of all.
                     (92)</quote> Translation allows linguistic materiality to be addressed as a
                  "necessarily nihilistic moment" (92) in a movement from irreversible
                  disarticulation to inevitable reinscription. This moment, this radical negativity
                  that translation allows to emerge, endows it with a specifically historical
                  agency.</p>
                  <p>In fact, the entire argument of the <title level="a">Conclusions</title> is doubly
                  framed by questions of history—first in the lecture itself, and secondly in the
                  larger context of the Messenger Lectures. In the lecture itself, de Man introduces
                  his reading of Benjamin by means of an evocation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and
                  Geoffrey Hartman as upholding a dialectical model of history in which the
                  negativity emerging from philosophy's rhetorical self-consciousness is ultimately
                  recuperated into "a new consciousness" (76) and "sacred revelation" (79),
                  respectively. De Man's reading of Benjamin subsequently relies heavily on this
                  evocation of a persistent historical naïvité, so as to stage Benjamin as a thinker
                  who leaves "no room for historical notions such as the notion of modernity" (93),
                  and instead radically reconceptualizes the historical through his critique of
                  translation. Translation, as the "errancy of language which never reaches the
                  mark," de Man argues, "is what Benjamin calls history," which "is not human,
                  because it pertains strictly to the order of language" (92). As such, the <title level="a">Conclusions</title> of the Messenger Lectures refer back to the
                  opening lecture on Baudelaire, which had already ended in the emergence of the
                  "materiality of actual history": <quote>Generic terms such as "lyric" [...] as
                     well as pseudo-historical period terms such as "romanticism" or "classicism"
                     are always terms of resistance and nostalgia, at the furthest remove from the
                     materiality of actual history. If mourning is called a "chambre d'éternel deuil
                     où vibrent vieux râles," then this pathos of terror states in fact the desired
                     consciousness of eternity and of temporal harmony as voice and song. True
                     "mourning" is less deluded. The most <emph>it</emph> can do is to allow for
                     non-comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac,
                     non-celebratory, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or, better,
                        <emph>historical</emph> modes of language power. (262)</quote> This
                  circularity of de Man's argument in the Messenger Lectures is symptomatic of its

                  linguistic materiality is never available as such, but can only be addressed in

                  and history and supplements it with a historical context that is of specific
                  relevance to British Romantic aesthetic theory. In <title level="a">The
                     Epistemology of Metaphor</title> (published in <title level="j">Critical
                     Inquiry</title> in 1978 and later included in <title level="m">Aesthetic
                     Ideology</title>), de Man locates in John Locke, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac,
                  and Kant a recurring failure to clearly demarcate rhetorical from other forms of
                  language, a failure resulting from "the asymmetry of the binary model that opposes
                  the figural to the proper meaning of figure" (48-49). The problem first occurs in
                  Locke's discussion of language in the <title level="m">Essay Concerning Human
                     Understanding</title>. In its movement from simple ideas to substances and
                  mixed modes, de Man argues, Locke's argument actually deploys "the entire spectrum
                  [...] of tropological totalization" and thus generates an "anamorphosis of tropes
                  which has to run its full course whenever one engages, however reluctantly or
                  tentatively, the question of language as figure."(42) Discussing "motion" as an
                  example of a simple idea, Locke demonstrates that as a simple idea it is
                  undefinable, and refers to the atomists' definition of motion as passage as an
                  instance of "translation" and not of definition. De Man comments: <quote>Locke's
                     own "passage" is bound to continue this perpetual motion that never moves
                     beyond tautology: motion is a passage and passage is a translation;
                     translation, once again, means motion, piles motion upon motion. It is no mere
                     play of words that "translate" is translated in German as
                        <foreign>übersetzen</foreign>, which itself translates the Greek
                        <foreign>meta phorein</foreign> or metaphor. Metaphor gives itself the
                     totality which it then claims to define, but it is in fact the tautology of its
                     own position. The discourse of simple ideas is figural discourse or translation
                     and, as such, creates the fallacious illusion of definition. (38)</quote> This
                  equation of translation with metaphor, already highlighted in Gasché's review of
                     <title level="m">Allegories of Reading</title>, returns in the <title level="a">Conclusions</title>: <quote>The translation is not the metaphor of the
                     original; nevertheless, the German word for translation,
                        <foreign>übersetzen</foreign>, means metaphor. <foreign>Übersetzen</foreign>
                     translates exactly the Greek <foreign>meta-phorein</foreign>, to mover over,
                        <foreign>übersetzen</foreign>, to put across. <foreign>Übersetzen</foreign>,
                     I should say, <emph>translates</emph> metaphor—which, asserts Benjamin, is not
                     at all the same. They are not metaphors, yet the word means metaphor. The
                     metaphor is not a metaphor, Benjamin is saying. [...] Amazingly paradoxical
                     statement, metaphor is not metaphor. (83)</quote> The example from Locke
                  contains clear indications as to how to understand this identity between
                  translation and figural language: translation designates a movement which presents
                  itself as one <emph>from</emph> extralinguistic meaning <emph>to</emph> language
                  or vice versa, while it is in fact the purely intralinguistic movement of the
                  trope as it turns towards but never reaches this extralinguistic meaning. This
                  troping-as-turning gives itself the illusion of meaning, yet it never reaches it
                  and tropes and turns back on nothing but itself—one crucial example of which is
                  the full course of the anamorphosis of tropes run in Locke's <title level="m">Essay</title>.</p>
                  <p>When de Man subsequently turns to Kant, the term translation again pops up—albeit
                  this time as a translation of a Kantian term by de Man himself as he discusses the
                  figure of hypotyposis. The latter refers to the sensory representation of
                  supra-sensory concepts of pure reason (ideas) by way of symbols. Commenting on the
                  necessarily metaphorical nature of philosophical language (de Man cites the
                  Kantian examples of "ground," "to depend," and "to follow from"), Kant states that
                  such metaphors are "a mere translation [<foreign>Übertragung</foreign>] from a
                  reflexion upon a represented object into an entirely different concept, to which
                     <emph>perhaps</emph> no representation could ever correspond" (47, de Man's
                  translation). De Man takes on the "perhaps" to mark a possible non-correspondence
                  between concepts and their metaphorical representation, so that the figure of
                  hypotyposis confronts Kant's philosophical rhetoric with the potential
                  uncontrollability of metaphors rather than reassures it of their conceptual power
                  and epistemological reliability. De Man's use of the word "translation" for
                     "<foreign>Übertragung</foreign>" subtly repeats his reading of Locke earlier in
                  the essay: while Kant's language would ideally translate supra-sensory ideas into
                  philosophical terminology, what actually happens is that it ends up in an
                  intralinguistic process of metaphorical substitution that never reaches beyond
                  itself, persistently referring itself to itself rather than representing
                  extralinguistic meaning. While this rhetorical condition by no means coincides
                  with the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in Kant, it already
                  anticipates de Man's reading of Kant five years later in the Messenger Lectures,
                  as it is symptomatic of the disarticulation of language as phenomenal
                  representation and its corresponding emergence as pure formality.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It is no coincidence, then, that the issue of
                     hypotyposis recurs in the Messenger Lectures. In the conclusion of <title level="a">Kant and Schiller,</title> for example, it appears as another
                     version of Kant's materialist resistance to Schiller's humanism, when de Man
                     addresses "the particular necessity which philosophy has, to take its
                     terminology not from purely intellectual concepts but from material, sensory
                     elements, which it then uses metaphorically and frequently forgets that it does
                     so. [...] [H]ypotyposis for Kant is certainly a problem for understanding
                     [...]; whereas here it is offered by Schiller as a solution [...]. The sensory
                     [...], unlike the hypotyposis in Kant, becomes a metaphor for reason." (154) In
                     the <title level="a">Conclusions,</title> de Man again refers to Kant's
                     hypotyposis and the way in which it "invites us to become aware of the use of
                     metaphors in our own philosophical discourse." (75) </note>

                     <title level="a">The Epistemology of Metaphor</title> thus supplements the
                  Messenger Lectures with a context that is of specific relevance for British
                  Romantic theory. It stands out in de Man's writings as one of the few instances in
                  which he actually discusses the British empiricist tradition, which in turn is of
                  crucial importance for the British Romantic translation of German Idealism by
                  authors such as Coleridge and Carlyle.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Another
                     instance, which is suggestive of the direction that my argument takes de Man's
                     notion of materiality, is the reference to Hume in <title level="a">The Return
                        to Philology</title> (published in <title level="m">The Resistance to
                        Theory</title>): <quote>In its origin and development, aesthetics has been
                        the province of philosophers of nature and of the self rather than of
                        philosophers of language. Neither has aesthetic theory succeeded in its
                        admirable ambition to unite cognition, desire and morality in one single
                        aesthetic judgment. Professor Bate "in an article on <title level="a">The
                           Crisis in English Studies</title>" asserts as a matter of course that it
                        suffices to 'turn to Kant' to lay to rest a linguistically motivated
                        scepticism like that of David Hume. [...] Whether a reading of <title level="m">The Critique of Judgment</title> ... would confirm this
                           assertion certainly stands in need of careful examination (25)</quote>
                     </note> In the essay, de Man suggests a far-reaching revision of the
                  traditional narrative of modernity in terms of a rhetorical condition that reaches
                  across philosophical traditions and affects our received notion of "Enlightenment"
                  as such. If there is validity to his readings of Locke and Kant, de Man claims,
                  then we might conclude that "our own literary modernity has reestablished contact
                  with a 'true' Enlightenment that remained hidden for us by a nineteenth-century
                  romantic and realist epistemology that asserted a reliable rhetoric of the subject
                  or of representation" (49). </p>
                  <p>From the Messenger Lectures thus emerges a notion of translation that, not unlike
                  what de Man in <title level="a">The Resistance to Theory</title> calls "the
                  linguistics of literariness," presents itself as a powerful tool in the
                  "unmasking" of aesthetic ideology by going "against a powerful philosophical
                  tradition of which aesthetics is a prominent part" (11). As such, this notion of
                  translation allows for a return to the "gap" suggested by Derrida between <title level="a">The Rhetoric of Temporality</title> and de Man's later writings.
                  Retrospectively, the Lectures make legible in the 1969 essay the emergence and
                  premature abandonment of the question of materiality. In his discussion of
                  Coleridge's theory of symbol in the broader contexts of European (pre-)Romanticism
                  and post-Romantic criticism, de Man focuses on the ambiguous valorization of
                  symbol over allegory in <title level="m">The Stateman's Manual</title>, and phrase
                  this ambiguity in terms of materiality: while Coleridge devalues allegory as
                  suffering from "a lack of substantiality," the symbol's "material substantiality
                  dissolves and becomes a mere reflection of a more original unity that does not
                  exist in the material world." Coleridge's conception of symbol as organic form
                  ultimately ends up in a "spiritualization of the symbol [that] has been carried so
                  far that the moment of material existence by which it was originally defined"
                  vanishes and is replaced by a notion of "translucence" (192), which turns it (with
                  allegory) to its transcendental source and away from the world of matter. In the
                  remainder of the essay, de Man then abandons this "materialist" line of
                  questioning, and instead recasts it in the subjectivist terminology of the
                  disjunction of the empirical and the linguistic self. In a later lecture, de Man
                  will criticize this approach, and provide an alternative through a rhetorical
                  reading of Johann Gottlieb Fichte that to a substantial degree announces the
                  argument of the Messenger Lectures.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A key moment
                     in this autocritical turn is the 1977 lecture on <title level="a">The Concept
                        of Irony</title> (included in <title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>),
                     in which de Man criticizes this analysis of the trope of irony in terms of "a
                     dialectic of the self as reflexive structure," implicitly referring to <title level="a">The Rhetoric of Temporality</title> when he states that "[i]t is
                     in this way, to the extent that I have written about the subject, that I have
                     dealt with it myself, so what I have to say today is in the nature of an
                        <foreign>autocritique</foreign>, since I want to put in question this
                     possibility." (169-170) The lecture's reading of Fichte to an important degree
                     anticipates both the argument of <title level="a">The Epistemology of
                        Metaphor</title> and the line of questioning of the Messenger Lectures when
                     he states that "[i]rony and history seem to be curiously linked to each other"
                     and that "[t]his would be the topic to which this would lead, but this can only
                     be tackled when the complexities of what we call performative rhetoric have
                     been more thoroughly mastered" (184).</note> After the latter has taken his
                  theoretical critique towards aesthetic ideology, materiality, and translation,
                  Coleridge ends up looming large as the "acknowledged 'father' of theory" (Trott
                  69) whose translation of German Idealist philosophy forged a critical idiom that
                  stands at the origin of post-Romantic Anglo-American criticism and that includes
                  de Man in its dynamic exchange with aesthetic ideology.</p>

                  <p>In the <title level="m">Biographia</title>'s philosophical chapters, the threat of
                  linguistic materiality is legible in the dynamic exchange between divine
                  ventriloquism and translation. In its most literal sense, of course, the <title level="m">Biographia</title> eclipses translation at the basis of its
                  philosophical argument by not acknowledging significant portions of this argument
                     <emph>as</emph> translations from Friedrich Schelling.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Next to the acknowledged translations, the <title level="a">Editors' Introduction</title> to the Bollingen edition indicates that a

                     </note> Yet
                  the <title level="m">Biographia</title>'s evasion of translation transcends the
                  strategic gestures of plagiarism, and should be read as an essential part of the
                  articulation of its transcendentalist argument and its persistent confrontation
                  with its own language as representative of transcendental ideas. Ideally,
                  Coleridge's language would participate in a process that it famously calls "divine
                  ventriloquism"—a process of organic revelation of divine truth across languages
                  based in a transcendental principle of unity that is immediate and in which ideas
                  and their representations coincide. While this process safely subsumes linguistic
                  mediation as a mere supplement to organic revelation, the matter of mediation
                  repeatedly forces itself on the <title level="m">Biographia</title> as it
                  translates Schelling’s Transcendental System. This re-emergence of language
                  already occurs at the moment of the introduction of the notion of "divine
                  ventriloquism" in chapter 9. Coleridge's claim that "I regard truth as a divine
                  ventriloquist: I care not from whose mouth the sounds are supposed to proceed, if
                  only the words are audible and intelligible" (164) ideally posits divine truth as
                  one speaking itself across languages under the unifying drive of organic
                  revelation. The addition of "if only the words are [...] intelligible," however,
                  immediately conditions this ideal and foregrounds linguistic mediation against
                  organic revelation. In fact, it is <emph>as</emph> a translation that the <title level="m">Biographia</title> is continually forced to confront the question as
                  to its comprehensibility, since the latter depends "rendering the system itself
                  intelligible to my countrymen" (163), an audience deeply afflicted by "that
                  compendious philosophy, which talking of mind but thinking of brick and mortar, or
                  other images equally abstracted from body, contrives a theory of spirit by
                  nicknaming matter" and reduces all things to "impressions, ideas, and sensations"
                  (235). The language of British "mechanical" philosophy represents the threat of a
                  purely material language, as when Coleridge indicates that "existence of an
                  infinite spirit, of an intelligent and holy will, must on this system be mere
                  articulated motions of the air" (120) and that "a God not visible [...] can exist
                  only in the sounds and letters that form his name and attributes" (121). To secure
                  his own philosophical rhetoric from this threat of a purely material language,
                  Coleridge subsequently appeals to "the ascertaining vision, the intuitive
                  knowledge" (239) that precedes linguistic materialization and translation. In
                  order to establish its own language as an instance of divine ventriloquism,
                  Coleridge's argument has to articulate the transcendental principle from which
                  this ventriloquism emerges. In the actual articulation of this principle, however,
                  it is translation that exposes the principle of organic unity as originating in an
                  imposition of difference rather than as an original principle of immediate
                  identity. As David Ferris's close reading of Coleridge's translation of Schelling
                  has compellingly demonstrated, Coleridge's translation adds to Schelling's system
                  a decisively religious dimension, and deviates the latter's argument in a much
                  more overtly organic direction. Perhaps the clearest example of this imposition of
                  difference occurs immediately before the discussion of the subjective and
                  objective ways of knowledge, when Coleridge rephrases the "postulate of
                  philosophy" as "the heaven-descended <hi rendition="#smcap">know thyself</hi>!"
                  (252). As Ferris argues, "[w]here Schelling exposes the principle systematically
                  and, in so doing, provides it with its own means of justification, Coleridge takes
                  it over as if it were a God-given truth" (57). The postulation of a divine origin
                  that ultimately grounds a total organic unity of opposites marks a strategic
                  recovery of linguistic transmission in Coleridge's translation. As Ferris states:
                     <quote>the point where Schelling's philosophy attains completion is the point
                     at which it gives authority to itself and so becomes self-grounded. The
                        <emph>promise</emph> of such a philosophical resolution is essentially what
                     Coleridge takes from Schelling and applies to the whole series of apparently
                     intractably divided terms and oppositions he is concerned with, namely,
                     subject/object, original/copy, author/text, truth/authority, critic/text and
                     philosophy/poetry. (60)</quote> Coleridge's translation of Schelling's
                  Transcendental System, in other words, effects a "disfiguration" (49) of its
                  systematic and self-grounding articulation. A further analysis of this
                  disfigurating impact of translation and its continuous reinscription in the
                  organic ideology of divine ventriloquism in the <title level="m">Biographia</title>, I would argue, could lead to a productive revaluation of
                  the relation between its anti-materialist philosophical argument and its
                  rhetorical performance as a continuous confrontation with—and evasion of—an
                  irreducible linguistic materiality that leads to the premature abortion of its
                  argument.</p>
                  <p>What is more, this dynamic between translation and materiality should be further
                  contextualized in British Romantic aesthetic theory and its continued impact on
                  the Anglo-American literary-critical tradition. A text certainly to be taken into
                  account in this respect is Carlyle's <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title>,
                  which, as I have extensively argue elsewhere,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                     my <title level="a">
                           <emph>Sartor Resartus</emph> and the Rhetoric of
                        Translation.</title> Apart from Carlyle, another key Romantic
                     author-translator to be taken into account in this context is Thomas De
                     Quincey, whose complex engagement with translation has as yet not received the
                     close critical attention it deserves. Notable exceptions are Eric Dayre’s
                     aforementioned study and Brecht de Groote’s recent dissertation on “‘A
                     Frightful Co-Existence’: Thomas De Quincey, Translation, and the Prospect of
                     Modernity.”</note> emerges as a highly experimental exploration of the process
                  of translation that ends in the disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic
                  it was intended to bring home to the British reader. What is often overlooked in
                  readings of <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title> is precisely the fact that it
                  does not coincide with the Teufelsdröckhian Clothes Philosophy it contains, but
                  presents a fictional account of its translation. Framing the articulation of a
                  transcendentalist aesthetic in such an account of its translation, <title level="m">Sartor</title> foregrounds the latter's rhetorical disarticulation
                     <emph>in</emph> translation. In this sense, <title level="m">Sartor
                     Resartus</title> presents the "end" of Romantic aesthetic theory in a final act
                  of sustained self-reflexive rhetorical scrutiny: in the progression from the
                     <title level="m">Biographia</title> to <title level="m">Sartor</title> a
                  foregrounding of the process of translation occurs, eventually ending up in the
                  disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic these works set out to
                  articulate.</p>
                  <p>From this brief excursion to Coleridge and Carlyle, a central question emerges
                  that de Man never turned to, but towards which his later essays on aesthetic
                  ideology certainly gesture, i.e. that of the British Romantic aesthetic theory as
                  essentially occurring in the mode of translation. Addressing this question would
                  entail a study of Romanticism in terms of the materiality emerging from the
                  disarticulation of the aesthetic in Kant, and would entail both a historical and
                  comparative reinterrogation of British Romanticism's position as mediating between
                  the philosophical traditions of empiricism and Idealism. In this sense, de Man can
                  and should be seen as "a thinker of affirmation"—or at least as a thinker putting
                  us before the task of reading and translating the theoretical discourse of and on
                  Romanticism, so as to confront it with the material event that ruptures aesthetic
                  ideology and destabilizes the critical terms we use to address it.</p>
