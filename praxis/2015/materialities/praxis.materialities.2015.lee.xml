         <p rend="noCount">This article examines Radcliffe's writing as a phenomenon of
                  continuous material surfaces and folds. Radcliffe's Gothic narratives can be seen
                  as assemblages that generate transpersonal affects and intensities. Their
                  conservatism can be seen in how they conceive of agency as a force that arrests or
                  works against the constant movement inherent in materiality.</p>

               <quote>A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between
                  things... coming and going rather than starting and finishing....
                 <ab rend="indent2"> —Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, <title level="m">A Thousand
                     Plateaus</title> (25)</ab></quote>
            </epigraph>
            <p> Gothic things can create embarrassment—for example, the gigantic helmet that crashes
               down from the sky at the beginning of Horace Walpole's <title level="m">The Castle of
                  Otranto</title> (1764), or the inevitable trapdoor that appears in the floor, the
               candle that goes out just when you know it will, or the door that seems to bolt or
               unbolt itself. As Jane Austen suggests when <title level="m">Northanger
               Abbey</title>'s heroine finds herself captivated by a mysterious lacquered cabinet,
               objects have a way of leading to the subject's mortification. But the problem is not
               simply one of animation, or the extension of human qualities to inanimate objects. A
               certain restless openness characterizes both human subjects and things. Gothic
               fiction can extinguish conceptual distinctions and narrative relations between
               subject and object in a radical manner. The contact is too intimate, too close, and
               too unmediated; the giant helmet and the puny body crushed under it form a grotesque
               material assemblage, as do Catherine Morland's "trembling hands [and] the hasp of the
               lock" (Austin 119). When Catherine examines and finally opens that cabinet in her
               room, furniture, heroine, and ambient environment meld into a fear-producing machine.
               Sounds within the body and those outside the room blend together, while motions ("the
               lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter") travel
               freely from environment to supposed inhabitant ("Catherine trembled from head to
               foot") and back again (124-5).</p>
            <p> The Gothic novel, that staple of Romantic publishing and reading, has always seemed
               both thing-like and person-like: thing-like in its obvious, clunky reliance on
               formula and cliché, and yet person-like in the way that its superficial character
               appears to indicate the existence of something deeper, or even unconscious. "The
               superficial and the formulaic," as Elizabeth Napier puts it, "form the very heart of
               the Gothic" (29). Marshall Brown has shown how Gothic fiction's clichés perform the
               function of Freud's dream-work, communicating incommunicable desires. <note
                  place="foot" resp="editors">See Brown 161-182, as well as Duncan 20-50. </note>
               But I want to step back from this assumed paradox and ask whether this genre,
               particularly in Radcliffe's handling, assumes anything distinctive about human
               consciousness: anything that distinguishes it ontologically from the hollow caves and
               passages, mountains and watchtowers, clouds, sounds, and effects of light and weather
               that fill its pages. Or even more radically: is there anything but movement on the
               surface? Does the phenomenon of interiority matter? Are subjects defined by their
               interiority or by intensities that freely wander across forms and surfaces, coming
               and going? Do affects have anything other than a temporary location? Does narrative
               have an inherent direction?</p>
            <p> To ask this is to put into question some basic assumptions of reading: that subjects
               are the subject, that landscape constitutes a background, that the novel is an
               exercise in representation analogous to consciousness, or, more recently, that the
               novel is an exercise in social will or construction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                  >See, for example, Armstrong.</note> This essay engages a different set of
               assumptions and pursues a different, materialist protocol of reading. It will examine
               Ann Radcliffe's <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> (1794) as a phenomenon
               of continuous material surfaces and folds, rather than as a reflection of
               consciousness or a purposive ideological construction. It will look at how different
               elements of the novel move, rest, and collect into varied, manifold assemblages that
               express a single intensive materiality. The Radcliffean novel will be viewed as "a
               project of composition and synergy," to borrow a phrase from a recent interpreter of
               Benedictus de Spinoza (Sharp 13). Humans and non-humans, affects and things are
               brought into contact and combination in ways that defy conventional models of agency,
               causality, or narrative teleology. In other words, Radcliffe's Gothic represents a
               certain materialist vision of the world, but it does more than this. It accretes and
               flexes its own materiality as a supple discursive thing, extended in time as well as
               in space.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On perdurance theory, or the idea that you
                  have different temporal parts as well as different spatial parts, see Hawley
                  10-11.</note>

            <p> What emerges in Radcliffe's novels can be described as a vibrant materiality, to
               borrow a phrase from political theorist Jane Bennett. According to Bennett, what
               so-called new materialists study is "not a world... of subjects and objects, but of
               various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations... a world
               populated less by individuals than by groups or compositions that shift over time"
               (354). They reject the Cartesian view of matter as "extended, uniform, and inert...
               solid, bounded objects that occupy space and whose movements... are predictable,
               controllable, and replicable" (Coole and Frost 7-8). Drawing on post-Newtonian
               science, they emphasize "matter's immanent vitality," the way that matter
               materializes as "excess, force... relationality" (8). Such approaches may seem
               incongruous in this context, a latter-day attempt to revive interest in Radcliffe by
               associating her with strange new worlds of theory. So it is surprising to discover,
               not only within Radcliffe's novels, but in the contemporary context of their
               production and reception, a similar way of thinking about materialism along these
               lines of impersonal transformations and transpersonal assemblages. The explanation
               may have to do more with Spinoza than with Deleuze: as Marjorie Levinson has recently
               shown in relation to William Wordsworth and Spinoza, questions of "social ontology,"
               or of "being numerous" may well be as vital to the project of Romanticism as the
               Hegelian questions of representation and self-consciousness that have long dominated
               critical discourse (643).</p>
            <p> The tendentious distinction between the natural and the social that Bruno Latour
               calls the constitution of modernity was a preoccupation of the popular fiction of the
               time as well as of the poetry. The natural world of things, "the mute and material
               multitude of objects," is understood to stand over and apart from the clamorous
               social world of human subjects, each world following its own laws and asserting its
               autonomy from the other (29). Yet everywhere, as Latour argues, person-thing and
               fact-interpretation hybrids proliferated, as it became modernity's distinctive
               self-given task to try to sort them out, to restore the autonomy of human subjects
               from the world of things. But their mutual imbrication has always been known. Readers
               and critics of Gothic novels reserved their gravest concern not for what these novels
               represented, but for what they seemed to do to the humans who consumed them.<note
                  place="foot" resp="editors">See Watt 8. </note> They worried about the
               physiological effects of repeated encounters with these types of objects, about the
               loss of distinction and identity perceptible everywhere. Books, authors, and readers
               switched places and blended identities within what might be called a
               social-physical-narrative network. Critics deplored the tendency for boundaries
               between subjects and things to dissolve, for powers to be communicated, and for
               unpredictable affects to be generated. John Keats, for example, in his well-known
               tribute to the romances of "Damosel Radcliffe," genially threatens to "cavern you and
               grotto you and... wood you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous sound you and
               solitude you," offering a remarkable instance of what Deleuze and Guattari would call
               the deterritorialization of language. Signifiers, signifieds, referents, and speaking
               subjects become nearly indistinguishable: woods, rocks, solitude, and you become
               sounds, events of playful aggression.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Keats to J.H.

            </p>
            <p> Radcliffe's novels present a materiality composed of shifting, heterogeneous
               assemblages. They are striated by rhythms of movement and rest that include
               environment, characters, and discourse. But there is another twist to this story.
               Radcliffe's plots are to an unusual extent comprised of nothing but movement and
               stasis, in dialectical relation to each other. This characteristic draws attention to
               the nature of narrative itself as an uninterrupted material flow of discourse; as a
               result, I want to suggest, the concept of <emph>conatus</emph> undergoes a subtle
               shift. In Spinoza's thought, <emph>conatus</emph> refers to a "striving to persevere
               in existence," an intrinsic force by which each thing tries to maintain itself (Sharp
               125, 133-34). It is "a force of existence unique to each thing... a power of
               self-organization, self-maintenance" (133). Each entity tries to remain itself as far
               as possible. Radcliffe greatly relies on, but also greatly downgrades, this force as
               something within matter: things strive to persist but dissolve, materiality changes
               shape and form without pause. She thus creates a tentatively reflexive function in
               her narratives, a function that could be seen as a kind of melancholic agency. This
               function consists in explicitly recognizing sameness, persistence, or repetition. </p>
            <p> While the notoriously repetitive quality of Radcliffe's novels has often been
               remarked, what has gone less examined is the degree to which they pose the question
               of identity over time. Sometimes it is actually a question. In <title level="m">The
                  Italian</title> (1797): is this monk the same as the monk I saw before? At other
               times, it is an occasion for a certain affect: "'There!' she would exclaim, 'there
               are the very cliffs, there the wood of pines.... There, too, under the crag of that
               mountain, is the cottage... which he bade me remember, and copy with my pencil...!'"
                  (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 92). Remembering and copying, which are
               equivalent, enable a subject to do one thing: to point out persistence, identity over
               time. In Radcliffe's novels, subjects seem to be composed, like everything else, as
               ratios of rest and motion, speed and slowness. They blend indifferently or dissolve
               ecstatically into larger assemblages. But Radcliffe strikingly invokes a special
               function of recognizing sameness and a particular form of pathos. Persistence over
               time is linked to an overarching affect of loss and absence. In other words,
               everything strives—and mostly fails—to persist in its own form, but only certain
               super-agents seem capable of keeping track, of perceiving vacancy and negativity, and
               of retaining consciously the traces of former combinations. There are two more points
               to make about this exiguous form of agency. First, it describes what Radcliffe's
               narrative itself does: the material flow of discourse continuously shifts and evolves
               into varying assemblages, repeats itself, but it also keeps track. Second, the
               affective charge given to persistence can be seen as making a deep, almost
               subliminal, case for a generically conservative stance. Material persistence can even
               be regarded as an achievement productive of the most powerful affects; it is not
               something to be taken lightly. </p>
            <p> In these novels so often thematized as novels about confinement, imprisoning
               structures have an inexplicable habit of opening themselves. In <title level="m">The
                  Italian</title>, characters find themselves trapped in a subterranean vault: "the
               door closed, with a thundering clap that echoed through all the vaults." It appears
               impenetrable. "The thick wood was inlaid with solid bars of iron; and was of such
               unconquerable strength, that it evidently guarded what had been designed for a
               prison" (76). Yet typically, this boundary dematerializes when, one chapter and a few
               hours later, they discover that the door "stood a little open": "He could scarcely
               believe his senses, since... he had not heard its ponderous bolts undrawn..." The
               hero, Vivaldi, darts out, "breathless with speed" (99). Confinement in <title
                  level="m">Udolpho</title> also leads to mysterious releases and then into prolonged states
               of wandering for no reason. Those heavy doors or walls rarely, if ever, exert a
               blocking or containing function, as we are reminded by countless crumbling castles—
               "shattered battlements and half-demolished walls" that have simply "from age and
               neglect, fallen to decay" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 606). The boundaries may
               be hollowed out. Doors in the castles of Udolpho and Le Blanc frequently lead into a
               passage "formed within the thickness of the walls..." Emily is informed "that there
               are many passages of the same kind concealed within the prodigious walls of the
               edifice" (458). A supposed prisoner, Dupont, wanders around Udolpho, passing through
               these hollow walls, even hearing and speaking through them: "the shell of the wall
               was there so thin... that I could distinctly hear every word, spoken on the other
               side" (459). And as everyone knows, he takes the opportunity to become himself a
               disembodied, inhuman echo: "I listened closely to Montoni... joined my voice, and
               repeated his last words" (460), provoking much consternation. Such passages do not
               lead anywhere; they pass by and connect, joining places, voices, and affective
               possibilities. </p>
            <p> But more than architectural boundaries seem to be porous. Objects frequently
               dissolve, losing their shapes, identities, and even substance. Emily goes in search
               of her aunt, and perceives "a track of blood, upon a stair." She follows it to a
               door, enters and sees "something lying in an obscure corner of the room." In a
               strange discursive skip in being, Emily "hurried towards the object that excited her
               terror, when, perceiving the clothes of some person on the floor, she caught hold of
               them, and found in her grasp the old uniform of a soldier, beneath which appeared a
               heap of pikes and other arms" (323). Emily's movement toward the object is
               interrupted when the object becomes something else mid-sentence, a "heap" of
               blood-stained clothes that itself merely conceals discarded weapons. That collection
               gives way narratively to another "track of blood... upon the stairs," which prompts
               further inconclusive movements by Emily, down and up, forward and back. <title
                  level="m">The Italian</title> offers a similar moment in which "an object" becomes
               without warning a moving heap of "remains," only to resolve later in the chapter into
               "part of the habiliment of a monk" (76-78). These could be read as moments of
               successive discovery, but they can also be read as curious moments of shape-shifting
               or even thing-shifting. Rather than existing as solid, bounded things, Radcliffe's
               objects are restless. They can become movements or itineraries in the discourse:
               "Dorothée was telling of a door, that opened from a gallery, leading from the great
               stair-case into the last anti-room of the saloon" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title>
               560). </p>
            <p> The boundaries of subjects are even less able to be defined; the majority of
               characters subsist only as an echo of another.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                  >Dupont's existence for much of the middle section of the novel is as a faint
                  voice heard from beneath Emily's window, eventually identified as singing a
                  familiar song (439-440); when finally revealed, he is simply an echo of an earlier
                  lover, Valancourt, repeating Valancourt's emotions as well as his songs.</note>
               Humans and animals alike seem to exist as "open, complex systems with porous
               boundaries"—systems that also replicate themselves (Coole and Frost 15). Characters
               are often indistinguishable, not only because they resemble each other (though they
               often do: in Terry Castle's witty formulation, "Every other looks like every other
               other," and we could add that every self looks the same as well), but because
               perceptions and affects travel freely across and between them (128).<note
                  place="foot" resp="editors"> Castle's reading proceeds from many of the same
                  observations about the novel as mine, but moves to a diametrically opposed
                  conclusion, asserting a fundamental diremption between subjective fantasm and
                  objective reality that she links to a "denial of corporeality" as a historically
                  determined attitude (137).</note> In Chapter Five of the fourth volume, it soothes
               Emily's "pensive mind" to take long walks in the woods in the evening, "watching, in
               tranquil melancholy, the gradual effect of evening over the extensive prospect, till
               the gray waters of the Mediterranean and the massy woods were almost the only
               features of the scene, that remained visible" (540). Some fifty pages later, we
               encounter the same set of emotions and perceptions moving across another set of
               characters in motion. Blanche, her father, and her lover St. Foix are travelling
               through the Pyrenees, but any other class-appropriate characters could be substituted
               here. Blanche, Emily's inexplicable double, is the first in this scene to be assigned
               "a pensive pleasure, as she watched the progress of twilight gradually spreading its
               tints over the woods and mountains, and stealing from the eye every minuter feature
               of the scene, till the grand outlines of nature alone remained" (598). The affect is
               next embodied in the lines of a poem in which the absent Emily had already created a
               trope for this love of liminality ("To the Bat"). The poem addresses its subject:
               "Thou lov'st to sport upon the twilight air, Mocking the eye, that would thy course
               pursue... Thou flit'st athwart the pensive wand'rer's way..." (598). The affect of
               pleasure seems to be itself a flickering materiality that crosses and recrosses the
               path of the now-generalized "pensive wanderer." The biological substrate of "the
               young St. Foix" is next in line as the temporary location of this affect. In this
               scene and throughout the novel, affects are strangely impersonal or transpersonal
               types of matter that float through various contingent locations. It would be an
               understatement to say that character is underdetermined; their names barely serve to
               register the frailest shade of distinction between them.</p>
            <p> Radcliffe's materiality seems to consist in intensities rather than in solid,
               bounded extension. Thus, the distinction between inside and outside becomes
               irrelevant. Instead of measuring dimensions or referring to objects, Radcliffe's
               narrative typically tracks continuous gradations of intensity: heat and light, speed
               and slowness, relative concentrations of color. A representative passage in <title
                  level="m">Udolpho</title> notes "[t]he solitary grandeur of the objects that
               immediately surrounded her, the mountain-region towering above, the deep precipices
               that fell beneath, the waving blackness of the forests..." before ending with "the
               wide horizon, where the same melting blue tint seemed to unite earth and sky" (166).
               How can plural objects be solitary? How can Emily be "immediately surrounded" by
               regions "towering above" and "[falling] beneath"? What is a "waving blackness"? The
               scene is constituted not by things but by qualitative intensities or vague essences:
               aroundness, aboveness, beneathness, blackness. In order to track fluctuations of
               intensity rather than the fixed locations of objects, the narrative creates what
               Deleuze and Guattari refer to as smooth or nomadic space: "an open space through
               which things-flows are distributed, rather than... a closed space for linear and
               solid things" (361). In this mode, there is "no line separating earth and sky"; it is
               "a tactile space, or rather 'haptic,' a sonorous much more than a visual space"
               (382). As in the passages above, the erasure of the horizon seems to repeat, and to
               initiate a broader openness to which flickering or "vortical" movements draw
               attention. Smooth space is not uniform, but rather open to "becoming and
               heterogeneity, as opposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical, the constant"
               (361). This is the space within which local variations occur, to which the names of
               characters are sometimes given and sometimes denied. "To a warm imagination, the
               dubious forms that float, half veiled in darkness, afford a higher delight, than the
               most distinct scenery that the sun can shew" (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 598).
               The "warm" imagination is an intensity that merges imperceptibly and almost
               haptically with others, unlike the eye, too prone to perceive the dimensions of
               objects over against itself. </p>
            <p> The scene inaugurated by that statement is constituted as fluctuating or flowing
               intensities of energy. Standing a little apart from the rest of the group, which has
               taken shelter from a storm in a shallow cave, St. Foix views: <quote>with emotions of
                  awful sublimity, the long volumes of sulphureous clouds, that floated along the
                  upper and middle regions of the air; and the lightnings that flashed from them,
                  sometimes silently, and at others, followed by sullen peals of thunder, which the
                  mountains feebly prolonged, while the whole horizon, and the abyss, on which he
                  stood, were discovered in the momentary light. Upon the succeeding darkness, the
                  fire, which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam... on the
                  surrounding figures it threw a strong, though pale gleam... while upon the foliage
                  of a gigantic larch, that impended its shade over the cliff above, appeared a red,
                  dusky tint, deepening almost imperceptibly into the blackness of night. (601)
               </quote> What this impersonal focalization offers are "regions" localized by varying
               intensities of energy—contained in the clouds, discharged as lightning (of different
               intensities), contained and released by the fire, and dissipating as light in a
               continuum of energy. The material world represented is constituted by the differences
               and continuities between the "partial gleam" and the "strong gleam," the "dusky tint"
               and the "blackness of night," and the continuities are not merely at the level of the
               signified, but at the acoustic and visual level of discourse as well. Even things
               more solid than light are thus constituted as "forces, energies, and intensities...
               and complex, even random processes" (Coole and Frost 13). Human subjects, too, are
               complex processes that intersect or join their environment; in any given landscape
               Valancourt (or Dupont) may be "standing upon the bank of the road, resting on his
               pike with folded arms" (37), while Emily (or Blanche) "wanders away" nomadically to
               merge into this spectrum of intensity, "listening in deep silence" (37).</p>
            <p> I have, of course, been discussing what Radcliffe's novels represent, the sort of
               materiality that they seem to show or imagine for us. But the peculiar power of these
               novels lies in the way that they often seem to bypass this power of representing.
               They distribute discursive material through a smooth or nomadic space, at times
               intensifying its energy through concentration and at other times dissipating it.
               Another way to put this is that Radcliffe constructs discursive assemblages that
               produce powerful affects more through spatial contiguity and density than through
               syntactical relations. Representation requires elements to be put together in a
               certain way in order to produce a picture, whether you think of Kant's transcendental
               unity of apperception or of the rules of language. I would argue that Radcliffe's
               famed descriptive effects gesture toward a different use of discourse, one in which
               elements are linked neither hypotactically nor paratactically, but in a flexible
               linguistic assemblage or network that can be compressed or stretched out, usually
               over many pages. A typical assemblage from <title level="m">Udolpho</title> might
               comprise the following: a cave—the sound of a dog barking—a rude bridge—an opposite
               cliff—a light—voices—"a single watch-tower"—a story—"a cloudy moon" (601-605). The
               representational or referential dimension of this assemblage cannot be entirely
               dismissed, but that dimension is tenuous, untotalizable in its shifting from visual
               to haptic to acoustic references. Its affective power seems to derive from the ways
               in which these signifiers do not add up to a single, fixed composition or mental
               image. </p>
            <p> Assemblages bring or join things together in a way that is inherently dynamic or
               non-totalizable. Radcliffe's narrative discourse moves continually, imbuing its
               regions with different quantities of intensity, creating densely- or
               sparsely-populated assemblages. It is motion rather than logic, smooth space rather
               than syntax that gives rise to the assemblage. The ancient fortress where Blanche's
               party takes shelter is another such heterogeneous assemblage:
               silence—path—summit—gate—view of main body—grey stone—an arch—shattered
               battlements—remains of a giant oak (606). The continual restless and recursive
               movement of Radcliffe's discourse draws attention to the looseness with which its
               parts are conjoined, including the part we generally call meaning or signification.
               Assemblages may feature flashes of reference, allusions to meaning, as in this one:
               curiosity of Blanche—Emily smiling—grave silence of Dorothée—the spectacle in the
               chamber of Udolpho—"the alarming words that had accidentally met her eye in the MS
               papers"—the black veil (491). The logical, or even narrative, relation between such
               elements counts for little; pure discursive or material proximity matters far more
               because it is only this contact or combination that can produce powerful affects. </p>
            <p> It is well known that contemporary critics condemned Gothic novels because they
               could and did "produce so powerful an effect" on their readers (<title level="j"
                  >Monthly Review</title>, qtd. in Watt 115). It is not inaccurate to say that
               Radcliffe's readers saw her novels as material assemblages that affected them through
               direct physical contact. In E.J. Clery's account, "the distracted mass audience
               absorbs the [novels] osmotically, habitually," through "tactile appropriation" (152).
               In <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>'s sharp parody, we recall, Henry Tilney
               boasts of literally appropriating his sister's copy of <title level="m">Mysteries of
                  Udolpho</title>, "running away with the volume which... was her own, particularly
               her own" (78). Physical contact with the volume brings about an explosion of motion
               (ending in "the Hermitage-walk"). Tilney argues that he was compelled or propelled
               "in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait only five minutes"; his consumption of
               the novel is measured in terms of time and somatic effect ("finishing it in two
               days—my hair standing on end the whole time" [77]). Readers and novels form grotesque
               assemblages, not unlike the disorienting swarms and multitudes that were identified
               with Gothic architecture.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Napier 71.</note> The
               products of the Minerva Press had a way of blurring all identities. As Clery notes,
               such novels were generally published anonymously or under a pseudonym, and sometimes
               were merely reshuffled and repackaged versions of other novels (138).<note
                  place="foot" resp="editors">"The trade seemed to resemble a chaos of shifting
                  identities, mysterious reduplications or multiple repetitions" (Clery 138).</note>
               Only the materiality of Gothic novels was iconic: in Austen's description, "three
               duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to
               the first, of two tombstones and a lantern" (82). The identities of authors or even
               the function of representation became less important than the sheer material
               proliferation of these novels, as lending libraries established themselves in
               "booksellers...engravers, and picture-framers, grocers, jewellers, confectioners,
               tobacconists, perfumers, ironmongers" (qtd. Clery 136).</p>
            <p> The "multitude of readers" (qtd. Clery 151) combined with the multitude of Gothic
               novels to form a productive assemblage, in Deleuze's terms: "a machinic assemblage of
               bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of bodies reacting to one another"
               (Deleuze and Guattari 88). This was a powerful kind of agency, an ability to make
               things happen.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Austen, of course, mocks this in
                  Eleanor Tilney's misapprehension of Catherine's remark that "something very
                  shocking indeed, will soon come out in London" (81).</note> Gothic novels linked
               bodies and discourse together to produce strong affects that transcended individual
               personhood and agency. The favored tropes of Gothic criticism reflect an awareness of
               this process. Gothic novels are consistently represented as itineraries, recipes, or
               a set of transformational procedures to be performed. They instruct their readers,
               critics complain, that "a young person [should] walk at night upon the battlements of
               an old castle... creep hands and feet along a narrow passage" (qtd. in Watt 81).
               Gothic novels produce and reproduce themselves, barely requiring the intervention of
               persons: "Take—An old castle... a long gallery, with a great many doors... Noise,
               whispers, and groans... Mix them together..." (qtd. Clery 147). Another critic gives
               instructions: "[f]rom any romance to make a novel. Where you find... A Castle.....
               put An house. A cavern... A bower. A groan... A sigh," presenting two parallel
               substitutable series of elements side by side: "The same table of course answers for
               transmuting a novel into a romance."<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title
                     level="m">The Age; A Poem</title> (1810), in Napier 28.</note> A Gothic novel
               is itself a loose, non-linear material assemblage that cares little for the exact
               number, location, or identity of its parts. What counts is occurrence, recurrence,
               combination, and connection. One point can connect to any other point, in rhizomatic
               fashion, and the more connections, the better.</p>
            <p> There is a paradox that emerges in the criticism and even simply in the reading of
               these novels: we could call it familiar surprise, or predictable unpredictability.
               The novel's discourse continually moves and changes in order to present us with the
               same: yet another animal-vegetable-mineral-light-sonority assemblage. In <title
                  level="m">Udolpho</title>, assemblages form, fade, decay, and then inexplicably
               reappear. Volume 4 is another Volume 1, retracing the same combinations of motion and
               rest, speed and slowness, offering remarkably similar moments, affects, assemblages.
               But such conjunctures are not supposed to be predictable or measurable; affective
               power is tied to surprise. But how can surprise coexist with such a high degree of
               repetition? The answer, I think, points toward a crucial feature of Radcliffe's
               narrative ontology, one that ties her to the so-called new materialism. Instead of
               being assumed to be static, substantial, and unchanging, materiality is understood as
               a contingent conjuncture or fragile assemblage that does not stay the same. It is a
               slow-motion flicker or flash. The assemblage is always gradually fading,
               disappearing, or evanescing; this is as true of the novel's discourse itself, its
               ceaseless flow of words, as of the represented dimension. Instead of posing the
               question of how beings can change, in other words, Radcliffe's discourse asks how
               things or assemblages can stay the same or repeat, how the same encounter can occur
               again. Persistence is always a surprise; recurrence nothing short of a miracle. Emily
               ends many chapters waiting for once-heard music to return: <quote>almost expecting,
                  that... the sounds would return....Emily continued to listen, but no music came...
                  Thus passed the hour in watchfulness... but no sounds returned; and, after
                  remaining at the casement, till the light tint of dawn began to edge the
                  mountain-tops and steal upon the night-shade, she concluded, that they would not
                  return. (340)</quote> Yet, though Emily fails to hear them, Radcliffe's sonorous
               assemblages are able to exert a powerful force in the narrative.</p>
            <p> Expectation and the capacity for disappointment give crucial hints as to Radcliffe's
               peculiar notion of agency. Agency is conceived not as a force that brings about
               change, but as that which lags behind change, or anticipates repetition,
               incorporating an otherwise inconceivable dimension of negativity into this material
               world. The distinction between subjects and objects is not necessary to maintain.
               Agency can be thought of as something like matter's own memory and expectation: that
               which preserves traces, keeps track of former iterations and assemblages, an
               after-intensity. It can be exercised by things or people, or distributed over
               assemblages: "there are the very cliffs, there are the wood of pines... There.. is
               the cottage," Emily notes when returning home at the beginning of the novel (92). She
               gives a local voice to a striving to persist that is not otherwise much in evidence.
               The last volume notes "the very avenue" that Emily had walked earlier; Emily points
               out to herself "the same high trees that used to wave over the terrace, and these the
               same flowery thickets... and there, too, on that bank, are the very plants" (583).
               This is in some ways the opposite of remembering; it is simply the awareness of
               persistence. Emily repeats the same assemblages: those steps, the terrace, the
               pavilion, Valancourt. In terms of the plot, persistence over time becomes visible
               against the ground of non-identity; in this case, the belief that Valancourt has
               changed morally: "he was no longer the same Valancourt." From this point of view,
               non-identity amounts almost to annihilation: "Valancourt seemed to be annihilated"
               (581). Yet the agency of retracing is so strong as to summon him into presence as
               part of this assemblage. "These recollections becoming too painful to be endured, she
               abruptly left the pavilion.. As she passed along the terrace, she perceived a person,
               walking... Valancourt! ...Emily, her eyes fixed on the place... remained, for some
               moments, unable to quit the spot, and scarcely conscious of existence" (586). Agency
               in this scene can be considered as the force that slows Emily down, reassembles an
               earlier conjuncture (pavilion—terrace—Valancourt), and fixes her to the spot,
               "scarcely conscious," thing-like. It seems to exist in excess of the immanent,
               ceaseless flow of materiality.</p>
            <p> As an arresting, persisting, or retracing dimension, agency belongs most strongly to
               the most notorious thing in Udolpho: what lies behind the black veil. We recall that
               Emily first approaches this object as part of a conscious effort "[t]o withdraw her
               thoughts... from the subject of her misfortunes" (248). It succeeds in withdrawing
               not only her thoughts but her consciousness. The horror produced by the "veiled
               picture," the narrative announces, "awakened all [her] powers" only to extinguish
               them when she perceives that the object behind the veil "was no picture" (249). Only
               in the final pages of the novel, to the eternal chagrin of readers, we learn that it
               was "a waxen image, made to resemble a human body in the state, to which it is
               reduced after death" (662). But from a material or ontological point of view, it is
               nothing to dismiss. It is not a picture, but neither is it "the murdered body of the
               lady Laurentini" (553). We could say of this body of wax that "an energetic
               materiality overspills the prepared matter" (Deleuze and Guattari 410). Its material
               agency certainly extends beyond its particular form or blurred figure. "A member of
               the house of Udolpho had been condemned to the penance of contemplating [it] during
               certain hours of the day"; and had "made it a condition in his will, that his
               descendants should preserve the image..." (<title level="m">Udolpho</title> 662). The
               body of wax preserves its impressions and is itself preserved, "suffered to retain
               its station in the wall of the chamber" (663). But what it preserves, what seems to
               give it its uniquely petrifying effect on its observers, is the very frozen essence
               of materiality: "a human figure of ghastly paleness, stretched at its length, and
               dressed in the habiliments of the grave... the face appeared partly decayed and
               disfigured by worms, which were visible on the features and hands. On such an
               object...no person could endure to look twice" (662). There is the official horror of
               the <emph>memento mori</emph>, the reminder of flesh's decay. But beyond this, the
               object's powerful affect comes from the way it artificially arrests a certain
               material conjuncture, captures materiality in the act of decaying intensity, of
               changing phase and form. It attempts to stop the narrative's constant movement
               through this material image, and succeeds in more than one sense: putting a stop to
               the motor force of the reader's desire to look on the other side of the black veil.
               The agency of this object is powerful indeed, its pure persistence underlined by its
               apparent effect on viewers: "no person could endure to look twice." </p>
            <p> What this reading has tried to do is to question the relation between the novel and
               the individual, and to question the methodological individualism that still drives
               even recent critiques of the genre. Many important studies of the novel have focused
               on how the novel relies on, or alternatively, constitutes the subjectivity located
               within the boundaries of an individual human body. Nancy Armstrong, for example, has
               recently argued that "the novel was not made to think beyond the individual" (25).
               Radcliffe's novels, falling as they do within the general category of what Armstrong
               and many others have called the "literature of sensibility," may not seem to
               seriously challenge such arguments; indeed, Armstrong specifically maintains that
               such literature "opposes this individualism" through the mechanism of affective
               contagion (16). Armstrong also points out that after Radcliffe it became essential
               for the mainstream novel to include "Gothic elements" (12). However, the "gothic
               elements" in question need not be defined in terms of supernatural events, ghosts,
               creepy castles, and so forth. Rather, I would like to suggest that the gothic or
               Radcliffean element resides, on the one hand, in a persistent depersonalization of
               affect, and on the other hand, in an awareness of materiality as vital, in motion,
               and possessed of agency. </p>
            <p> The depersonalization of affect in Radcliffe is extreme: a feeling can be anyone's
               feeling, even if a story is usually somebody's story.<note place="foot"
                  resp="editors">The allusion to Catherine Gallagher's study, <title level="m"
                     >Nobody's Story: The Vanishing Acts of Women Writers in the
                  Marketplace</title>, is intentional.</note> But we need to consider affect not so
               much as delimited, defined sensations but as "an encounter between bodies that
               involves...a qualitative change... in the intensity of a being's power to persevere,"
               in Hasana Sharp's gloss (26-29). Thus, affect cannot be the property of a single
               person; it is a relation that occurs at what might be called a molecular or
               micro-level. And the connection that Sharp makes between depersonalization and
               freedom, that "freedom involves a kind of depersonalization," seems to me central to
               any appeal that novels might possess (139).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This
                  insight lies at the heart of what Sharp calls "the politics of renaturalization,"
                  and is intended to offer an alternative to the Hegelian politics of recognition,
                  which aims ultimately at the reinforcement of self-conscious identity through the
                  consciousness of the other.</note> In other words, the difference between
               particular affects—and even individual characters—may not be as important as the
               transactions or contacts that occur between them. Novels create links and
               assemblages, though not always as visibly as in the case of Radcliffe. We might even
               say, in Bennett's words, that they reveal "not a world... of subjects and objects,
               but of various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations...
               groupings or compositions that shift over time" (354). Drawing attention to what he
               calls "romantic physicalism," Colin Jager has suggested the importance in Romantic
               and post-Romantic discourse of the consciousness-matter relation. I would agree with
               Jager that one important consequence of reformulating the debate, of bringing matter
               back into it, is a change in how political terms get defined: "it deflates the
               language of progressive and conservative because it deflates the oppositions
               (mind/nature, subject/object) in which that particular political debate is embedded,
               and returns us to the more defined—if no less mysterious—terrain of the mind-body
               problem" (47). I would add that it doesn't simply deflate the idea of conservatism,
               but rather situates it at a molecular level. Radcliffe's understanding of matter as
               in constant, swerving movement places a high value on persistence, on the
               preservation of traces; the phenomenon of persistence even amounts to a special kind
               of agency. This is the level, I think, at which her novels' conservatism can be
               examined. Phenomena of revolution and counter-revolution can be grasped not only in
               structures of affect, temporality, or suspended action (as in the "agonized waiting"
               that Mary Favret describes in her study of Romantic war-time temporality), but in the
               ways that narratives spin out their own shifting networks of materiality (75).
               Finally, Radcliffe's notion of materiality also overturns the idea that narrative
               consists in change and difference (in things happening to people, or people making
               things happen); it suggests a way of reading narrative not as chained sequences of
               cause and effect, but as heterogeneous assemblages and chance conjunctures of effects
               that sometimes cut transversely across the linear duration of the narrative, and
               sometimes rely on that duration to accrete a certain thickness or intensity.
               Radcliffe's narratives themselves illustrate the melancholic, conservative agency of
               tracing the same assemblages again and again. </p>
