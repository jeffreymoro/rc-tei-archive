               <p>Without doubt one of the most incisive critical inquiries into (post-)Romantic
                  notions of materiality to date was pursued in Paul de Man's later essays on
                  aesthetic ideology, and more particularly in the Messenger Lectures he delivered
                  at Cornell in 1983. In a parenthetical remark in his <title level="m">Mémoires:
                     for Paul de Man</title>, Jacques Derrida located in de Man's work an "original
                  materialism" that precedes "the metaphysical oppositions in which the concept of
                  matter and materialist theories are generally inscribed": <quote>([...] There is a
                     theme of "materiality," indeed an original materialism in de Man. It concerns a
                     "matter" which does not fit the classical philosophical definitions of
                     metaphysical materialisms any more than the sensible representations or the
                     images of matter defined by the opposition between the sensible and the
                     intelligible. Matter, a matter without presence and without substance, is what
                     resists these oppositions. [...] Matter of this sort, "older" than the
                     metaphysical oppositions in which the concept of matter and materialist
                     theories are generally inscribed, is, we might say, "in memory" of what
                     precedes these oppositions. But by this very fact [...] it retains an essential
                     relation with fiction, figurality, rhetoricity. <title level="m">Matière et
                        Mémoire</title> is the title I could have given to this long parenthesis
                     [...]). (52-53)</quote> Later in the <title level="m">Mémoires</title> Derrida
                  adds that "[o]ne cannot understand this privileging of allegory –I was long
                  puzzled by it for thus very reason—if one is not familiar with the internal
                  debates of Anglo-American criticism concerning Romanticism" (77). Driven by the
                  desire to locate a "sort of affirmative thought" (66) in de Man's relentless
                  rhetorical reading, Derrida parenthetically puts the notion of materiality at the
                  center of his reading of de Man's analysis of G.F.W. Hegel in <title level="a"
                     >Sign and Symbol in Hegel's <emph>Aesthetics</emph></title> (1982), and briefly
                  allows the Anglo-American Romantic critical tradition to enter his argument when
                  he turns to de Man's comments on Coleridge in <title level="a">The Rhetoric of
                     Temporality</title> (1969). In the questions that conclude his lecture, Derrida
                  marks "a kind of spacing, a gap that is not contradiction" (85) between both
                  essays and their respective analyses of allegory and irony. Without entering into
                  the complex questions of the relation between de Man's early and later writings
                  (and between de Man and Derrida, for that matter),<note place="foot"

                  terms of the renegotiation of the relation between materiality, Romanticism, and
                  translation in the Messenger Lectures. As the structural unity of the argument
                  developed over the six lectures has suffered somewhat from their posthumous
                  dispersion over different volumes,<note place="foot" resp="editors">The six

                  explored in their critical reception. Symptomatic of this fragmented reception is
                  the systematic isolation of the famous concluding lecture on Walter Benjamin from
                  this broader argumentative context.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a useful
                     situation of the essay in the broader context of de Man's other writings, see
                     Martin McQuillan's <title level="m">Paul de Man</title>. Within the field of
                     translation studies, de Man mainly figures, with Derrida, as an example of
                     deconstructionist appropriation of Benjamin. As has been noted by Eve Tavor
                     Bennet and Kevin Attell, however, their respective readings do diverge on
                     decisive points. An interesting new development in the essay's reception was
                     the recent publication of <title level="m">Theory and the Disappearing Future:
                        On de Man, On Benjamin</title>, containing a transcript (and facsimile
                     print) of de Man's handwritten notes for the lecture, with critical
                     commentaries by Tom Cohen, Claire Colebrook and J. Hillis Miller.</note>
                  Restoring de Man's reading of Benjamin to its original context of the Messenger
                  Lectures, I argue, allows for a more accurate analysis of the proximity of his
                  critique of translation to the notion of materiality introduced in his reading of
                  Immanuel Kant's <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>, which constitutes
                  the central event of the lecture series. This closer analysis, moreover, refers de
                  Man's later writings back to the British Romantic tradition, more specifically to
                  the initial forging of an English critical idiom in the translation of German
                  Idealist philosophy by, among others, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle.
                  As an elaborate analysis of the latter by far exceeds the limitations of this
                  essay, my aim here is to prepare the ground for such a return to British Romantic
                  aesthetic theory through de Man by means of a close reading of the latter's
                  critique of translation. In a coda, I will briefly sketch the form that such a
                  re-entry into the rhetorical complexity of the <title level="m">Biographia
                     Literaria</title> and <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title> in terms of
                  materiality and translation can take.</p>
               <p> Although, as Rodolphe Gasché has noted, translation already figures in <title
                     level="m">Allegories of Reading</title> as referring both to the totalizing
                  drive of metaphor and its disarticulation in rhetorical reading,<note place="foot"
                     resp="editors">In fact, Gasché's review of <title level="m">Allegories of
                        Reading</title> highlights the intricate proliferation of the issue of
                     translation as a process including de Man's own critical praxis into a dynamic
                     of translation, re-translation, and de-translation, characterizing de Man's
                     rhetorical readings as "retranslations" that are "de-translations, i.e.
                     operations by means of which the static and closed off instances of totality
                     are referred back to the 'original' mechanics of the text" (49). Although it is
                     certainly an essential part of further inquiry into the issue of translation in
                     de Man's writings, the inclusion of the latter in such an interminable process
                     of translation will only be indirectly addressed in this essay, since it would
                     complicate matters beyond the scope of my present argument. Another commentary
                     to take into account in this context is Cynthia Chase's <title level="a"
                        >Translating Romanticism.</title></note> it is in <title level="a"
                     >Conclusions: Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'</title> that de
                  Man most directly addresses the issue of translation as a concrete process that
                  allows him to reconfigure the terms of his rhetorical critique of Romantic
                  aesthetics. De Man's turn to translation in the essay in fact concludes an
                  elaborate argument developed over six lectures, the main theme of which was
                  announced in the opening lecture on <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in
                     the Lyric</title> as "the major crux of all critical philosophies and
                  'Romantic' literatures," i.e. "the continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment"
                  (239) or "the seamless articulation, by way of language, of sensory and aesthetic
                  experience with the intellectual assurance of affirmation" (244). From rhetorical
                  readings of Charles Baudelaire and Heinrich von Kleist, the lecture series
                  progresses to a discussion of the Hegelian sublime, to the disarticulation of the
                  category of the aesthetic in Kant and its humanistic recuperation recuperation in
                  Friedrich Schiller, so as to finally arrive at a reading of Benjamin's comments on
                  translation in his famous preface to his own translation of Baudelaire's <title
                     level="a">Tableaux Parisiens.</title> Baudelaire is not the only element
                  endowing the Messenger Lectures with a certain circularity, as they are structured
                  as a series of disarticulations of received notions of the aesthetic, ideology,
                  history, and translation that center on the notion of materiality introduced
                  halfway through the lecture series in <title level="a">Phenomenality and
                     Materiality in Kant.</title></p>
               <p>In <title level="a">Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant,</title> de Man locates
                  "a deep, perhaps fatal, break or discontinuity" (79) at the center of the <title
                     level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>. In the concluding section of the
                  analytics of the sublime, at the moment when one would have expected the emergence
                  of "a phenomenalized, empirically manifest principle" that would provide the
                  necessary causal link between "a purely conceptual and an empirically determined
                  discourse" (73) that would ultimately guarantee the architectonic unity of Kant's
                  transcendental philosophy, sublime vision ends up as "purely material" and "purely
                  formal, devoid of any semantic depth and reducible to the formal mathematization
                  or geometrization of pure optics." This formal materialism "runs counter to all
                  values and characteristics associated with aesthetic experience" (83) and, as de
                  Man discusses at length in the fifth lecture on <title level="a">Kant and
                     Schiller,</title> has been overlooked and reinscribed into an organic aesthetic
                  from Schiller onwards. To be sure, this reinscription is inevitable, and also
                  occurs in Kant's own critical philosophy: the purely material architectonic of
                  nature, de Man argues, is juxtaposed to the organic architectonics of Pure Reason
                  described near the end of the First Critique, in which the pure formality of
                  sublime vision is reinscribed into an organic tropology of body and limbs. The
                  confrontation of both versions of the architectonic occurs as one between the
                  organic metaphor of the unity of modes of cognition as a body of articulated limbs
                  that grows from the inside in, on the one hand, and the materiality of the sublime
                  vision of the ocean and the heavens, on the other. Ultimately, then, both nature
                  and the body end up disarticulated in the Third Critique, and instead of providing
                  the eventual establishment of the aesthetic as the category that would secure the
                  organic congruity between perception and cognition, it instead "marks the undoing
                  of the aesthetic as a valid category" and leaves us "with a materialism that
                  Kant's posterity has not yet begun to face up to" (89). </p>
               <p>Crucially, this disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic also affects
                  language as such. Asking himself what the equivalent of this formal materialism
                  would be "in the order of language," de Man at the very end of his lecture spells
                  out the most radical consequence of his critique of the aesthetic, stating that
                  "[t]o the dismemberment of the body corresponds a dismemberment of language, as
                  meaning-producing tropes are replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and
                  propositions into discrete words, or the fragmentation of words into syllables or
                  finally letters" (89). The pure, nonteleological, and nonorganic formality of
                  nature is transferred to language itself, so that an irrecoverable
                     <emph>linguistic</emph> materiality emerges that resists inscription into an
                  organically conceived process of meaning production.<note place="foot"
                     resp="editors">If, as Marc Redfield has argued, aesthetic ideology depends on
                     the production of transparency and the obliteration of linguistic mediation,
                     language resists this effacing gesture and persists "not as meaning, not as
                     semantic or intersubjective communication, but as an opacity, a stumbling, a
                     transport or drift or mutation irreducible to meaning or intention." In other
                     words, language "persists <emph>as language</emph>, as the technical supplement
                     that in itself can never properly exist" (23). As de Man states in <title
                        level="a">The Resistance to Theory</title> (another late essay, which first
                     got rejected by MLA, was subsequently delivered at Amherst College in 1981, and
                     finally published in the volume with the same title), the analysis of this
                     resistance marks the beginning of literary theory as such: "Literary theory can
                     be said to come into being when the approach to literary texts is no longer
                     based on non-linguistic, that is to say historical and aesthetic,
                     considerations or, to put it somewhat less crudely, when the object of
                     discussion is no longer the meaning or the value but the modalities of
                     production and of reception of meaning and of value prior to their
                     establishment" (7).</note> From the dismemberment of language emerges "the
                  prosaic materiality of the letter and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can
                  transform this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment"
                  (90). That this linguistic materiality is to be taken in its most literal sense is
                  clear from the examples de Man provides: not only does he refer to the literary
                  example of Kleist's play with the word <foreign>Fall</foreign> (fall) and
                     <foreign>Falle</foreign> (trap), which he discussed at length in the second
                  Messenger Lecture on <title level="a">Aesthetic Formalization,</title> but he also
                  refers to Kant's own language, stating that <quote>[n]o such artful moments seem
                     to occur, at first sight, in Kant. But just try to translate one single
                     somewhat complex sentence of Kant, or just consider what the efforts of
                     entirely competent translators have produced, and you will soon notice how
                     decisively determining the play of the letter and of the syllable, the way of
                     saying (<foreign>Art des Sagens</foreign>) as opposed to what is being said
                        (<foreign>das Gesagte</foreign>)—to quote Walter Benjamin—is in this most
                     unconspicuous of stylists. (89)</quote> The example, concluding de Man's
                  lecture on Kant, already prefigures his lecture on Benjamin, not only in its
                  explicit reference, but also—and more importantly—in the observation that
                  translation foregrounds the linguistic materiality that results from the
                  dismemberment of language that took place in Kant's text. If, earlier in the
                  lecture, de Man had introduced the notion of materiality as "the only word that
                  comes to mind," and had added that "how this materiality is to be understood in
                  linguistic terms is not, as yet, clearly intelligible" (82), the final example of
                  his lecture anticipates his further exploration of this question in terms of
                  translation in his concluding lecture on Benjamin.</p>
               <p>As de Man says at the beginning of the lecture, he will "repeat once more what I
                  have been saying since the beginning, using another text in order to have still
                  another version [...] of some of the questions with which we have been concerned
                  throughout these series" (73). This repetition is most clearly legible in the
                  lecture's argument as the gradual stripping of the Benjaminian concept of
                     <foreign>reine Sprache</foreign> from its "prophetic, religiously messianic"
                  (76) overtones and reading it instead as another version of the linguistic
                  materiality de Man had located in Kant. De Man's turn to Benjamin's text occurs as
                  a structural repetition of the concluding example of the lecture on Kant:
                  highlighting shifts and errors in Harry Zohn's and Maurice de Gandillac's French
                  translations of Benjamin's "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers," de Man foregrounds the
                  materiality of Benjamin's own language and its emergence in translation. By
                  subsequently repositioning translation towards poetry, philosophy, criticism, and
                  history, de Man establishes it as a practice particularly privileged to address
                  this linguistic materiality and its disarticulating effect. Unlike poetry, which
                  is aimed at conveying (extralinguistic) meaning, translation "is a relation from
                  language to language." Like philosophy—and more specifically like Kant's critical
                  epistemology—translation is critical of imitation. As Benjamin indicates, a proper
                  understanding of the relation between the original and its translation would imply
                  a critical reflection similar to the epistemological critique of "a theory of
                  simple imitation" (82). This comparison is crucial to de Man's argument, since it
                  draws a parallel between Kant's critical philosophy and Benjamin's concept of
                  translation, which will eventually end in the convergence of both in their
                  rigorous exploration of pure materiality. As is the case with criticism—Benjamin's
                  reference is to the German Romantics and to Friedrich Schlegel in particular—the
                  original when translated is "put in motion, de-canonized, questioned in a way
                  which undoes its claim to canonical authority" (83). Finally, like history,
                  translation should be understood as a non-organic, non-natural, non-dialectic
                  process. Just as we should not conceive of history as a natural process of growth
                  and movement, de Man's Benjamin says, translation should not be seen as an organic
                  process of imitation. Rather it is the other way around: instead of looking at the
                  translation as somehow growing out of the original, we should look at the original
                  from the perspective of the translation, as the latter makes us see the original
                  in a different way—allows for the emergence of an instability that was already
                  there. Translation lifts texts out of the safe haven of an organically and
                  dialectically developing history and redelivers them, as it were, as the
                  essentially linguistic, non-organic, non-human events that they always already
                  were. It is this deliverance that relates translation to linguistic materiality as
                  it emerged in Kant.</p>
               <p>At the end of this series of comparisons, translation emerges as an exemplary
                  activity that allows for a reconceptualization of philosophy, theory, and history
                  as essentially "intralinguistic." If all three are also derived activities (from
                  perception, literature, and action, respectively), they relate "to what in the
                  original belongs to language, and not to meaning as an extralinguistic correlate
                  susceptible of paraphrase and imitation." It is in the subsequent elaboration of
                  the exemplary critical thrust of the process of translation (one that decisively
                  transcends "the empirical act of translating") that de Man most programmatically
                  defines it in terms of linguistic materiality. <emph>As</emph> translations,
                  philosophy, theory, and history <quote>reveal that their failure, which seems to
                     be due to the fact that they are secondary in relation to the original, reveals
                     [...] an essential disarticulation which was already there in the original.
                     They kill the original, by discovering that the original was already dead. They
                     read the original from the perspective of a pure language (<foreign>reine
                        Sprache</foreign>), a language that would be entirely freed of the illusion
                     of meaning – pure form if you want [...]. (84)</quote> In its progression from
                  poetry to philosophy, criticism, and history, de Man's concluding lecture ends up
                  providing another version of the disarticulation of the organic congruity between
                  language and meaning and the emergence of an irreducible linguistic materiality.
                  Translation is presented as the process <foreign>par excellence</foreign> that
                  allows this materiality to be addressed: "to the extent that it disarticulates the
                  original, to the extent that it is pure language and is only concerned with
                  language," translation gets drawn into "the bottomless depth, something
                  essentially destructive, which is in language itself" (84).</p>
               <p>Like in his lecture on Kant, de Man subsequently concludes his argument by
                  providing a specifically <emph>linguistic</emph> account of the disarticulating
                  dynamics of translation, which derives from a threefold disjunction. In the first
                  place, language displays a disjunction between the hermeneutic and the poetic,
                  between "<foreign>das Gemeinte</foreign>" and the "<foreign>Art des
                     Meinens</foreign>"—meaning and the way in which a work means. Benjamin, de Man
                  argues, counters the Schillerian humanistic account of language, instead staging
                  language as non-organic and non-intentional. The second disjunction is between
                  grammar and meaning, foregrounding "the materiality of the letter" (89) as
                  potentially disruptive of meaning and making it uncontrollable, the material
                  disruption of what is assumed to be organic. The third and final disjunction,
                  between "the symbol and what is being symbolized" (89), highlights "the
                  unreliability of rhetoric as a system of tropes which would be productive of a
                  meaning" (91), foregrounding the way in which Benjamin's own tropology, contrary
                  to first impressions, in fact disarticulates its own symbolism (i.e. the symbol of
                  the amphora) so as to perform the disjunction it addresses through
                  translation.</p>
               <p>De Man's comments on translation to some extent repeat well-known aspects of his
                  rhetorical critique of (post-)Romantic literature, yet they at the same time
                  provide this critique with additional theoretical and historical incisiveness. On
                  a theoretical level, de Man's earlier critique of metaphor is supplemented with a
                  critique of organic conceptions of meaning production and phenomenological models
                  of language, deriving from the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in
                  Kant. Precisely to the extent that this disarticulation affects language as
                  phenomenal embodiment of meaning, the linguistic materiality that results from it
                  can never be addressed <emph>in</emph> language without reinscribing it into the
                  organic tropological model of language that this materiality resists. The
                  materiality in question, in other words, has no substance, is without matter, and
                  can only be witnessed as an event. In terms of de Man's reading of Benjamin, pure
                  language is something that happens <emph>in translation</emph>, be it in
                  interlingual translation or in critical reading. In the "Conclusions" it is
                  translation and the movement it causes in the original that makes this event
                  happen, as it hovers around linguistic materiality and alienates language from the
                  human and the organic as such. <foreign>Reine Sprache</foreign>, which has come to
                  refer to linguistic materiality, has no substance, does not exist, except <emph>in
                     translation</emph>. <quote>This movement of the original is a wandering, an
                        <emph>errance</emph>, a kind of permanent exile if you wish, but it is not
                     really an exile, for there is no homeland [...]. Least of all is there
                     something like a <foreign>reine Sprache</foreign>, a pure language, which does
                     not exist except as a permanent disjunction which inhabits all languages as
                     such, including and especially the language one calls one's own. What is to be
                     one's own language is the most displaced, the most alienated of all.
                     (92)</quote> Translation allows linguistic materiality to be addressed as a
                  "necessarily nihilistic moment" (92) in a movement from irreversible
                  disarticulation to inevitable reinscription. This moment, this radical negativity
                  that translation allows to emerge, endows it with a specifically historical
                  agency.</p>
               <p>In fact, the entire argument of the <title level="a">Conclusions</title> is doubly
                  framed by questions of history—first in the lecture itself, and secondly in the
                  larger context of the Messenger Lectures. In the lecture itself, de Man introduces
                  his reading of Benjamin by means of an evocation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and
                  Geoffrey Hartman as upholding a dialectical model of history in which the
                  negativity emerging from philosophy's rhetorical self-consciousness is ultimately
                  recuperated into "a new consciousness" (76) and "sacred revelation" (79),
                  respectively. De Man's reading of Benjamin subsequently relies heavily on this
                  evocation of a persistent historical naïvité, so as to stage Benjamin as a thinker
                  who leaves "no room for historical notions such as the notion of modernity" (93),
                  and instead radically reconceptualizes the historical through his critique of
                  translation. Translation, as the "errancy of language which never reaches the
                  mark," de Man argues, "is what Benjamin calls history," which "is not human,
                  because it pertains strictly to the order of language" (92). As such, the <title
                     level="a">Conclusions</title> of the Messenger Lectures refer back to the
                  opening lecture on Baudelaire, which had already ended in the emergence of the
                  "materiality of actual history": <quote>Generic terms such as "lyric" [...] as
                     well as pseudo-historical period terms such as "romanticism" or "classicism"
                     are always terms of resistance and nostalgia, at the furthest remove from the
                     materiality of actual history. If mourning is called a "chambre d'éternel deuil
                     où vibrent vieux râles," then this pathos of terror states in fact the desired
                     consciousness of eternity and of temporal harmony as voice and song. True
                     "mourning" is less deluded. The most <emph>it</emph> can do is to allow for
                     non-comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac,
                     non-celebratory, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or, better,
                        <emph>historical</emph> modes of language power. (262)</quote> This
                  circularity of de Man's argument in the Messenger Lectures is symptomatic of its
                  most radical conclusion. In terms of the <title level="a">Conclusions,</title>
                  linguistic materiality is never available as such, but can only be addressed in

                  original, in which it was always already at work.</p>
               <p>In an important but often overlooked essay that marks a transition from <title
                     level="m">Allegories of Reading</title> to the critique of aesthetic ideology
                  in the Messenger Lectures, de Man both anticipates this revaluation of translation
                  and history and supplements it with a historical context that is of specific
                  relevance to British Romantic aesthetic theory. In <title level="a">The
                     Epistemology of Metaphor</title> (published in <title level="j">Critical
                     Inquiry</title> in 1978 and later included in <title level="m">Aesthetic
                     Ideology</title>), de Man locates in John Locke, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac,
                  and Kant a recurring failure to clearly demarcate rhetorical from other forms of
                  language, a failure resulting from "the asymmetry of the binary model that opposes
                  the figural to the proper meaning of figure" (48-49). The problem first occurs in
                  Locke's discussion of language in the <title level="m">Essay Concerning Human
                     Understanding</title>. In its movement from simple ideas to substances and
                  mixed modes, de Man argues, Locke's argument actually deploys "the entire spectrum
                  [...] of tropological totalization" and thus generates an "anamorphosis of tropes
                  which has to run its full course whenever one engages, however reluctantly or
                  tentatively, the question of language as figure."(42) Discussing "motion" as an
                  example of a simple idea, Locke demonstrates that as a simple idea it is
                  undefinable, and refers to the atomists' definition of motion as passage as an
                  instance of "translation" and not of definition. De Man comments: <quote>Locke's
                     own "passage" is bound to continue this perpetual motion that never moves
                     beyond tautology: motion is a passage and passage is a translation;
                     translation, once again, means motion, piles motion upon motion. It is no mere
                     play of words that "translate" is translated in German as
                        <foreign>übersetzen</foreign>, which itself translates the Greek
                        <foreign>meta phorein</foreign> or metaphor. Metaphor gives itself the
                     totality which it then claims to define, but it is in fact the tautology of its
                     own position. The discourse of simple ideas is figural discourse or translation
                     and, as such, creates the fallacious illusion of definition. (38)</quote> This

               <p>When de Man subsequently turns to Kant, the term translation again pops up—albeit
                  this time as a translation of a Kantian term by de Man himself as he discusses the
                  figure of hypotyposis. The latter refers to the sensory representation of
                  supra-sensory concepts of pure reason (ideas) by way of symbols. Commenting on the
                  necessarily metaphorical nature of philosophical language (de Man cites the
                  Kantian examples of "ground," "to depend," and "to follow from"), Kant states that
                  such metaphors are "a mere translation [<foreign>Übertragung</foreign>] from a
                  reflexion upon a represented object into an entirely different concept, to which
                     <emph>perhaps</emph> no representation could ever correspond" (47, de Man's
                  translation). De Man takes on the "perhaps" to mark a possible non-correspondence
                  between concepts and their metaphorical representation, so that the figure of
                  hypotyposis confronts Kant's philosophical rhetoric with the potential
                  uncontrollability of metaphors rather than reassures it of their conceptual power
                  and epistemological reliability. De Man's use of the word "translation" for
                     "<foreign>Übertragung</foreign>" subtly repeats his reading of Locke earlier in
                  the essay: while Kant's language would ideally translate supra-sensory ideas into
                  philosophical terminology, what actually happens is that it ends up in an
                  intralinguistic process of metaphorical substitution that never reaches beyond
                  itself, persistently referring itself to itself rather than representing
                  extralinguistic meaning. While this rhetorical condition by no means coincides
                  with the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in Kant, it already
                  anticipates de Man's reading of Kant five years later in the Messenger Lectures,
                  as it is symptomatic of the disarticulation of language as phenomenal
                  representation and its corresponding emergence as pure formality.<note

                     version of Kant's materialist resistance to Schiller's humanism, when de Man
                     addresses "the particular necessity which philosophy has, to take its
                     terminology not from purely intellectual concepts but from material, sensory
                     elements, which it then uses metaphorically and frequently forgets that it does

                     [...]; whereas here it is offered by Schiller as a solution [...]. The sensory
                     [...], unlike the hypotyposis in Kant, becomes a metaphor for reason." (154) In
                     the <title level="a">Conclusions,</title> de Man again refers to Kant's
                     hypotyposis and the way in which it "invites us to become aware of the use of

                  Messenger Lectures with a context that is of specific relevance for British
                  Romantic theory. It stands out in de Man's writings as one of the few instances in
                  which he actually discusses the British empiricist tradition, which in turn is of
                  crucial importance for the British Romantic translation of German Idealism by

                        philosophers of language. Neither has aesthetic theory succeeded in its
                        admirable ambition to unite cognition, desire and morality in one single
                        aesthetic judgment. Professor Bate "in an article on <title level="a">The

                           assertion certainly stands in need of careful examination (25)</quote></note> In the essay, de Man suggests a far-reaching revision of the
                  traditional narrative of modernity in terms of a rhetorical condition that reaches
                  across philosophical traditions and affects our received notion of "Enlightenment"
                  as such. If there is validity to his readings of Locke and Kant, de Man claims,
                  then we might conclude that "our own literary modernity has reestablished contact
                  with a 'true' Enlightenment that remained hidden for us by a nineteenth-century
                  romantic and realist epistemology that asserted a reliable rhetoric of the subject
                  or of representation" (49). </p>
               <p>From the Messenger Lectures thus emerges a notion of translation that, not unlike
                  what de Man in <title level="a">The Resistance to Theory</title> calls "the
                  linguistics of literariness," presents itself as a powerful tool in the
                  "unmasking" of aesthetic ideology by going "against a powerful philosophical
                  tradition of which aesthetics is a prominent part" (11). As such, this notion of
                  translation allows for a return to the "gap" suggested by Derrida between <title
                     level="a">The Rhetoric of Temporality</title> and de Man's later writings.
                  Retrospectively, the Lectures make legible in the 1969 essay the emergence and
                  premature abandonment of the question of materiality. In his discussion of
                  Coleridge's theory of symbol in the broader contexts of European (pre-)Romanticism
                  and post-Romantic criticism, de Man focuses on the ambiguous valorization of
                  symbol over allegory in <title level="m">The Stateman's Manual</title>, and phrase
                  this ambiguity in terms of materiality: while Coleridge devalues allegory as
                  suffering from "a lack of substantiality," the symbol's "material substantiality
                  dissolves and becomes a mere reflection of a more original unity that does not
                  exist in the material world." Coleridge's conception of symbol as organic form
                  ultimately ends up in a "spiritualization of the symbol [that] has been carried so
                  far that the moment of material existence by which it was originally defined"
                  vanishes and is replaced by a notion of "translucence" (192), which turns it (with
                  allegory) to its transcendental source and away from the world of matter. In the
                  remainder of the essay, de Man then abandons this "materialist" line of
                  questioning, and instead recasts it in the subjectivist terminology of the
                  disjunction of the empirical and the linguistic self. In a later lecture, de Man
                  will criticize this approach, and provide an alternative through a rhetorical
                  reading of Johann Gottlieb Fichte that to a substantial degree announces the
                  argument of the Messenger Lectures.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A key moment
                     in this autocritical turn is the 1977 lecture on <title level="a">The Concept
                        of Irony</title> (included in <title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>),
                     in which de Man criticizes this analysis of the trope of irony in terms of "a
                     dialectic of the self as reflexive structure," implicitly referring to <title
                        level="a">The Rhetoric of Temporality</title> when he states that "[i]t is
                     in this way, to the extent that I have written about the subject, that I have
                     dealt with it myself, so what I have to say today is in the nature of an
                        <foreign>autocritique</foreign>, since I want to put in question this
                     possibility." (169-170) The lecture's reading of Fichte to an important degree
                     anticipates both the argument of <title level="a">The Epistemology of
                        Metaphor</title> and the line of questioning of the Messenger Lectures when
                     he states that "[i]rony and history seem to be curiously linked to each other"
                     and that "[t]his would be the topic to which this would lead, but this can only
                     be tackled when the complexities of what we call performative rhetoric have
                     been more thoroughly mastered" (184).</note> After the latter has taken his
                  theoretical critique towards aesthetic ideology, materiality, and translation,
                  Coleridge ends up looming large as the "acknowledged 'father' of theory" (Trott
                  69) whose translation of German Idealist philosophy forged a critical idiom that
                  stands at the origin of post-Romantic Anglo-American criticism and that includes
                  de Man in its dynamic exchange with aesthetic ideology.</p>

                  the <title level="m">Biographia</title>'s evasion of translation transcends the
                  strategic gestures of plagiarism, and should be read as an essential part of the
                  articulation of its transcendentalist argument and its persistent confrontation
                  with its own language as representative of transcendental ideas. Ideally,
                  Coleridge's language would participate in a process that it famously calls "divine
                  ventriloquism"—a process of organic revelation of divine truth across languages
                  based in a transcendental principle of unity that is immediate and in which ideas
                  and their representations coincide. While this process safely subsumes linguistic
                  mediation as a mere supplement to organic revelation, the matter of mediation
                  repeatedly forces itself on the <title level="m">Biographia</title> as it
                  translates Schelling’s Transcendental System. This re-emergence of language
                  already occurs at the moment of the introduction of the notion of "divine
                  ventriloquism" in chapter 9. Coleridge's claim that "I regard truth as a divine
                  ventriloquist: I care not from whose mouth the sounds are supposed to proceed, if
                  only the words are audible and intelligible" (164) ideally posits divine truth as
                  one speaking itself across languages under the unifying drive of organic
                  revelation. The addition of "if only the words are [...] intelligible," however,
                  immediately conditions this ideal and foregrounds linguistic mediation against
                  organic revelation. In fact, it is <emph>as</emph> a translation that the <title
                     level="m">Biographia</title> is continually forced to confront the question as
                  to its comprehensibility, since the latter depends "rendering the system itself
                  intelligible to my countrymen" (163), an audience deeply afflicted by "that
                  compendious philosophy, which talking of mind but thinking of brick and mortar, or
                  other images equally abstracted from body, contrives a theory of spirit by
                  nicknaming matter" and reduces all things to "impressions, ideas, and sensations"
                  (235). The language of British "mechanical" philosophy represents the threat of a
                  purely material language, as when Coleridge indicates that "existence of an
                  infinite spirit, of an intelligent and holy will, must on this system be mere
                  articulated motions of the air" (120) and that "a God not visible [...] can exist
                  only in the sounds and letters that form his name and attributes" (121). To secure
                  his own philosophical rhetoric from this threat of a purely material language,
                  Coleridge subsequently appeals to "the ascertaining vision, the intuitive
                  knowledge" (239) that precedes linguistic materialization and translation. In
                  order to establish its own language as an instance of divine ventriloquism,
                  Coleridge's argument has to articulate the transcendental principle from which
                  this ventriloquism emerges. In the actual articulation of this principle, however,
                  it is translation that exposes the principle of organic unity as originating in an
                  imposition of difference rather than as an original principle of immediate
                  identity. As David Ferris's close reading of Coleridge's translation of Schelling
                  has compellingly demonstrated, Coleridge's translation adds to Schelling's system
                  a decisively religious dimension, and deviates the latter's argument in a much
                  more overtly organic direction. Perhaps the clearest example of this imposition of
                  difference occurs immediately before the discussion of the subjective and
                  objective ways of knowledge, when Coleridge rephrases the "postulate of
                  philosophy" as "the heaven-descended <hi rendition="#smcap">know thyself</hi>!"
                  (252). As Ferris argues, "[w]here Schelling exposes the principle systematically
                  and, in so doing, provides it with its own means of justification, Coleridge takes
                  it over as if it were a God-given truth" (57). The postulation of a divine origin
                  that ultimately grounds a total organic unity of opposites marks a strategic
                  recovery of linguistic transmission in Coleridge's translation. As Ferris states:
                     <quote>the point where Schelling's philosophy attains completion is the point
                     at which it gives authority to itself and so becomes self-grounded. The
                        <emph>promise</emph> of such a philosophical resolution is essentially what
                     Coleridge takes from Schelling and applies to the whole series of apparently
                     intractably divided terms and oppositions he is concerned with, namely,
                     subject/object, original/copy, author/text, truth/authority, critic/text and
                     philosophy/poetry. (60)</quote> Coleridge's translation of Schelling's
                  Transcendental System, in other words, effects a "disfiguration" (49) of its
                  systematic and self-grounding articulation. A further analysis of this
                  disfigurating impact of translation and its continuous reinscription in the
                  organic ideology of divine ventriloquism in the <title level="m"
                     >Biographia</title>, I would argue, could lead to a productive revaluation of
                  the relation between its anti-materialist philosophical argument and its
                  rhetorical performance as a continuous confrontation with—and evasion of—an
                  irreducible linguistic materiality that leads to the premature abortion of its
                  argument.</p>
               <p>What is more, this dynamic between translation and materiality should be further
                  contextualized in British Romantic aesthetic theory and its continued impact on
                  the Anglo-American literary-critical tradition. A text certainly to be taken into
                  account in this respect is Carlyle's <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title>,
                  which, as I have extensively argue elsewhere,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                     my <title level="a"><emph>Sartor Resartus</emph> and the Rhetoric of
                        Translation.</title> Apart from Carlyle, another key Romantic
                     author-translator to be taken into account in this context is Thomas De
                     Quincey, whose complex engagement with translation has as yet not received the
                     close critical attention it deserves. Notable exceptions are Eric Dayre’s
                     aforementioned study and Brecht de Groote’s recent dissertation on “‘A
                     Frightful Co-Existence’: Thomas De Quincey, Translation, and the Prospect of
                     Modernity.”</note> emerges as a highly experimental exploration of the process
                  of translation that ends in the disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic
                  it was intended to bring home to the British reader. What is often overlooked in
                  readings of <title level="m">Sartor Resartus</title> is precisely the fact that it
                  does not coincide with the Teufelsdröckhian Clothes Philosophy it contains, but
                  presents a fictional account of its translation. Framing the articulation of a
                  transcendentalist aesthetic in such an account of its translation, <title
                     level="m">Sartor</title> foregrounds the latter's rhetorical disarticulation
                     <emph>in</emph> translation. In this sense, <title level="m">Sartor
                     Resartus</title> presents the "end" of Romantic aesthetic theory in a final act
                  of sustained self-reflexive rhetorical scrutiny: in the progression from the
                     <title level="m">Biographia</title> to <title level="m">Sartor</title> a
                  foregrounding of the process of translation occurs, eventually ending up in the
                  disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic these works set out to
                  articulate.</p>
               <p>From this brief excursion to Coleridge and Carlyle, a central question emerges
                  that de Man never turned to, but towards which his later essays on aesthetic
                  ideology certainly gesture, i.e. that of the British Romantic aesthetic theory as
                  essentially occurring in the mode of translation. Addressing this question would
                  entail a study of Romanticism in terms of the materiality emerging from the
                  disarticulation of the aesthetic in Kant, and would entail both a historical and
                  comparative reinterrogation of British Romanticism's position as mediating between
                  the philosophical traditions of empiricism and Idealism. In this sense, de Man can
                  and should be seen as "a thinker of affirmation"—or at least as a thinker putting
                  us before the task of reading and translating the theoretical discourse of and on
                  Romanticism, so as to confront it with the material event that ruptures aesthetic
                  ideology and destabilizes the critical terms we use to address it.</p>
