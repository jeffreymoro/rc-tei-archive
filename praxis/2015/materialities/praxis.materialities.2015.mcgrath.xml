                  <quote>I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits unless I spend four
                     hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the
                     woods and over the hills and fields absolutely free from all worldly
                     engagements. . . . When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and
                     shop-keepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the
                     afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as if the legs were
                     made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they deserve some
                     credit for not having all committed suicide long ago. — Henry David Thoreau

                  <quote>What purchase might there be for loosening the grip of capitalism as an
                     oppressive instance? . . . One critical orientation, which is seemingly
                     paradoxical given that mobility and liberation have hitherto been closely
                     associated, is to be sought in challenging mobility as a prerequisite and
                     incontestable value. Is the project of liberation still compatible with an
                     unlimited extension of the exigency of mobility, contact and connection which .
                     . . can be a source of new forms of exploitation and new existential tensions?
                     — Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello (468)</quote>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Mobility for Thoreau offers respite from a capitalist economy that exploits
                  workers. For Boltanski and Chiapello, however, it represents capitalism's latest
                  and most advanced form of oppression. In the new spirit of capitalism, mobility is
                  key to a knowledge economy that idealizes workers who are flexible, creative, and
                  reprogrammable—workers who, following William Wordsworth, wander as clouds
                  through the Cloud. As Boltanski and Chiapello explore, mobility and flexibility
                  today are sources for new social anxieties. What once offered respite from
                  capitalism for Thoreau is now a source of anxiety for workers capable of imagining
                  a near future when they may no longer be mobile or flexible enough to compete for
                  jobs that provide adequate material resources. In an economy that values mobility
                  and flexibility, one is expendable when others are more mobile and flexible—code
                  in the new knowledge economy for a purely formal process of substitution or
                  interchangeability. This essay begins with two questions: how does the general
                  mobility and flexibility of late capitalism, increased—if not inaugurated—by cloud
                  computing, leave material traces? And (risking seeming a bit simple minded), given
                  Romantic poetry's preoccupation with clouds, how does Romantic poetry—specifically the poetry of William Wordsworth—help us to think the material
                  traces of cloud computing and the knowledge economy differently?</p>

               <head>Romanticism and Materialism</head>
               <p>To think about Romanticism—and in particular Romantic poetry—and materialism
                  today may still strike some as quite odd. Aren't poets the least materialist of
                  writers and Romantic poets the least materialist of the poets? This at least is
                  how Jerome McGann characterized Romantic poetry so powerfully in <title level="m"
                     >Romantic Ideology</title>, where he argued that Romantic poetry "is everywhere
                  marked by extreme forms of displacement and poetic conceptualization whereby the
                  actual human issues with which the poetry is concerned are resituated in a variety
                  of idealized localities" (1). What distinguishes Romantic poetry is the recurring
                  displacement of material life. </p>
               <p>Many readers of Romantic poetry have worked against McGann's accusation for years, but recent publications by contemporary poets and specialists in contemporary
                  poetry and poetics continue to align Romanticism with idealism, showing that the
                  dominant narrative exerts great power. Marjorie Perloff's <title level="m"
                     >Uncreative Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century</title>, Kevin
                  Goldsmith's <title level="m">Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital
                     Age</title>, and Craig Dworkin and Kevin Goldsmith's <title level="m">Against
                     Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing</title> show how contemporary
                  writing has distanced itself from the tropes that preoccupied—or have been
                  understood to preoccupy—Romantic poets: genius, imagination, individuality,
                  creativity, emotion, and so on. Dreams of originality strongly associated with
                  Romantic discourse have themselves been transformed by technologies that enable new
                  writing practices. As Goldsmith writes: "writers are exploring ways of writing
                  that have been thought, traditionally, to be outside the scope of literary
                  practice: word programming, databasing, recycling, appropriation, intentional
                  plagiarism, identity ciphering, and intensive programming, to name but a few" (2).
                  Summarizing Perloff, he explains: "because of changes brought on by technology and
                  the Internet, our notion of genius—a romantic isolated figure—is outdated"
                  (1).</p>
               <p>Technological change in recent years is largely responsible for an increase in
                  non-expressive, conceptual, and material poetics: a poetry, following Charles
                  Olson, that aims to get "rid of [the] lyrical interference of the individual as
                  ego" so strongly associated with Romanticism and embrace self-consciously
                  "unoriginal" practices common in the digital age (qtd. in Dworkin, <title
                     level="a">Against Expression</title> xliii). In <title level="a">The Fate of
                     Echo,</title> Dworkin's introduction to <title level="m">Against
                     Expression</title>, he describes the original online collection from which
                     <title level="m">Against Expression</title> emerged, which <quote>happened to
                  gather a particular kind of writing to make a secondary argument: some of the
                  presumed hallmarks of poetry—the use of metaphor and imagery, a soigné edited
                  craft, the sincere emotional expression of especially sensitive individuals—might
                  be radically reconsidered, and poetry might be reclaimed as a venue for intellect
                  rather than sentiment. (xliii)</quote> In the original forward published online at
                  UbuWeb, Dworkin contrasts recent developments in contemporary poetry and poetics
                  with Romanticism, and with Wordsworth in particular. He writes: "what would a
                  non-expressive poetry look like? A poetry of intellect rather than emotion? One in
                  which the substitution at the heart of metaphor and image were replaced by the
                  direct presentation of language itself, with 'spontaneous overflow' supplanted by
                  meticulous procedure and exhaustively logical process?" (<title level="m"
                     >UbuWeb</title>). A metonym for Romanticism, "spontaneous overflow" stands for
                  a poetry skewed toward transparency and immateriality. Unlike an expressive poetry
                  that foregrounds the lyric ego and aims to transmit or communicate some expressive
                  content, non-expressive poetry renders words opaque and material, thus making
                  possible forms of "social, economic, and political critique" (Goldsmith 61). Dan
                  Graham's <title level="a">Schema</title> is one of Dworkin's examples of
                  non-expressive poetry, "where the self-regard of narcissistic confession [is]
                  rejected in favor of laying bare the potential for linguistic self-reflexiveness"
                     (<title level="m">Against Expression</title> xliii). Graham's poem consists
                  of publishing information about the appearance of the page upon which the "poem"
                  is printed. As Dworkin explains: "Graham submits a template—not unlike the portion
                  of XML source used to order and display the information pulled from various
                  databases—which the editor of the magazine was to calculate and complete,
                  providing information about the physical characteristics of the publication.
                  Rigorously and recursively self-referential, the completed piece parses itself,
                  collapsing form and content. The result focuses attention onto the most minute
                  particulars of the physical aspects of print" (289). The scheme, and so the text of the poem, includes the
                  weight of the paper sheet, the type of paper stock, the name of the typeface,
                  etc.; and of the pages selected, the number of words, the number of adjectives,
                  the percentage of area occupied by type. The poem attempts to turn attention to
                  the materiality of the printed object. It has no "content" but its material
                  context. Dworkin continues: "The radical implications of Graham's work follow from
                  that combination of an insistence on the cultural materiality of language and a
                  rejection of the romantic author <!-- KB: SHOULD THIS BE 'Romantic author'?? -->as a unified locus of interior authority" (290). In this way, the poem forces
                  readers to attend to a material context that more often is ignored by a tradition
                  of Romantic poetry, to return to McGann, that privileges an ideal or idealized
                  content over historical, material context. In several important ways, 2011 was a
                  very un-Romantic year. </p>
               <p>Few readers would confuse Wordsworth's <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a
                     cloud</title> with Graham's <title level="a">Schema,</title> yet I wonder if
                  Romanticism need so forcefully be aligned with the immateriality of "narcissistic
                  confession," and so defined as complicit with and not critical of the social,
                  economic, and political status quo. I wonder, to put this differently, how easy it
                  is to gain access to "materiality." Unlike an expressive poetry structured by
                  figure (and the various forms of substitution figurative language foregrounds in a
                  poem like <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title>), a non-expressive
                  poetry would "replace" metaphor with what Dworkin describes as the "direct
                  presentation of language itself." The readily apparent difficulty of such a
                  presentation arises from the fact that the effort to "replace" "the substitution
                  at the heart of metaphor" already depends on the logic of substitution—or
                  replacement—that defines metaphor. To supplant "spontaneous overflow" with the
                  direct presentation of language itself is already to participate in the logic of
                  substitution that defines figurative or expressive poetry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Eric Lindstrom, who offers an interesting contrast with
                     Dworkin's use of "supplanted" in his description of how the spontaneous
                     overflow of emotion is supplanted by meticulous procedure in non-expressive
                     poetry and poetics.</note> The poet's effort to substitute for metaphor the
                  direct presentation of language depends upon metaphor.</p>
               <p>An assertion that Romanticism is outdated may reproduce certain "Romantic"
                  structures and preoccupations. What distinguishes Romantic poems may be their
                  attempts to move away from Romanticism. Goldsmith, for example, begins <title
                     level="m">Uncreative Writing</title> with something of a Wordsworthian problem:
                  "faced with an unprecedented amount of available text, the problem is not needing
                  to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that
                  exists" (1). Goldsmith develops "uncreative" writing practices to manage, parse,
                  and organize "this thicket of information," just as Wordsworth offers <title
                     level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> to "manage" the rapid communication of
                  intelligence (Wordsworth, <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 294).
                  Famously, Wordsworth laments the craving for extraordinary incidents produced in
                  the minds of readers by the proliferation of information (newspapers, for instance)
                  and argues for poetry to play a role in offsetting the blunting of the mind that
                  results from this craving. In some significant ways, Goldsmith and Wordsworth
                  respond to the same problem. Similarly, Dworkin characterizes the shift from
                  expressive to non-expressive poetry and poetics using familiar Romantic tropes:
                  contemporary non-expressive poets choose Echo over Romanticism's—perhaps
                  specifically Wordsworth's—Narcissus, language over ego, materiality over
                  ideal-ity. Such an opposition is complicated, though, by the very poetry under
                  discussion. The opposition Dworkin sets up between Echo and Narcissus maps too
                  easily onto the opposition John Keats, for instance, sets up between William Shakespeare and John Milton. Shakespeare was always already something of a re-mixer and a model of
                  sorts for Keats, i.e. Romanticism, too. Like the poets Dworkin celebrates, Keats
                  distinguishes the poetical character from Wordsworth's "egotistical sublime." "A
                  poet," writes Keats in a letter to Richard Woodhouse from October of 1818, "is the
                  most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no Identity" (Keats
                  195). Dan Graham's <title level="a">Schema,</title> like Keats's poet, is
                  similarly empty of content of its own. Perhaps 2011 was a very romantic year for
                  contemporary poetics.</p>
               <p>I started by suggesting that poets are the least material of writers, and Romantic
                  poets the least material of poets. This is true, of course, only if one defines
                  Romanticism in the terms employed by those who collapse Romanticism and idealism,
                  a drifting into mind of language merely as a vehicle to explore the self. But what
                  if the Romantic poet's turn inward is not a turn away from materiality, but a turn
                  toward the question: where is the material? When? Where or when is the encounter
                  with what cannot be known or understood about language, and how does this
                  encounter, this event, offer some form of registering materiality—however defined,
                  however removed from consciousness, for example? The rejection of Romanticism
                  common in contemporary poetics—a rejection that aligns Romanticism with idealism
                  and contemporary poetry with materialism—always risks transforming materialism
                  into an ideal idealism, as the auto-referentiality of text becomes
                  indistinguishable from Wordsworth's ego-ideal.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Contemporary poet Christian Bök provocatively suggests that
                     in the future poetry will be written by machines for other machines to read

                  one discovers it instead dispersed, a cloud; when one thinks one has finally rid

               <head>New Materialisms</head>
               <p>Recent advances in technology are helping us not only develop new writing
                  practices, but also rethink what we mean by matter, material, materiality, and so
                  call for what Diane Coole and Samantha Frost term "new materialisms." The more we
                  come to understand about atoms—but also genes, networks, etc.—the less comfortably
                  solid material becomes, for, as Coole and Frost write, "the microscopic atom
                  consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike,
                  three-dimensional wave of spinning electrons" (11). They continue: <quote>Even when vast
                  numbers of atoms are assembled in the kind of macrostructures we experience in the
                  'condensed matter' of the perceptible world, their subatomic behavior consists in
                  the constant emergence, attraction, repulsion, fluctuation, and shifting of nodes
                  of charge: which is to say that they demonstrate none of the comforting stability
                  or solidity we take for granted. (11)</quote> What formerly we thought "material" is now,
                  we discover, more dispersed, cloudlike than we might prefer. To be a good
                  materialist today, one cannot simply kick a stone and feel good about having
                  returned oneself to the hard stuff that matters most. We cannot, as Wordsworth
                  famously did when confronted by the immateriality of self and world, simply reach
                  for some tree branch or wall. As he explains in his discussion of <title level="a"
                     >Ode: Intimations of Immortality,</title> "I was often unable to think of
                  external things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as
                  something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature. Many times
                  while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this
                  abyss of idealism to the reality" (Wordsworth, <title level="m">Fenwick
                     Notes</title> 61). Wordsworth's fear when a boy was that he would fall into an
                  abyss of idealism, and so he grasped for wall or tree in an effort to encounter a
                  world that threatened to disappear—as the world became merely an extension of his
                  own immaterial self. The threat is oneself, one's own immateriality, and the chance
                  that there is or soon will be nothing but this immateriality. In later years, of
                  course, Wordsworth's fear is the reverse: that the world is too much with us, a
                  large stone on a small chest.</p>
               <p> Bruno Latour begins <title level="m">Pandora's Hope</title> with a question from
                  a colleague that takes him by surprise. It's a question that seems to follow from
                  many of the social, cultural, and scientific discussions that have become more and
                  more common in the 20<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>and 21<hi rendition="#sup"
                     >st</hi> centuries: "'I have a question for you,' he said, taking out of his
                  pocket a crumpled piece of paper on which he had scribbled a few key words. He
                  took a breath: 'Do you believe in reality?'" (1). In other words, the question
                  from Latour's colleague is—given the various concerns over reality as socially
                  constructed, as virtual—is it still possible to "believe" in reality? The
                  colleague is here the young Wordsworth and Latour simply the closest wall or tree.
                  What happened to the material world? In "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From
                  Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern," Latour expresses quite powerfully his
                  worry that "a certain form of critical spirit has sent us down the wrong path"
                  (231). He draws a parallel between PhD programs "still running to make sure that
                  good American kids are learning the hard way that facts are made up, that there is
                  no such thing as natural, unmediated, unbiased access to truth" and extremists who
                  "are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won
                  evidence" (227). What is the difference, he concludes, "between conspiracists and a
                  popularized, that is a teachable version of social critique?" (228). Latour's
                  colleague in <title level="m">Pandora's Hope</title> is forced to ask his question
                  in part because forms of social critique have successfully questioned the very
                  idea of matters of fact. The fact that the so-called linguistic or cultural turn
                  has made it possible to ask such a question is precisely what Coole and Frost
                  identify as a reason for the necessity of new materialisms: "the more textual
                  approaches associated with the so-called cultural turn are increasingly being
                  deemed inadequate for understanding contemporary society, particularly in light of
                  some of its most urgent challenges regarding environmental, demographic,
                  geopolitical, and economic change" (3). Textual approaches have left us with
                  nothing but the immaterial. Like Latour's colleague, we reach for something else,
                  something more, something more material—or at least we should be reaching. But the
                  act itself repeats Wordsworth's question. If Romanticism is nothing other than an
                  effort away from Romanticism, is idealism nothing other than the effort out of
                  idealism? If the effort out of Romanticism merely puts us back in Romanticism,
                  does the effort out of idealism merely put us back in idealism? </p>
               <p>Latour, however, foregrounds a form of material textuality in his opening anecdote,
                  as his colleague takes from his pocket a scrap of paper upon which he has written
                  a few key words. Given the scene, the colleague's question appears possible at all
                  only because of and through his encounter with writing, and so Latour's opening
                  foregrounds technologies of inscription even as the colleague's question seems to
                  lament a linguistic turn that embraces theories of textuality that threaten—or are
                  perceived to threaten—reality. In his posthumously published book <title
                     level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title>, Paul de Man argues that the encounter
                  with something one might call matter or materiality occurs not when textual
                  approaches are eschewed, but only "by way of an epistemological critique of tropes"
                  (132). What Coole and Frost refer to as "textual approaches"are deemed inadequate
                  in <title level="m">New Materialisms</title>because language does not offer access
                  to materiality; as if the world, reality, materiality (as Latour's colleague
                  worries) is destroyed as soon as we represent it with or through signs. At moments
                  like this, however, it can appear that a purely formal, fully tropological model
                  for language is the legacy of post-structuralism, deconstruction, and the linguist
                  and cultural turns; as if this model were not always part of what Paul de Man
                  calls aesthetic ideology and something the epistemological critique of tropes is
                  meant to oppose.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for
                     instance, Orrin N. C. Wang's reading in <title level="m">Romantic
                        Sobriety</title>, p. 92.</note> For de Man, literary attention to signs,
                  words, tropes, does not result in a rejection of materiality; it offers an attempt
                  to encounter, in whatever minimal way possible, materiality. Materiality is not
                  opposed to writing, even if it is "opposed to some extent to the notion of
                  cognition" (<title level="m">Aesthetic Ideology</title> 132). But this does not
                  negate Latour's larger point, that certain extremists today are perfectly willing
                  to use the very constructivist arguments utilized by the left for decades to make
                  revisionist historical and counter-factual claims. The question is how—when—does
                  the language of trope become something else; when does formalism become
                  formalization, a dislocation from within—however brief—of what de Man calls
                  aesthetic ideology? If critique for Latour has run out of steam, this may be
                  because critical reading is not attending enough today to its own tropes, even a
                  trope like steam so familiar—if in slightly revised form—to Romantic poets.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>The aesthetic for de Man is a principle of articulation, and yet in the
                  contemporary university Vonnegut imagines, there no longer are any meetings, by
                  which I think he means to lampoon the great number of meetings scheduled in
                  universities in which very little gets done. But just as there are no meetings,
                  there is no articulation. Here, the principle of articulation is the absence of
                  articulation, which can seem a form of resistance to aesthetics, but is just as
                  likely the advanced form aesthetics has adopted in late capitalism. Vonnegut
                  lampoons the university that has become a fully closed system in which the
                  aberrantly referential effects of language are foreclosed from the start by the
                  very absence of articulation. He somewhat playfully—if also
                  accidentally—anticipates Bill Reading's argument in <title level="m">The University
                     in Ruins</title>, where Readings famously argues that the corporate
                  bureaucratization of the University leads to an emerging purely formal discourse
                  of excellence empty of content: "the contemporary University of Excellence should
                  now be understood as a bureaucratic system whose internal regulation is entirely
                  self-interested" (40). "What gets taught or researched matters less than the fact
                  that it be excellently taught or researched" (13). In the contemporary University,
                  as in late capitalism, content concerns are eclipsed as purely formal structures
                  of substitution and exchange become the only defining content. Without certain
                  attempts at articulation between form and content conditioned by the aesthetic,
                  there is no chance for the occurrence of materiality, which de Man defines as the
                  passage from one conception of language to another, from a language of trope to
                  a language of performance. The absence of articulation and something like absolute
                  connectivity, a purely formal system, are indistinguishable. "Everybody's in it
                  and nobody's in it." </p>
               <p>Descriptions of Apple's new iCloud come quite close to Vonnegut's imagined

                  theories of language: "iCloud is so much more than a hard drive in the sky. It
                  makes it quick and effortless to access just about everything on the devices you
                  use every day . . . No syncing required. No management required. In fact, no

                  language from Apple come close to the purely formal language imagined by Latour in
                  "Has Critique run out of Steam" and embraced at moments by contemporary poets, who
                  develop and celebrate a fully auto-referential poetics that draws attention to the
                  materiality of language itself. Though, as Goldsmith makes clear in <title
                     level="m">Uncreative Writing</title>, there may be no way to remove expression
                  fully, as the choices made by poets more interested in uncreative than creative
                  writing mark a poetic subject even as he or she disappears; in other words, a
                  materialist poetics cannot rid itself of idealism, and an idealist poetics that
                  aspires to wander as a cloud (Wordsworth) may not be able to rid itself of
                  materialism.</p>
               <p>When Coole and Frost write that "the microscopic atom consists of a positively
                  charged nucleus surrounded by a cloudlike, three-dimensional wave of spinning
                  electrons," they mean, of course, that to be a good materialist today one need
                  take an interest in clouds. If this is true, then there may be no more materialist
                  a poet than Wordsworth, famous for beginning both of his long epic poems with
                  clouds and subjecting himself to ridicule for <title level="a">I wandered lonely
                     as a cloud.</title> Cloud computing makes possible new forms of mobility
                  embraced and supported by late capitalism. But even Wordsworth, however great his
                  ego-ideal, never went quite so far as Apple. <title level="a">I wandered lonely as
                     a cloud</title> is still a far cry from "iCloud," as the simile in Wordsworth's
                  poem makes conspicuous the figurative potential of language. There is a meeting, a
                  chance occurrence—perhaps we might call it an event—here as Wordsworth's
                  preoccupation with clouds, once perhaps read as a sign of Wordsworth's idealism—his collapsing of subject and object, his embrace of the immaterial self as it
                  disperses, colonizing a world by making it lighter—gives way to parataxis: not "I
                  . . . as a cloud" but "iCloud." </p>
               <p>Wordsworth's <title level="a">I Wandered lonely as a cloud</title>—"wandered" and
                  "lonely," in addition to "as," being key terms Apple eliminates in its rewriting
                  of the line—is still frequently lampooned precisely for its seeming embrace of its
                  own idealist position—as Wordsworth frees the poetic ego burdened on the couch to
                  dance: "my heart with pleasure fills, / And dances with the daffodils."<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wordsworth, <title level="m"

                     Commodification and Social Concern</title>, following de Man's readings of
                  Friedrich Schiller and Heinrich von Kleist in <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, that
                  dance is a common figure within aesthetic ideology for a social and political
                  model in which all works in harmony, but a harmony designed to conceal the violence
                  that makes it possible. While Wordsworth's poem is often read "as a standard
                  expression of Romantic pantheism" (168), Simpson argues that Wordsworth's dancing
                  daffodils anticipate Karl Marx's dancing table, Marx's figure for the commodity in
                     <title level="m">Capital</title>. In becoming a commodity, the table "changes
                     into a thing which transcends sensuousness while remaining sensible."<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Simpson 156. For the full Marx
                     quote, see <title level="m">Capital</title> p. 163.</note> The table-as-commodity becomes ghostly, a "sensible-supersensible" thing (Simpson 156). In the
                  poem Wordsworth gives himself vaporous form, but in giving himself vaporous form he
                  both transcends the material world and stages the becoming-commodity of ghostly
                  things, even the becoming-commodity of ghostly things like poets and poems. </p>
               <p> Capitalism and commodity form are built on the same power of exchange and so structured by the
                  figurative potential of language even as this structure is disguised. Similarly, a
                  post-industrial knowledge economy is built on a worker's ability to "wander"
                  "lonely" even as the very chance for wandering is foreclosed, as the cloud follows
                  one wherever one goes. The somewhat accidental articulation of Wordsworth's poem
                  and Apple's iCloud helps make visible the degree to which late capitalism
                  disguises its own figurative structure even as it becomes ubiquitous. As all
                  things become increasingly "exchangeable," the system becomes more purely formal;
                  the apparent absence of figurative language (iCloud as compared to "as a Cloud")
                  becomes an ideal as the rhetorical structures disappear from view. One can think about
                  this structure in slightly different terms: iCloud (and cloud computing more
                  generally) makes possible absolute connectivity, mobility, and flexibility while
                  disguising the basic material structures that make connection, mobility, and
                  flexibility possible. In a recent report written by Gary Cook and Jodie Van Horn
                  and published by Greenpeace on the energy use of data centers in the United States
                  and their carbon footprint, the "cloud" is described as IT's biggest innovation
                  and disruption in recent years. The authors explain: "Cloud computing is
                  converting our work, finances, health and relationships into invisible data,
                  centralized in out-of-the-way storage facilities or data centers. . . . In the US,
                  which hosts approximately 40% of the world's data center servers, it is estimated
                  that server farms consume close to 3% of the national power supply" (4). "Apple's
                  new $1bn US dollar 'iData Center' in North Carolina, necessary for iCloud, is
                  estimated to require as much as 100MW of power, equivalent to about 80,000 US
                  homes or 250,000 EU homes" (12). Making data invisible, in other words, requires a
                  lot of energy, made visible by the increased consumption of coal and nuclear energy
                  and the material effects of such consumption. While Apple has plans to build a
                  solar farm near their iData Center, the energy required to run server banks is
                  increasing in the United States by 12% a year.</p>
               <p>Echoing Boltanski and Chiapello, Alan Liu in <title level="m">The Laws of Cool:
                     Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information</title> explores the subtly
                  destructive effects of a late capitalism that privileges a worker's ability to
                  wander with the help of a cloud that promotes new forms of creative knowledge
                  work. Mobility and flexibility are now a source, suggests Liu, for new anxieties
                  as "global competition legitimates restructuring, downsizing, outsourcing, and the
                  replacement of career workers with permatemps—the social law of a new nomadism"
                  (292). In a postindustrial sociality, "'lifelong learning' demands perpetual
                  reeducation at 'Internet speed,' but bodily, family, community, ethnic, gender,
                  and other duties of everyday life pose an incalculably great counter-demand that
                  makes it almost impossible, for instance, to study at night" (293-294). One must
                  remain always mobile, flexible, and connected else one will lose touch with the "cool"
                  and find oneself replaced, exchanged. Absolute mobility, which is pitched as
                  freedom to roam or surf, increases insecurity and insecurity is the oldest way to
                  keep one from thinking or criticizing. The cloud does all the thinking for
                  everybody.</p>
               <p><title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title> is perhaps a poem about
                  removing oneself from the discomfort of the material world through the power of
                  imagination: "For oft, when on my couch I lie / In vacant or in pensive mood, /
                  They [the daffodils] flash upon that inward eye" (ll. 19-21). The couch is now
                  such a powerful figure for emotional disquiet on the one hand and general apathy
                  on the other. Instead of getting off the couch, one might argue, Wordsworth finds
                  a way to live there happily. If so, then Wordsworth's poem and the idealist
                  position it advances can easily be read as contributing to a work ethic that cloud
                  computing fully realizes. One no longer needs to leave the couch to work all of the
                  time. And for this reason, contemporary poetry's distrust of the lyric ego, legible
                  through its turn toward the materiality of the letter, offers some resistance to an
                  aesthetic ideology that displaces material life. </p>
               <p>But what Wordsworth's presumed idealism—his collapsing of subject and
                  object—cannot have controlled is itself newly legible with the insistent presence
                  of "as," the conspicuous use of figure now removed from Apple's rewriting of the
                  poem's first line: "iCloud / That floats on high o'er hills and vales." The
                  process of articulation that names aesthetics has become the absence of
                  articulation as Wordsworth's conspicuous use of figure disappears. In this way
                  late capitalism sells us back Wordsworth's dream as the imagined disarticulation
                  of Wordsworth's dream. Whichever way one chooses, one cannot miss one's way. If
                  the aesthetics of late capitalism now includes the elimination of figure (figured
                  here by iCloud as compared to "I . . . as a cloud"), an elimination of figure
                  because there is nothing but figure—all parts are interchangeable—then
                  paradoxically, it is now Wordsworth's simile that stubbornly remains immobile.
                  Perhaps there's a chance for materialism even if it is indistinguishable from
                  idealism. Wordsworth, of course, never leaves the couch—at least not within the
                  world the lyric imagines—but what the insistence of "as" makes legible—and this
                  might be the simplest if also the most pun-ny way to put it by way of conclusion—Wordsworth is unwilling to work his "as" off. What we have not yet come to terms
                  with are the ways that the absolutely formal system of late capitalism—one that
                  advances absolute mobility and interchangeability—needs, somewhat paradoxically,
                  to eliminate the very figurative potential of language it seems structured by.</p>
