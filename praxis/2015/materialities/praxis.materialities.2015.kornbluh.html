            <p>Though Karl Marx stands an irrefutable and even obligatory touchstone in most trajectories
               of materialism, his historical materialist analysis of capital proceeds by way of
               a number of formulations that subsequent Marxists would, and do, critique as idealist:
               conceiving labor as a differential substance that “is more than it has” and that marks
               the human’s distinction from animals (or, at least, from “bees” as the example goes)
               by virtue of its ineluctably ideational aspect; conceiving capital as “illusory, but
               (with) its own laws of motion for all that”; conceiving value as “in reality impossible”;
               and conceiving capitalism as a mode of production that is simultaneously a metaphysical
               system. As our present financial crisis has prompted various returns to Marx, particularly
               to his theory of fictitious capital, this entwining of the material and the ideal
               once again demands critical attention. This paper focuses on a few signal moments
               when thinking capitalism requires a materialism merged with its other – moments when
               it is a necessity, rather than a weakness, for Marxian materialism to have been something
               more multifaceted than we epigones generally avow.</p>

                     present global financial crisis that we are all materialists now. In the advertising
                     campaigns for Detroit automakers ("this was once a country where people made things")
                     and in the liberal left political discourse of Naomi Klein, Joseph Stiglitz, and others
                     (finance is "entirely divorced from the real economy"), a hard line inscribes itself

                     that line? He apparently judges "the material" to be "the means of subsistence" in
                     human society ('land, bread, housing' and labor), and rules everything else out of
                     bounds.

                  <p>Unsurprisingly, in our present crisis it is to Marx's writings on "fictitious capital"
                     that political economists, cultural theorists, and even the mainstream media have
                     frequently turned when they desire to contrast "the material basis" of value (as David
                     Harvey puts it) and mere "claims or titles" of value (95).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Harvey frequently defines "fictitious capital" in contrast to the "material," as in
                              "money that is thrown into circulation as capital without any material basis in commodities
                              or productive activity" (95). Marx's discussion of fictitious capital in Volume 3,
                              Chapters 25 and 29 makes no such distinction, focusing instead on the specificity
                              of the "titular" quality of the "claims to value" made by financial instruments, in
                              connection with the claims to value made by the process of commodity exchange.</span></div>
                     </div> From the Latin <span class="foreign">fingere</span>: to form or feign, "fictitious" in "fictitious capital" indexes the putative opposite
                     of Harvey's "material basis": immaterial superstructural representation. For the materialism
                     that founds this particular critique of finance, industrial bodies that matter clash
                     with financial figures that don't, and we'd all be better off if we could just banish
                     those pesky representations.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Whatever the political benefits of such a "strategic materialism" (and I don't dispute
                  that there are some), my modest proposal here is that it ought not be attributed to
                  Marx. Precisely in the theory of fictitious capital, I argue, the Marxian <span class="foreign">oeuvre</span> problematizes any materialism that would exclude representation from the material
                  realm. In seeking to account for capitalism, but also (one wagers) in materialisms
                  beyond that accounting, Marx repeatedly grapples with representation that materializes
                  itself. His discussion of fictitious capital pivots on this uncanny mediation, recapitulating
                  a problematic which repeatedly recurs across his writing—in interpreting finance,
                  fetishism, valorized exchange, labor, and even the natural world: a strange materiality
                  whose existence is unaccountable in terms of previously available matter, a material
                  that dynamically mediates itself into existence.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In Romanticist circles, this mediation is likely more recognizable under the sign
                     of "positing power" or "force." As those signs direct, one could arrive at this modest
                     proposal by reading Marx with Paul de Man and/or Jacques Derrida—and indeed, crucial
                     arguments by Jennifer Bajorek, J. Hillis Miller, and Werner Hamacher have formidably
                     educed the resonances between Marx's materialism and a materialism of language.

                     texts alongside the archive of Victorian financial journalism he extensively drew
                     upon. In that archive, which chronicled the financial revolution's rapid legalization
                     of the institutions and instruments of finance such as the corporate person and derivatives,
                     financial reporters continually formulated the enigmatic materiality of finance and
                     queried the metaphysics of "fictitious capital." Citing this journalism at length,
                     Marx's discourse attempts to educe the systematic consequences of this phenomenon.</p>

                     in what would become a chain of constantly recurring large-scale financial crises,
                     in 1837, 1839, 1847, 1857, 1866, 1873, and 1878. In every mainstream publication—from <em>The Morning Chronicle</em> (the most prominent daily) to Charles Dickens's <em>Household Words</em> to <em>The Economist</em>—these crises were explicitly attributed to the strange matter of fictitious capital.

                  <p>In the passages of <em>Capital</em> Volume 3 that are, even in their obscurity, more familiar to us than this Victorian
                     discourse, Marx denominates fictitious capital as "interest," "claims" to future interest,
                     "the mother of all insane forms" (when "a debt, for example, appears in the mind of
                     a banker as a commodity"—read here "mortgage backed securities"), "self-propelling
                     value," the "majority […] component of banker's capital" and, above all, an "illusion
                     […] purely illusory" (<em>Capital</em> vol. 3, ch. 29). An illusion with many material modes of appearance, fictitious capital
                     in the Victorian press meant above all else a representation of wealth that could
                     itself beget wealth, a simulation that could, in their idiom, "realize capital."

                              by contrast, connotes the conversion of land into money, the conversion of assets,
                              whether "real" estate or virtual futures, into the realer real of capital.</span></div>

                     peculiarity of the London Stock Exchange created the conditions for this precipitation
                     of value by feint. After the corporation was legalized in 1825, all Victorian corporations
                     conducted IPOs before they commenced operations, utilizing the public stock market
                     as their venture capital forum.

                     bill would come due only on a bimonthly "Accounting Day." If, by the time of the Accounting
                     Day, the price of the company's share had risen—either due to hype about subscriptions
                     or to the availability of new information—an investor could "realize" a profit by
                     immediately turning over his shares without settling for his subscription.

                     figuration in which stock certificates function as "the representative of a representative

                     within poetry in the general sense ("<span class="foreign">poiesis</span> means simply creation...any action which is the cause of a thing emerging from non-existence
                     into existence"), it is hard to argue that the poetry of banking is the only poetic

                     the general sense; making out of illusion is the condition of all human making: <span class="quote">‘Labor is, first of all, a process between man and nature, a process by which man mediates...We
                        understand labor in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts
                        operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect
                        in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from
                        the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before
                        he erects it in reality. At the end of every labor-process, we get a result that already
                        existed in the imagination of the laborer at its commencement. He not only effects
                        a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose
                        of his own. (<em>Capital</em> vol. 1, ch. 7, sec. 1, 284)’</span> While the bee fulfills needs by changing the form of natural materials, man forms
                     an idea, an imaginative projection, of both needs and their fulfillment. Labor for
                     Marx, Bajorek notes, must thus be defined as the mediation of material and ideal (48).
                     Crucial affinities therefore entwine labor and language (especially language conceived
                     of as inherently imaginative)—which is why, in defining human nature, Marx lit upon
                     Milton: "Milton produced <em>Paradise Lost</em> in the same way that a silkworm produces silk, as the activation of his own nature"
                     (1044).

                     is, whether there is a distinctive historical moment of fictitious capital from which
                     we might find it politically desirable to regress. When Marx first introduces fictitious
                     capital in his writings, he does so by quoting a report to Parliament in which officials
                     warn of the "dangerous expansion" of an "enormous superstructure" (Marx inserts an
                     exclamation mark here) of credit atop a "base" of the Bank of England's monetary reserve,
                     finding that the gross economic output was not only one in which credit exchanges
                     had vastly exceeded cash transactions, but one in which the volume of credit transactions
                     undertaken to settle other credit transactions amounted to a situation in which "it
                     is impossible to decide what arises out of real, bona fide transactions, or what part
                     is fictitious" (Leatham 44).

                     a series of quotes from the financial press and from economic history texts that,
                     in their very definitions of ostensibly more legitimate, more collateralized forms
                     of credit, render credit as such indistinguishable from fictitious credit. In economic
                     discourse itself, his assemblage punctuates, it is impossible to decide on the line
                     between real and fictitious capital.</p>

                  <p>For Marx, this impossible indeterminacy indicates precisely that something within
                     all capital is fictitious, that capitalist exchange is ontologically unstable, logically
                     ungrounded. From the opening pages of <em>Capital</em>, it is clear that speculation occurs long before the advent of the stock market and
                     futures contracts: it takes place as soon as any exchange of goods is mediated by
                     the abstraction "value." Value hypostasizes the commensurability of two qualitatively
                     different goods, in two different spatio-temporal situations—a commensurability that
                     Marx underscores is "in reality impossible" (<span class="foreign">in Wahrheit unmöglich</span>) (<em>Capital</em> vol. 1, 151). The idea of value overcomes this impossibility by providing a "makeshift"
                     (<span class="foreign">Notbehelf</span>) an image that Marx designates "foreign to the true nature of things" (<span class="foreign">etwas der wahren Natur der Dinge Fremdes</span>). In overcoming impossibility and mediating "true nature," valorization surges into
                     actuality, wreaking foreignness in its wake. Not just finance, but every act of valorized
                     exchange entails this lurching effectivity—this precipitous makeshifting from material
                     to immaterial and back again—which Marx repeatedly designates with verbs of "jerking,"
                     "hurling," "flinging," and "throwing"—going so far as to define the drive momentum
                     of capital accumulation as a "glitching circuit" (<span class="foreign">fehlerhaften Kreislauf</span>) (<em>Capital</em> 873). He also likes the noun "leap"—when money comes to stand for value and becomes
                     the third party in exchange, commodities make a "mortal leap" (<span class="foreign">salto mortale</span>) into the body of money; when the argument in <em>Capital</em> reaches insurmountable paradoxes it makes a leap to start anew (<span class="foreign">Hic Rhodus, hic salta</span>!), and also when nature materializes itself, as in the passage from the <span class="foreign">Anti-Duhring</span> (<em>Capital</em> 200, 260).

                     "makeshift" (<em>Theories</em> 453). Fictitious capital comprises not only naked short sales and collateralized debt
                     obligations, but stock, credit, money, and value itself. For this reason, we must
                     rigorously refrain from romanticizing the non-fictitious "reality" of earlier capitalism
                     when talking about finance: although empirically speaking, the world of the past did

                  individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organization of
                  these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature...Men can be

                  They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they being
                  to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical

               "money that is thrown into circulation as capital without any material basis in commodities
               or productive activity" (95). Marx's discussion of fictitious capital in Volume 3,
               Chapters 25 and 29 makes no such distinction, focusing instead on the specificity
               of the "titular" quality of the "claims to value" made by financial instruments, in
               connection with the claims to value made by the process of commodity exchange.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
