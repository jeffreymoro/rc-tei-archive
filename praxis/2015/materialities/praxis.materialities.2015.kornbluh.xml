         <div type="abstract">
            <p>Though Karl Marx stands an irrefutable and even obligatory
                  touchstone in most trajectories of materialism, his historical materialist
                  analysis of capital proceeds by way of a number of formulations that subsequent
                  Marxists would, and do, critique as idealist: conceiving labor as a differential
                  substance that “is more than it has” and that marks the human’s distinction from
                  animals (or, at least, from “bees” as the example goes) by virtue of its
                  ineluctably ideational aspect; conceiving capital as “illusory, but (with) its own
                  laws of motion for all that”; conceiving value as “in reality impossible”; and
                  conceiving capitalism as a mode of production that is simultaneously a
                  metaphysical system. As our present financial crisis has prompted various returns
                  to Marx, particularly to his theory of fictitious capital, this entwining of the
                  material and the ideal once again demands critical attention. This paper focuses
                  on a few signal moments when thinking capitalism requires a materialism merged
                  with its other – moments when it is a necessity, rather than a weakness, for
                  Marxian materialism to have been something more multifaceted than we epigones
                  generally avow.</p>

               <p>Along with zombie banks and toxic assets, it is apparently so much fallout of the
                  present global financial crisis that we are all materialists now. In the
                  advertising campaigns for Detroit automakers ("this was once a country where
                  people made things") and in the liberal left political discourse of Naomi Klein,
                  Joseph Stiglitz, and others (finance is "entirely divorced from the real
                  economy"), a hard line inscribes itself between "things" and finance, Jeep Grand
                  Cherokee and Credit Default Swaps.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Chrysler

                  to be a materialist line—a line contouring the real and cordoning the unreal,
                  severing the sensuous from the imaginative, the raw material from the cooked
                  ideal. And who better than Karl Marx could serve as the foremost referee of that
                  line? He apparently judges "the material" to be "the means of subsistence" in
                  human society ('land, bread, housing' and labor), and rules everything else out of
                     bounds.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Karl Marx, <title level="a">First

                        all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals.
                        Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organization of these
                        individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature...Men can be
                        distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion, or anything else
                        you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as
                        soon as they being to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is
                        conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of
                        subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material
                     life.</quote></note>
               </p>
               <p>Unsurprisingly, in our present crisis it is to Marx's writings on "fictitious
                  capital" that political economists, cultural theorists, and even the mainstream
                  media have frequently turned when they desire to contrast "the material basis" of
                  value (as David Harvey puts it) and mere "claims or titles" of value (95).<note
                     place="foot" resp="editors">Harvey frequently defines "fictitious capital" in
                     contrast to the "material," as in "money that is thrown into circulation as
                     capital without any material basis in commodities or productive activity" (95).
                     Marx's discussion of fictitious capital in Volume 3, Chapters 25 and 29 makes
                     no such distinction, focusing instead on the specificity of the "titular"
                     quality of the "claims to value" made by financial instruments, in connection
                     with the claims to value made by the process of commodity exchange.</note> From
                  the Latin <foreign>fingere</foreign>: to form or feign, "fictitious" in
                  "fictitious capital" indexes the putative opposite of Harvey's "material basis":
                  immaterial superstructural representation. For the materialism that founds this
                  particular critique of finance, industrial bodies that matter clash with financial
                  figures that don't, and we'd all be better off if we could just banish those pesky
                  representations. </p>
               <p>Whatever the political benefits of such a "strategic materialism" (and I don't
                  dispute that there are some), my modest proposal here is that it ought not be
                  attributed to Marx. Precisely in the theory of fictitious capital, I argue, the
                  Marxian <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> problematizes any materialism that would exclude
                  representation from the material realm. In seeking to account for capitalism, but
                  also (one wagers) in materialisms beyond that accounting, Marx repeatedly grapples
                  with representation that materializes itself. His discussion of fictitious capital
                  pivots on this uncanny mediation, recapitulating a problematic which repeatedly
                  recurs across his writing—in interpreting finance, fetishism, valorized exchange,
                  labor, and even the natural world: a strange materiality whose existence is
                  unaccountable in terms of previously available matter, a material that dynamically
                  mediates itself into existence. </p>
               <p>In Romanticist circles, this mediation is likely more recognizable under the sign
                  of "positing power" or "force." As those signs direct, one could arrive at this
                  modest proposal by reading Marx with Paul de Man and/or Jacques Derrida—and
                  indeed, crucial arguments by Jennifer Bajorek, J. Hillis Miller, and Werner
                  Hamacher have formidably educed the resonances between Marx's materialism and a
                  materialism of language.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Bajorek; Miller;

                  I take in this essay is a more mundanely materialist one: reading Marx's texts
                  alongside the archive of Victorian financial journalism he extensively drew upon.
                  In that archive, which chronicled the financial revolution's rapid legalization of
                  the institutions and instruments of finance such as the corporate person and
                  derivatives, financial reporters continually formulated the enigmatic materiality
                  of finance and queried the metaphysics of "fictitious capital." Citing this
                  journalism at length, Marx's discourse attempts to educe the systematic
                  consequences of this phenomenon. </p>
               <p>By the time Marx settled in London in 1848, the Victorians had endured the first
                  two in what would become a chain of constantly recurring large-scale financial
                  crises, in 1837, 1839, 1847, 1857, 1866, 1873, and 1878. In every mainstream
                  publication—from <title level="j">The Morning Chronicle</title> (the most
                  prominent daily) to Charles Dickens's <title level="j">Household Words</title> to
                     <title level="j">The Economist</title>—these crises were explicitly attributed
                  to the strange matter of fictitious capital.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For

                  daily bread, littering his desk at the British Library, to which he had applied
                  for membership immediately upon settling in London, and where his very first order
                  of business was to read all the extant back issues of <title level="j">The

               <p>In the passages of <title level="m">Capital</title> Volume 3 that are, even in
                  their obscurity, more familiar to us than this Victorian discourse, Marx
                  denominates fictitious capital as "interest," "claims" to future interest, "the
                  mother of all insane forms" (when "a debt, for example, appears in the mind of a
                  banker as a commodity"—read here "mortgage backed securities"), "self-propelling
                  value," the "majority […] component of banker's capital" and, above all, an
                  "illusion […] purely illusory" (<title level="m">Capital</title> vol. 3, ch. 29).
                  An illusion with many material modes of appearance, fictitious capital in the
                  Victorian press meant above all else a representation of wealth that could itself
                  beget wealth, a simulation that could, in their idiom, "realize capital."<note
                     place="foot" resp="editors">According to Dr. Johnson's dictionary, when
                     "realize" first came into financial usage in the eighteenth century, it meant
                     "to convert money into land." The Victorian usage, by contrast, connotes the
                     conversion of land into money, the conversion of assets, whether "real" estate
                     or virtual futures, into the realer real of capital.</note> As critical
                  expository pieces in that era's press were keen to uncover, a crucial peculiarity
                  of the London Stock Exchange created the conditions for this precipitation of
                  value by feint. After the corporation was legalized in 1825, all Victorian
                  corporations conducted IPOs before they commenced operations, utilizing the public
                  stock market as their venture capital forum.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For
                     a history of the corporation in England, see Alborn.</note> If an entrepreneur
                  wanted to launch a business, he would assemble a corporate board and offer shares
                  in the business on the prospect that eventually the business would indeed
                  operate/construct/manufacture, etc. These shares would be sold to the public, who
                  would not pay in cash, but rather in the form of a promise—a "subscription" whose
                  bill would come due only on a bimonthly "Accounting Day." If, by the time of the
                  Accounting Day, the price of the company's share had risen—either due to hype
                  about subscriptions or to the availability of new information—an investor could
                  "realize" a profit by immediately turning over his shares without settling for his
                     subscription.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For exemplary expository essays

                  only moment in the process at which money changed hands, the reality of the profit
                  obtaining in a different register than shareholder dividends, since the companies
                  did not exist, and different too from exploitation, since no labor had been
                  performed. "Fictitious capital" thus signifies the differential reality of
                  promises (the prospectus, the subscription) that profit (creating a new state of
                  affairs, the actual money), speech acts whose eccentric felicity we could deem
                  "material events."<note place="foot" resp="editors">On promises that create new

                  figuration in which stock certificates function as "the representative of a
                  representative of a representative," but let us simply quote one: <quote>many of
                     the objects and events of {banking} are in their nature highly poetic. Like
                     Moliere's character who had been speaking prose for forty years without knowing
                     it, we talk, and think, and act poetry, without being at all conscious of the

                  us, poetry is the medium of financial life, the essence of the financial mode of
                  production—making things with words. But just as poetry in the restricted
                  sense—representations of representation, derivative and devoid of being—is
                  enveloped within poetry in the general sense ("<foreign>poiesis</foreign> means
                  simply creation...any action which is the cause of a thing emerging from

                  </quote> As a kind of representation that makes a claim to value—a claim to
                  represent an abstraction that lacks ontological positivity—money contrives to
                  effectuate the concrete existence of that abstract substance. Such a contrivance
                  is aligned not with language in its quotidian or referential function, but with
                  language in its defamiliarizing tropological character. </p>
               <p>Even more fundamentally—logically prior to the valorization of labor by
                  money—labor itself, Marx's formulations suggest, is already bound up with this
                  same foreign representation. The restricted sense of poiesis is not the exception,
                  but rather the archetype of the general sense; making out of illusion is the
                  condition of all human making: <quote>Labor is, first of all, a process between
                     man and nature, a process by which man mediates...We understand labor in a form
                     that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble
                     those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the
                     construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the
                     best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination
                     before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labor-process, we get a
                     result that already existed in the imagination of the laborer at its
                     commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he
                     works, but he also realises a purpose of his own. (<title level="m"
                        >Capital</title> vol. 1, ch. 7, sec. 1, 284) </quote> While the bee fulfills
                  needs by changing the form of natural materials, man forms an idea, an imaginative
                  projection, of both needs and their fulfillment. Labor for Marx, Bajorek notes,
                  must thus be defined as the mediation of material and ideal (48). Crucial
                  affinities therefore entwine labor and language (especially language conceived of
                  as inherently imaginative)—which is why, in defining human nature, Marx lit upon
                  Milton: "Milton produced <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> in the same way
                  that a silkworm produces silk, as the activation of his own nature" (1044).<note

               <p>This dynamism of natural making also underlies Marx's thought about the raw
                  material of nature. In his letters to Engels for almost a decade, which prompted
                  Engels's composition of the <foreign>Anti-Duhring</foreign>, Marx conceived nature
                  as perhaps the foundational instance of strange matter, theorizing the "leap" by
                  which "a transition is made from the realm of non-sensation to the realm of
                  sensation" when nature materializes itself, and regularly using the term

               <p>If you have followed the silkworm's thread down this rabbit hole in which even the
                  most immediate referent for "material" is itself riven by speculative enigmas, we
                  can return again to the question of whether banking is the only poetic phase of
                  capital—that is, whether there is a distinctive historical moment of fictitious
                  capital from which we might find it politically desirable to regress. When Marx
                  first introduces fictitious capital in his writings, he does so by quoting a
                  report to Parliament in which officials warn of the "dangerous expansion" of an
                  "enormous superstructure" (Marx inserts an exclamation mark here) of credit atop a
                  "base" of the Bank of England's monetary reserve, finding that the gross economic
                  output was not only one in which credit exchanges had vastly exceeded cash
                  transactions, but one in which the volume of credit transactions undertaken to
                  settle other credit transactions amounted to a situation in which "it is
                  impossible to decide what arises out of real, bona fide transactions, or what part
                  is fictitious" (Leatham 44). <note place="foot" resp="editors">The report was
                     published in 1840 by Leatham.</note> "Fictitious" thus from the beginning
                  bespeaks not the opposite of the real, but its indistinguishable twin. Indeed,
                  Marx's chapter on <title level="a">Credit and Fictitious Capital</title> stresses
                  the additive rather than adversative function of the copula "and"—he assembles a
                  series of quotes from the financial press and from economic history texts that, in
                  their very definitions of ostensibly more legitimate, more collateralized forms of
                  credit, render credit as such indistinguishable from fictitious credit. In
                  economic discourse itself, his assemblage punctuates, it is impossible to decide
                  on the line between real and fictitious capital.</p>
               <p>For Marx, this impossible indeterminacy indicates precisely that something within
                  all capital is fictitious, that capitalist exchange is ontologically unstable,
                  logically ungrounded. From the opening pages of <title level="m">Capital</title>,
                  it is clear that speculation occurs long before the advent of the stock market and
                  futures contracts: it takes place as soon as any exchange of goods is mediated by
                  the abstraction "value." Value hypostasizes the commensurability of two
                  qualitatively different goods, in two different spatio-temporal situations—a
                  commensurability that Marx underscores is "in reality impossible" (<foreign>in
                     Wahrheit unmöglich</foreign>) (<title level="m">Capital</title> vol. 1, 151).
                  The idea of value overcomes this impossibility by providing a "makeshift"
                     (<foreign>Notbehelf</foreign>) an image that Marx designates "foreign to the
                  true nature of things" (<foreign>etwas der wahren Natur der Dinge
                     Fremdes</foreign>). In overcoming impossibility and mediating "true nature,"
                  valorization surges into actuality, wreaking foreignness in its wake. Not just
                  finance, but every act of valorized exchange entails this lurching
                  effectivity—this precipitous makeshifting from material to immaterial and back
                  again—which Marx repeatedly designates with verbs of "jerking," "hurling,"
                  "flinging," and "throwing"—going so far as to define the drive momentum of capital
                  accumulation as a "glitching circuit" (<foreign>fehlerhaften Kreislauf</foreign>)
                     (<title level="m">Capital</title> 873). He also likes the noun "leap"—when
                  money comes to stand for value and becomes the third party in exchange,
                  commodities make a "mortal leap" (<foreign>salto mortale</foreign>) into the body
                  of money; when the argument in <title level="m">Capital</title> reaches
                  insurmountable paradoxes it makes a leap to start anew (<foreign>Hic Rhodus, hic
                     salta</foreign>!), and also when nature materializes itself, as in the passage
                  from the <foreign>Anti-Duhring</foreign> (<title level="m">Capital</title> 200,
                     260).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also <title level="m">Contribution
                        to the Critique of Political Economy</title>. </note> A consistent Marxian
                  motif (which Kiarina Kordela argues to be understood as Spinozan "immanent
                  causality") is this notion of that which does not exist but in its effects defines
                  every moment of capital, from mediated value to hedged futures (<title level="m"
                     >Surplus</title>). Thus Marx's strongest assertion about fictitious capital
                  formalizes the phenomenon he has been tracing all along: "fictitious capital
                  is...purely illusory, yet it has its own laws of motion for all that"
                     (<foreign>seine eigne Bewegung</foreign>) (vol. 3, ch. 29, 596). </p>
               <p>As he repeatedly limns the strange material events of self-positing
                  performativity, Marx broaches the insight that all capital is galvanized by the
                  leap which fictitious capital perfects, prompting his denomination of fictitious
                  capital "the most complete fetish" in its consummation of the fetishism of
                  commodities and the fetishism of the "makeshift" (<title level="m"
                     >Theories</title> 453). Fictitious capital comprises not only naked short sales
                  and collateralized debt obligations, but stock, credit, money, and value itself.
                  For this reason, we must rigorously refrain from romanticizing the non-fictitious
                  "reality" of earlier capitalism when talking about finance: although empirically
                  speaking, the world of the past did not <emph>fully</emph> concretize the
                  universal structure of capital, structurally speaking, this fictitious virtuosity
                  has always been with us.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This contrast between
                     empirical and structural is a variation on that between phenomenological and
                     transcendental that Kordela makes apropos capital's virtuality. <title
                        level="a">Marx's Update of Cultural Theory,</title> 45</note> The
                  materialism we could name Marxian is thus not the tired arrest of speculative
                  velocity by kissing the ground, embracing a substance—for that would be
                  materialism made ideal. It is rather a "materialism without matter"—what Marx
                  called the "ruthless criticism of everything existing": the relentless analysis of
                  the material events by which capital posits its own preconditions while poetry
                  makes the world, and of the mediations that might one day unbind the two.<note
