               from these later writings a concept of translation that might be of particular relevance

                  <p>Without doubt one of the most incisive critical inquiries into (post-)Romantic notions
                     of materiality to date was pursued in Paul de Man's later essays on aesthetic ideology,
                     and more particularly in the Messenger Lectures he delivered at Cornell in 1983. In
                     a parenthetical remark in his <em>Mémoires: for Paul de Man</em>, Jacques Derrida located in de Man's work an "original materialism" that precedes
                     "the metaphysical oppositions in which the concept of matter and materialist theories
                     are generally inscribed": <span class="quote">‘([...] There is a theme of "materiality," indeed an original materialism in de Man.
                        It concerns a "matter" which does not fit the classical philosophical definitions
                        of metaphysical materialisms any more than the sensible representations or the images
                        of matter defined by the opposition between the sensible and the intelligible. Matter,
                        a matter without presence and without substance, is what resists these oppositions.
                        [...] Matter of this sort, "older" than the metaphysical oppositions in which the
                        concept of matter and materialist theories are generally inscribed, is, we might say,
                        "in memory" of what precedes these oppositions. But by this very fact [...] it retains
                        an essential relation with fiction, figurality, rhetoricity. <em>Matière et Mémoire</em> is the title I could have given to this long parenthesis [...]). (52-53)’</span> Later in the <em>Mémoires</em> Derrida adds that "[o]ne cannot understand this privileging of allegory –I was long
                     puzzled by it for thus very reason—if one is not familiar with the internal debates
                     of Anglo-American criticism concerning Romanticism" (77). Driven by the desire to
                     locate a "sort of affirmative thought" (66) in de Man's relentless rhetorical reading,
                     Derrida parenthetically puts the notion of materiality at the center of his reading
                     of de Man's analysis of G.F.W. Hegel in 
                     “Sign and Symbol in Hegel's <em>Aesthetics</em>”
                      (1982), and briefly allows the Anglo-American Romantic critical tradition to enter
                     his argument when he turns to de Man's comments on Coleridge in 
                     “The Rhetoric of Temporality”
                      (1969). In the questions that conclude his lecture, Derrida marks "a kind of spacing,
                     a gap that is not contradiction" (85) between both essays and their respective analyses
                     of allegory and irony. Without entering into the complex questions of the relation
                     between de Man's early and later writings (and between de Man and Derrida, for that
                     matter),

                     of this fragmented reception is the systematic isolation of the famous concluding

                              see Martin McQuillan's Paul de Man. Within the field of translation studies, de Man
                              mainly figures, with Derrida, as an example of deconstructionist appropriation of
                              Benjamin. As has been noted by Eve Tavor Bennet and Kevin Attell, however, their respective
                              readings do diverge on decisive points. An interesting new development in the essay's
                              reception was the recent publication of Theory and the Disappearing Future: On de
                              Man, On Benjamin, containing a transcript (and facsimile print) of de Man's handwritten…</span></div>
                     </div> Restoring de Man's reading of Benjamin to its original context of the Messenger Lectures,
                     I argue, allows for a more accurate analysis of the proximity of his critique of translation
                     to the notion of materiality introduced in his reading of Immanuel Kant's <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, which constitutes the central event of the lecture series. This closer analysis,
                     moreover, refers de Man's later writings back to the British Romantic tradition, more
                     specifically to the initial forging of an English critical idiom in the translation
                     of German Idealist philosophy by, among others, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas
                     Carlyle. As an elaborate analysis of the latter by far exceeds the limitations of
                     this essay, my aim here is to prepare the ground for such a return to British Romantic
                     aesthetic theory through de Man by means of a close reading of the latter's critique
                     of translation. In a coda, I will briefly sketch the form that such a re-entry into
                     the rhetorical complexity of the <em>Biographia Literaria</em> and <em>Sartor Resartus</em> in terms of materiality and translation can take.</p>

                  <p>Although, as Rodolphe Gasché has noted, translation already figures in <em>Allegories of Reading</em> as referring both to the totalizing drive of metaphor and its disarticulation in rhetorical
                     reading,

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In fact, Gasché's review of Allegories of Reading highlights the intricate proliferation
                              of the issue of translation as a process including de Man's own critical praxis into
                              a dynamic of translation, re-translation, and de-translation, characterizing de Man's
                              rhetorical readings as "retranslations" that are "de-translations, i.e. operations
                              by means of which the static and closed off instances of totality are referred back
                              to the 'original' mechanics of the text" (49). Although it is certainly an essential
                              part of further inquiry into the issue of translation in de Man's writings, the inclusio…</span></div>
                     </div> it is in 
                     “Conclusions: Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'”
                      that de Man most directly addresses the issue of translation as a concrete process
                     that allows him to reconfigure the terms of his rhetorical critique of Romantic aesthetics.
                     De Man's turn to translation in the essay in fact concludes an elaborate argument
                     developed over six lectures, the main theme of which was announced in the opening
                     lecture on 
                     “Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric”
                      as "the major crux of all critical philosophies and 'Romantic' literatures," i.e.
                     "the continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment" (239) or "the seamless articulation,
                     by way of language, of sensory and aesthetic experience with the intellectual assurance
                     of affirmation" (244). From rhetorical readings of Charles Baudelaire and Heinrich
                     von Kleist, the lecture series progresses to a discussion of the Hegelian sublime,
                     to the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in Kant and its humanistic
                     recuperation recuperation in Friedrich Schiller, so as to finally arrive at a reading
                     of Benjamin's comments on translation in his famous preface to his own translation
                     of Baudelaire's 
                     “Tableaux Parisiens.”
                      Baudelaire is not the only element endowing the Messenger Lectures with a certain
                     circularity, as they are structured as a series of disarticulations of received notions
                     of the aesthetic, ideology, history, and translation that center on the notion of
                     materiality introduced halfway through the lecture series in 
                     “Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant.”
                     </p>
               </div>
               <p>In 
                  “Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant,”
                  de Man locates "a deep, perhaps fatal, break or discontinuity" (79) at the center
                  of the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>. In the concluding section of the analytics of the sublime, at the moment when one
                  would have expected the emergence of "a phenomenalized, empirically manifest principle"
                  that would provide the necessary causal link between "a purely conceptual and an empirically
                  determined discourse" (73) that would ultimately guarantee the architectonic unity
                  of Kant's transcendental philosophy, sublime vision ends up as "purely material" and
                  "purely formal, devoid of any semantic depth and reducible to the formal mathematization
                  or geometrization of pure optics." This formal materialism "runs counter to all values
                  and characteristics associated with aesthetic experience" (83) and, as de Man discusses
                  at length in the fifth lecture on 
                  “Kant and Schiller,”
                  has been overlooked and reinscribed into an organic aesthetic from Schiller onwards.
                  To be sure, this reinscription is inevitable, and also occurs in Kant's own critical
                  philosophy: the purely material architectonic of nature, de Man argues, is juxtaposed
                  to the organic architectonics of Pure Reason described near the end of the First Critique,
                  in which the pure formality of sublime vision is reinscribed into an organic tropology
                  of body and limbs. The confrontation of both versions of the architectonic occurs
                  as one between the organic metaphor of the unity of modes of cognition as a body of
                  articulated limbs that grows from the inside in, on the one hand, and the materiality
                  of the sublime vision of the ocean and the heavens, on the other. Ultimately, then,
                  both nature and the body end up disarticulated in the Third Critique, and instead
                  of providing the eventual establishment of the aesthetic as the category that would
                  secure the organic congruity between perception and cognition, it instead "marks the
                  undoing of the aesthetic as a valid category" and leaves us "with a materialism that
                  Kant's posterity has not yet begun to face up to" (89).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Crucially, this disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic also affects language
                     as such. Asking himself what the equivalent of this formal materialism would be "in
                     the order of language," de Man at the very end of his lecture spells out the most
                     radical consequence of his critique of the aesthetic, stating that "[t]o the dismemberment
                     of the body corresponds a dismemberment of language, as meaning-producing tropes are
                     replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and propositions into discrete words, or
                     the fragmentation of words into syllables or finally letters" (89). The pure, nonteleological,
                     and nonorganic formality of nature is transferred to language itself, so that an irrecoverable <em>linguistic</em> materiality emerges that resists inscription into an organically conceived process
                     of meaning production.

                              and persists "not as meaning, not as semantic or intersubjective communication, but
                              as an opacity, a stumbling, a transport or drift or mutation irreducible to meaning

                     </div> From the dismemberment of language emerges "the prosaic materiality of the letter
                     and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can transform this materiality into the phenomenal
                     cognition of aesthetic judgment" (90). That this linguistic materiality is to be taken
                     in its most literal sense is clear from the examples de Man provides: not only does
                     he refer to the literary example of Kleist's play with the word <span class="foreign">Fall</span> (fall) and <span class="foreign">Falle</span> (trap), which he discussed at length in the second Messenger Lecture on 
                     “Aesthetic Formalization,”
                      but he also refers to Kant's own language, stating that <span class="quote">‘[n]o such artful moments seem to occur, at first sight, in Kant. But just try to translate
                        one single somewhat complex sentence of Kant, or just consider what the efforts of
                        entirely competent translators have produced, and you will soon notice how decisively
                        determining the play of the letter and of the syllable, the way of saying (<span class="foreign">Art des Sagens</span>) as opposed to what is being said (<span class="foreign">das Gesagte</span>)—to quote Walter Benjamin—is in this most unconspicuous of stylists. (89)’</span> The example, concluding de Man's lecture on Kant, already prefigures his lecture on
                     Benjamin, not only in its explicit reference, but also—and more importantly—in the
                     observation that translation foregrounds the linguistic materiality that results from
                     the dismemberment of language that took place in Kant's text. If, earlier in the lecture,
                     de Man had introduced the notion of materiality as "the only word that comes to mind,"
                     and had added that "how this materiality is to be understood in linguistic terms is
                     not, as yet, clearly intelligible" (82), the final example of his lecture anticipates
                     his further exploration of this question in terms of translation in his concluding
                     lecture on Benjamin.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As de Man says at the beginning of the lecture, he will "repeat once more what I have
                  been saying since the beginning, using another text in order to have still another
                  version [...] of some of the questions with which we have been concerned throughout
                  these series" (73). This repetition is most clearly legible in the lecture's argument
                  as the gradual stripping of the Benjaminian concept of <span class="foreign">reine Sprache</span> from its "prophetic, religiously messianic" (76) overtones and reading it instead
                  as another version of the linguistic materiality de Man had located in Kant. De Man's
                  turn to Benjamin's text occurs as a structural repetition of the concluding example
                  of the lecture on Kant: highlighting shifts and errors in Harry Zohn's and Maurice
                  de Gandillac's French translations of Benjamin's "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers," de
                  Man foregrounds the materiality of Benjamin's own language and its emergence in translation.
                  By subsequently repositioning translation towards poetry, philosophy, criticism, and
                  history, de Man establishes it as a practice particularly privileged to address this
                  linguistic materiality and its disarticulating effect. Unlike poetry, which is aimed
                  at conveying (extralinguistic) meaning, translation "is a relation from language to
                  language." Like philosophy—and more specifically like Kant's critical epistemology—translation
                  is critical of imitation. As Benjamin indicates, a proper understanding of the relation
                  between the original and its translation would imply a critical reflection similar
                  to the epistemological critique of "a theory of simple imitation" (82). This comparison
                  is crucial to de Man's argument, since it draws a parallel between Kant's critical
                  philosophy and Benjamin's concept of translation, which will eventually end in the
                  convergence of both in their rigorous exploration of pure materiality. As is the case
                  with criticism—Benjamin's reference is to the German Romantics and to Friedrich Schlegel
                  in particular—the original when translated is "put in motion, de-canonized, questioned
                  in a way which undoes its claim to canonical authority" (83). Finally, like history,
                  translation should be understood as a non-organic, non-natural, non-dialectic process.
                  Just as we should not conceive of history as a natural process of growth and movement,
                  de Man's Benjamin says, translation should not be seen as an organic process of imitation.
                  Rather it is the other way around: instead of looking at the translation as somehow
                  growing out of the original, we should look at the original from the perspective of
                  the translation, as the latter makes us see the original in a different way—allows
                  for the emergence of an instability that was already there. Translation lifts texts
                  out of the safe haven of an organically and dialectically developing history and redelivers
                  them, as it were, as the essentially linguistic, non-organic, non-human events that
                  they always already were. It is this deliverance that relates translation to linguistic
                  materiality as it emerged in Kant.</p>
               <p>At the end of this series of comparisons, translation emerges as an exemplary activity
                  that allows for a reconceptualization of philosophy, theory, and history as essentially
                  "intralinguistic." If all three are also derived activities (from perception, literature,
                  and action, respectively), they relate "to what in the original belongs to language,
                  and not to meaning as an extralinguistic correlate susceptible of paraphrase and imitation."
                  It is in the subsequent elaboration of the exemplary critical thrust of the process
                  of translation (one that decisively transcends "the empirical act of translating")
                  that de Man most programmatically defines it in terms of linguistic materiality. <em>As</em> translations, philosophy, theory, and history <span class="quote">‘reveal that their failure, which seems to be due to the fact that they are secondary
                     in relation to the original, reveals [...] an essential disarticulation which was
                     already there in the original. They kill the original, by discovering that the original
                     was already dead. They read the original from the perspective of a pure language (<span class="foreign">reine Sprache</span>), a language that would be entirely freed of the illusion of meaning – pure form
                     if you want [...]. (84)’</span> In its progression from poetry to philosophy, criticism, and history, de Man's concluding
                  lecture ends up providing another version of the disarticulation of the organic congruity
                  between language and meaning and the emergence of an irreducible linguistic materiality.
                  Translation is presented as the process <span class="foreign">par excellence</span> that allows this materiality to be addressed: "to the extent that it disarticulates
                  the original, to the extent that it is pure language and is only concerned with language,"
                  translation gets drawn into "the bottomless depth, something essentially destructive,
                  which is in language itself" (84).</p>
               <p>Like in his lecture on Kant, de Man subsequently concludes his argument by providing
                  a specifically <em>linguistic</em> account of the disarticulating dynamics of translation, which derives from a threefold
                  disjunction. In the first place, language displays a disjunction between the hermeneutic
                  and the poetic, between "<span class="foreign">das Gemeinte</span>" and the "<span class="foreign">Art des Meinens</span>"—meaning and the way in which a work means. Benjamin, de Man argues, counters the
                  Schillerian humanistic account of language, instead staging language as non-organic
                  and non-intentional. The second disjunction is between grammar and meaning, foregrounding
                  "the materiality of the letter" (89) as potentially disruptive of meaning and making
                  it uncontrollable, the material disruption of what is assumed to be organic. The third
                  and final disjunction, between "the symbol and what is being symbolized" (89), highlights
                  "the unreliability of rhetoric as a system of tropes which would be productive of
                  a meaning" (91), foregrounding the way in which Benjamin's own tropology, contrary
                  to first impressions, in fact disarticulates its own symbolism (i.e. the symbol of
                  the amphora) so as to perform the disjunction it addresses through translation.</p>
               <p>De Man's comments on translation to some extent repeat well-known aspects of his rhetorical
                  critique of (post-)Romantic literature, yet they at the same time provide this critique
                  with additional theoretical and historical incisiveness. On a theoretical level, de
                  Man's earlier critique of metaphor is supplemented with a critique of organic conceptions
                  of meaning production and phenomenological models of language, deriving from the disarticulation
                  of the category of the aesthetic in Kant. Precisely to the extent that this disarticulation
                  affects language as phenomenal embodiment of meaning, the linguistic materiality that
                  results from it can never be addressed <em>in</em> language without reinscribing it into the organic tropological model of language
                  that this materiality resists. The materiality in question, in other words, has no
                  substance, is without matter, and can only be witnessed as an event. In terms of de
                  Man's reading of Benjamin, pure language is something that happens <em>in translation</em>, be it in interlingual translation or in critical reading. In the "Conclusions" it
                  is translation and the movement it causes in the original that makes this event happen,
                  as it hovers around linguistic materiality and alienates language from the human and
                  the organic as such. <span class="foreign">Reine Sprache</span>, which has come to refer to linguistic materiality, has no substance, does not exist,
                  except <em>in translation</em>. <span class="quote">‘This movement of the original is a wandering, an <em>errance</em>, a kind of permanent exile if you wish, but it is not really an exile, for there
                     is no homeland [...]. Least of all is there something like a <span class="foreign">reine Sprache</span>, a pure language, which does not exist except as a permanent disjunction which inhabits
                     all languages as such, including and especially the language one calls one's own.
                     What is to be one's own language is the most displaced, the most alienated of all.
                     (92)’</span> Translation allows linguistic materiality to be addressed as a "necessarily nihilistic
                  moment" (92) in a movement from irreversible disarticulation to inevitable reinscription.
                  This moment, this radical negativity that translation allows to emerge, endows it
                  with a specifically historical agency.</p>
               <p>In fact, the entire argument of the 
                  “Conclusions”
                  is doubly framed by questions of history—first in the lecture itself, and secondly
                  in the larger context of the Messenger Lectures. In the lecture itself, de Man introduces
                  his reading of Benjamin by means of an evocation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Geoffrey
                  Hartman as upholding a dialectical model of history in which the negativity emerging
                  from philosophy's rhetorical self-consciousness is ultimately recuperated into "a
                  new consciousness" (76) and "sacred revelation" (79), respectively. De Man's reading
                  of Benjamin subsequently relies heavily on this evocation of a persistent historical
                  naïvité, so as to stage Benjamin as a thinker who leaves "no room for historical notions
                  such as the notion of modernity" (93), and instead radically reconceptualizes the
                  historical through his critique of translation. Translation, as the "errancy of language
                  which never reaches the mark," de Man argues, "is what Benjamin calls history," which
                  "is not human, because it pertains strictly to the order of language" (92). As such,
                  the 
                  “Conclusions”
                  of the Messenger Lectures refer back to the opening lecture on Baudelaire, which had
                  already ended in the emergence of the "materiality of actual history": <span class="quote">‘Generic terms such as "lyric" [...] as well as pseudo-historical period terms such
                     as "romanticism" or "classicism" are always terms of resistance and nostalgia, at
                     the furthest remove from the materiality of actual history. If mourning is called
                     a "chambre d'éternel deuil où vibrent vieux râles," then this pathos of terror states
                     in fact the desired consciousness of eternity and of temporal harmony as voice and
                     song. True "mourning" is less deluded. The most <em>it</em> can do is to allow for non-comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac,
                     non-celebratory, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or, better, <em>historical</em> modes of language power. (262)’</span> This circularity of de Man's argument in the Messenger Lectures is symptomatic of
                  its most radical conclusion. In terms of the 
                  “Conclusions,”
                  linguistic materiality is never available as such, but can only be addressed in repeated
                  acts of translation that time and again allow it to emerge from the original, in which
                  it was always already at work.</p>
               <p>In an important but often overlooked essay that marks a transition from <em>Allegories of Reading</em> to the critique of aesthetic ideology in the Messenger Lectures, de Man both anticipates
                  this revaluation of translation and history and supplements it with a historical context
                  that is of specific relevance to British Romantic aesthetic theory. In 
                  “The Epistemology of Metaphor”
                  (published in <em>Critical Inquiry</em> in 1978 and later included in <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>), de Man locates in John Locke, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, and Kant a recurring
                  failure to clearly demarcate rhetorical from other forms of language, a failure resulting
                  from "the asymmetry of the binary model that opposes the figural to the proper meaning
                  of figure" (48-49). The problem first occurs in Locke's discussion of language in
                  the <em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>. In its movement from simple ideas to substances and mixed modes, de Man argues,
                  Locke's argument actually deploys "the entire spectrum [...] of tropological totalization"
                  and thus generates an "anamorphosis of tropes which has to run its full course whenever
                  one engages, however reluctantly or tentatively, the question of language as figure."(42)
                  Discussing "motion" as an example of a simple idea, Locke demonstrates that as a simple
                  idea it is undefinable, and refers to the atomists' definition of motion as passage
                  as an instance of "translation" and not of definition. De Man comments: <span class="quote">‘Locke's own "passage" is bound to continue this perpetual motion that never moves
                     beyond tautology: motion is a passage and passage is a translation; translation, once
                     again, means motion, piles motion upon motion. It is no mere play of words that "translate"
                     is translated in German as <span class="foreign">übersetzen</span>, which itself translates the Greek <span class="foreign">meta phorein</span> or metaphor. Metaphor gives itself the totality which it then claims to define, but
                     it is in fact the tautology of its own position. The discourse of simple ideas is
                     figural discourse or translation and, as such, creates the fallacious illusion of
                     definition. (38)’</span> This equation of translation with metaphor, already highlighted in Gasché's review
                  of <em>Allegories of Reading</em>, returns in the 
                  “Conclusions”
                  : <span class="quote">‘The translation is not the metaphor of the original; nevertheless, the German word
                     for translation, <span class="foreign">übersetzen</span>, means metaphor. <span class="foreign">Übersetzen</span> translates exactly the Greek <span class="foreign">meta-phorein</span>, to mover over, <span class="foreign">übersetzen</span>, to put across. <span class="foreign">Übersetzen</span>, I should say, <em>translates</em> metaphor—which, asserts Benjamin, is not at all the same. They are not metaphors,
                     yet the word means metaphor. The metaphor is not a metaphor, Benjamin is saying. [...]
                     Amazingly paradoxical statement, metaphor is not metaphor. (83)’</span> The example from Locke contains clear indications as to how to understand this identity
                  between translation and figural language: translation designates a movement which
                  presents itself as one <em>from</em> extralinguistic meaning <em>to</em> language or vice versa, while it is in fact the purely intralinguistic movement of
                  the trope as it turns towards but never reaches this extralinguistic meaning. This
                  troping-as-turning gives itself the illusion of meaning, yet it never reaches it and
                  tropes and turns back on nothing but itself—one crucial example of which is the full
                  course of the anamorphosis of tropes run in Locke's <em>Essay</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When de Man subsequently turns to Kant, the term translation again pops up—albeit
                     this time as a translation of a Kantian term by de Man himself as he discusses the
                     figure of hypotyposis. The latter refers to the sensory representation of supra-sensory
                     concepts of pure reason (ideas) by way of symbols. Commenting on the necessarily metaphorical
                     nature of philosophical language (de Man cites the Kantian examples of "ground," "to
                     depend," and "to follow from"), Kant states that such metaphors are "a mere translation
                     [<span class="foreign">Übertragung</span>] from a reflexion upon a represented object into an entirely different concept, to
                     which <em>perhaps</em> no representation could ever correspond" (47, de Man's translation). De Man takes
                     on the "perhaps" to mark a possible non-correspondence between concepts and their
                     metaphorical representation, so that the figure of hypotyposis confronts Kant's philosophical
                     rhetoric with the potential uncontrollability of metaphors rather than reassures it
                     of their conceptual power and epistemological reliability. De Man's use of the word
                     "translation" for "<span class="foreign">Übertragung</span>" subtly repeats his reading of Locke earlier in the essay: while Kant's language
                     would ideally translate supra-sensory ideas into philosophical terminology, what actually
                     happens is that it ends up in an intralinguistic process of metaphorical substitution
                     that never reaches beyond itself, persistently referring itself to itself rather than
                     representing extralinguistic meaning. While this rhetorical condition by no means
                     coincides with the disarticulation of the category of the aesthetic in Kant, it already
                     anticipates de Man's reading of Kant five years later in the Messenger Lectures, as
                     it is symptomatic of the disarticulation of language as phenomenal representation
                     and its corresponding emergence as pure formality.

                     for British Romantic theory. It stands out in de Man's writings as one of the few

                     turn is of crucial importance for the British Romantic translation of German Idealism

                     that remained hidden for us by a nineteenth-century romantic and realist epistemology

                  <p>From the Messenger Lectures thus emerges a notion of translation that, not unlike
                     what de Man in 
                     “The Resistance to Theory”
                      calls "the linguistics of literariness," presents itself as a powerful tool in the
                     "unmasking" of aesthetic ideology by going "against a powerful philosophical tradition
                     of which aesthetics is a prominent part" (11). As such, this notion of translation
                     allows for a return to the "gap" suggested by Derrida between 
                     “The Rhetoric of Temporality”
                      and de Man's later writings. Retrospectively, the Lectures make legible in the 1969
                     essay the emergence and premature abandonment of the question of materiality. In his
                     discussion of Coleridge's theory of symbol in the broader contexts of European (pre-)Romanticism
                     and post-Romantic criticism, de Man focuses on the ambiguous valorization of symbol
                     over allegory in <em>The Stateman's Manual</em>, and phrase this ambiguity in terms of materiality: while Coleridge devalues allegory
                     as suffering from "a lack of substantiality," the symbol's "material substantiality
                     dissolves and becomes a mere reflection of a more original unity that does not exist
                     in the material world." Coleridge's conception of symbol as organic form ultimately
                     ends up in a "spiritualization of the symbol [that] has been carried so far that the
                     moment of material existence by which it was originally defined" vanishes and is replaced
                     by a notion of "translucence" (192), which turns it (with allegory) to its transcendental
                     source and away from the world of matter. In the remainder of the essay, de Man then
                     abandons this "materialist" line of questioning, and instead recasts it in the subjectivist
                     terminology of the disjunction of the empirical and the linguistic self. In a later
                     lecture, de Man will criticize this approach, and provide an alternative through a
                     rhetorical reading of Johann Gottlieb Fichte that to a substantial degree announces
                     the argument of the Messenger Lectures.

                     significant portions of this argument <em>as</em> translations from Friedrich Schelling.

                     </div> Yet the <em>Biographia</em>'s evasion of translation transcends the strategic gestures of plagiarism, and should
                     be read as an essential part of the articulation of its transcendentalist argument
                     and its persistent confrontation with its own language as representative of transcendental
                     ideas. Ideally, Coleridge's language would participate in a process that it famously
                     calls "divine ventriloquism"—a process of organic revelation of divine truth across
                     languages based in a transcendental principle of unity that is immediate and in which
                     ideas and their representations coincide. While this process safely subsumes linguistic
                     mediation as a mere supplement to organic revelation, the matter of mediation repeatedly
                     forces itself on the <em>Biographia</em> as it translates Schelling’s Transcendental System. This re-emergence of language
                     already occurs at the moment of the introduction of the notion of "divine ventriloquism"
                     in chapter 9. Coleridge's claim that "I regard truth as a divine ventriloquist: I
                     care not from whose mouth the sounds are supposed to proceed, if only the words are
                     audible and intelligible" (164) ideally posits divine truth as one speaking itself
                     across languages under the unifying drive of organic revelation. The addition of "if
                     only the words are [...] intelligible," however, immediately conditions this ideal
                     and foregrounds linguistic mediation against organic revelation. In fact, it is <em>as</em> a translation that the <em>Biographia</em> is continually forced to confront the question as to its comprehensibility, since
                     the latter depends "rendering the system itself intelligible to my countrymen" (163),
                     an audience deeply afflicted by "that compendious philosophy, which talking of mind
                     but thinking of brick and mortar, or other images equally abstracted from body, contrives
                     a theory of spirit by nicknaming matter" and reduces all things to "impressions, ideas,
                     and sensations" (235). The language of British "mechanical" philosophy represents
                     the threat of a purely material language, as when Coleridge indicates that "existence
                     of an infinite spirit, of an intelligent and holy will, must on this system be mere
                     articulated motions of the air" (120) and that "a God not visible [...] can exist
                     only in the sounds and letters that form his name and attributes" (121). To secure
                     his own philosophical rhetoric from this threat of a purely material language, Coleridge
                     subsequently appeals to "the ascertaining vision, the intuitive knowledge" (239) that
                     precedes linguistic materialization and translation. In order to establish its own
                     language as an instance of divine ventriloquism, Coleridge's argument has to articulate
                     the transcendental principle from which this ventriloquism emerges. In the actual
                     articulation of this principle, however, it is translation that exposes the principle
                     of organic unity as originating in an imposition of difference rather than as an original
                     principle of immediate identity. As David Ferris's close reading of Coleridge's translation
                     of Schelling has compellingly demonstrated, Coleridge's translation adds to Schelling's
                     system a decisively religious dimension, and deviates the latter's argument in a much
                     more overtly organic direction. Perhaps the clearest example of this imposition of
                     difference occurs immediately before the discussion of the subjective and objective
                     ways of knowledge, when Coleridge rephrases the "postulate of philosophy" as "the
                     heaven-descended <span class="smcap">know thyself</span>!" (252). As Ferris argues, "[w]here Schelling exposes the principle systematically
                     and, in so doing, provides it with its own means of justification, Coleridge takes
                     it over as if it were a God-given truth" (57). The postulation of a divine origin
                     that ultimately grounds a total organic unity of opposites marks a strategic recovery
                     of linguistic transmission in Coleridge's translation. As Ferris states: <span class="quote">‘the point where Schelling's philosophy attains completion is the point at which it
                        gives authority to itself and so becomes self-grounded. The <em>promise</em> of such a philosophical resolution is essentially what Coleridge takes from Schelling
                        and applies to the whole series of apparently intractably divided terms and oppositions
                        he is concerned with, namely, subject/object, original/copy, author/text, truth/authority,
                        critic/text and philosophy/poetry. (60)’</span> Coleridge's translation of Schelling's Transcendental System, in other words, effects
                     a "disfiguration" (49) of its systematic and self-grounding articulation. A further
                     analysis of this disfigurating impact of translation and its continuous reinscription
                     in the organic ideology of divine ventriloquism in the <em>Biographia</em>, I would argue, could lead to a productive revaluation of the relation between its
                     anti-materialist philosophical argument and its rhetorical performance as a continuous
                     confrontation with—and evasion of—an irreducible linguistic materiality that leads
                     to the premature abortion of its argument.</p>

                     </div> emerges as a highly experimental exploration of the process of translation that ends
                     in the disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic it was intended to bring
                     home to the British reader. What is often overlooked in readings of <em>Sartor Resartus</em> is precisely the fact that it does not coincide with the Teufelsdröckhian Clothes
                     Philosophy it contains, but presents a fictional account of its translation. Framing
                     the articulation of a transcendentalist aesthetic in such an account of its translation, <em>Sartor</em> foregrounds the latter's rhetorical disarticulation <em>in</em> translation. In this sense, <em>Sartor Resartus</em> presents the "end" of Romantic aesthetic theory in a final act of sustained self-reflexive
                     rhetorical scrutiny: in the progression from the <em>Biographia</em> to <em>Sartor</em> a foregrounding of the process of translation occurs, eventually ending up in the
                     disarticulation of the transcendentalist aesthetic these works set out to articulate.</p>

               <p>From this brief excursion to Coleridge and Carlyle, a central question emerges that
                  de Man never turned to, but towards which his later essays on aesthetic ideology certainly
                  gesture, i.e. that of the British Romantic aesthetic theory as essentially occurring
                  in the mode of translation. Addressing this question would entail a study of Romanticism
                  in terms of the materiality emerging from the disarticulation of the aesthetic in
                  Kant, and would entail both a historical and comparative reinterrogation of British
                  Romanticism's position as mediating between the philosophical traditions of empiricism
                  and Idealism. In this sense, de Man can and should be seen as "a thinker of affirmation"—or
                  at least as a thinker putting us before the task of reading and translating the theoretical
                  discourse of and on Romanticism, so as to confront it with the material event that
                  ruptures aesthetic ideology and destabilizes the critical terms we use to address
                  it.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The six Messenger Lectures were delivered in the spring of 1983, just months before
               de Man's death in December of that year. The lectures were: 
               “Anthropomorphism and Trope in Baudelaire”
               (published as 
               “Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric”
               in <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, 239–62), 
               “Kleist's <em>Über das Marionettentheater</em>”
               (published as 
               “Aesthetic Formalization: Kleist's <em>Über das Marionettentheater</em>”
               in <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, 263–90), 
               “Hegel on the Sublime”
               (published in <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>, 105–18), 
               “Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant”
               (published in <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>, 70–90), 
               “Kant and Schiller”
               (published as edited transcript in <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>, 129–62) and 
               “Conclusions”
               (published as 
               “'Conclusions': Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'”
               in <em>The Resistance to Theory</em>, 73–105). For commentaries on the lectures and the notion of materiality on which
               they center, see the essays included in <em>Material Events</em> and <em><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/deman">Legacies of Paul de Man</a></em>. For a discussion of de Man's notion of materiality in relation to his theory of
               rhetorical reading, see my 
               “Surfacing Materiality.”
               </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">For a useful situation of the essay in the broader context of de Man's other writings,
               see Martin McQuillan's <em>Paul de Man</em>. Within the field of translation studies, de Man mainly figures, with Derrida, as
               an example of deconstructionist appropriation of Benjamin. As has been noted by Eve
               Tavor Bennet and Kevin Attell, however, their respective readings do diverge on decisive
               points. An interesting new development in the essay's reception was the recent publication
               of <em>Theory and the Disappearing Future: On de Man, On Benjamin</em>, containing a transcript (and facsimile print) of de Man's handwritten notes for
               the lecture, with critical commentaries by Tom Cohen, Claire Colebrook and J. Hillis
               Miller.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In fact, Gasché's review of <em>Allegories of Reading</em> highlights the intricate proliferation of the issue of translation as a process including
               de Man's own critical praxis into a dynamic of translation, re-translation, and de-translation,
               characterizing de Man's rhetorical readings as "retranslations" that are "de-translations,
               i.e. operations by means of which the static and closed off instances of totality
               are referred back to the 'original' mechanics of the text" (49). Although it is certainly
               an essential part of further inquiry into the issue of translation in de Man's writings,
               the inclusion of the latter in such an interminable process of translation will only
               be indirectly addressed in this essay, since it would complicate matters beyond the
               scope of my present argument. Another commentary to take into account in this context
               is Cynthia Chase's 
               “Translating Romanticism.”
               </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">If, as Marc Redfield has argued, aesthetic ideology depends on the production of transparency
               and the obliteration of linguistic mediation, language resists this effacing gesture
               and persists "not as meaning, not as semantic or intersubjective communication, but
               as an opacity, a stumbling, a transport or drift or mutation irreducible to meaning
               or intention." In other words, language "persists <em>as language</em>, as the technical supplement that in itself can never properly exist" (23). As de
               Man states in 
               “The Resistance to Theory”
               (another late essay, which first got rejected by MLA, was subsequently delivered at
               Amherst College in 1981, and finally published in the volume with the same title),
               the analysis of this resistance marks the beginning of literary theory as such: "Literary
               theory can be said to come into being when the approach to literary texts is no longer
               based on non-linguistic, that is to say historical and aesthetic, considerations or,
               to put it somewhat less crudely, when the object of discussion is no longer the meaning
               or the value but the modalities of production and of reception of meaning and of value
               prior to their establishment" (7).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">It is no coincidence, then, that the issue of hypotyposis recurs in the Messenger
               Lectures. In the conclusion of 
               “Kant and Schiller,”
               for example, it appears as another version of Kant's materialist resistance to Schiller's
               humanism, when de Man addresses "the particular necessity which philosophy has, to
               take its terminology not from purely intellectual concepts but from material, sensory
               elements, which it then uses metaphorically and frequently forgets that it does so.
               [...] [H]ypotyposis for Kant is certainly a problem for understanding [...]; whereas
               here it is offered by Schiller as a solution [...]. The sensory [...], unlike the
               hypotyposis in Kant, becomes a metaphor for reason." (154) In the 
               “Conclusions,”
               de Man again refers to Kant's hypotyposis and the way in which it "invites us to become
               aware of the use of metaphors in our own philosophical discourse." (75)</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Another instance, which is suggestive of the direction that my argument takes de Man's
               notion of materiality, is the reference to Hume in 
               “The Return to Philology”
               (published in <em>The Resistance to Theory</em>): <span class="quote">‘In its origin and development, aesthetics has been the province of philosophers of
                  nature and of the self rather than of philosophers of language. Neither has aesthetic
                  theory succeeded in its admirable ambition to unite cognition, desire and morality
                  in one single aesthetic judgment. Professor Bate "in an article on 
                  “The Crisis in English Studies”
                  " asserts as a matter of course that it suffices to 'turn to Kant' to lay to rest
                  a linguistically motivated scepticism like that of David Hume. [...] Whether a reading
                  of <em>The Critique of Judgment</em> ... would confirm this assertion certainly stands in need of careful examination
                  (25)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">A key moment in this autocritical turn is the 1977 lecture on 
               “The Concept of Irony”
               (included in <em>Aesthetic Ideology</em>), in which de Man criticizes this analysis of the trope of irony in terms of "a dialectic
               of the self as reflexive structure," implicitly referring to 
               “The Rhetoric of Temporality”
               when he states that "[i]t is in this way, to the extent that I have written about
               the subject, that I have dealt with it myself, so what I have to say today is in the
               nature of an <span class="foreign">autocritique</span>, since I want to put in question this possibility." (169-170) The lecture's reading
               of Fichte to an important degree anticipates both the argument of 
               “The Epistemology of Metaphor”
               and the line of questioning of the Messenger Lectures when he states that "[i]rony
               and history seem to be curiously linked to each other" and that "[t]his would be the
               topic to which this would lead, but this can only be tackled when the complexities
               of what we call performative rhetoric have been more thoroughly mastered" (184).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               which has as yet been insufficiently picked up by Anglo-American Coleridge criticism,

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Next to the acknowledged translations, the 
               “Editors' Introduction”
               to the Bollingen edition indicates that a "maximum of a quarter of the total material

               Apart from Carlyle, another key Romantic author-translator to be taken into account
               in this context is Thomas De Quincey, whose complex engagement with translation has
               as yet not received the close critical attention it deserves. Notable exceptions are
               Eric Dayre’s aforementioned study and Brecht de Groote’s recent dissertation on “‘A
