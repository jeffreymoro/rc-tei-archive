            <p>This essay reads Percy Bysshe Shelley's <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> in the context of the resurgence of critical interest in anarchist theory. The essay
               meditates on how recent developments in anarchist-related critical theory, specifically
               the work of Jacques Rancière, make visible an aesthetics of anarchism. Using Rancière's
               re-contextualization of the Romantic aesthetic philosophies of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich
               Schiller, the essay argues that Shelley's protest poem can be read as an anarchism
               not only in terms of its political content, but, perhaps more radically, with respect
               to its form. In so doing, the essay attempts to think beyond the critical impasse
               in which <em>The Mask</em> is understood as sacrificing aesthetics for politics, or politics for aesthetics,
               by asking how <em>The Mask</em> might be read as expressing an anarchic politics, in Rancière's words, "simply by
               being literature."</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Masks of An-Archy: Shelley, Rancière, and the Anarchist Turn</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Percy Shelley’s <em>The Mask of Anarchy </em>(1819) has been revered by political radicals of all stripes, from Chartists to Marxists,
               and although a Marxist orientation arguably comprises the “mainstream” interpretation
               of Shelley as a political radical, the same history sees Shelley more or less adopted
               as part of an international anarchist literary canon. Indeed, as Eric Hobsbawm avers,
               in the early part of the twentieth century “interest in Shelley” became something
               of a sign by which anarchists often recognized one another (82). In his canonical
               1962 history of the movement, George Woodcock noted that it was in Shelley—as the
               chief disciple of William Godwin, his father-in-law and unofficial founder of modern
               anarchism—“that anarchism first appears as a theme of world literature. And, though
               Shelley must perhaps cede to Tolstoy the honour of being the greatest of anarchist
               writers, he remains the greatest of anarchist poets” (91).</p>
            <p>Yet, as Michael Scrivener noted some time ago, Shelley’s connection to anarchism has
               received little more than “spotty acknowledgement” (35), a forgetting that persists
               today despite the abiding critical interest in his politics. Recent years, however,
               have seen a dramatic resurgence of popular and academic interest in anarchist theory
               and practice, prompting Simon Critchley to propose an “anarchist turn” across the
               disciplines (“The Anarchist Turn”). This turn marks, among other things, a certain
               return by contemporary radical theorists to one of the root insights of anarchist
               thinking; namely, its fundamental critique of <em>archē</em>, the foundations or “first” principles which historically serve as the metaphysical
               ground and justification for a hierarchical construction of the social. If, as Kir
               Kuiken has recently argued, the political and aesthetic upheavals that mark Romanticism
               make its aesthetics the locus “for a fundamental set of questions that can no longer
               be resolved by reference to a pre-given ground or authority” (4), then the recent
               anarchist turn is itself the return of a certain Romanticism that remains to be thought
               through.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In this essay, I explore the implications of the anarchist turn for Romanticism as
                  the possibility of a return to Woodcock’s view of Shelley as an anarchist poet. My
                  purpose, however, is not simply to interpret Shelley’s politics as anarchist; rather,
                  this essay meditates on how recent developments in anarchist theory make visible an <em>aesthetics</em> of anarchism, and how this aesthetics is deployed in one of Shelley’s most expressly
                  anarchistic poems, <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>. What follows investigates this possibility primarily via the work of Jacques Rancière,
                  whose work on the politics of aesthetics has strong ties to the anarchist turn.

                  </div> The relationship between anarchic and Romantic discourses in Rancière’s thinking,
                  and their importance for Romanticism itself, has yet to be explored in detail. The
                  coordinates for relating these discourses are found in Rancière’s notion of the “aesthetic
                  regime,” which he locates in the Romantic period. For Rancière, texts such as Kant’s <em>Critique of Judgment</em> (1790),

                  </div> This democratic principle does not correspond to political anarchism per se but with
                  a “primary ‘anarchism’ at the heart of politics” as such, a “rupture in the logic
                  of <em>archē</em>” which “presupposes that a determinate superiority is exercised over an equally determinate

               <p>This an-archy provides a critical architecture for understanding Shelley’s relationship
                  to anarchism not in terms of its political content but as <em>form</em>, specifically in its paradoxical Kantian-Schillerian modality as a “suspension” of
                  relations of domination, which, I argue, provides the aesthetic coordinates for <em>The Mask</em>’s emphasis on passive resistance. Examining this an-archic conception of form, this
                  essay thus attempts to think beyond the critical impasse in which <em>The Mask</em> is understood either as sacrificing aesthetics for politics

                           (Webb 93). Even sympathetic appraisals by Scrivener, Richard Hendrix, Thomas Edwards,
                           and Stephen C. Behrendt alternately characterize Shelley’s blend of “dramatic form”
                           with “political insight” as “imperfect,” “contradictory,” and as such potentially
                           damaging to the very causes it seeks to promote (Scrivener 199, Hendrix 68, Edwards

                  </div> or a mere “aesthetic processing” <em>of</em> politics (Wolfson 195). Rather, by linking Rancière’s analysis of the aesthetic regime
                  to one of Shelley’s most exoteric political poems, the essay asks how <em>The Mask </em>might be read as expressing an an-archic politics “simply by being literature” (Rancière, <em>PL </em>3).</p>
            </div>
            <p>In this respect, parts of my argument dovetails with recent work on Shelley by critics
               like Kuiken and Matthew Borushko, who have re-emphasized the centrality of form in
               Shelley’s political texts. My analysis of the suspension of form in Kant and Schiller
               via Rancière echoes what Borushko has called, via Adorno, the “alliance between the
               aesthetic [form] and nonviolence” in Shelley’s <em>Mask</em> (97). In turn, my own argument extends these critical insights by linking this inherently
               political conception of the aesthetic to Rancière’s aesthetic regime so as to provide
               a different accent on the critical history that often touches upon, but rarely examines
               in depth or in distinctively <em>aesthetic</em> terms, Shelley’s connection to the anarchist political tradition.</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">I.</span></h2>
               <p>We can begin with a brief reminder of some of the core ideas informing Rancière’s
                  approach to the politics of aesthetics. Central to this approach is his disjoining
                  of the politics of literature from the politics of writers. For Rancière, the politics
                  of literature is not concerned with “the personal engagements of writers in the social
                  or political struggles of their times,” nor to “the way writers represent social structures”
                  or “political movements . . . in their books.” Instead, the politics of literature
                  concerns the way literature “intervenes <em>as</em> literature” in the “carving up of space and time, the visible and invisible, speech
                  and noise” (<em>PL </em>3; emphasis added). In this respect, intervention is not the demonstration of a program
                  for political resistance in poetic form; rather, intervention is located in the articulation
                  of form itself, which Rancière sees in Kantian terms as the <em>a priori </em>“shape” that reconfigures sensible-perceptual space. By disrupting the tacit distribution
                  organizing the sensible, form also bears a distinctively political potential as “dissensus,”
                  or the “reconfiguration of the distribution of the sensible that defines the common
                  of a community, by introducing into it subjects and new objects, in rendering visible
                  those who were not, and of making understood as speakers those who were only understood
                  as noisy animals” (<em>AD</em> 25).</p>
               <p>Rancière locates the historical emergence of this political dimension of aesthetic
                  form with the “aesthetic regime” of art during the Romantic period. The aesthetic
                  regime arises, in particular, in opposition to a prior “representative” regime of
                  art formulated on the basis of an Aristotelian theory of <em>mimesis</em>. The representative was composed of three interrelated elements analogous “with a
                  fully hierarchical vision” of society: the “primacy of action over characters,” a
                  “hierarchy of genres according to the dignity of their subject matter,” and the “primacy
                  of the art of speaking” (<em>PA</em> 22). The privileging of narrative as “the imitation of men who act” establishes an
                  opposition between the “rationality of action against the empirical nature of life,”
                  such that “the superiority of the poem, which links actions” over other forms, appears
                  “homologous to the superiority of men who take part in the world of action” (<em>PL </em>9-10). Men of action are further privileged in their possession of efficacious speech:
                  orators, princes, princesses, generals, and so on. Moreover, the definitive nature
                  of the rules for aesthetic production means that works of art demand an equally determinate
                  effect on their audience: a successful tragedy, for instance, always culminates in
                  a catharsis.</p>
               <p>The aesthetic regime, conversely, emerges precisely when the hierarchies of the representative
                  begin to break down. The innovation of the aesthetic regime is an acknowledgement
                  that there are no pre-existing rules for what counts as the subject of a work of art
                  and, therefore, that there are no solid boundaries between the forms of art and those
                  of life: art is freed “from any specific rule, from any hierarchy of the arts, subject
                  matter, and genre” (<em>PA </em>23). The aesthetic regime dismantles the hierarchical distribution of subjects, instead
                  promoting an “equality of represented subjects” and an “indifference of style with
                  regard to content,” such that artists no longer have to represent subjects according
                  to specific rules (Rockhill 81). The aesthetic regime thus revitalizes aesthetics
                  by placing it in contact with life, while life is thought to be potentially transformable
                  by its renewed contact with art. One of the byproducts of the aesthetic regime’s abolition
                  of representative rules, however, is precisely “the loss of any determinate relationship
                  between a work and its audience, between its sensible presence and an effect that
                  will be its natural end” (Rancière, “Art of the Possible”).</p>
               <p>The aesthetic regime’s confusion of the lines between art and life finds its historical
                  parallel in the French Revolution, which overturned the social and political hierarchies
                  correspondent to the generic divisions within the representative regime, while investing
                  transformations of sensible experience and the radical blurring of artistic boundaries
                  with a desire directed towards a future human community. The logic of this shift is
                  evident Wordsworth’s well-known refusal of the rules of engagement by which poets
                  are supposed to “gratify certain known habits of association,” along with his arguments
                  against poetic diction, and his promotion of the “language really used by men” as
                  the proper domain of poetry, all of which exemplifies the aesthetic regime’s desire
                  for art’s renewed contact with life. In the <em>Defence</em>, Shelley’s demand for “the poetry of life” (502) similarly manifests the aesthetic
                  regime’s collapse of discursive boundaries. For Shelley, imagination “has for its
                  objects those forms which are common to universal nature,” which includes not only
                  poetry, but “the kindred expressions of the poetical faculty; architecture, painting,
                  music, the dance, sculpture, philosophy, and we may add the forms of civil life” (488).
                  In turn, the <em>Defence</em> emphasizes “the connexion of poetry and social good,” for poetry “contains within
                  itself the seeds at once of its own and of social renovation” (492). However, Shelley
                  also acknowledges the contingency of the artwork’s intention and its effect in the
                  image of the fading coal whose “transitory brightness” emits only a “feeble shadow”
                  of its original conception; hence, “it is impossible to predict the greatness of its
                  results” (504).</p>
               <p>The collapse of the borders between art and life in the aesthetic regime is not as
                  straightforward as it appears, however. On the one hand, the aesthetic regime inaugurates
                  a project of “aesthetic revolution” through its “suspension of the relations of domination”
                  and their transformation “into the generative principle of a world without domination”
                  (Rancière, <em>AD</em> 36). On the other, art can only gesture towards this utopian future by virtue of
                  its <em>distance</em> from life, that is, by virtue of the autonomy of its form. For Rancière, it is the
                  “resistant figure of the work[’s form] in which political promise is negatively preserved”
                  that generates its an-archic potential (<em>AD</em> 36-37). This paradox is compounded by the “generative contradiction” of form itself
                  (<em>PA</em> 29): in order for art to preserve its “political promise” it must be distinct from
                  the “natural” organization of bodies in the distribution of the sensible. At the same
                  time, this promise also means that that art must be more than mere art; namely, it
                  must become an agent of transformation. Art can hold onto its political promise only
                  through its disincorporation from existing distributions of the sensible. The aesthetic
                  regime is therefore “inhabited by a heterogeneous power, the power of a form of thought
                  that has become foreign to itself” (<em>PA </em>23). This heterogeneous power parallels dissensus: by virtue of its paradoxical autonomy
                  and heteronomy, form produces a gap in the sensible through its neutralization of
                  the customary meanings attributed to words and the assigned relations between bodies
                  and their capacities. It is through this hiatus that form manifests alternative possibilities
                  for a redistribution of the sensible.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Rancière arrives at the constitutive paradox of the aesthetic regime through an examination
                     of Romantic aesthetic philosophy, in particular Schiller’s rereading of Kant’s aesthetic
                     judgment. What interests Rancière in Kant and Schiller is their shared emphasis on
                     discerning in aesthetic experience a “form of judgment freed from the hierarchies
                     of knowledge and those of social life” (“Art of the Possible”). For Kant, aesthetic
                     judgment proceeds from a double negation that suspends both the law of the understanding
                     and the law of practical interest. Judgments of the type “this is beautiful” are disinterested,
                     Kant argues, since they function in the absence of any determinate law of the understanding
                     or as an object of desire. As disinterested, aesthetic form is not the imposition
                     of a conceptual unity on manifold sensation but that aspect of an object freely reflected
                     in the imagination in the absence of any determinate concept or empirical interest,
                     so that the imagination is “as it were, at play in the observation of the shape” (Kant, <em>CJ</em> 114). No longer subject either to the laws of reason or of sensibility, imaginative
                     play manifests a free and indeterminate relation between the faculties of the imagination
                     and the understanding, which in turn produces “aesthetic common sense”: <span class="quote">‘a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (<em>a priori</em>) of everyone else’s way of representing in thought, in order as it were to hold its
                        judgment up to human reason as a whole . . . by abstracting from the limitations that
                        contingently attach to our judging, which is in turn accomplished by leaving out as
                        far as is possible everything in one’s representational state that is matter, i.e.
                        sensation, and attending solely to the formal peculiarities of his representation.

                     </div> in Rancière’s terms it is precisely the emphasis on form in the aesthetic experience
                     of beauty that generates the possibility of dissensus. Crucially, Kant distinguishes
                     his version of aesthetic common sense from the common-sense “realism” of the Scottish
                     Enlightenment, whose privileging of sense-experience Schiller critiques as “judging
                     all experience whatsoever by one particular fragment of experience” (101). Conversely,
                     the formalism of the Kantian aesthetic judgment divests common sense of its unreflected
                     immediacy, encouraging a <em>critical</em> relation to the given. Aesthetic common sense emerges precisely when the given empirical
                     distribution of “common sense” is no longer taken for granted.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Kant further describes the <em>sensus communis</em> generated by aesthetic judgment as <em>possible</em> rather than “actual” (<em>CJ </em>174). The universality of the aesthetic experience of form does not affirm the <em>sensus communis</em> as an already existing state of affairs, as it does for the Scottish realists, but
                  identifies it as a possibility whose withdrawal from the given opens towards Rancière’s
                  conception of equality as a supplement that “separates the community out from the
                  sum of the parts of the social body.” As a universal presupposition in which “to think
                  for oneself” is paradoxically “to think the position of everyone else” (Kant, <em>CJ</em> 174), aesthetic common sense identifies the moment when a singular judgment is no
                  longer part of the conventional distributions of the sensible, but identifies itself
                  with “human reason as a whole,” “a communal sphere different from the official public
                  sphere” (Rancière, “Democracy” 174-75).</p>
               <p>Schiller’s rereading of Kant in the <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> makes the politics within aesthetic judgment explicit. For Schiller, “if man is ever
                  to solve that problem of politics in practice he will have to approach it through
                  the problem of the aesthetic” (90), whose “play” encompasses the very definition of
                  humanity itself: “man only plays when he is in the fullest sense of the word a human
                  being, and <em>he is only fully a human being when he plays</em>” (131). In the sixth letter, Schiller criticizes the increasingly “sharper divisions
                  between the sciences” and the “rigorous separation of ranks and occupations” (99)
                  that constitutes the representative regime and its itinerant police order. In aesthetic
                  play, conversely, the mind finds itself a “medium” between reason and sensation: “it
                  is, precisely because it is divided between the two, removed from the constraint of
                  the one as of the other. . . . By means of beauty sensuous man is led to a form of
                  thought” and “spiritual man is brought back to matter” (129, 137). Schiller describes
                  play as emerging in the experience of form, which in its Kantian definition affects
                  the “whole man,” whereas subject matter affects “only one or other of his functions”
                  (151). Schiller encounters the contradictory play of this formal effect at work in
                  his description of the statue of the<em>Juno Ludovisi</em>: “the whole figure reposes and dwells in itself, . . . neither yielding nor resisting;
                  here is no force to contend with force. . . . we find ourselves at one and the same
                  time in a state of utter repose and supreme agitation, and there results that wondrous
                  stirring of the heart for which mind has no concept nor speech any name” (132). The
                  aesthetic experience of the statue’s autonomy is inextricably intertwined with its
                  heteronomy, its strange fascination promising a new form of life in its formal difference
                  from ordinary sensation.</p>
               <p>For Rancière, Schiller’s conception of aesthetic play as the free agreement between
                  reason and sensation articulates a “pure instance of suspension, a moment when form
                  is experienced for itself,” which stands in direct contrast to any “state that governs
                  human societies and puts each person in his place by separating those who command
                  from those who obey” (<em>PA </em>24; <em>AD </em>97). Hence, the free agreement made possible through aesthetic experience is “already
                  . . . dissensus” (<em>AD</em> 97). On the one hand, aesthetic play is dissensus in its refusal of a cognition in
                  which one faculty is subordinated to another; on the other, it is the refusal of any
                  hierarchical division in which one form of life is superior to another. In turn, Schiller’s
                  desire for an “aesthetic education” of humanity comes about as a distinctively nonviolent
                  suspension of (sensible) force contending with (rational) force. This suspension,
                  mobilized by the Kantian-Schillerian concept of form, locates an aesthetics of passive
                  resistance within the politics of Romantic aesthetics, a state in which utter repose
                  is paradoxically and simultaneously a mode of supreme agitation.</p>
               <p>In the <em>Defence</em>, Shelley also speaks of poetry as the play of “exultation and horror, grief and pleasure,
                  eternity and change” that in its synthetic “union under its light yoke all irreconcilable
                  things” (505). This union does not reconcile us with things as they are but “makes
                  us the inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos,” defeating both
                  “the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding impressions”
                  as well as reason’s “enumeration of quantities already known” (480). Neither “mere
                  life,” nor “mere form,” the suspension made possible in the experience of aesthetic
                  play, creates what Schiller calls “living Shape” [<em>lebende Gestalt</em>] (128). Echoing the “Shape” that breeds living thoughts “As flowers beneath May’s
                  footstep waken” in <em>The Mask </em>(l. 122), Schiller’s “living Shape” expands Kant’s formulation beyond mere disinterestedness
                  to redeploy aesthetic play as the figure through which both mind and world can be
                  imagined otherwise: on the basis of equality.</p>

                     English” (Holmes 532). To be sure, Shelley seems to have intended the poem to be read
                     this way; writing to Leigh Hunt in 1820, Shelley includes <em>The Mask</em> as part of a “little volume of <em>popular songs</em>, wholly political, &amp; destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination of the reformers”
                     (<em>Letters </em>2: 191). Conversely, Susan Wolfson has contested <em>The Mask</em>’s celebrated interventionist status on the very basis of its form, seeing in the
                     poem’s blend of dream-vision and political awakening a series of external and internal
                     impasses that undermine the very causes it seeks to promote. Such impasses, from the
                     poem’s belated publication in 1832 rendering it “unable to affect the struggle it
                     addresses” (195), to its framing as a dream-vision from which “the poet never seems
                     to awaken” (195-96), and its reduction of mass political action to a “static aesthetic
                     spectacle” (198-200, 203), disarticulate Shelley’s attempt to put poetry to work in
                     and as politics.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Yet even Wolfson’s penetrating reading of <em>The Mask</em>’s formal contradictions remains within the scope of critical judgment that measures
                  the poem as a “litmus test” for Shelley’s politics (Kuiken 188). In this respect,
                  Wolfson less overturns the political monumentalization of Shelley than reproduces
                  it negatively as a sign of poetry’s failure to <em>be</em> politics. Such approaches potentially miss something crucial about the complex tensions
                  between autonomy and heteronomy that contribute to the aesthetic regime’s political
                  theorization of form itself.</p>
               <p>In order to gauge how <em>The Mask </em>can be an interventionist text “as literature” let us return briefly to Shelley’s
                  statement that <em>The Mask </em>is a poem “destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination of the reformers.” At first
                  glance, Shelley’s comment would seem to posit a simple cause and effect relation between
                  poetry and politics. One notes the subtle wording of the remark, however: what is
                  being awakened is the <em>imaginations </em>of the reformers. That is to say, what Shelley expresses in <em>The Mask </em>is not necessarily poetry as the causal spring of a failed, programmatic, model of
                  politics, but a politics of poetry capable of imagining new forms of collective life.
                  This imagining becomes possible through the poetic reconfiguration of the sensible;
                  hence, the imaginative awakening to which Shelley refers in his letter becomes the
                  “sense awakening” in <em>The Mask</em>, something “heard and felt” (l. 136-37).</p>
               <p>Shelley’s much-discussed use of the court masque genre provides a convenient starting
                  point for the poem’s manner of “carving up” the sensible, since it renders palpable
                  the differences between representative and aesthetic regimes. As Stuart Curran points
                  out, Shelley inverts the hierarchy of values typically associated with the masque-antimasque
                  genres. Whereas in the conventional masque, the vulgarity, grotesquerie, and chaos
                  of the antimasque are invoked only to be “superseded by the ritual celebration” of
                  “the received order of society and . . . its structures of authority” (Curran 188,
                  190), Shelley repurposes the masque such that the authoritative embodiments of order
                  (“God, King, and Law”) now inhabit the “motley crowd” typically associated with the
                  antimasque (l. 27, 40-41, 66). Conversely, Shelley transvalues the masque into an
                  aesthetic form that gives voice to that part that has no part, the “Heroes of unwritten
                  story” (l. 148). In so doing, <em>The Mask</em> reconfigures the masque-form as a genre available to everyone: its subjects are no
                  longer situated within the hierarchical arrangement which defines the crowd as the
                  chaotic “other” of social authority, but rather access the passion of ritual celebration
                  hitherto reserved for these forms of authority as available to all.</p>
               <p>The theoretical basis for this inversion is formulated in the <em>Defence</em>, where Shelley redefines drama in the context of the aesthetic regime’s an-archic
                  breakdown of the representative hierarchy of genres. Shelley shifts the meanings of
                  the dramatic form from a code properly separating genres to that “under which a greater
                  number of modes of expression of poetry are susceptible of being combined than any
                  other” (491-92). Though <em>The Mask </em>is not as ostentatious in its generic hybridity as the “lyrical drama” of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, its redeployment of the masque nonetheless performs a dramatic function which Rancière
                  identifies with “the practice of bringing into play the capacity of the greatest number,”
                  the “many” of the “Ye are many – they are few” (“Democracy” 175). In this context,
                  the function of the masque for Shelley is not political action, insofar as action
                  remains within the representative schema that that aesthetic regime calls into question.
                  Rather, its function in bringing into play the capacity of the greatest number is
                  the <em>suspension</em> of action, exemplified both in the transvaluation of “God, King, and Law” as the
                  arbiters of Anarchy without progression, as well as the equivalence of the multitude’s
                  “folded arms and looks” with “Weapons of unvanquished war” (l. 321-22).</p>
               <p>This suspension of action is figured from the outset of the poem in the ambiguous
                  status of the speaker, who dreamily ventriloquizes a voice heard “from over the Sea”:
                  </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               </blockquote>
               <p> For Wolfson, the quadruple single rhyme and the drowsy sibilance of “As I-Sea-Poesy”
                  generates an effect at once hypnotic and claustrophobic. Initiating the verse’s rhyme
                  scheme not with the first end rhyme “Italy-me” but with the internal “as<em>lee</em>p-Italy,” which then becomes “me” and “Poesy,” <em>The Mask</em> binds its desire for political agency to the ideologically (en)closed “specular seeming”
                  (Wolfson 197). This agency is further perplexed by the syntactic echoes between the
                  voice of the “indignant Earth” (l. 139) that calls for political action and the poem’s
                  specular preamble. The “As I” that initiates the dream sequence thus returns as the
                  “As if” through which the Earth’s “words of joy and fear arose”: “As if their Own
                  indignant Earth / . . . / Had felt her blood upon her brow / . . . / As if her heart
                  had cried aloud” (l. 138-39, 141, 147). The poem’s form thus works to restrain the
                  “political agency of the oratory to a dream” (Wolfson 198).</p>
               <p>But in making the oratory a dream, <em>The Mask</em> at once formally demonstrates the restraint that the poem’s content will exhort as
                  passive resistance, while further displacing the hierarchical modes of sensibility
                  within the representative order. As Rancière notes, in the representative order, “speaking
                  was the act of the orator who persuades an assembly. . . . The power of making art
                  with words was linked to the power of a hierarchy of speech, of a relationship of
                  address regulated between speech acts and defined audiences on whom these speech acts
                  were supposed to produce the effects of mobilizing” (<em>PL </em>12). It is precisely this hierarchy of the active speech of men-in-action over a passive
                  multitude that the poem goes on to challenge by displacing both the source of the
                  orator’s voice and its addressee: its origin is not a localizable figure within the
                  social hierarchy but in the “Earth,” while its addressee is no longer “magistrates,
                  princes and preachers” but the “many,” or rather, as Rancière puts it, “any one at
                  all, no one in particular” (<em>PL </em>12). Like the masque form itself, the representative function of oration here becomes
                  subject to the an-archic formula of the aesthetic regime that dismantles “the distinction
                  between men of speech-in-action and men of noisy suffering voice” (<em>PL </em>13). The dream is the <em>form</em> of the oration; as such, the oration functions only “as if” it were the objective
                  content of a political program. Rather, insofar as the dream is its form, the oration
                  itself is a “vision of Poesy,” an experimental shaping of the sensible materials <em>for</em> a new program of political resistance, a program whose content remains indeterminate,
                  suspended between passion and action.</p>
               <p>The dream frame can also be read as the necessary prerequisite for allegorizing the
                  paradoxical autonomy and heteronomy of aesthetic form. The poem’s dream effect announces
                  less the erasure of its historical-material referentiality than what Herbert Marcuse
                  calls a “sublimation” of it. The function of aesthetic sublimation in its “transcendence
                  of immediate reality” is precisely to disrupt “the reified objectivity of established
                  social relations . . . while preserving its overwhelming presence” (Marcuse 6, 7).
                  Hence the aesthetic stylization of the masque is doubled by the poem’s reference to
                  having been written “on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester.” At the same time,
                  the strangely unlocalizable “voice of the Earth” that will emerge in the poem to exhort
                  passive resistance from the masses announces “a new dimension of experience” (Marcuse
                  7) through the “as if” that hypothetically restores Henry Hunt’s truncated speech
                  to the Manchester assembly, the content of which becomes the sublimated form of Shelley’s
                  revised masque. The “truth” of the Peterloo massacre, then, is not the event of the
                  massacre itself, which would only confirm the existing order of things, but the sublimated
                  poetic world which breaks from this reality so as to become “a vehicle [for] recognition
                  and indictment” (Marcuse 9), or in Rancière’s terms, dissensus. </p>
               <p>At once recognized and indicted in the early part of <em>The Mask</em> is the violence that sustains the consensual apparatus that defines normative distributions
                  of the sensible. Prior to Hope’s intervention, the poem is suffused with images of
                  theatricalized violence, as the pageant of Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy tramples “to
                  a mire of blood” the “adoring multitude” (l. 39-40), whose adulation shows them colluding
                  in their own oppression. The culminating point of the multitude’s complicity lies
                  not only in its “ideological blindness” (Borushko 103), however, but in the specifically
                  consensual mode that this blindness takes: “Then all cried with one accord; / ‘Thou
                  are King, and god, and Lord; / Anarchy, to Thee we bow / Be thy name made holy now!’”
                  (l. 70-74). It is only with the “one accord” that Anarchy’s reign converts its more
                  overt forms of theatricalized violence into manageable forms of instituted violence:
                  “Bank,” “Tower,” and “Parliament” (l. 83, 84).</p>
               <p>Arguably the central figure of dissensus in the poem is the “Shape arrayed in mail”
                  (l. 110): </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">A mist, a light, an image rose </div>
                     <div class="l">. . . </div>
                     <div class="l">With step as soft as wind it past </div>
                     <div class="l">O’er the heads of men—so fast </div>
                     <div class="l">That they knew the presence there, <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">And looked,—but all was empty air. (l. 118-21) </div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> At once present and absent, the Shape marks a symbolic break in the poem that marks
                  the shift from (revised) antimasque to masque and, in doing so, allegorizes the formal
                  operation Rancière attributes to the dissensus through which a multitude previously
                  invisible becomes visible. The Shape thereby opens a space in which equality will
                  be inscribed in the staging of a dispute which establishes a community existing solely
                  through its being divided from the status quo via a specifically aesthetic production,
                  “a mist, a light, an image” (l. 102). The voicing of this dispute emerges through
                  the anonymous figure of the “indignant Earth” (l. 139), whose speech evokes a counter-world
                  that directly contrasts the existing one. In its hortatory function, the counter-world
                  evoked in the rhetorical functions of the Earth’s speech enjoins the reader to undertake
                  an aesthetic play in the observation of the poem’s Shape. As Ronald Tetreault points
                  out, the Earth’s speech assumes an “imperative stance,” especially in the jussive
                  refrain for the multitude to “Rise like Lions after Slumber” (205). Emphasis on the
                  imperative is a conventional aspect of the court masque, which finds the “Master of
                  the Revels” giving “commands to the masquers . . . phrased as wishes inviting corresponding
                  actions” (Tetreault 206). Just as Shelley transvalues the masque form, however, so
                  too must the rhetorical status of the poem’s repeated “let” shift in emphasis from
                  command to invitation: “Let a vast assembly be / And with great solemnity / Declare
                  with measured words that ye / Are, as God has made ye, free” (l. 295-98). Insofar
                  as freedom can be declared through “measured words,” Shelley connects the invitation
                  to think the possibility of a counter-world via a poetics that invites its audience
                  to recreate the words of the poet on their own terms, thus rendering poetry itself
                  a proving ground for the equality it desires.</p>
               <p>In the invitational refrain of the “let,” Shelley gestures towards passive resistance
                  as the political index of the experience of form itself. The Shape, as the symbolic
                  hiatus that begins the poem’s hortatory provocation, prefigures a formal “suspension”
                  that will be translated into the multitude’s “folded arms and looks which are / Weapons
                  of unvanquished war” (l. 319-22). Emptying the poem's content of its action, Shelley
                  evokes form as a moment of utter repose that is simultaneously a moment of supreme
                  agitation that reconfigures the distribution of the sensible, linking the promise
                  of political autonomy as self-rule with the autonomy of the “Shape” of the work of
                  art itself, whose measured (s)words signal the work of art’s heteronomy from things
                  as they are. The “let” in turn invites the reader to take up the role of what Rancière
                  calls the “emancipated spectator.” Just as Schiller’s rereading of Kant articulates
                  an aesthetic that is already dissensus, the multitude’s spectatorship before the spectacle
                  of the masque as antimasque, and the subsequent call for nonviolent resistance in
                  the “let,” actively dismantles “the opposition between viewing and acting”: “emancipation
                  begins . . . when we understand that viewing is also an action that [either] confirms
                  or transforms” the existing distribution of positions (Rancière, <em>Emancipated </em>13). As Joseph Tanke explains, for Rancière emancipated art “does not compel viewers
                  to become active” by “dictating the terms of participation”; rather, the formal emptiness
                  and indeterminacy of the Shape requires only “that we insist upon the postulates of
                  equality implied by the aesthetic [regime] of art” (93).</p>
               <p>Shelley also hints at such postulates in more formally “external” ways. Although <em>The Mask</em> appears highly regulated, Shelley employs shifts in the distribution of the poem’s
                  sensible structure and texture that periodically disrupt its apparent uniformity.
                  One such destabilization occurs at the very outset with the pyhrric substitution “As
                  I” slightly modifying the sing-song metre of the poem’s predominant iambic tetrameter;
                  likewise, the frequent use of off-rhyme (“gown-on,” “who-fro” “Hypocrisy-by,” “crown-shone,”
                  and others); the seemingly random distribution of five rather than four line stanzas
                  (stanzas three, thirty-three, thirty-eight, forty-seven, fifty-five, sixty-seven,
                  eighty-two, and the final stanza, ninety-one); and the use of stanzas alternating
                  between one and two principal end-rhymes intermittently strips the veil of familiarity
                  so as to call attention to possible reconfigurations within the poem’s sensible texture.
                  The poem thus affects a play between regularity and irregularity which thematizes
                  the Shape’s ability to bring together opposites, generating an “irregularity in regularity”
                  that turns our attention to the contingency of the existing categories of the sensible,
                  but also towards the paradoxical synthesis of opposites—the violence of nonviolence,
                  the supreme agitation of repose—through which slight displacements in the poem’s formal
                  sensorium provides opportunities to re-shape dominant configurations of the sensible.</p>
               <p>Nonetheless, Shelley also acknowledges that aesthetics cannot fully determine the
                  political effects it would have on its audience. As Mark Kipperman notes, the poet’s
                  speech only directs the masses to the potential of its self-possession; it does not,
                  and cannot, predict its outcome (“Shelley, Adorno”). This anxiety concerning the outcome
                  of the poem’s effects is reflected in the fact that the “sense” awakened by the Shape
                  gives voice and measure to words of both “joy and fear” (l. 138). Hence, the voice
                  deems it necessary to warn the multitude against violent revenge, rendering the poem’s
                  vision for a new collective a prospect for debate over a freedom that is possible
                  and desirable, but also contingent. The voice of the Earth, an-archically democratic
                  in its voicing of a wrong by which the excluded identify immediately with the universal,
                  functions as a dissensus whose manifestation is an invitation and an incitement towards
                  a future possibility that must be incessantly renewed: “words [that] shall then become
                  / Like oppression’s thundered doom / Ringing through each heart and brain, / Heard
                  again—again—again” (l. 364-68). This indefinite circulation of words that must always
                  be heard again, whose transmission remains uncertain in their circulation “outside
                  any determined relationship of address” (Rancière, <em>PL </em>12), thematizes the promise of an an-archic world without hierarchies that constitutes
                  the work of art in the aesthetic regime.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>Rancière’s exploration of the tensions within the aesthetic regime can potentially
                  help us understand both the Romantic period in broader terms, but also hopefully offer
                  a means to push forward the perennial debates surrounding the relationship between
                  politics and aesthetics in Shelley. Rancière’s theorization of the aesthetic regime
                  complicates received conceptions of the relations between politics and aesthetics,
                  offering a more capacious view that departs from any strictly causal determination.
                  As such, the concept of the aesthetic regime opens even more promising horizons with
                  respect to Romantic texts that on their surface may not appear political at all, or
                  conversely, appear to suffer from a desire to instrumentalize poetry as politics.
                  In so doing, one can rethink the “anarchism” of Romantic aesthetics beyond its conventional
                  senses, while retaining and renewing its anti-authoritarian potentialities beyond
                  the antinomy of aesthetic autonomy and political commitment.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">The history of critical reception of <em>The Mask</em> either ignored the poem entirely (Bloom, Wasserman) or dismissed its deliberately
               stripped-down verse as poetically inferior (Webb 93). Even sympathetic appraisals
               by Scrivener, Richard Hendrix, Thomas Edwards, and Stephen C. Behrendt alternately
               characterize Shelley’s blend of “dramatic form” with “political insight” as “imperfect,”
               “contradictory,” and as such potentially damaging to the very causes it seeks to promote
               (Scrivener 199, Hendrix 68, Edwards 161-68, Behrendt 199).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">See especially J. F. Lyotard, <em>Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime</em> (1994). Lyotard politicizes Kant’s ideas on the beautiful and the sublime as “conservative”
               and “radical” modes of aesthetics, respectively. Rancière offers a productive counter-reading
               of this interpretation so as to recuperate a radical politics of the beautiful itself.
               See Rancière, <em>Aesthetics and its Discontents</em>, 88-105.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">The index to American anarchist Benjamin Tucker’s magazine <em>Liberty</em> (1881-1908) lists over twenty references to Shelley. <em>The Mask</em> proved influential for Tucker himself, who frequently editorialized in the pages
               of <em>Liberty </em>concerning the use of violence as a means of overthrowing State power. Shelley was
               also frequently the subject of lectures at the experimental Modern School founded
               in New York in 1911 by anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman (Avrich 121,
               129, 149, 352). “To the Men of England,” sections of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and <em>The Mask</em> were anthologized in popular anarchist texts such as Marcus Graham’s <em>Anthology of Revolutionary Poetry </em>(1929), as well as singled out for praise in Victor Méric’s entry on “Poésie” for
               Sébastien Faure’s <em>Encyclopédie Anarchiste</em> (1934). See also Herbert Read, <em>In Defence of Shelley &amp; Other Essays</em> (1936); Paul Goodman, <em>Speaking and Language: A Defence of Poetry</em> (1972).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
