                <p rend="noCount">Shelley's political legacy passed through an often-neglected
                    school of writers to world leaders and revolutionaries globally in the
                    decades following his death. When assessing his legacy, we should not
                    overlook those early, ardent appreciators known as "the Spasmodic School."
                    Alexander Smith, Sydney Dobell, J. Stanyan Bigg, and even James Thomson B.V.
                    took Shelley's call to a revolution conducted through imaginative sympathy
                    seriously, and together, helped to fan his "fading coal" to flame.</p>

                <affiliation>Northwest University</affiliation></byline>
            <p> Matthew Arnold’s much-derided jibe about ineffectual angels is not the only remark
                on Shelley’s political impotence. Early reviewers were quick to dismiss both his
                radicalism and radical ambition. <emph>The Quarterly Review</emph>, for example,
                compares him (presciently) to a drowning man, flailing his arms about to no avail,
                as Kim Wheatley has shown (8). Wheatley argues that reviewers’ vituperative
                recrimination of his project amounts to a kind of paranoid politics, casting his
                gestures as ineffectual for fear of their possible political power. </p>
            <p> Scholars such as Mark Redfield, Paul Foot, David Duff, and Cian Duffy have recently
                made inroads into recreating the political Shelley, suppressed for so much of the
                century that followed him, and ignored for much of ours. Likewise, Shelley’s
                influence on later poets has been repeatedly, if not comprehensively, remarked
                through the work of Anthony Harrison, Herbert Tucker, and others.</p>
                
                <p> But a
                reconsideration of the political (broadly considered) in Shelley is due in the wake
                of recent scholarship from Slavoj Žižek and Jacques Ranciere, among others, tying
                the political and aesthetic. The bifurcation of those concepts is still very much
                with us. Eugene Stelig wrote in 2013, for example (of Wordsworth), “by the end of
                the decade, the identity conflict between poetry and politics was essentially over,
                having been resolved in favor of the former” (745-6). That attempting to write
                political poetry creates an “identity conflict” is taken for granted. This essay
                considers another dimension of the political in Shelley: not a revolution of the
                mind, nor the moral force of his verse and example, but the <emph>realpolitik</emph>
                carried on in his name, and the politico-poetic revolution he actually enacted. </p>
            <p> Among the most important of Shelley's legacies is the overlooked school of poets
                writing in the years following his death, known at first derisively, and then
                popularly as the "The Spasmodics." The Spasmodics took Shelley as their hero and
                model, and unlike him, lived to see their (his) politico-poetic vision take shape.
                Through the Spasmodics then, Shelley’s trumpet of prophecy sounded to legions of
                readers both in the English literary world and beyond.</p> 
                
                <p>My claims in this essay
                are three: 1) that despite Arnoldian-Victorianist portraits of Shelley as
                politically-ineffectual (and this despite the fact that, whatever his intentions, he
                largely <emph>was</emph> ineffectual during his short life) Shelley’s effect on the
                popular generation of poets immediately following his death was both profound and
                heretofore unremarked, 2) that the most popular school thereof—the Spasmodics—are
                better categorized as a Shelleyan rather than Keatsian, and 3) that this is so in
                part because of their works' political force, despite that modern Victorianist
                critics—like the Victorians before them—call their work “apolitical.”</p>
                <p> This
                reconsideration will, I hope, do a few things for us. It extends work already begun
                by Susan Schmidt and Michael Rossington on Shelley’s reception worldwide in the
                years following his death, especially among the working classes. It also offers a
                glimpse at how early Victorians—Christians, moralists—began the project of
                rehabilitating Shelley’s work, and reputation, making it (if only slightly) more
                palatable for domestic consumption. In that, it participates in conversations on the
                Romantic/Victorian divide hosted by Richard Cronin and Anthony Harrison and gives us
                a picture of how Romantic, and more specifically, Shelleyan, poetics were
                incorporated into what afterward became known as the early part of a new period.
                Some ancillary questions pop up that might be further considered elsewhere: what
                does the Shelleyan poetic project actually look like, as distinct from
                Keatsian/Huntian/Byronic? What would a School of Shelley look like, if not this? </p>

                <p>So far have their magnificent stars fallen, that before saying anything
                    substantive about the Spasmodics, a short introduction is required.<note

                    Philip James Bailey (1816-1902), Sydney Dobell (1824-1874), Alexander Smith
                    (1830-1867), and J. Stanyan Bigg (1828-1865) are the principle authors in this
                    group, but there are other minor writers, and some major ones who can be so
                        classed.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> James Thompson (B.V.), George
                        Gillfilan, Gerald Massey, and J. Westland Marston are also associated with
                        the Spasmodics, as are early Arthur Hugh Clough, Tennyson’s
                            <emph>Maud</emph>, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s <emph>Aurora
                            Leigh</emph>.</note> Understood as inheritors of the Romantic tradition,
                    their work outsold everything in the nineteenth-century apart from Byron, but
                    since they were mostly working-class writers, and because of Victorian critical
                    reaction to late-Romantic epistemology, their fame died quickly by the
                    1860s.</p>
                <p> In their 2004 special issue of <emph>Victorian Poetry</emph>, editors Charles
                    LaPorte and Jason Rudy note that Spasmodism “struck nearly all readers as a
                    demonstrably new mode of poetic composition,” featuring “a wavering between
                    poetic identities—masculine and feminine—virile and susceptible” (422, 424).
                    Herbert Tucker points out their attention to “the sanctity of the moment of
                    heightened perception, and the totality of the truth to which creative poets
                    enjoy privileged if fitful access” (429). Both are expanding on George
                    Saintsbury’s definition of Spasmodism as <quote>a kind of solidifying or at
                        least centripetalizing of the loose and floating endeavours toward something
                        new and strange...by a certain gorgeousness or intricacy of language, by a
                        scrupulous avoidance of the commonplace in subject, by more or less
                        elaborately hinted or expressed unorthodoxy in religion or philosophy.
                        (155)</quote> Though they were extremely popular, especially in the 1850s,
                    it has become fashionable to argue that the Spasmodics do not form anything like
                    a real literary movement. Some say that the Spasmodics “constitute a school only
                    in name” (LaPorte, Rudy 421). Richard Cronin writes that “not until J.H.
                    Buckley’s essay, ‘The Spasmodic School’...in 1966...did the term achieve any
                    substantial content” (142). Buckley’s essay, actually published in 1951 as a
                    chapter in <emph>The Victorian Temper</emph>, argues that “the Spasmodics can be
                    classed together as members of a ‘school’ only insofar as...they subscribed...to
                    a fairly coherent philosophy of incoherence” (43). </p>
                <p> This is not quite true, however. Not only did earlier critics consider the
                    Spasmodics a “school of poetry,” with similar traits and goals and members, but
                    the members themselves seemed to have thought of themselves as belonging to such
                    a group and common project. <emph>The Cambridge History of English
                        Literature</emph> described in 1922—44 years before Cronin’s reference—that
                    they constituted “a fairly definite group, of which...[Bailey] was the leader:
                    the so-called Spasmodics” (147). Contemporary reviews also categorized these
                    same authors as belonging to “a definite group”: an article from <emph>The
                        Leader</emph> in 1854 treats Bigg, Dobell, and Massey under the heading “The
                    Latest School of Poetry.” Smith himself writes in his posthumous collection of
                    essays <emph>Last Leaves</emph>, “While noticing this ebb and flow of poetical
                    reputations, it may not be too much to infer that the oblivion to which the
                    Spasmodic School has been consigned for the last few years has been to a
                    considerable extent undeserved” (174). In fact, <emph>The Scottish Review
                    </emph>wrote of the Spasmodics as early as 1855, "Tennyson can scarcely be said
                    to have founded a school; Bailey has" (347).</p>
                <p> The Spasmodics then, were not “a school only in name” as Rudy, Cronin, and
                    others argue, but were thought of immediately as one, with fixed members and
                    characteristics, and thought of themselves as belonging to one. Although it is
                    true that there isn’t a formal aesthetic charter in place like Shelley’s
                        <emph>Defence of Poetry</emph> or Wordsworth’s prefaces to <emph>Lyrical
                        Ballads</emph> announcing an express purpose, the Spasmodics comprise a
                    coherent school and a serious movement that merits discussion both as a group of
                    individuals working toward a common aesthetic and as a body of work.</p>
                <p> Furthermore, the Spasmodics were not only a school appreciated by the masses but
                    were influences on most of the important poets then living. Charles LaPorte has
                    recently shown how Smith’s aesthetic balance informed and structured Elizabeth
                    Barrett-Browning’s masterwork, <emph>Aurora Leigh</emph>. Heather Morton has
                    shown Spasmodic influence on Swinburne. The Rossettis were ardent admirers.
                    Dobell was a close friend and literary encouragement to the Brontes. And these
                    are just a very few. As will be shown, since they conceived of themselves as
                    Shelley’s wild west wind, blowing change and revolution hither and yon, their
                    widespread poetic influence ought to be considered as part of Shelley’s legacy. </p>
                <p> Finally, the Spasmodics were not only influential poetically, but politically,
                    to which notion we will shortly return in more detail. However little we think
                    of them now, the Spasmodics affected world leaders in Italy, Germany, and
                    Russia, among others, which we can add to Shelley’s attempts at reform in
                    Ireland, England, and Greece, since he can be considered the movement’s
                    progenitor. Some of this work on Shelley’s political influence has been done.
                    Bouthaina Shaaban, for example, maps references to Shelley in the Chartist
                    press, a valuable reference for scholars working either on Shelley’s reception
                    or on Chartism. That Shelley's poetry was read by revolutionaries is not new
                    knowledge, but that his politico-poetic ideals were fleshed out, more or less
                    instantly upon the widespread availability of his poems, is. </p>
                <p> The Spasmodics are referred to by their contemporaries as having belonged to
                    “The School of Keats” (Clough 159). One critic in the <emph>Saturday Review</emph> compared Keats and the Spasmodics
                    under the heading "Poetical Nuisances": <quote>A new poetical school is
                        springing up which ought to be brought under the Nuisances Removal Act. Just
                        as society is trying to put down the bone boilers and glue-makers, so must
                        criticism awaken to its new and dirtier duties. Extirpation is the only
                        remedy. What insults the natural propriety is only to be handed over to the
                        police...Here is a writer who has got hold of...the mannerism of Keats, and
                        the impudence of Leigh Hunt...who is as dull as Bailey, and as sensual as
                        Alexander Smith. (Saturday Review 327)</quote> Critics thought this because,
                    by the 1850s, Keats’ reputation had not sufficiently recovered—in part by Lord
                    Houghton's <emph>Life</emph> in 1856 and the letters thereafter—and to link a
                    writer with him was an insult. The comparison is meant to call up images of the
                    lower classes, effeminacy, escapism, and a kind of unmanly poetic striving for
                    fame.</p>
                <p> Even now scholars set them alongside Keats, thinking they wrote apolitical,
                    escapist verse in an anti-classicist mode. I argue that we've been wrong on both
                    those scores and that “The School of Shelley” is the more appropriate label due
                    to the Spasmodics’ deep engagement with his work and various homages to it, and
                    for their Shelleyan political engagements.</p>

                <head>Resuscitating Shelley</head>
                <p>Among Shelley’s first and most ardent readers were the Chartists. Chartist poet
                    Thomas Frost records how reading Shelley made him “a chartist, and something
                    more” (cited in Sanders 8). W. J. Linton records the reading of Shelley’s
                        <emph>Queen Mab</emph> as one of his formative experiences (cited in Sanders
                    8). If Shelley’s attempts at political insurrection didn’t always materialize,
                    his attempts at poetical insurrection did. Shelley spawned a cadre of
                    imitators—ballad-mongers, rebels—and many of these found their ways to Chartism. </p>
                <p> In what he calls “the Chartist Imaginary,” Mike Sanders shows how poetry was,
                    for that group, no mere decoration but an essential component of the movement,
                    since it “transforms the consciousness of the reader” (9). This is Shelley’s
                    project written on the polis. Sanders explains how exposure to writers like
                    Burns and Shelley created in working-class writers a transformation that was
                    “qualitative and total…it does not alter any specific opinions held by its
                    readers, but is experienced by them as the acquisition of new powers in general”
                    (10).</p>
                <p> Chartist readings of Shelley are important here because many Chartists were also
                    Spasmodics, and vice versa. In fact, some say the movements are
                        indistinguishable.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Except, I argue, that
                        Spasmodism is <emph>primarily</emph> an aesthetic movement that has
                        political overtones, while Chartism is primarily a political one, that has
                        poetic basis. </note> Ernest Jones is the most important of these double
                    agents, since he was widely acknowledged the last leader of the Chartists and is
                    also included among the first Spasmodics. Phyllis Mary Ashraf, who also lists
                    Shelley as an exemplar for Chartists in her <emph>Introduction to Working-Class
                        Literature in Great Britain </emph>also has Ebenezer Jones and Gerald Massey
                    as Chartist poets, which is important, since they are also always listed among
                    Spasmodics. In any case, Spasmodism and Chartism shared numerous members,
                    aesthetics, and concerns.</p>
                <p> Not content simply to read Shelley’s verse, and to espouse his politics, many
                    Spasmodics penned him various forms of homage. James Thomson—the last
                    Spasmodic—is known to history by his <emph>nom de plume</emph>, “James Thomson
                    B.V.,” which serves to distinguish him from the earlier James Thomson, author of
                        <emph>The Seasons</emph>, and to acknowledge his debt to his two heroes.
                    “Bysshe Vanolis” is meant to reference Shelley’s middle name and the German poet
                    Novalis. Thomson writes a defense in 1860 called simply “Shelley,” deriding the
                    harsh treatment Shelley received both during and after his life. Thomson argues,
                        <quote>probably no man of this century has suffered more and more severely,
                        both in person and reputation, from this rash convictive bigotry than Percy
                        Bysshe Shelley. Florence to the living Dante was not more cruelly unjust
                        than England to the living Shelley. (14)</quote> If we have come to
                    recognize this hyper-defensive language with regard to Shelley’s reputation, we
                    should also recognize that much of it comes through the Spasmodics.</p>
                <p>In 1861, Thomson writes a long narrative poem, again called “Shelley,” wherein he
                    both recalls the earlier poet, and imitates his syntax. The poem begins, <quote><lg>
                            <l>UPON a grassy slope of shore I lay</l>
                            <l>Hour after hour, from sunset into night,</l>
                            <l>Outgazing tranquil o'er the tranquil bay,</l>
                            <l>And dreaming in a mood of rare delight.</l>
                            <l>Yes, for some hours, sky-pure sea-calm star-bright</l>
                            <l>My spirit was in tune with heaven and earth,</l>
                            <l>Nor felt the discords of its mortal birth. (1-7) </l>
                        </lg></quote> Shelleyan lyricism pervades Thomson’s poetry, early and late.
                    Nearly 20 years after this publication, still an acolyte, Thomson took Shelley
                    as a guide through atheism and despair in his magnum opus, <emph>City of
                        Dreadful Night (1880)</emph>.</p>
                <p> Thomson was not alone among the Spasmodics in revering Shelley. Sydney Dobell’s
                    lecture, “On the Nature of Poetry,” delivered in Edinburgh in 1857, was a direct
                    answer to Shelley’s <emph>Defence of Poetry</emph>, and his own poems owe much
                    to Shelley’s. Dobell’s friend and collaborator Alexander Smith offered a
                    clear-eyed summary of Dobell’s indebtedness: “Of all recent writers,” Smith
                    writes, “[Dobell] bears the closest resemblance to Shelley. He has much of
                    Shelley’s impracticability, exaggeration, and hectic over-color; he has all
                    Shelley’s subtlety, analytic habit and power, splendor of imagery, dramatic
                    instinct, and rich-flowing lyrical impulse” (189). Smith may be overstating the
                    case, as would be usual, but he’s not far off the mark.</p>
                <p> Though it is possible the Spasmodic poets came independently to appreciations of
                    Shelley, they were likely encouraged so to do by the editor cum patron George
                    Gilfillan (1815-1873). Reverend Gilfillan, an immensely popular minister from
                    Dundee, Scotland, is probably the second most important critic in the early
                    Victorian period, after Carlyle. Like the rest of the Spasmodic School, his
                    reputation has faded, but as author of Walter Scott’s biography and the
                    best-selling <emph>Bards of the Bible</emph>, editor of Robert Burns, and much
                    else, he was for a time a tastemaker without parallel. Gilfillan is often
                    credited with having founded the Spasmodic School, since he was an early
                    supporter of Alexander Smith and Sydney Dobell, to a large extent architecting
                    their careers. </p>
                <p> Gilfillan possessed a remarkable breath of literary taste and was in a position
                    to inflict that taste on others. As LaPorte and Rudy note, “he worked toward
                    broadening the usual horizons of the British poetic tradition” (427). They point
                    out, rightly, that many lesser-known British poets, from Gilfillan’s volume of
                    the same name, have been vindicated by history: <quote>John Gower, Thomas
                        Hoccleve, John Lydgate, Sir John Skelton, George Gascoigne, Sir Philip
                        Sidney, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Donne,
                        Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, Robert Herrick, Catharine
                        Phillips, Andrew Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas
                        Chatterton </quote> are listed there among others (427). He was also a
                    staunch, a radical, supporter of Shelley.</p>
                <p>Though most now condemn Gilfillan's moralizing conservatism, we should recognize
                    how forward was his defense of the Satanic School in the 1830s (Buckley 50).
                    Comparing Shelley to Keats, Gilfillan writes that the former is “superior”
                        <quote>in sustained stateliness, in sounding march, in extent of knowledge,
                        power of intellect, and purity of taste, and free…from [Keats’] babyism of
                        manner, affectations of style, endless sinkings away from the finest
                        eloquence. (90)</quote> Moreover, the preacher directly compares Shelley to
                    the biblical writers, as in the following excerpt. <quote> In somewhat lower,
                        but still lofty regions, we find the same facutly presiding…as in…Shelley.
                        In those writers who had the benefit of inspiration it is the same. Think of
                        Isaiah with his glowing eloquence! Ezekiel with his stupendous visions!
                        (Gilfillan 92)</quote> To call Shelley a prophet—for a minister of the
                    church to call Shelley a prophet—was itself an act of transgression. In the
                    years following his death, before Shelley’s reputation had recovered from early
                    scandal among the Victorian reading public, Gilfillan both sounded his genius to
                    the world and recommended him as an example to the ascendant poets who made up
                    the Spasmodic school.</p>
                <p> The Spasmodics were criticized, as was Shelley, largely for the socio-political
                    instability that their work suggested, and from the same quarters. This claim
                    warrants a more space than I can give it here, but it is easy to imagine how
                    Smith’s epic <emph>A Life-Drama</emph> that crescendos in a rape scene, Dobell’s
                        <emph>Balder</emph> wherein a man kills his wife, might unsettle a
                    conservative readership. Kirstie Blair reads a prejudice in early reviewers,
                    noting how terms like “‘irregular” and “perverted” hint at the potential
                    immorality of this writing, and carry possible connotations of sexual
                    depravity,” a sexual depravity associated in the Victorian mind primarily with
                    Shelley and Byron. </p>
                <p> It is no surprise that the chief critic of Spasmodism, was William Aytoun, Tory
                    and editor at (where else?) <emph>Blackwood’s Magazine</emph> from 1839 to his
                    death in1865. Aytoun wrote damning articles about Shelley and published them
                    alongside damning articles about the Spasmodics, because to him, and to many,
                    they comprised one movement: radicals. Aytoun is also where the term comes from.
                    We owe “Spasmodic” as a specific poetic group to Aytoun, who pilloried these
                    writers under that name in his satire <emph>Firmillian</emph> (1854), but we owe
                    the literary term to Charles Kingsley, who in 1853 used it to describe Shelley’s
                    verse:
                <quote>“and thus arose a spasmodic, vague extravagant, effeminate, school of poetry,
                    which… possess, elements in common with Shelley’s” (51).</quote></p>
                <p> Spasmodic politics were more or less exactly in line with Shelley’s. It was a
                    working-class movement from the beginning. Bailey’s first readers were the
                    gathered printers and mechanics who helped produce the book and thereafter
                    formed a literary club. Smith was himself a pattern-tracer in a Glasgow
                    manufacturing house. Dobell was a religious non-conformist. Bigg was a firebrand
                    editor. Jones was a Chartist. For the most part, they threw themselves into
                    reformist causes with Shelleyan vigor. </p>
                <p> This is important to note because even contemporary scholars have imagined the
                    Spasmodics as merely an aesthetic movement, uninterested in politics. Richard
                    Cronin calls Smith’s work “entirely apolitical,” claiming that “by the time he
                    wrote <emph>A Life-Drama</emph>, Smith had already given up on politics”
                    (“Alexander Smith and the Poetry of Displacement”). </p>
                <p> Cronin here is likely following Arthur Hugh Clough, Matthew Arnold’s friend and
                    fellow Spasmodic detractor. Where Cronin calls Smith “escapist,” and “obsessed
                    with the Kentish countryside,” Clough writes “Yet really, and truth to tell, is
                    it not, upon the whole, an easy matter to sit under a green tree by a purling
                    brook, and indite pleasing stanzas on the beauties of nature and fresh air”
                    (99)? But that is not the Spasmodic project anymore than it is Shelley’s. </p>
                <p> True, Smith had been attending Chartist meetings, participating in a working
                    men’s educational co-op, and editing a reformist journal before publication of
                        <emph>A Life-Drama</emph> (1853), and as Cronin points out, seeing the two
                    Chartists hung in the town square was likely sobering. But his work didn’t leave
                    the political at that point, nor at any other. </p>
                <p> To mark<emph> A Life Drama</emph> as the end of Smith’s political phase is an
                    odd choice, since his very next poetic effort was a collaboration with the
                    Marxist/Chartist Sydney Dobell, called <emph>Sonnets on the War</emph> (1856).
                    There are few more politically engaged collections of poetry in the entire age:
                        <emph>Sonnets</emph> covers British positions on Hungary, America, Italy,
                    and the Crimea, in a pull-no-punches manner. With titles like “The Army
                    Surgeon,” “The Wounded I,” “The Wounded II,” “Vox Populi,” “Sebastapol,” and
                    “The Cavalry Charge,” the charge that the Spasmodics were “apolitical” hard to
                    maintain indeed. </p>
                <p> Neither were these very political young writers simply twittering away in golden
                    bowers about the war. Their poetry was actually read, and, some say, affected
                    the outcome of certain political revolutions. The Italian liberation fighter
                    Guiseppe Mazzini (also friends with another Spasmodic, Ernest Jones) wrote that
                    Dobell’s <emph>The Roman</emph> was the poem he would have written about Italy,
                    had he been a poet (Kierstead 71) . </p>
                <p> We should notice how rare this is. We have poems that interpret or record
                    political events, and ones about revolutionary leaders that are popular with
                    people, but rare is the political poem which is timely and forceful enough to
                    have been read, much less lauded by the leaders of the movement it represents.
                    And the poem was effective, as Christopher M. Kierstead writes. Mentioning
                        <emph>The Roman</emph> as a template for Rossetti’s later confrontation of
                    the “Italian Question,” he argues that Dobell’s poem “was a politically useful
                    means of vindicating the Italian cause in the minds of the British public at a
                    time when it needed reassurance after the downfall of Mazzini’s short-lived
                    Roman Republic in 1849” (71). </p>
                <p> Mazzini continues his exhortation to Dobell, seeming himself to channel Shelley,
                    “and what you write flows from the soul, the all-loving, the all-embracing, the
                    prophet-soul” (qtd. Kierstead 71). “Prophet-soul” is right; in an avocation
                    coincident of “A Song: ‘Men of England,’” Dobell, dropping all poeticisms, wrote
                    in 1867 to the Italian rebels, “Fight! you mad, magnificent, foolish nation”
                    (Ellis 210). Add that Spasmodist Ernest Jones was a personal friend of Karl Marx
                    and Friedrich Engels, and the political range of Spasmodic poetics broadens
                    significantly.</p>
                <p> In a kind of answer to claims that Shelley didn’t accomplish more politically,
                    Kierstead writes, “Ultimately, the poet does not claim for himself the role of
                    leader but instead, the role of instigator—one who senses the greatness of the
                    cause and acts with an almost mystical force in bringing political events to
                    fruition” (71). Mark Kipperman likewise writes defending Shelley’s
                    interventionist political poetry from detractors such as Matthew Arnold and,
                    more recently, Susan Wolfson. He states that Shelley’s hope in <emph>The Mask of
                        Anarchy</emph> for the “moral force of the masses’ protest” involves both a
                    “class demand” for “urgent material needs,” and a renewed “self-respect” in
                    which they, the victims, “stand for the absolute moral order of reciprocal
                    justice” (9). “Self-respect” is the “something more” alluded to by Hood who said
                    that reading Shelley “made me a Chartist, and something more.” The “mystical
                    force” Krierstead mentions is what Kipperman likely has in mind when he answers
                    concerning Shelley’s political potency, <quote>the dream vision of an aristocrat
                        may perhaps constitute a more incisive political analysis than a ballad
                        about the rebel framebreaker, General Ludd. In fact, peculiar though it may
                        seem, Adorno would probably see the dream vision section of Shelley’s poem
                        as even more subversive than its working-class balladry. (4)</quote> I have
                    argued here for a second answer: the poet not only as visionary, but as
                    instigator of visionaries. In the space of a single generation, Shelley had the
                    ear—had in some cases the beating hearts—of world leaders and revolutionaries
                    through the poetry of the Spasmodics, with which movement he was affiliated from
                    the first, which is itself more political than has heretofore been acknowledged,
                    and which in any fair legislation, ought to be trumpeted more broadly still.</p>
