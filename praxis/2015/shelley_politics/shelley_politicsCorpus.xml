               <p>This essay argues for a close relationship between Shelley's
                    aesthetics and the modern concept of nonviolence. By reading Shelley with
                    Theodor Adorno and Jacques Rancière, the essay establishes a critical Romantic nonviolence
                    at the core of their aesthetic theories.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>This essay is motivated by three claims. The first is Percy Bysshe Shelley’s
                claim, dramatized most notably at the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” that
                there is a close relationship between aesthetic experience, political emancipation,
                and what can be called anachronistically nonviolent resistance. The second claim
                belongs to Theodor Adorno, who writes, in an early section of <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>,
                of the “[uniting] of the aesthetic element of form with noncoercion” (7). The third
                claim comprises Jacques Rancière’s definition of “critical art”—“a type of art that
                sets out to build awareness of the mechanisms of domination to turn the spectator
                into a conscious agent of world transformation” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 45)—and
                his delineation of critical art’s formal means: a “suspension of the relations of
                domination” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 36). These three claims are by no means the
                same, but the terms they collectively encompass—aesthetic form, the politics of art,
                the nondominative—indicate, I mean to suggest, an overlooked aspect of the
                historical trajectory of the political possibility of art, beginning with the
                Romantic redefinition of aesthetic experience and practice in the late eighteenth
                and early nineteenth centuries and then taking shape in twentieth-century leftist
                rethinkings of politics and aesthetics in the Marxian dialectical tradition.
                Shelley’s reimagining of political poetry is thus seminal here. In engaging the
                complex historico-political moment of Peterloo, Shelley’s poetry enacts a form of
                critique constitutionally oriented against the violence that defined the day. What
                emerges is not just a politics of nonviolence but an aesthetics of nonviolence: art
                becoming the space, the time, and the form of the noncoercive and nondominative—a
                becoming that Adorno and Rancière help us to think. </p>
                  <p>While “The Mask of Anarchy,” written in response to the news of Peterloo reaching
                Italy, has long been associated with modern nonviolence—from Gandhi’s quoting of
                it to its prefiguring of the lasting images of Tiananmen Square in 1989<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On Gandhi and Shelley, see Weber 28-30. The images
                    of Beijing in 1989 I refer to include the several photographs of the individual
                    known as “Tank Man” by Charlie Coe, Stuart Franklin, Terril Jones, Jeff Widener,
                    and Arthur Tsang Hin Wah.</note>—it has at the same time stood at the center
                of persistent debates over how to measure the politics of a poem. One view might
                celebrate the poem’s overt political statements, including its bracing criticism of
                the British government, its outrage at the use of force against a peaceable
                assembly, and its disdain for Castlereagh, Eldon, and Sidmouth, for example.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For versions of this view, see Cameron 343-50,
                    Holmes 532-540, and Thompson 659.</note> Yet another angle on the poem
                characterizes its political aspirations as, in the end, dubious at best and failed
                at worst, insofar as the poem was too radical for even Leigh Hunt to publish,
                precluding it from effecting material change in England in 1819.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For the most powerful argument along these lines, see Wolfson
                    195-206.</note> What is more, often implicit in this view is a rhetorical
                question: how could a poem ever effect political change? Thus the poem, along with
                others written by Shelley in the wake of Peterloo, brings us up against the larger
                issue of the politics of art: not only how to measure it, but what, in the first
                place, is it? To these questions I might add, as a way of signaling the direction of
                this essay: what can it be?</p>
                  <p>My argument is that one possible answer to these questions resides in our grasp of
                the Romantic construal of the aesthetic as nonviolence, first in Shelley’s poetics
                in the aftermath of Peterloo, and then in the theorizations of art’s “autonomy” and
                “criticality” in Adorno and Rancière, respectively. Indeed, thinking along these
                lines provides a way around, or through, the Scylla and Charybdis of measurable
                efficacy versus naïve idealism that defines the critical history of Shelley’s
                political poetry.</p>

                  <p>Standing behind ongoing debates over the politics of Shelley’s poetry, explicitly
                at times but also implicitly, is the influential distinction—and the generative
                tension—between “committed” art and “autonomous” art that Adorno makes in his
                well-known and much-discussed 1962 essay “Commitment.” While distinguishable from
                tendentious art or the “advocacy of a particular partisan position,” committed works
                of art are identifiable as “vehicles for what the author wants to say” politically
                or philosophically, as in the case of Sartre, whose works “operate with traditional
                plots and exalt them with an unshakable faith in meanings that are to be transferred
                to reality” 81). In contradistinction, autonomous works of art are “determinate
                negations of empirical reality.” This negation is accomplished through the work’s
                governing principle of “inherent structure”—through its “formal law” 92, 89)—which
                allows the work to become “knowledge in the form of a nonconceptual object.”
                Autonomous art can be known through its “intractability,” a primarily formal
                difficulty that “compels the change in attitude that committed works only demand”
                90).</p>
                  <p>The intersection of Adorno’s “Commitment” and Shelley’s 1819 poetics is addressed
                by Robert Kaufman and Mark Kipperman in <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist
                    Poetry, 1819-1820</emph>. Kaufman establishes the influence of Shelley not only
                on Adorno but also on Brecht and Benjamin, as each writer worked out his own ideas
                about the emancipatory potential of art. On this reading, Adorno’s notion of
                “commitment” derives in part from his reading of Shelley—including of Brecht’s
                translations of “The Mask of Anarchy”; what Adorno found in Shelley, Kaufman writes,
                is that “lyric experiment helps construct and make available the
                intellectual-emotional apparatus for accessing, and to that extent helps make
                available the social material of, ‘the new’ (‘the new’ here being understood
                ultimately as the not-yet-grasped features of the mode of production and, in fact,
                all that is emergent in the social)” (Kaufman 19). Shelley’s practice of “lyric as
                experiment” thus functions as a “prerequisite to such subjectivity, critical
                thought, and commitment” as would enable political emancipation (Kaufman 19).
                Suggesting that Adorno is “unfairly hard” on Brecht’s political art in “Commitment,”
                Kipperman carefully recovers the “historicity” of Shelley’s use of satire in “The
                Mask”—the socio-material grounding and penetrating analysis, that is, of Shelley’s
                “committed” poetry of 1819 that frees it from a verdict parallel to the one Adorno,
                fairly or unfairly, delivers on Brecht (Kipperman 5, 7). Through their readings of
                form (lyric) and genre (satire), both Kaufman and Kipperman are able effectively to
                reestablish the force of Shelley’s commitments.</p>
                  <p>Nearly absent in name, though—but most certainly, I must be clear, not in
                spirit—from both of these readings, is the other side of the coin in Adorno’s essay:
                autonomy. In many ways, “Commitment” is a brief for autonomous art over committed
                art, and it locates the emancipatory potential of the aesthetic in its autonomy from
                overt sociopolitical and philosophical commitments. However, as W. J. T. Mitchell
                reminds us, even for Adorno the distinction between autonomy and commitment does not
                result in a “simple choice” between the two: “Commitment, in short, leads to kitsch,
                and formalism [autonomy] leads to academicism. The compulsion and inescapability of
                formalism may lead to an end just as dead as the cul-de-sac of propaganda” (Mitchell
                322-3). Yet in the powerful closing passages of “Commitment,” Adorno turns to
                autonomy, as distinguished from recent French and German examples of “politically
                radical” committed art, in order to delineate the emancipatory potential of the
                aesthetic, and in doing so subtly connects autonomy, and the “politics” it engenders
                or indeed enacts, to nonviolence: 
            <quote> This is not the time for political works of art; rather, politics has migrated into
                the autonomous work of art and it has penetrated most deeply into works that present
                themselves as politically dead, as in Kafka’s parable about the children’s guns,
                where the idea of nonviolence is fused with the dawning awareness of an emerging
                political paralysis (“Commitment” 93-94).</quote>
            Adorno is referring to a set of untitled fragments in Kafka’s Notebook B that were
                given the title “The Appeal” by Max Brod in 1937.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    I wish to thank Jared Green for first identifying “The Appeal” as Adorno’s
                    reference for me. See Kafka, <emph>The Blue Octavo Notebooks</emph> 5-6. On
                    Brod’s titling of the fragments, see Gray 22.</note> The primary fragment
                consists of a first-person narrative by a resident of a tenement building concerning
                an attempt by one of his fellow tenants to organize the residents—for purposes which
                are not stated. The resident making the appeal, quotations from whom occupy nearly
                the entire story, possesses toy guns, which he suggests he and his fellow tenants
                might use in their efforts. This cryptic fragment also makes an appearance in
                Adorno’s dense, lengthy, dialectical essay “Notes on Kafka,” where it is quoted in
                its entirety and interpreted in the following pithy and provocative way: “This is
                the figure of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka”).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The parable, as it appears in Adorno’s essay on Kafka: “‘In our
                    house, this enormous suburban house, a rented barracks overgrown with
                    indestructible medieval ruins, there was proclaimed today, on a misty, icy
                    winter morning, the following call to arms: “Fellow Tenants, I possess five toy
                    guns. They are hanging in my closet, one on each hook. The first is mine, the
                    rest are for anyone who wants them. Should there be more than four, the others
                    will have to bring their own weapons and deposit them in my closet. For there
                    will have to be unity; without unity we will not move forward. Incidentally, I
                    only have guns which are entirely useless for any other purpose, the mechanism
                    is ruined, the wads are torn off, only the hammers still snap. Therefore, it
                    will not be very difficult to procure more such weapons should they be needed.
                    But fundamentally, I will be just as happy, in the beginning, with people who
                    have no guns. Those of us who do, will, at the crucial moment, take the unarmed
                    into our midst. This is a strategy which proved itself with the first American
                    farmers against the Indians; why shouldn’t it prove itself here as well, since
                    the conditions are, after all, similar? We can even forget about guns, then, for
                    the duration, and even the five guns are not absolutely necessary, and they will
                    be used simply because they are already here. If the other four do not want to
                    carry them, then they can forget about them. I alone will carry one, as the
                    leader. But we shouldn’t have a leader, and so I, too, will destroy my gun our
                    lay it aside.” That was the first call to arms. In our house no one has the time
                    or desire to read such calls, much less consider them. Soon the little papers
                    were swimming along in the stream of dirt which originates in the attic, is
                    nourished by all the corridors, and spills down the stairs to struggle there
                    with the opposing stream that swells upward from below. But a week later came a
                    second call: “Fellow Tenants! So far no one has reported to me. I was, insofar
                    as the necessity of earning my living allowed, constantly at home, and during
                    the time of my absence, when the door to my room was always left open, a sheet
                    of paper lay on my table on which anyone who so desired could enroll. No one has
                    done so.”’ This is the figure of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka”
                    224-5).</note> That is, while existing as or containing “the figure of
                revolution,” the parable is nonetheless “politically dead,” a deadness that can be
                understood as having no political meanings transferable to reality, no
                representational or mimetic ties to the political, material, empirical world. In
                other words, to focus on the parable’s depiction of, say, the implied
                power-relations between the renters and their landlord; to consider those relations
                allegorical of some other set of power-relations in society; to take heart in the
                attempt to organize and build solidarity through the two “calls to arms” despite
                their being unanswered—would be, it seems, to miss the work’s actual criticality.
                The “figure of revolution” resides not in these commitments but primarily in the
                parable’s formal resistance to those commitments and the ideologies of exchange with
                which they are necessarily bound. If one recalls Adorno’s critique of Sartre in
                “Commitment,” one can begin to see how a work such as “The Appeal” might function
                differently. Sartre’s works “operate with traditional plots and exalt them with an
                unshakable faith in meanings that are to be transferred to reality” (“Commitment”
                81), Adorno writes. Not only is Kafka’s parable structured without a standard plot
                or narrative framework, but it also, through both the mediation of the narrative
                voice and the recursivity of the quoted appeals themselves—such that the appeals are
                not even transferable to their own immediate social reality in the fiction of the
                story—strays far from any codified political meaning or effect. The layers of
                “political paralysis” Adorno sees in the fragments thus begin to emerge. The
                narrative logic of the appeals (especially the longer first appeal) is awkwardly
                self-negating: the appellant’s initial calls for the miming of violence, his
                puzzling use of historical analogy, and his ultimate anxiety over promoting himself
                as a leader all work to discredit his politics as well as to render the cause
                utterly devoid of the means to intervene in and affect the situation. No one takes
                up the call to arms: “In our house no one has the time or desire to read such calls,
                much less to consider them” (“Notes on Kafka” 225).</p>
                  <p>Yet what should not be missed here is Adorno’s connecting of the formal autonomy
                of the work of art—the very “figure of revolution”—with “the idea of nonviolence.” A
                baseline formulation of this relationship would be that the difference between the
                autonomous work and reality—the work’s very autonomy—is marked and defined in terms
                of the violence of “the practical world,” a phrase Adorno uses in this context in
                    <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>. Hence the negation of the violent means of
                practical politics in Kafka’s parable achieved through form: it is not the political
                content or justification of the call to arms (which we do not know) that matters as
                much as its form, its status as a call to arms in the first place. In this way, we
                see the “idea of nonviolence” in “The Appeal” as the parable resists dramatizing a
                world wherein a call to arms, the use of toy guns, and a false analogy work as
                political methods—which is to say, the entire parable resists the coercion and
                domination that constitute everyday practical politics.</p>
                  <p>A look at Adorno’s centenary address on Mahler, given in Vienna in 1960, two years
                before “Commitment” was published, offers further insight into the relationships
                among the formal features of works of art, their political possibilities, and their
                emancipatory nonviolence. Adorno brings the address to a close with a discussion of
                Mahler’s variation technique. Rather than purely academic variation for the sake of
                variation, Adorno argues, the individual “functional elements” of Mahler’s music are
                “too independent, too evidently living beings in process” such that variation and
                deviation “transforms the identical into the nonidentical” (“Mahler” 94-5). These
                functional figures of deviation and variation contain the substance of Mahler’s
                music: as they “emerge, persist, and disappear” they become, in a memorable phrase,
                “figures of disintegration” 95-6) What is formulated in such figures of
                disintegration, Adorno goes on to suggest, is what he calls Mahler’s “nonviolent
                violence,” akin to “the power of a true humanity” (96). That is, the figural
                disintegration of Mahler’s variation technique mimes violence but nonetheless,
                crucially, resists the totalizing violence of ideological integration. Mahler’s
                music “follows the notes where they lead,” Adorno writes, “from a sense of
                identification with those who are cruelly knocked about and forced into line by
                aesthetic norms and indeed by civilization” 96). The criticality of this nonviolent
                violence rests upon the political possibility of resisting—through a formal,
                nonrepresentational identification with “the victims”—the imposition of the norms of
                the world of domination.</p>
                  <p>In <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>, Adorno fleshes out the relationship between
                form and the nonviolent:
            <quote>[Form] is the nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that nevertheless preserves it as
                what it is in its divergences and contradictions, and for this reason form is
                actually an unfolding of truth. A posited unity, it constantly suspends itself as
                such; essential to it is that it interrupts itself through its other just as the
                essence of its coherence is that it does not cohere. In its relation to its
                other—whose foreignness it mollifies and yet maintains—form is what is anti-barbaric
                in art; through form art participates in the civilization that it criticizes by its
                very existence. Form is the law of the transfiguration of the existing, counter to
                which it represents freedom. (143)</quote>
            Adorno makes several large claims for the sociopolitical possibilities of aesthetic
                form here: form represents freedom, form is the anti-barbaric aspect of art, and
                form is how art can offer a critique of the world of which, despite being
                autonomous, it nonetheless remains a part. The nonviolent synthesis that defines
                form becomes, on the other end of the process of aesthetic construction and
                experience, a force of anti-barbarism—at the very least its enactment or miming—in
                society. What is nonviolent, and hence what is pitched against the barbarism of
                civilization, is the resistance of art through its form to a reductive, pernicious,
                and ideological social totality. Only through enlivening and maintaining the
                divergences, contradictions, and incoherences of existence may art register a
                critical politics.</p>

                  <p>A coherence that does not cohere is an apt way to characterize the unique
                form—and, ultimately, the critical politics—of Shelley’s sonnet “England in 1819,”
                which stands, next to “The Mask of Anarchy” and Shelley’s other post-Peterloo
                political poetry, at the heart of ongoing debates in Romantic studies over how to
                read the politics of a work of art. Indeed, even more so than “The Mask,” Shelley’s
                sonnet has been celebrated for its foregrounding of and achievement in poetic form
                by at least two of the most important formalist studies of Romantic poetry. Of form
                and content in this Shelley’s “greatest sonnet,” Stuart Curran writes, “the melding
                . . . appears seamless” yet “ultimately . . . is a paradox”: “the informing idea of
                this marriage is an impossibility: the subject, as Shelley conceives it, is pitted
                against the form itself” (54-5). “The form,” Curran concludes, “symbolically
                consumes itself, as surely as the society it catalogs” (55). While noting the
                “forceful . . . play against formal prescription” in among other places the sonnet’s
                syntax and deployment of a pivotal concluding couplet, Susan Wolfson points to the
                “uncertain effect” of the formal means Shelley uses to shape this attempt at
                political intervention (204). In the end, Wolfson finds “indeterminacy” and
                “undecidability” at the heart of the sonnet, such that “the charge to Shelley’s
                readers is to see how this poetic form keeps the [political] possibilities in
                tension” (Wolfson 205). </p>
                  <p>Taken together, Curran’s and Wolfson’s formalist readings can instigate a new
                angle on the critical-political possibilities of Shelley’s sonnet if we recall
                Adorno’s articulation of form as a “nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that
                nevertheless preserves it as what it is in its divergences and contradictions.” That
                is, the posited, paradoxical and ultimately unsuccessful (by some measures) marriage
                of aesthetic form and sociopolitical content identified by Curran, and the
                unresolved and ultimately irresolvable semantic and structural tensions analyzed by
                Wolfson—contradictions and divergences enlivened by acts of formalist criticism—do
                not necessarily indicate that the sonnet lacks political possibilities. Conversely,
                it is in the resistance of the sonnet to the identity of form and content, and then
                to the ideology implied by the very notion of resolution—as if, that is, the
                violence of Peterloo and all that it revealed about England in 1819 could ever yield
                a resolution that was not effectively a continuation of a violently repressive
                status quo—that we can locate the beginnings of the sonnet’s dialectical
                criticality. Indeed, James Chandler’s important reading of the historicist
                self-consciousness informing the “ambiguity, paradox, and paranomasia” in Shelley’s
                “experiment with the form of the sonnet” is a powerful example of such political
                possibility, as the poem enacts a “commitment to the notion of changing history
                    <emph>by</emph> interpreting it” (31).</p>
                  <p>Yet I wish to suggest that the political possibility defining the sonnet’s formal
                intricacies, and thus also undergirding the nuanced formalist readings it has
                engendered, is a Romantic political aesthetic of nonviolence. That is to say, the
                poem resists the barbarism of late 1819 in England not by declaring its commitments
                to radicalism and to reform but rather by staking out its autonomy from the coercive
                methods of practical politics, from the self-defeating violence of revolutionary
                politics—from, in short, the entire economy of instrumental rationality, which, for
                Shelley, serves as the structural or objective source of events such as Peterloo. </p>
                  <p>The poem enacts an aesthetics of nonviolence in a number of ways, beginning from
                its well-established and often-remarked-upon resistance to the inherited norms of
                the sonnet tradition. While we know both that the rhyme-based organization of this
                sonnet may be unprecedented and that Shelley employs (or at the very least alludes
                to) the thematic pivot of the hallmark closing couplet of the English sonnet
                tradition, these formal idiosyncrasies continue to bear revisiting for the new
                avenues they open up. The rhyme scheme divides the poem into two sections, though
                not in the traditional octave-sestet manner of a Petrarchan sonnet. Rather,
                Shelley’s poem is organized as a six-line section (rhyme scheme:
                <emph>ababab</emph>) followed by an eight-line section (rhyme scheme:
                    <emph>cdcdccdd</emph>), essentially, one might say, a kind of inversion of the
                Italian form once we grasp that the rhyme in the closing couplet originates in the
                eighth line of the poem.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephen Behrendt notes
                    that Shelley inverts the Petrarchan form in another sonnet, “[Lift not the

                fainting country” (5), the closing “octave” hinges on the introduction of “a people”

                  <p>“A people” begins the second and final sentence of the poem, its second section,
                its octave, and thus here the sonnet might enjoin us to locate its volta. However,
                the introduction of “a people” in line seven functions as a false volta, for rather
                than representing the counterpoint that might be implied by the new section it
                announces in the poem, it merely joins the chronicle of ills plaguing England in
                1819. In other words, the “people” are part of a detailed list—what Curran calls
                Shelley’s “pointillist survey” (55)—that includes a “despised and dying King,”
                “Princes,” “Rulers,” “an army,” “laws,” “Religion,” and a “senate.” “Starved and
                stabbed,” the “people” are identified as the victims of violence—“th’untilled field”
                likely alludes to Peterloo—but the poem’s formal insistence on not granting them the
                status of volta, of not locating political agency or possibility in the
                straightforward solidarity implied by simply the declaration of “a people,” conveys
                the structural nature of the violence characterizing England in 1819. One cannot
                point alone to the king, to parliament, to the army, to the laws, or even to the
                people in order to obtain purchase on the “tempestuous day” post-Peterloo. Rejecting
                standard political attributions of causality and agency by way of resisting the
                aesthetic laws—“golden and sanguine”—of the sonnet form, the poem alternatively
                arranges the various factors of the condition of England in 1819 in constellar
                relations. </p>
                  <p>It is through the positing of such relationality, a set of formal moves that
                refuses the existing self-defeating and pernicious explanatory paradigms, that we
                can continue to chart the poem’s aesthetics of nonviolence, present in both form
                (the poem’s autonomy) and content (the poem’s commitments). On one level of the
                sonnet’s logic, the necessity of “blood” to sustain the status quo will also cause
                the downfall of those who hold power, as kings and princes eventually will “drop,
                blind in blood, without a blow.” Yet on the level of form, the effect of their fall
                is rendered null by its placement as the conclusion of the poem’s opening sestet, in
                other words, as the moment prior to the false volta of “a people.” Reinforced by the
                full stop, the end of line six might normally produce anticipation of the
                contrapuntal gesture of the next section. But “a people” becomes part of what
                amounts to the political paralysis of England in 1819 depicted by Shelley’s
                experimentation with the forms and norms of the sonnet. Progress will not come with
                intervention as it is traditionally understood in the liberal-reformist or even the
                radical political lexicon. The mere “dropping” of tyrants and rulers is not
                emancipatory, for domination has taken the institutionalized form of the “laws which
                tempt and slay.” The laws “slay” in their alliance with God and King, as the
                contemporaneous “Mask of Anarchy” makes clear. But more balefully they “tempt” those
                seeking political progress to rely upon them only, inevitably, to “slay” those who
                seek redress.</p>
                  <p>The sonnet refuses to advocate insurrection, for “an army” as metonymy of force
                is a “two-edged” self-defeating political means; nor does the sonnet yield a
                positive alternative program of political action. Rather, the poem’s formal play, an
                instance of what Kaufman identifies as Shelley’s “lyric as experiment,” stands as a
                critique of the violence of post-Peterloo politics in England. All of the items on
                Shelley’s list—the “rulers” as well as the “people,” the “army” as well as the
                “laws”—turn out to be “graves from which a glorious Phantom may / Burst, to illumine
                our tempestuous day.” Indeed, the poem famously pivots, in the closing couplet, upon
                a modal auxiliary that expresses possibility. It is often noted that Shelley here
                retains the English sonnet’s central formal feature. But Shelley’s allusion to
                tradition is complex. The poem certainly contains a concluding set of two rhymed
                lines through which, in terms of both form and content, the problems articulated by
                the preceding twelve lines are recast. However, its rhyme is not new: “may” and
                “day” repeat the “c” rhyme of the pattern charted above, recalling “prey” and “slay”
                from the second group of rhymes in the poem. What is more, the closing couplet is
                preceded by another couplet, this one determined by the rhyme of “sealed” and
                “unrepealed.” One might then venture to say that Shelley’s sonnet in fact concludes
                with two consecutive couplets in another parry against the violence of aesthetic
                norms. Yet one might also find the relationship of the concluding couplet to the
                rest of the poem—of, we might say, the very possibility of emancipation to the
                society from which emancipation is necessary; of the “glorious Phantom” to the
                “th’untilled field”—thus resistant to extant aesthetic, explanatory, and political
                forms. The couplet, connected to the preceding lines by way of rhyme (its
                commitments) and separate from those lines by way of its functional allusion to
                sonnet tradition (its autonomy), creates, through its formal relations—its
                nonviolent violence—the space wherein the diffuse material of England in 1819 may be
                constellated rather than determined.</p>

                  <p>In the broadest terms, Shelley’s aesthetics of nonviolence ultimately rests on
                the resistance of the work of art to incorporation into the social totality: the
                resistance, we might say, of “England in 1819” to England in 1819. This resistance
                is achieved primarily through form, and it can properly be called nonviolence
                insofar as the society and attendant politics against which it pitches itself are
                defined by, and effectively carry out, domination. The nature of the relationship of
                art to domination is central to Rancière’s conception of critical art, which takes
                us further in imagining the unique political possibilities therein. “In its most
                general expression,” Rancière writes, “critical art is a type of art that sets out
                to build awareness of the mechanisms of domination to turn the spectator into a
                conscious agent of world transformation” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 45). Beginning
                from the Romantic-age notions of free appearance and free play in Schiller, and from
                the suspension of the power of the sensible experienced by the spectator before an
                idle work of art, Rancière argues for a critical difference between two realms: the
                sensorium of art and the sensorium of domination. This distinction between sensoria
                is, in turn, the way in which art can have a politics: in fact, Rancière argues that
                a specific politics is consubstantial with the suspension of the cognitive power of
                the understanding that defines aesthetic experience. The suspension “defines that
                which comes within the province of art through its adherence to a sensorium
                different to that of domination” (30). “It is,” Rancière continues, “as an
                autonomous form of experience that art concerns and infringes on the political
                division of the sensible” (32). </p>
                  <p>A work of art achieves its criticality through the “redistribution of the
                sensible,” a key idea in Rancière’s aesthetic theory. In other words, art consists
                in constructing spaces and relations to reconfigure materially and symbolically the
                territory of the common. A work of art exists as the place wherein the relations
                among bodies, images, times, spaces, “all the self-evident facts of perception based
                on the set of horizons and modalities of what is visible and audible as well as what
                can be said, thought, made or done” are reconfigured (<emph>Politics</emph> 89).
                Such a repartitioning of the realm of the sensible, effected by the status, the mere
                existence, of works of art as objects of sensory experience, names the emancipatory,
                nonviolent politics of art for Rancière. “Art is not, in the first instance,”
                Rancière writes, 
            <quote> political because of the messages and sentiments it conveys concerning the state of
                the world. Neither is it political because of the manner in which it might choose to
                represent society’s structures, or social groups, their conflicts or identities. It
                is political because of the very distance it takes with respect to these functions,
                because of the type of space and time that it institutes, and the manner in which it
                frames this time and peoples this space” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 23).</quote>
            A dramatic “redistribution of the sensible” is, indeed, an apt way to
                characterize the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” the work that remains at
                the center of our conversation on the politics of Shelley. In the poem, a figure
                called Hope places herself down in front of Anarchy’s violent procession—an act of
                nonviolence that eerily predicts future acts and images of nonviolence, from Gandhi
                and King to “Tank Man” in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Hope’s nonviolence creates space
                and also, quite literally, reconfigures time in the poem. The positional word
                “between” identifies the space that now exists between Hope and Anarchy’s triumph;
                into this space “a mist, a light, an image rose.” The arising of the mist, light,
                image is predicated on, though very near simultaneous with, the creation of space.
                The simile-laden description of the Shape, which amounts to six ballad stanzas of
                figural deviation technique, also establishes an alternative experience of time
                insofar as the surface level experience of time (the time of reading; the time of
                rhythm and meter) in the poem is given over wholly to the Shape and the multitude’s
                compulsion to witness it. </p>

                  <p>We are united with the multitude as we read the poem; we are suspended in the
                time and space of the work’s sensorium, which has replaced the sensorium of violence
                and domination represented by Anarchy’s procession. One might say that Shelley
                dramatizes the repartitioning of the sensible. The sensory experience of the Shape,
                the experience begat by Hope’s originary nonviolence, remains autonomous: the
                multitude’s looks and “thoughts”—new thoughts, thoughts detached from and not
                emerging from Anarchy’s reign of God and King and Law—“spring up.” Thoughts whose
                content is not told, I should add, as if Shelley is asking us here to consider the
                very form of the new more so than its content.</p>
                  <p>Of course, while the multitude is idly and freely engrossed in the organic
                deviations and variations of the Shape, Anarchy and the rest of the procession meet
                their end, and the multitude is emancipated from the violence and domination of
                Anarchy’s reign. The poem is suggesting the veritable equivalence and
                simultaneousness of aesthetic experience, nonviolence, and the possibility of
                political change. One does not cause the others; rather, as Rancière and Adorno
                would argue, albeit with different inflections, one indeed amounts to the others: a
                nonviolent, autonomous aesthetic experience, an experience of the power of form, is
                the only politics of poetry. In reconfiguring the sensible, a work of art can simply
                refuse to play by the rules of, and thus resist, the violence of the world.</p>

               <p>In 2001, the <emph>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</emph> published a volume
                    devoted to politics in Shelley titled <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist
                        Poetry, 1819-1820</emph>. The volume comprises essays by Samuel Gladden,
                    Robert Kaufman, and Mark Kipperman, which, taken together and along with the
                    introduction by volume editor Michael Scrivener and the embedded responses by
                    Steven Jones, carefully articulate—and necessarily complicate—what Marc Redfield
                    has called “one of Romanticism’s greatest legacies: how to think of the
                    political force of literary texts” (150). Gladden’s analysis of political and
                    revolutionary bodies in <emph>Oedipus Tyrannus; or, Swellfoot the Tyrant</emph>;
                    Kaufman’s delineation of a “literary trajectory” linking Shelley to the
                    theorists involved in and the artists connected to Frankfurt School critical
                    aesthetics; and Kipperman’s re-grounding of “The Mask of Anarchy” in the
                    iconology of its moment—each foreground implicitly Redfield’s generative
                    question by homing in on Shelley’s political poetry in the wake of the Peterloo
                    Massacre in August 1819. And rightly so. As James Chandler has put it,
                    “‘Peterloo’—like ‘The French Revolution’ on a higher scale or even
                    ‘Romanticism,’ itself on a scale yet higher still—names an event of
                    indeterminate duration that marks a transformation in the practices of modern
                    literary and political representation, one understood in its moment to have
                    revolutionary potential” (18). A crisis in the theory and practice of
                    representation both political <emph>and</emph> literary, that is, along with a
                    palpable sense of the emancipatory possibilities latent in this confluence of
                    the political and the literary, then, demarcate the situation of 1819-20 into
                    which Shelley sought to intervene with his poetry and prose.</p>
               <p>Yet what does it mean—what could it mean—for a work of art to intervene in its
                    immediate political context? What do we mean when we label a set of poems
                    “interventionist”? Does the adjectival usage foreclose the judgment as to
                    whether or not a work has, in actuality, intervened—or, perhaps more aptly, on
                    whether or not it is even able to intervene, thus relegating the label
                    “interventionist” to the level of stated intention? Shelley is perhaps more
                    slippery on the subject of just how he imagined his writing to affect politics
                    than we have given him credit for. As he articulated in a number of places in
                    1819 and 1820, Shelley certainly intended his work to intervene in at least a
                    basic sense of the term. It is well known that many of his post-Peterloo
                    efforts, including “The Mask of Anarchy,” were part of what he described—that
                    is, what he pitched—to Leigh Hunt as “a little volume of popular songs
                        <emph>wholly political</emph>, destined to awaken and direct the imagination
                    of the reformers” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2, 191). Here Shelley foresees his poems
                    affecting the “imagination”—not the actions or the strategies—of a specific
                    group of individuals, the political and intellectual leaders of the reform
                    movement. What is more, “wholly political” seems to imply that his other poems
                    from this period, those not intended for the “little volume of popular songs,”
                    must be at least partially “political.” Indeed, in the preface to the lyrical
                    drama <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>, published in 1820, Shelley acknowledges
                    his personal commitment to reform but specifies that “it is a mistake to suppose
                    that I dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of
                    reform,” before going on famously to say “didactic poetry is my abhorrence”
                    (Shelley 209). “Solely” here suggests, I think, that reform nonetheless remains
                    a commitment of Shelley’s poetry, even when its antididactic aim is to offer
                    “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209).</p>
               <p>These two representative attempts by Shelley, originating in the crucible of
                    post-Peterloo British letters, to articulate the relationship between poetry and
                    politics implicate his work in a longer conversation to which Adorno contributed
                    the terms “commitment” and “autonomy” in “Commitment,” his response to Sartre’s
                        <emph>What is Literature?</emph> Committed or interventionist art would be
                    “wholly political,” aimed at the “reformers” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2, 191) and
                    at the “direct enforcement of reform (209)”; autonomous art might be described
                    as “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209). As Scrivener writes in the
                    Introduction to <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist Poetry,
                    1819-1820</emph>, “the very word and category, ‘interventionist,’ is still vexed
                    by the . . . binary opposition of escapist and interventionist, idealist and
                    materialist, [and] resurrects a debate in which Adorno seems to have had the
                    last word, but one has to emphasize ‘seems.’” Indeed, the deep insights of the
                    previous <emph>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</emph> volume on Shelley’s
                    politics reside in the ability of the contributions, along with the responses by
                    Steven Jones, to think through and then beyond what Scrivener calls the
                    “antimony of commitment and autonomy”—to activate, that is, the Shelley whose
                    poetry can be “both autonomous and interventionist.” </p>
               <p>The present volume sustains the necessity of seeing through and beyond this
                    antinomy by continuing the work of rereading and reimagining the political in
                    Shelley’s writings and his legacy. Indeed, as Mischa Willett demonstrates, the
                    Victorian appropriation of Shelley’s ouevre into a binary of Matthew Arnold’s
                    “ineffectual angel” on the one hand and, on the other, G. B. Shaw’s Shelley who
                    penned the “Chartist Bible” leaves out a crucial feature of Shelley’s Victorian
                    reception: the Spasmodics, whose indebtedness to Shelley comprises both a
                    radical aestheticism and a critical politics, whereby the former provides the
                    foundation of the latter. Often read apolitically and under the sign of Keats,
                    the Spasmodic School is more accurately identified as Shelleyan, Willett argues.
                    If, as Willett suggests, Sydney Dobell’s Spasmodic and Shelleyan <emph>The
                        Roman</emph> (1850) inspired Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian liberation
                    leader, can we term this effect an intervention into politics by the spirit of
                    Shelley? A similar question should be asked of the influence of Shelley’s ideas,
                    mediated indeed by their Victorian reception, on the nonviolence of Mohandas K.
                    Gandhi—a lineage that informs Borushko’s argument in the present volume for a
                    close relationship, smithied in Shelley’s post-Peterloo poetics and then shaped
                    in twentieth-century forms of political and aesthetic resistance, between art
                    and nonviolence.</p>
               <p>Michael Demson’s essay returns us to Britain in the aftermath of Peterloo, where
                    the stakes of an author’s commitments and attempts at intervention come sharply
                    into focus. Demson tells the story of “John Cahuac, a radical London publisher,
                    who was effectively silenced and removed from any political discourse, and the
                    fate of his satirical writings, almost entirely forgotten today.” As Demson
                    contextualizes with rich comparative detail, both Cahuac and Shelley, coming
                    from dramatically different class positions, turned to seditious satire in the
                    months after Peterloo. Cahuac’s forgotten works, which he wrote as well as
                    published himself, include a defiant open letter to Lord Sidmouth and a pamphlet
                    titled “Who killed Cock Robin?: a satirical tragedy, or hieroglyphic prophecy on
                    the Manchester Blot!!!” These and other of Cahuac’s writings aimed ultimately,
                    as Shelley’s attempts at satire also aimed, Demson argues, to awaken the popular
                    imagination to the need for political solidarity. But Cahuac was tried at least
                    twice for seditious libel in his career, and in 1823 he was convicted of
                    stealing an octavo edition of Lingard’s <emph>History of England</emph> (which
                    he claimed he owned legally), for which he was sentenced to fourteen years
                    transportation and sent to Van Dieman’s Land. He never returned. “Why crush a
                    starving bookseller?,” Demson quotes Shelley writing to Leigh Hunt, for thereby
                    “tyrants . . . strike in his person at all of their political enemies” and
                    “divert the attention of the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive
                    Government.” One could say that tyranny crushed Cahuac, and, as Demson argues
                    and implies on a broader scale, one could also say that such actions forced
                    Romantics and post-Romantics, including Shelley and those who take up his
                    mantle, to imagine new forms of interventionist art. </p>
               <p>The essays by Borushko, Lambier, and McGeough turn to the sensorium as the locus
                    of new political possibilities in Shelley’s work. Borushko’s argument for the
                    immanent nonviolence of art—differently inflected in Shelley, Adorno, and
                    Jacques Rancière—relies upon, in the end, the resistance of aesthetic form to
                    the existing order of the sensible. Through such resistance, a work of art at
                    the same time reorders the realm of the sensible by virtue of its very
                    existence. Indeed, this resistance and consequent redistribution, dramatized so
                    aptly in “The Mask of Anarchy,” names what Rancière identifies as the truly
                    critical politics of art. Rancière, whose writing on art and politics motivates
                    not only Borushko’s but also Lambier’s and McGeough’s essays, challenges us
                    finally to see past older, antinomian versions of the politics of a poem. In
                    other words, Rancière enjoins us to move beyond “the relationship of the poet
                        <emph>to</emph> politics” and “the presence of politics <emph>in</emph> the
                    poem” in order to conceive “the very politics <emph>of</emph> the poetry, the
                    manner in which poetry configures the space in which its productions are
                    inscribed” (240). Lambier’s strategy to push this conversation forward locates
                    Shelley’s thought in the debates surrounding rights in the Romantic age.
                    Centrally, Lambier demonstrates that criticisms such as Hazlitt’s of Shelley—“I
                    think he is chargeable with extreme levity,” Hazlitt writes—intersect with the
                    language of critics in the legal-rights camp of natural rights theorists, such
                    as Shelley, according to Lambier, whose work is a part of what Lynn Hunt has
                    characterized as the invention of human rights. Shelley’s poetry and prose thus
                    participates in the extension of rights to those groups who are excluded by the
                    narrower circle drawn by constitutionalist interpretations of rights
                    declarations.</p>
               <p>McGeough’s contribution to the volume is another example of this. His ability to
                    find in Shelley an “aesthetics of anarchism”—ultimately a reading of political
                    form before, or as determinative of, political content—offers a new angle on a
                    perennial issue in the critical conversation on Shelley’s politics: his
                    relationship to the anarchist tradition. In a review essay from 1985, William
                    Keach, reflecting on important advances in scholarship on Shelley’s politics by
                    Michael Scrivener and P. M. S. Dawson, notes that both works reveal “the
                    limitations of characterizing Shelley as an anarchist,” not only because of the
                    distance between our definition of the term and Shelley’s use of it, but also
                    because of the influence on Shelley of Thomas Paine’s—more so than William
                    Godwin’s—views of government (126). Complicating this binary of Paine or Godwin
                    but encompassing both possibilities, McGeough establishes the “dissensus,” a
                    term from Rancière that both McGeough and Lambier place in conversation with
                    Shelley, which appears in “The Mask of Anarchy” with the emergence of the “Shape
                    arrayed in mail” that resists the ordering, the violent consensus, of the
                    sensible established by Anarchy’s procession. In Lambier’s essay, it is
                        <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> wherein Shelley stages dissensus: “the
                    epipsyche of aesthetic experience places two senses of the world side by side,
                    the prevailing order and a virtual alternative, thus opening up new
                    possibilities for reconfiguration.” </p>
               <p>On this point, the retrojection of Rancière’s notions of “dissensus” and the
                    redistribution of the sensible onto Shelley’s works from 1819-1820, Lambier’s
                    essay unites with Borushko’s and McGeough’s in their attempts to think beyond
                    the old impasse between Shelley’s commitments and his moments of artistic
                    autonomy. Indeed, the essays by Demson and Willett join the others in charting
                    new political possibilities in our estimation of Shelley’s body of work—pathways
                    that take us back to post-Peterloo repression through to the Victorian
                    Shelleyans, and then forward to Rancière’s post-Marxism.</p>

               <p>Given the resurgence of interest in the relation between Shelley’s political essays
                and poetry, what concept of relationality can be posed to move beyond an old,
                entrenched opposition between the social commitment of prose and the abstract
                withdrawal of poetry to theorize a novel form of “political poetics”?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent reevaluations of Shelley’s political prose
                    and poetry can be found in edited collections by Alan M. Weinberg and Timothy
                    Webb, Darby Lewes, and Michael Scrivener.</note> In what ways do Shelley’s
                reflections on the history of modern revolution inform his ideas of literary
                experience and political subjectivity? How, moreover, does Shelley’s work provoke
                what he describes in <emph>A Defence of Poetry</emph> (1821) as “a beneficial change
                in opinion or institution” through aesthetic experience (535), without falling prey
                to an escapist flight into inwardness?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All
                    references to Shelley’s poetry and <emph>A Defence of Poetry</emph> are cited
                    from Donald Reiman and Neil Fraistat’s Norton edition, <emph>Shelley’s Poetry
                        and Prose</emph>, hereafter indicated as <emph>Norton </emph>in parenthesis.
                </note> Taking these questions as points of departure, this paper will locate within
                Shelley’s work a theory of <emph>aesthetic resistance</emph> by reading between his
                historical-political reflections on the British reform movement in <emph>A
                    Philosophical View of Reform</emph> (1819-20) and his critical aesthetics. </p>
               <p>Shelley’s reception, from his own time to the present, testifies to a persistent
                vexation over his radical mixtures of aesthetics with politics. William Hazlitt,
                reviewing what he describes as Shelley’s “electrical experiments in morals and
                philosophy,” sketches him as a reckless contrarian “drawn up by irresistible levity
                to the regions of mere speculation and fancy,” where “[b]ubbles are to him the only
                realities: —touch them, and they vanish” (201, 200). Matthew Arnold famously
                describes him as “a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his
                luminous wings in vain” (327), an ethereal figure that serves as an alibi for F. R.
                Leavis’ later complaint over Shelley’s “weak grasp upon the actual” (206). Though
                more recent criticism has rescued Shelley from such dismissive appraisals, critical
                concern over his “levity,” his immateriality and dreamy idealism, survives in the
                neglect or disavowal of his political works as naïve, patronizing, enthusiastic,
                ideological, or even dangerous. </p>
               <p>And yet, as I will argue, Shelley’s aesthetic departures from things as they are
                present new aesthetic formations that are subversive to established ways of
                experiencing the world. In this sense, Shelley’s political aesthetics stages a
                “dissensus,” to import Jacques Rancière’s term, where the prevailing form of common
                sense, the public sense of what is shared in collective life, is disrupted through
                artistic practices that reconfigure the “distribution of the sensible,” or
                partitions of sensory experience that legislate what is made visible and invisible
                in the common world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <emph>The Politics of
                        Aesthetics</emph>, the translator and editor Gabriel Rockhill proposes the
                    following helpful definition for the “distribution of the sensible” in
                    Rancière’s work: <quote>the implicit law governing the sensible
                        order that parcels out places and forms of participation in a common world
                        by first establishing the modes of perception within which these are
                        inscribed. The distribution of the sensible thus produces a system of
                        self-evident facts of perception based on the set horizons and modalities of
                        what is visible and audible as well as what can be said, thought, made, or
                        done. Strictly speaking, ‘distribution’ therefore refers both to forms of
                        inclusion and to forms of exclusion. (85)</quote>
                  </note> I will suggest that
                Shelley’s “levity,” his appeal to an aesthetic dimension in politics, creates new
                modes of experience that resist forms of inhumanity by making visible the otherwise
                invisible wrongs suffered by groups who remain excluded from participation in the
                public commons.</p>
               <p>At the time Shelley is writing his essays on the reform movement, British social and
                political life is undergoing a moral upheaval, a transvaluation of values arising,
                at least in part, from the growing international success of the American and French
                Declarations of universal rights. Attracted to the emancipatory potential of this
                new genre of writing, Shelley himself drafted a <emph>Declaration of Rights</emph>
                (1812), a broadside with thirty-one enumerated articles, organized around the two
                fundamental principles of the emerging rights tradition: “The rights of man are
                liberty, and an equal participation of the commonage of nature” (<emph>Prose</emph>
                56). But despite the claim of universal freedom and equality for all, one of the
                most disquieting paradoxes of Enlightenment rights discourse lies in the limited
                scope of its application, which excluded the equal recognition of women, slaves and
                free blacks, the poor and unpropertied, as well as many religious groups.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the paradoxes of human rights,
                    see Lynn Hunt.</note> Without solid foundations in the established laws and
                constitutions of states, the rights of man also ran the risk of becoming “metaphysic
                rights,” to use Edmund Burke’s phrase, a situation in which there is a perceived
                discrepancy between the <emph>a priori</emph> concepts of rights and the complex
                realities of pragmatic politics.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the
                        <emph>Reflections</emph>, Edmund Burke described this clash as a process of

                        entering into common life, like rays of light which pierce into a dense
                        medium, are, by the laws of nature, refracted from that straight line.
                        Indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns, the
                        primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and
                        reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in
                        the simplicity of their original direction. (61)</quote>
                  </note> What these
                familiar critiques misrecognize is the vital life of rights, which is activated by
                the resistances of subjects who are denied the rights they have by virtue of their
                common humanity. Women’s rights, though conspicuously missing in the major rights
                declarations of 1776 and 1789, are powerfully championed in the political writings
                of Olympe de Gouges as well as Mary Wollstonecraft, and are publicly contested in
                the emergent genre of the Jacobin novel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a

                1804, an historic event that foreshadowed the British abolition of the African slave
                trade in 1807 and the subsequent emancipation of nearly eight hundred thousand

               <p>These transformative historical and political events taking place in England, Europe
                and America held out the possibility for what the Chorus of Spirits in the utopian
                Act IV of <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> announce as “the new world of man,” an age
                unfolding <emph>as if </emph>according to a universal plan of Promethean history
                (V.157). In a paragraph of the preface to <emph>Hellas</emph>, originally deleted by
                his publishers Charles and James Ollier, Shelley takes an even more revolutionary
                position to declare that his age has embarked on a “war of the oppressed against the
                oppressor,” a struggle that will produce “a new race” intolerant of the excesses of
                Sovereigns, “those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers”
                    (<emph>Norton</emph> 432). </p>
               <p>Shelley’s provocative announcement of an age of war with sovereign power marks a
                radical shift from a thinker like Kant who, nearly forty years earlier, claimed his
                time to be an age of Enlightenment, where the ruler keeps open, under the idea of
                liberal toleration, a space for the development and exercise of the free use of
                public reason. They do, however, share an aversion to the idea of forcing historical
                change through the unnecessary use of violence, especially if there is a non-violent
                alternative for political reform. “A revolution,” Kant argues, “may well put an end
                to autocratic despotism and to rapacious or power-seeking oppression, but it will
                never produce a true reform in the ways of thinking. Instead, new prejudices, like
                the ones they replaced, will serve as a leash to control the great unthinking mass”
                    (<emph>Political </emph>55). Shelley’s later political thought similarly
                advocates for a gradualist conception of social and political reform, but he also
                expresses a profound sympathy for global revolutionary movements, sympathy akin to
                Kant’s description of the spectatorial “enthusiasm” arising from the French
                    Revolution.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Despite his well-documented
                    enthusiasm for the American and French Revolutions, Kant notoriously denies any
                    notion of a constitutional “right of revolution,” claiming “the people can never
                    possess a right of coercion against the head of state, or be entitled to oppose
                    him in word or deed.” Of the English constitution, vaunted as an example to the
                    world, Kant says “we find no mention of what the people are entitled to do if
                    the monarch were to violate the contract of 1688” (<emph>Political </emph>83).
                    For Kant, any statement within a constitution of a right of resistance would
                    fail the test of publicity, because it must then declare the remedies and powers
                    responsible for keeping the sovereign within the bounds of the contract, a
                    remedy that would in fact create another sovereign, or even a third to judge
                    which sovereign power was in the right.</note> Spectators of world historical
                events possess, Kant argues, a capacity for universal, disinterested sympathy that
                reveals itself publicly as “wishful <emph>participation</emph> that borders closely
                on enthusiasm”; this affective response, provoked by the spectacle of a people’s
                struggle for natural rights and republicanism, testifies to a “moral predisposition
                in the human race” (<emph>Conflict</emph> 302). As a collective experience, the
                spectator’s shared feeling of enthusiasm marks the revolutionary event as “a sign of
                history” (301), or in other words, an event whose occurrence on the world stage,
                bursting forth as an unpredictable rupture in the prevailing historical-political
                reality, affords an indication of humanity’s inherent capacity to author its own
                progress. </p>
               <p>Jean-François Lyotard’s influential reading of Kantian enthusiasm as “a modality of
                sublime feeling” re-inscribes this form of revolutionary spectatorship within an
                aesthetic dimension by reading political judgment as an analogue for aesthetic
                reflective judgment (<emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Keeping in mind Cian Duffy’s and Peter Howell’s critique of Kantian approaches
                    to the sublime in Romantic studies, a critical look that foregrounds an
                    alternative notion of the sublime as “the site of a complex interaction between
                    different discourses” (3), my illustration of the affinity between Kant and
                    Shelley on the sublime will highlight the analogical relations between
                    aesthetics, politics, history, and, to a lesser extent, science.</note> Like the
                experience of the sublime in nature, where the imagination confronts instances of
                formlessness or immensity that exceed its ability to comprehend what it has just
                apprehended, revolutions “are formless and shapeless in the history of human nature”
                (33). The sublime, however, occasions a second moment of recovery. Following the
                painful experience of the imagination’s impotence, the judging subject is enlivened
                by the pleasurable discovery of our “supersensible vocation” to strive after Ideas
                of reason beyond the chaotic particulars of nature (Kant, <emph>Critique</emph>
                §27.141). Despite the violence and disorder of revolution, the spectator’s
                enthusiasm reveals a collective fervor for “the Idea of the republican contract,”
                which offers a sign, or “complex hypotyposis,” of humanity’s progress toward the
                better (Lyotard, <emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 33, 40). It is therefore not the event of
                the French Revolution in itself that affords an indication of historical progress,
                just as sublime feeling is not wholly attributable to the object of nature under
                investigation. Rather, the judging subject’s feeling of pleasurable pain arises from
                the imagination’s struggle to present an unpresentable Idea of history, such as the
                Idea of a republican constitution emerging from seemingly lawless political
                rebellion. It is the task of the world spectator to bear witness to political
                upheavals and to discern signs of the regulative Idea of purposive progress
                underlying world history. </p>
               <p>In the opening chapter of <emph>A Philosophical View of Reform</emph>, a text that
                shares Kant’s commitment to republicanism, Shelley traces what could be called a
                universal history from an <emph>enthusiastic</emph> point of view. Driven by the
                dialectical opposition between “the spirit of freedom and the spirit of tyranny”
                (214), his narrative of world historical upheavals pays close attention to the
                rebellions in England in 1688, America in 1776, and France in 1789, before looking
                forward to anticipate the wave of revolutions in the 1820s across Spain, Portugal,
                and Greece. Unlike other universal histories of the period, he also acknowledges the
                world historical significance of the slave rebellions in the West Indies. “Two
                nations of free negroes are already established,” writes Shelley, “one, in
                pernicious mockery of the usurpation over France, an empire, the other a republic;
                both animating yet terrific spectacles to those who inherit around them the
                degradation of slavery and the spirit of dominion” (214). The establishment of Haiti
                (Saint-Domingue) and Liberia—the former by revolutionary violence, the latter by
                colonial settlement—offered the world community further indications of the advance
                of human freedom, or “signs of the times” (213), even as the coherence of the
                Enlightenment narrative of “the march of progress” is disfigured by the use of
                violence in political rebellion as a means of last resort. </p>
               <p>In shifting to an aesthetic mode of representing the spectator’s sympathy for the
                actors of revolution, a form of spectatorship that takes place within what Lyotard
                calls the “the theatre hall of history” (<emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 29), Kant’s
                theorization of an aesthetic perspective <emph>within</emph> the political opens the
                possibility for a novel way to think through world historical change. As in William
                Blake’s “The Mental Traveller,” where “the Eye altering alters all” (62), the world
                spectator’s point of view and participatory mode of perceiving the events of history
                is as important as the events themselves. The aesthetic experience of viewing
                political events, “this game of great revolutions,” is transformed into a mode of
                mental drama, where the events of history are internalized and reflexively
                considered by spectators “who are not engaged in this game themselves” (Kant,
                    <emph>Conflict</emph> 302). Framed as drama and viewed from a cosmopolitan point
                of view, the sublime image of revolution creates a dissension within the “hearts of
                all spectators” (302). The stirring and discordant play of the faculties is not
                caused by a call to participate directly in rebellion, nor is it provoked by widely
                condemned images of the abuse of sovereign power under the <emph>ancien
                    régime</emph>, nor even by the horrific spectacle of the terror of Robespierre.
                What makes the spectator’s judgments subjectively universal and communicable, as in
                the case of aesthetic reflective judgment, is a shared common sense
                    (<emph>Critique</emph> §20-22, 40), or the pleasurable accord of the imagination
                and understanding without the mediation of a concept (in the case of the beautiful),
                or the discordant accord between the imagination and reason (in the case of the
                sublime). </p>
               <p>In his explication of Kantian common sense, Gilles Deleuze describes the unique form
                of common sense generated by the sublime as one “engendered in dissension” (53). The
                violence done to the imagination brings to light what Kant calls a “capacity for
                resistance,” that is, our disposition to confront nature’s seemingly unsurpassable
                authority over us (<emph>Critique</emph> §29.144). Sublime common sense, revelatory
                of our shared ability to resist the given sensory experience of the natural order,
                is therefore a dissensual common sense. The Kantian conception of a dissensus
                stirring in the psychic life of the judging subject, an inner aesthetic experience
                that manifests itself in artistic practices, links onto Shelley’s use of imagery
                drawn from the natural sublime as a mode of presenting “the operations of the human
                mind” on the verge of revolt (<emph>Norton</emph> 207). In <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>, for instance, the figure of “the sun-awakened avalanche,”
                accumulating “flake after flake, in Heaven-defying minds” (II.3.37, 39), prefigures
                the revolutionary overthrow of Jupiter’s rule by the palingenetic power of
                Demogorgon. </p>
               <p>Though Shelley joins a chorus of Romantic writers who figure revolutionary upheavals
                within the discourse of the natural sublime, his own restless experimentation with
                literary forms presents a subversive challenge to established norms and
                classifications of the arts, one that threatens to blur, even overturn, the
                carefully legislated boundaries between hierarchical orders of genre. The prospect
                of this kind of aesthetic revolution is, indeed, what triggers Hazlitt’s criticism
                of Shelley’s experiments:
            <quote>Curiosity is the only proper category of [Shelley’s] mind, and though a man in
                knowledge, he is a child in feeling. Hence he puts everything into a metaphysical
                crucible to judge it himself and exhibit it to others as a subject of interesting
                experiment, without first making it over to the ordeal of his common sense or trying
                it on his heart. … Mr. Shelley has been accused of vanity—I think he is chargeable
                with extreme levity; but this levity is so great that I do not believe he is
                sensible of its consequences. He strives to overturn all established creeds and
                systems; but this is in him an effect of constitution. He runs before the most
                extravagant opinions; but this is because he is held back by none of the merely
                mechanical checks of sympathy and habit. He tampers with all sorts of obnoxious
                subjects; but it is less because he is gratified with the rankness of the taint than
                captivated with the intellectual phosphoric light they emit. (200)</quote>
            Shelley, for Hazlitt, is a dangerous alchemist of Promethean proportions, not unlike
                Dr. Frankenstein working feverishly on his sublime monster, and with potentially
                horrific—if unintended—consequences when carried over into social and political
                life. Hazlitt’s charge against Shelley for possessing dangerous levels of levity, as
                though it were an inflammable gas in one of Humphrey Davy’s chemical experiments,
                coincides with rhetorical tropes deployed to critique the idealist claims of natural
                rights theorists at this time. In the <emph>Reflections on the Revolution in
                    France</emph> (1790), for example, Burke appeals to his reader to stand on “the
                firm ground of the British constitution” rather than emulate “in their desperate
                flights the aëronauts of France” (249), an analogy between the drafters of the 1789
                Declaration and the craze for hot-air balloon flights, beginning with the
                Montgolfier brothers’ first manned hot-air balloon flight in France in 1783.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Richard Holmes, Chapter 3, for an exceptional
                    discussion of the hot-air balloon craze in the Romantic period, with a vivid
                    description of the first flight of the Montgolfier brothers.</note> Jeremy
                Bentham’s <emph>Anarchical Fallacies,</emph> too, makes light (pun intended) of
                natural rights as nonsensical rhetorical fictions, “nonsense upon stilts,” which
                tends toward “a spirit of insurrection to all laws” (501). This attack on the
                fictionality, the <emph>levity</emph>, of human rights discourse has a long legacy
                up to the present, with Alasdair MacIntyre’s claim that “there are no such rights,
                and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns” (67).
                Coincidently, Joseph Montgolfier named the property that lifted the balloon into the
                air as “levity,” a principle of flight that the young Shelley uses to send copies of
                his <emph>Declaration of Rights</emph> to the disenfranchised via fire balloons. In
                one of his early poems, “Sonnet: To a balloon, laden with Knowledge,” he deploys the
                balloon as a symbol of human freedom, “a ray of courage to the opprest and poor,”
                which soon “through the tyrant’s gilded domes shall roar” (<emph>Norton</emph> 6. 9,
                11). </p>
               <p>Unlike Burke and Bentham, who criticize what they perceive to be the anarchic and
                terroristic potential of natural rights, especially the “right of resistance,”
                Shelley sides with Richard Price in recognizing such a right as constitutionally
                guaranteed as a legacy of the English Revolution in 1688. In his famous lecture,
                    <emph>A Discourse on the Love of Country </emph>(1789), the lecture that incited
                Burke to write his <emph>Reflections</emph>, Price affirms that the English people
                accomplished a shift in the idea of sovereign power from “passive obedience,
                nonresistance, and the divine right of kings” toward the multitude’s active power to
                choose their sovereign on the basis of consent (190). This idea of the people as the
                autonomous and primary foundation of the sovereign’s legitimacy, as set out by John
                Locke in the <emph>Two Treatises on Government</emph> (1689), is also the source of
                Price’s provocative claim that it is the people’s right to resist sovereign power
                when it is abused, and ultimately to replace the “cashiered” king with a new
                individual or mode of governance chosen by the multitude. </p>
               <p>In Shelley’s most systematic political text, <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>,
                humanity’s natural right of resistance is, as we have seen, the vital principle that
                initiates and legitimizes social and political change. The text’s condensed
                universal history traces the hopeful realization of liberty and equality, the
                “elementary principles” of rights (216), as humanity progressively activates its
                irrepressible capacity to resist oppression. Beginning with the fall of the Roman
                Empire, he narrates the story of the human will to resist as it manifests in the
                republics of the Italian Renaissance, the Reformation, the English Civil War, the
                Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, up to the American and French
                Revolutions. Like the chained Prometheus forced to witness images of exploitation
                and repression, Shelley’s history registers each singular abuse of the rights of man
                as “rapid passing shadows, which forerun successful insurrection” (224). As a world
                spectator, he then turns an eye to liberatory movements in South America, China,
                Turkey, and India, struggles that are fueled, to a greater or lesser degree, by “the
                arts and philosophy of Europe” (226). In the theatre of his political thought, poets
                and philosophers play a crucial role as “unacknowledged legislators of the world”
                because their works circulate globally as “the contagion of good” (227, 225), sowing
                seeds of rebellion. And yet, the narrative also has the opposite effect of turning
                “European art and literature” into a colonizing discourse (226), thus usurping
                indigenous histories and systems of knowledge and, in turn, transforming the
                unacknowledged legislators into prophets <emph>of</emph> rather than
                    <emph>against</emph> empire. Human rights discourse today runs a similar risk of
                becoming an inhuman instrument of neo-colonial control and exploitation rather than
                a source for a more radical politics. </p>
               <p>However, Shelley’s critical history of the “mighty calamity of government” defies any
                uncomplicated reinscription into a narrative of British imperialism (228), and his
                criticisms of the British system of government are devastating, including his
                critique of the development of the national debt, the issuing of paper money, the
                system of landed property, and the misdistribution of parliamentary seats throughout
                England. His description of the apparatus of the British state coincides with what
                Rancière has called “the police,” or “the set of procedures whereby the aggregation
                and consent of collectivities is achieved, the organization of powers, the
                distribution of places and roles, and the systems for legitimizing this
                distribution” (<emph>Disagreement</emph> 28). Rancière’s concept of “policing,”
                which is usually offered as a description of politics, captures the anarchic
                character of Shelley’s proposals to reconfigure the exclusionary logic of the
                “police,” such as the extension of suffrage (though he retreats from granting women
                the vote), electoral reform, the abolishment of standing armies and sinecures, and
                the repayment of the national debt by the rich.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Though Shelley hesitates in advocating for female suffrage, he does express his
                    sympathy towards the idea of universal suffrage: “Mr. Bentham and other writers
                    have urged the admission of females to the right of suffrage; this attempt seems
                    somewhat immature. Should my opinion be the result of despondency, the writer of
                    these pages would be the last to withhold his vote from any system which might
                    tend to an equal and full development of the capacities of all living beings”
                        (<emph>Philosophical </emph>251). </note> He condemns the British system of
                elections for being chaotic, corrupt, and widely recognized in the popular press as
                entirely dysfunctional. In his later essay <emph>On the English Reform Bill</emph>
                (1831), Hegel is similarly critical of the “bizarre and informal irregularity and
                inequality which prevail[s] at present” (<emph>Political</emph> 234). After
                outlining the problems of rotten boroughs, the purchasing of seats, bribery, and the
                concentration of power in the hands of a small elite, Hegel observes, “It would be
                difficult to discover a comparable symptom of political corruption in any other
                people” (236). The challenge, as Shelley knows well, is to convince those in power,
                whose material interests are secured by unequal distributions and rights, to
                recognize the necessity of reform. </p>
               <p>As a counter to the logic of the police, Rancière reserves the term “politics” for
                changes that are antagonistic to the given order of the visible. Politics, then,
                refers to “whatever breaks with the tangible configuration whereby parties and parts
                or lack of them are defined by a supposition that, by definition, has no place in
                that configuration—that of the part of those who have no part”
                    (<emph>Disagreement</emph> 29). Political activity, in other words, unsettles
                the hierarchical distribution of bodies, places, roles, occupations, and so forth,
                such that previously marginalized groups and heterogeneous parts of the social whole
                are made visible within the configuration of what is perceptible, or “the
                distribution of the sensible.” Rancière’s aesthetics of politics involves,
                therefore, an egalitarian reconfiguration of what is intelligible on the occasions
                where the excluded, the parts that have no part, demand equal participation in the
                common world. </p>
               <p>To make a case for those without a place or part in the political process, Shelley
                recommends gradualist interventions as a first mode of reconfiguring the
                distribution of the sensible, such as the remedies of petitions, passive resistance,
                agitating public opinion, publishing dissenting opinions, and seeking the writings
                of poets and philosophers in a proto-public intellectual capacity. “Suppose the
                memorials to be severally written by Godwin, Hazlitt, Bentham and Hunt,” writes
                Shelley, “they would be worthy of the age and of the cause” (259). If all measures
                fail, however, the people must take the gravest of actions: “The last resort of
                resistance is undoubtedly insurrection” (260). In the final unfinished, fragmentary
                pages of <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>, we encounter a radical side of Shelley’s
                politics. If all peaceful, nonviolent measures are exhausted, violent upheaval is
                occasionally necessary as the end game of political struggle. Drawing on “the most
                approved writers on the English constitution,” Shelley argues, “which has in this
                instance been merely a declaration of the superior decisions of eternal justice, we
                possess a right of resistance” (260). What he is referring to is the contested
                declaration of the 1689 Bill of Rights, which includes a provision for Protestants
                to bear arms in self-defense, a provision that William Blackstone later interprets
                as “a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance
                and self-preservation when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient
                to restrain the violence of oppression” (143). After witnessing the bloody reprisals
                of counterrevolutionary measures on behalf of the state toward collective
                demonstration and peaceful protest, notably in the case of the Peterloo Massacre of
                16 August 1819, Shelley mines juridical-historical precedent to bolster his case for
                the multitude’s right to rebel. </p>
               <p>Shelley looks back to the English Revolutionary period as a source of inspiration not
                only in law and politics, but also in philosophy, poetry, and literature. Just
                before writing <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>, he began composing <emph>Charles
                    the First</emph> (1818)<emph>,</emph> which would have translated the
                revolutionary politics of the English Civil War into dramatic form. The events that
                led to the execution of a king and the “temporary abolition of aristocracy and
                episcopacy” were, for Shelley, a “mighty example” to the world of a people’s
                capacity for “bringing to justice one of the chiefs of a conspiracy of privileged
                murderers and robbers whose impunity had been the consecration of crime”
                    (<emph>Philosophical </emph>213). What makes this departure from the existing
                police order possible is the “exertion of the energies of intellectual power” on
                behalf of the poets and philosophers reflecting the “spirit of their age,”
                particularly Shakespeare and Lord Bacon, those unacknowledged legislators of a new
                mode of the perceptible (213, 227). Works of literature have the enduring value of
                opening up new horizons of possibility that have yet to be activated beyond the
                current social order; they disclose an aesthetic dimension of politics where the
                prevailing common sense, shared by all, confronts alterative sensible configurations
                of common life. </p>
               <p>The theory of aesthetic experience outlined in <emph>A Defence</emph>, as Robert
                Kaufman observes, is “quite similar to the one that Kant offers in the Third
                Critique’s Analytic of the Beautiful,” though with Shelley’s “self-conscious usage
                of a revolutionary vocabulary” (709). And akin to the Kantian doctrine of the
                faculties, Shelley divides the human mind into a faculty psychology, namely, the
                analytic power of reason and the synthetic power of imagination: reason legislates
                the logical, associational relations of distinct thoughts and quantities, while the
                imagination is the mind’s transformative, creative capacity to act upon primary
                elements of psychic life to forge new relations and forms. The imagination’s most
                privileged form of creation is poetry. In the process of outlining the relation
                between poetry and life, aesthetics and politics, Shelley offers a further
                distinction between a “restricted” and “unrestricted” idea of poetry: while the
                former refers to productions of the imagination in “metrical language”
                    (<emph>Norton</emph> 513), or individuated works, the latter refers to the
                activation of the human imagination in the form of a creative “poetical faculty”
                possessed by all with varying degrees of potency (531). The poetical faculty, in
                turn, is responsible for a two-fold process of first creating “new materials of
                knowledge, and power and pleasure,” and then formally ordering the new content
                “according to a certain rhythm and order which may be called the beautiful and the
                good” (531). Within the context of Shelley’s universal history, the restricted sense
                of poetry takes shape as the “great poem,” to which each individual poet contributes
                a verse (522); by contrast, the unrestricted poetry of the world has produced the
                various artistic disciplines as well as laws, civil societies, and religions. The
                poet of politics, therefore, “discovers those laws according to which things ought
                to be ordered” (513), and translates these laws into new practices of writing, like
                the modern genre of rights declarations sparked by the age of revolution. The
                original drafter of the American Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson,
                affords an exemplary case of a poet of laws and constitutions whose revolutionary
                influence was felt on the authors of the French Declaration.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lynn Hunt reports that Jefferson’s original draft went through
                    “eighty-six alterations made by himself, the Committee of Five, or Congress”
                    (18). This painstaking level of revision and attention to detail stands at odds
                    with Shelley’s remark that it is an “error to assert that the finest passages of
                    poetry are produced by labour and study” (<emph>Norton</emph> 531). </note> This
                is not, however, to diminish the social importance of poetic works in favour of
                utilitarian forms of knowledge, as Thomas Love Peacock proposes in <emph>The Four
                    Ages of Poetry </emph>(1820). Shelley’s theory of poetry situates poetic
                thinking as a universally shared capacity in all subjects, a poetic common sense,
                though one that wanes as corruption reigns and language ossifies. During “periods of
                the decay of social life,” the task of the poet, in the restricted sense, is to
                spark the imagination by stirring the poetic faculty, “the faculty which contains
                within itself the seeds at once of its own and of social renovation” (520, 522).
                Where the calculating principle of instrumental reason deadens language, the
                practice and reception of poetry resuscitates the moral imagination. </p>
               <p>But how, then, does poetry excite an aesthetic of resistance, the catalyst of
                aesthetic revolution? Like the Kantian conception of aesthetic common sense, in
                which one “reflects on his own judgment from a universal standpoint”
                    (<emph>Critique</emph> §40.175), the Shelleyan poetic faculty is the point of
                genesis for an enlarged mentality, both for the poet and his audience. Shelley’s
                theory of history, however, grants the poet a more genetic role to play in the
                production of common sense; he describes how poets at an early moment in human
                history apprehend an enduring “rhythm and order” between “existence and perception,”
                and then invent forms of language and representation to link “perception and
                expression” (<emph>Norton</emph> 512). Over successive epochs, the narrative traces
                how poets have been agents of social transformation, preventing the decay of
                language and defamiliarizing habitual modes of perceiving the familiar world.
                Because the imagination is the creative power that organizes and combines the basic
                elements of social life according to the mind’s laws (“equality, diversity, unity,
                contrast, mutual dependence” [511]), and because the poet possesses the most potent
                poetic faculty, poets have the imaginative power to make new sense of the world, to
                redistribute the sensible. Poetry acts upon the reader by making the mind “the
                receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought” (517); the superior
                faculties are therefore not only <emph>enlarged</emph> by the sheer mass of the
                novel content but also <emph>awakened</emph> by the new formal relations that link
                familiar thoughts in unfamiliar ways. The enlarged mentality is a condition of
                possibility for the good because the viewer participates in a virtual form of “the
                common universe of which we are portions and percipients,” a common experience that
                allows one to “put himself in the place of another and of many others” (517).
                Poetry’s relation to morality does not reside in its doctrines—“Didactic poetry is
                my abhorrence,” Shelley writes in the Preface to <emph>Prometheus</emph>—but rather
                in its ability to expand the imagination beyond “the principle of self” in
                sympathetic identification with others (209, 531). Moreover, poetic experience opens
                up gaps within the perceptible, what Shelley calls “new intervals and interstices”
                (517), disjunctions that reveal an aesthetic dimension within the operations of
                psychic life and the perception of the world. The gaps that emerge in aesthetic
                experience afford opportunities for departure from things as they are, and poetry
                generates a “being within our being,” an <emph>epipsyche</emph>, which “defeats the
                curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding impressions”
                (533). This disjunction creates “dissensus,” to use Rancière’s term, “a conflict
                between <emph>sense</emph> and <emph>sense</emph>,” that is, “between a sensory
                presentation and a way of making sense of it, or between several sensory regimes
                and/or ‘bodies’” (<emph>Dissensus</emph> 139).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                    his essay, “The Paradoxes of Political Art,” Rancière offers a helpful outline
                    of dissensus in art: 
                    <quote>Dissensus is a conflict between sensory presentation and a
                    way of making sense of it, or between sensory regimes and / or ‘bodies’. This is
                    the way in which dissensus can be said to reside at the heart of politics, since
                    at bottom the latter itself consists in an activity that redraws the frame
                    within which common objects are determined. Politics breaks with the sensory
                    self-evidence of the ‘natural’ order that destines specific individuals and
                    groups to occupy positions of rule or of being ruled, assigning them to private
                    or public lives, pinning them down to a certain time and space, to specific
                    ‘bodies’, that is to specific ways of being, seeing, and saying.

                  </note> As a moment of dissensus, the epipsyche
                of aesthetic experience presents two divergent senses of the subject’s relation to
                itself and the world, namely, the prevailing configuration as well as a virtual
                alternative, thus opening new possibilities to recalibrate one’s perception of the
                established reality. </p>
               <p>Far from escaping social and political life, the aesthetic dimension suspends and
                distorts our conventional understanding of the historical world. The work of art
                enacts a defamiliarizing refusal of the actual, of pernicious habits and customs
                that have insinuated themselves into a normative idea of human nature. Such moments
                of <emph>epipsychic dissensus, </emph>or subversions of common sense perception,
                reappear as an ongoing strategy in Shelley’s work.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Observing Shelley’s prevalent use of the concept of the “epipsyche,” Carlos
                    Baker long ago identified this movement as “the psyche-epipsyche strategy.”
                    Baker describes this term as follows: “To put the matter in Shelleyan terms, the
                    mind (psyche) imaginatively creates or envisions what it does not have
                    (epipsyche), and then seeks to possess epipsyche, to move towards it as a goal.
                    Therefore the psyche-epipsyche strategy in a nutshell is the evolution by the
                    mind of an ideal pattern towards which it then aspires” (<emph>Major
                        Poetry</emph> 53).</note> He begins to flesh out his concept of the
                epipsyche, or “little soul,” in his short essay “On Love,” where he describes it as
                “a miniature as it were of our entire self, yet deprived of all that we condemn or
                despise, the ideal prototype of every thing excellent or lovely that we are capable
                of conceiving as belonging to the nature of man” (<emph>Norton</emph> 504). As an
                animating principle within our psychic life, “a soul within our soul,” we strive to
                realize its material embodiment, or “antitype,” within the sensible world (504). It
                might seem odd to extract a radical politics from Shelley’s reflections on love,
                perhaps a moment of levity, but love’s sympathetic movement beyond the self serves
                as an activating principle in several of Shelley’s lyrical experiments, such as
                    <emph>Alastor</emph>, <emph>Epipsychidion</emph>, and <emph>Adonais</emph>. In
                the short time that remains, however, I will briefly highlight a unique example in
                which the epipsyche is turned on its head and the necessity of <emph>eros</emph> is
                intertwined with <emph>thanatos</emph>, that is, the scene of resistance between
                Prometheus and Jupiter’s Phantasm in the opening act of <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>. </p>
               <p>The drama opens with the tortured, enchained Prometheus declaring, after “three
                thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours” under Jupiter’s oppressive reign (I.12),
                that his blind hatred has ultimately resolved into pity for the “cruel King” (I.50),
                whose fateful fall will soon come to pass according to Demogorgon’s “mighty law” of
                Necessity (II.2.43). On the verge of mental revolution, Prometheus appeals to the
                Earth and her constituent parts (mountains, springs, air, and whirlwinds) to
                reiterate the forgotten curse he placed upon Jupiter long ago; what comes back from
                the world is the “sound of voices—not the voice / Which I gave forth” (I.112-13) and
                an “awful whisper” (I.132). The voices of the world are sensory but without standing
                in the symbolic order. The Titan senses a whisper “scarce like sound” (I.133); it
                “tingles through the frame / As lightning tingles, hovering ere it strike”
                (I.133-34). The voices of the Earth and her parts are felt as powerful sensory
                signals but without linguistic communication. Each exchange reveals Prometheus’ loss
                of the right to engage in a community of speakers, a capacity Lyotard supposes to be
                “perhaps the most fundamental human right” (“Other’s Rights” 141). Under the regime
                of Jupiter, the tyrant over “living things” (I.3), the Earth and the other elements
                of nature speak “the language of the dead” (I.138), an underground discourse of
                resistance unknown to the immortal Prometheus and his oppressor. To speak in the
                language of the living is to run the risk of Jupiter’s torture on “some wheel of
                pain” (I.141). The loss of an interlocutory community is not immediately apparent,
                however, because the “Daedal harmony” (IV.416) of the drama’s language produces the
                illusion of transparent dialogue, which, in turn, playfully mirrors and critiques
                the sinister way in which oppressive power generates a state of enforced consensus
                that masks the voices of those who remain excluded. Without the means to recall or
                present the curse he uttered to Jupiter, and without the capacity to understand the
                language of the witnesses, Prometheus finds himself the victim of what Lyotard calls
                a “differend,” that is, a situation in which “something ‘asks’ to be put into
                phrases, and suffers from the wrong of not being able to be put into phrases right
                away” (<emph>Differend</emph> 13). How can Prometheus work through his own psychic
                resistance to summon up the curse, without the testimony of Earth and her muted
                elements? </p>
               <p>Though we possess only fragments of Aeschylus’ lost play, <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>, many classical scholars agree that Earth, or Gaia, is a
                mediating figure that reconciles Prometheus with Zeus by revealing the Titan’s
                secret knowledge of the danger that will come if the tyrant produces a child with
                    Thetis.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his reconstruction of the possible
                    narrative development of Aeschylus’ Promethean trilogy, D.J. Conacher suggests
                    that it is “reasonable to guess (as many commentators have done) that Gaia is in
                    some way an intermediary between the two antagonists in the revelation of
                    Prometheus’ secret to Zeus” (<emph>Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound</emph>
                    112).</note> Shelley’s Earth, however, resists her own interpellation into
                Jupiter’s state of consensus. Her task, to use Lyotard’s language, is “to bear
                witness to the differends by finding idioms for them” (13), a task that will help
                Prometheus to recollect and eventually revoke the misbegotten curse. To bridge the
                chasm between the “two worlds of life and death” (I.195), Earth proposes an
                alternative route that would intertwine both worlds by having a phantasm from the
                dead utter the curse in the language of the living. Rather than hear the curse from
                his own image, Prometheus opts for the specter of the reigning sovereign power. The
                invocation of Jupiter’s Phantasm stages a scene of dissensus between two seemingly
                incommensurable worlds, which not only facilitates Prometheus’ process of working
                through the repressed curse, but also bridges the domains of actuality and
                potentiality. Jupiter’s Phantasm is a kind of inverted epipsyche in that it affords
                Prometheus the opportunity to witness his disavowed sense of revenge and “calm hate”
                in a virtual, uncanny double of himself as tyrant (I.259), a transformative
                experience that precipitates his repentance and ultimate retraction of the curse.
                Prometheus’ experience of the phantasm is therefore not unlike the temporal sequence
                of sublime spectatorship: the feeling of misery and pain that accompanies his
                inability to present a seemingly ineffable event gives way to the pleasure of
                atonement that accompanies the reiteration and remorseful repeal of his words. This
                reading of the Phantasm also foregrounds the active role of Earth in refashioning
                the world; having created a breach in the sensible domain, she emerges as a
                revolutionary subject on behalf of her muted constituent parts—the parts of the
                world that have no part in Jupiter’s regime. Earth, in this sense, bears witness to
                an impassable differend and then generates novel passageways between existence and
                perception, then perception and expression, subversively restoring Prometheus’ right
                to speak to others. His monologic, lyric <emph>I</emph> becomes a dialogic, dramatic
                    <emph>we</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For this insight, I owe a
                    debt of gratitude to Tilottama Rajan’s essay, “Romanticism and the Death of
                    Lyric Consciousness,” in which she argues that the lyric <emph>cogito</emph> is
                    always already displaced by its inalienable difference: “My argument is that
                    pure lyric is a monological form, where narrative and drama alike are set in the
                    space of difference. The latter present the self in interaction with other
                    characters and events. But lyric, as a purely subjective form, is marked by the
                    exclusion of the other through which we become aware of the difference of the
                    self from itself” (196). </note>
               </p>
               <p>Shelley’s refusal of the normative constraints of common sense, to recall Hazlitt’s
                charge, is exemplified in his radical experiment with the “lyrical drama.”
                    <emph>Prometheus </emph>translates the conventions of Greek drama into a hybrid
                genre where the classical structures of Aeschylus’ work are combined, like a
                chemical mixture, with modern forms of lyric subjectivity and democratic equality
                that refigure established hierarchical divisions between lyric, drama, and
                    epic.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his essay “Lyrical Drama:
                        <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> and <emph>Hellas,</emph>” Stuart Curran
                    characterizes Shelley’s challenge as an “assault” on generic divisions: “’Lyric
                    drama’, like the similar designation of the previous generation, ‘lyrical
                    ballad’, is, instead, a deliberate assault on the integrity of the tripartite
                    generic division—epic, drama, lyric—inherited from Aristotle and Horace and
                    reinforced throughout the eighteenth century by major arbiters of neoclassical
                    criticism” (290). The recalibration of generic structures through the poetic
                    experiment of the lyrical drama brings to light Shelley’s revolutionary politics
                    of aesthetics at the level of form. </note> Shelley’s imaginative departures
                from generic models is matched by a radical innovation at the level of the
                narrative: instead of reconciling “the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind,”
                Prometheus emerges as a revolutionary figure who embodies “the highest perfection of
                moral and intellectual nature,” qualities that give the Titan’s patient defiance a
                sense of justice that is missing in the rebelliousness of Milton’s Satan (206-7).
                The image of Prometheus’ near-solipsistic solitude, not unlike Hegel’s description
                of the lyric subject as “an enclosed inner world” (<emph>Aesthetics</emph> 1115), is
                interrupted by the drama’s dialogic interaction with the world at large, which
                stages a scene of dissension that forges an alternative community of speakers and
                activates a new form of revolutionary subjectivity. But what ultimately makes this
                possible is the return of a repressed primordial power of resistance that emerges
                from the disjointure between the world of the living and the dead, that is, the
                overpowering force of Demogorgon. Just as tyrants rarely “leave a path to freedom
                but through their own blood” (<emph>Philosophical</emph> 213), Jupiter’s reign only
                comes to an end after a swift, decisive struggle with his more powerful offspring.
                Demogorgon’s defeat of Jupiter is the originary violence that founds the new
                Promethean age of humanity through “Destruction’s strength” (IV.564), a death drive
                that retreats from history until it is recalled once again, as a last resort, “To
                defy Power which seems Omnipotent” (IV.572). The disappearance of Demogorgon from
                the world at the end of Shelley’s lyrical drama mirrors, in an uncanny way, the
                withdrawal of the “right of resistance” after its revolutionary enactment in the
                Declarations of 1776 and 1789, serving only as a supplementary right in the French
                Declaration of 1793. Even in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the
                right to resist is only mentioned in the opening Preamble as an endgame to be
                avoided by granting universal rights to all peoples. And yet, as Shelley’s
                aesthetics of resistance brings to light, the capacity to resist is as irrepressible
                as the capacity for poetry: they are life and death instincts in humanity’s
                unsurpassable struggle to recreate the world. </p>

               <p>Shelley's political legacy passed through an often-neglected
                    school of writers to world leaders and revolutionaries globally in the
                    decades following his death. When assessing his legacy, we should not
                    overlook those early, ardent appreciators known as "the Spasmodic School."
                    Alexander Smith, Sydney Dobell, J. Stanyan Bigg, and even James Thomson B.V.
                    took Shelley's call to a revolution conducted through imaginative sympathy
                    seriously, and together, helped to fan his "fading coal" to flame.</p>

               <p> Matthew Arnold’s much-derided jibe about ineffectual angels is not the only remark
                on Shelley’s political impotence. Early reviewers were quick to dismiss both his
                radicalism and radical ambition. <emph>The Quarterly Review</emph>, for example,
                compares him (presciently) to a drowning man, flailing his arms about to no avail,
                as Kim Wheatley has shown (8). Wheatley argues that reviewers’ vituperative
                recrimination of his project amounts to a kind of paranoid politics, casting his
                gestures as ineffectual for fear of their possible political power. </p>
               <p> Scholars such as Mark Redfield, Paul Foot, David Duff, and Cian Duffy have recently
                made inroads into recreating the political Shelley, suppressed for so much of the
                century that followed him, and ignored for much of ours. Likewise, Shelley’s
                influence on later poets has been repeatedly, if not comprehensively, remarked
                through the work of Anthony Harrison, Herbert Tucker, and others.</p>
               <p> But a
                reconsideration of the political (broadly considered) in Shelley is due in the wake
                of recent scholarship from Slavoj Žižek and Jacques Ranciere, among others, tying
                the political and aesthetic. The bifurcation of those concepts is still very much
                with us. Eugene Stelig wrote in 2013, for example (of Wordsworth), “by the end of
                the decade, the identity conflict between poetry and politics was essentially over,
                having been resolved in favor of the former” (745-6). That attempting to write
                political poetry creates an “identity conflict” is taken for granted. This essay
                considers another dimension of the political in Shelley: not a revolution of the
                mind, nor the moral force of his verse and example, but the <emph>realpolitik</emph>
                carried on in his name, and the politico-poetic revolution he actually enacted. </p>
               <p> Among the most important of Shelley's legacies is the overlooked school of poets
                writing in the years following his death, known at first derisively, and then
                popularly as the "The Spasmodics." The Spasmodics took Shelley as their hero and
                model, and unlike him, lived to see their (his) politico-poetic vision take shape.
                Through the Spasmodics then, Shelley’s trumpet of prophecy sounded to legions of
                readers both in the English literary world and beyond.</p>
               <p>My claims in this essay
                are three: 1) that despite Arnoldian-Victorianist portraits of Shelley as
                politically-ineffectual (and this despite the fact that, whatever his intentions, he
                largely <emph>was</emph> ineffectual during his short life) Shelley’s effect on the
                popular generation of poets immediately following his death was both profound and
                heretofore unremarked, 2) that the most popular school thereof—the Spasmodics—are
                better categorized as a Shelleyan rather than Keatsian, and 3) that this is so in
                part because of their works' political force, despite that modern Victorianist
                critics—like the Victorians before them—call their work “apolitical.”</p>
               <p> This
                reconsideration will, I hope, do a few things for us. It extends work already begun
                by Susan Schmidt and Michael Rossington on Shelley’s reception worldwide in the
                years following his death, especially among the working classes. It also offers a
                glimpse at how early Victorians—Christians, moralists—began the project of
                rehabilitating Shelley’s work, and reputation, making it (if only slightly) more
                palatable for domestic consumption. In that, it participates in conversations on the
                Romantic/Victorian divide hosted by Richard Cronin and Anthony Harrison and gives us
                a picture of how Romantic, and more specifically, Shelleyan, poetics were
                incorporated into what afterward became known as the early part of a new period.
                Some ancillary questions pop up that might be further considered elsewhere: what
                does the Shelleyan poetic project actually look like, as distinct from
                Keatsian/Huntian/Byronic? What would a School of Shelley look like, if not this? </p>

                    reaction to late-Romantic epistemology, their fame died quickly by the
                    1860s.</p>
                  <p> In their 2004 special issue of <emph>Victorian Poetry</emph>, editors Charles
                    LaPorte and Jason Rudy note that Spasmodism “struck nearly all readers as a
                    demonstrably new mode of poetic composition,” featuring “a wavering between
                    poetic identities—masculine and feminine—virile and susceptible” (422, 424).
                    Herbert Tucker points out their attention to “the sanctity of the moment of
                    heightened perception, and the totality of the truth to which creative poets
                    enjoy privileged if fitful access” (429). Both are expanding on George
                    Saintsbury’s definition of Spasmodism as <quote>a kind of solidifying or at
                        least centripetalizing of the loose and floating endeavours toward something
                        new and strange...by a certain gorgeousness or intricacy of language, by a
                        scrupulous avoidance of the commonplace in subject, by more or less
                        elaborately hinted or expressed unorthodoxy in religion or philosophy.
                        (155)</quote> Though they were extremely popular, especially in the 1850s,
                    it has become fashionable to argue that the Spasmodics do not form anything like
                    a real literary movement. Some say that the Spasmodics “constitute a school only
                    in name” (LaPorte, Rudy 421). Richard Cronin writes that “not until J.H.
                    Buckley’s essay, ‘The Spasmodic School’...in 1966...did the term achieve any
                    substantial content” (142). Buckley’s essay, actually published in 1951 as a
                    chapter in <emph>The Victorian Temper</emph>, argues that “the Spasmodics can be
                    classed together as members of a ‘school’ only insofar as...they subscribed...to
                    a fairly coherent philosophy of incoherence” (43). </p>
                  <p> This is not quite true, however. Not only did earlier critics consider the
                    Spasmodics a “school of poetry,” with similar traits and goals and members, but
                    the members themselves seemed to have thought of themselves as belonging to such
                    a group and common project. <emph>The Cambridge History of English
                        Literature</emph> described in 1922—44 years before Cronin’s reference—that
                    they constituted “a fairly definite group, of which...[Bailey] was the leader:
                    the so-called Spasmodics” (147). Contemporary reviews also categorized these
                    same authors as belonging to “a definite group”: an article from <emph>The
                        Leader</emph> in 1854 treats Bigg, Dobell, and Massey under the heading “The
                    Latest School of Poetry.” Smith himself writes in his posthumous collection of
                    essays <emph>Last Leaves</emph>, “While noticing this ebb and flow of poetical
                    reputations, it may not be too much to infer that the oblivion to which the
                    Spasmodic School has been consigned for the last few years has been to a
                    considerable extent undeserved” (174). In fact, <emph>The Scottish Review
                    </emph>wrote of the Spasmodics as early as 1855, "Tennyson can scarcely be said
                    to have founded a school; Bailey has" (347).</p>
                  <p> The Spasmodics then, were not “a school only in name” as Rudy, Cronin, and
                    others argue, but were thought of immediately as one, with fixed members and
                    characteristics, and thought of themselves as belonging to one. Although it is
                    true that there isn’t a formal aesthetic charter in place like Shelley’s
                        <emph>Defence of Poetry</emph> or Wordsworth’s prefaces to <emph>Lyrical
                        Ballads</emph> announcing an express purpose, the Spasmodics comprise a
                    coherent school and a serious movement that merits discussion both as a group of
                    individuals working toward a common aesthetic and as a body of work.</p>
                  <p> Furthermore, the Spasmodics were not only a school appreciated by the masses but
                    were influences on most of the important poets then living. Charles LaPorte has
                    recently shown how Smith’s aesthetic balance informed and structured Elizabeth
                    Barrett-Browning’s masterwork, <emph>Aurora Leigh</emph>. Heather Morton has
                    shown Spasmodic influence on Swinburne. The Rossettis were ardent admirers.
                    Dobell was a close friend and literary encouragement to the Brontes. And these
                    are just a very few. As will be shown, since they conceived of themselves as
                    Shelley’s wild west wind, blowing change and revolution hither and yon, their
                    widespread poetic influence ought to be considered as part of Shelley’s legacy. </p>
                  <p> Finally, the Spasmodics were not only influential poetically, but politically,
                    to which notion we will shortly return in more detail. However little we think
                    of them now, the Spasmodics affected world leaders in Italy, Germany, and
                    Russia, among others, which we can add to Shelley’s attempts at reform in
                    Ireland, England, and Greece, since he can be considered the movement’s
                    progenitor. Some of this work on Shelley’s political influence has been done.
                    Bouthaina Shaaban, for example, maps references to Shelley in the Chartist
                    press, a valuable reference for scholars working either on Shelley’s reception
                    or on Chartism. That Shelley's poetry was read by revolutionaries is not new
                    knowledge, but that his politico-poetic ideals were fleshed out, more or less
                    instantly upon the widespread availability of his poems, is. </p>
                  <p> The Spasmodics are referred to by their contemporaries as having belonged to
                    “The School of Keats” (Clough 159). One critic in the <emph>Saturday Review</emph> compared Keats and the Spasmodics
                    under the heading "Poetical Nuisances": <quote>A new poetical school is
                        springing up which ought to be brought under the Nuisances Removal Act. Just
                        as society is trying to put down the bone boilers and glue-makers, so must
                        criticism awaken to its new and dirtier duties. Extirpation is the only
                        remedy. What insults the natural propriety is only to be handed over to the
                        police...Here is a writer who has got hold of...the mannerism of Keats, and
                        the impudence of Leigh Hunt...who is as dull as Bailey, and as sensual as
                        Alexander Smith. (Saturday Review 327)</quote> Critics thought this because,
                    by the 1850s, Keats’ reputation had not sufficiently recovered—in part by Lord
                    Houghton's <emph>Life</emph> in 1856 and the letters thereafter—and to link a
                    writer with him was an insult. The comparison is meant to call up images of the
                    lower classes, effeminacy, escapism, and a kind of unmanly poetic striving for
                    fame.</p>
                  <p> Even now scholars set them alongside Keats, thinking they wrote apolitical,
                    escapist verse in an anti-classicist mode. I argue that we've been wrong on both
                    those scores and that “The School of Shelley” is the more appropriate label due
                    to the Spasmodics’ deep engagement with his work and various homages to it, and
                    for their Shelleyan political engagements.</p>

                  <head>Resuscitating Shelley</head>
                  <p>Among Shelley’s first and most ardent readers were the Chartists. Chartist poet
                    Thomas Frost records how reading Shelley made him “a chartist, and something
                    more” (cited in Sanders 8). W. J. Linton records the reading of Shelley’s
                        <emph>Queen Mab</emph> as one of his formative experiences (cited in Sanders
                    8). If Shelley’s attempts at political insurrection didn’t always materialize,
                    his attempts at poetical insurrection did. Shelley spawned a cadre of
                    imitators—ballad-mongers, rebels—and many of these found their ways to Chartism. </p>
                  <p> In what he calls “the Chartist Imaginary,” Mike Sanders shows how poetry was,
                    for that group, no mere decoration but an essential component of the movement,
                    since it “transforms the consciousness of the reader” (9). This is Shelley’s
                    project written on the polis. Sanders explains how exposure to writers like
                    Burns and Shelley created in working-class writers a transformation that was
                    “qualitative and total…it does not alter any specific opinions held by its
                    readers, but is experienced by them as the acquisition of new powers in general”
                    (10).</p>
                  <p> Chartist readings of Shelley are important here because many Chartists were also
                    Spasmodics, and vice versa. In fact, some say the movements are
                        indistinguishable.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Except, I argue, that
                        Spasmodism is <emph>primarily</emph> an aesthetic movement that has
                        political overtones, while Chartism is primarily a political one, that has
                        poetic basis. </note> Ernest Jones is the most important of these double
                    agents, since he was widely acknowledged the last leader of the Chartists and is
                    also included among the first Spasmodics. Phyllis Mary Ashraf, who also lists
                    Shelley as an exemplar for Chartists in her <emph>Introduction to Working-Class
                        Literature in Great Britain </emph>also has Ebenezer Jones and Gerald Massey
                    as Chartist poets, which is important, since they are also always listed among
                    Spasmodics. In any case, Spasmodism and Chartism shared numerous members,
                    aesthetics, and concerns.</p>
                  <p> Not content simply to read Shelley’s verse, and to espouse his politics, many
                    Spasmodics penned him various forms of homage. James Thomson—the last
                    Spasmodic—is known to history by his <emph>nom de plume</emph>, “James Thomson
                    B.V.,” which serves to distinguish him from the earlier James Thomson, author of
                        <emph>The Seasons</emph>, and to acknowledge his debt to his two heroes.
                    “Bysshe Vanolis” is meant to reference Shelley’s middle name and the German poet
                    Novalis. Thomson writes a defense in 1860 called simply “Shelley,” deriding the
                    harsh treatment Shelley received both during and after his life. Thomson argues,
                        <quote>probably no man of this century has suffered more and more severely,
                        both in person and reputation, from this rash convictive bigotry than Percy
                        Bysshe Shelley. Florence to the living Dante was not more cruelly unjust
                        than England to the living Shelley. (14)</quote> If we have come to
                    recognize this hyper-defensive language with regard to Shelley’s reputation, we
                    should also recognize that much of it comes through the Spasmodics.</p>
                  <p>In 1861, Thomson writes a long narrative poem, again called “Shelley,” wherein he
                    both recalls the earlier poet, and imitates his syntax. The poem begins, <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>UPON a grassy slope of shore I lay</l>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Shelleyan lyricism pervades Thomson’s poetry, early and late.
                    Nearly 20 years after this publication, still an acolyte, Thomson took Shelley
                    as a guide through atheism and despair in his magnum opus, <emph>City of
                        Dreadful Night (1880)</emph>.</p>
                  <p> Thomson was not alone among the Spasmodics in revering Shelley. Sydney Dobell’s
                    lecture, “On the Nature of Poetry,” delivered in Edinburgh in 1857, was a direct
                    answer to Shelley’s <emph>Defence of Poetry</emph>, and his own poems owe much
                    to Shelley’s. Dobell’s friend and collaborator Alexander Smith offered a
                    clear-eyed summary of Dobell’s indebtedness: “Of all recent writers,” Smith
                    writes, “[Dobell] bears the closest resemblance to Shelley. He has much of
                    Shelley’s impracticability, exaggeration, and hectic over-color; he has all
                    Shelley’s subtlety, analytic habit and power, splendor of imagery, dramatic
                    instinct, and rich-flowing lyrical impulse” (189). Smith may be overstating the
                    case, as would be usual, but he’s not far off the mark.</p>
                  <p> Though it is possible the Spasmodic poets came independently to appreciations of
                    Shelley, they were likely encouraged so to do by the editor cum patron George
                    Gilfillan (1815-1873). Reverend Gilfillan, an immensely popular minister from
                    Dundee, Scotland, is probably the second most important critic in the early
                    Victorian period, after Carlyle. Like the rest of the Spasmodic School, his
                    reputation has faded, but as author of Walter Scott’s biography and the
                    best-selling <emph>Bards of the Bible</emph>, editor of Robert Burns, and much
                    else, he was for a time a tastemaker without parallel. Gilfillan is often
                    credited with having founded the Spasmodic School, since he was an early
                    supporter of Alexander Smith and Sydney Dobell, to a large extent architecting
                    their careers. </p>
                  <p> Gilfillan possessed a remarkable breath of literary taste and was in a position
                    to inflict that taste on others. As LaPorte and Rudy note, “he worked toward
                    broadening the usual horizons of the British poetic tradition” (427). They point
                    out, rightly, that many lesser-known British poets, from Gilfillan’s volume of
                    the same name, have been vindicated by history: <quote>John Gower, Thomas
                        Hoccleve, John Lydgate, Sir John Skelton, George Gascoigne, Sir Philip
                        Sidney, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Donne,
                        Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, Robert Herrick, Catharine
                        Phillips, Andrew Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas
                        Chatterton </quote> are listed there among others (427). He was also a
                    staunch, a radical, supporter of Shelley.</p>
                  <p>Though most now condemn Gilfillan's moralizing conservatism, we should recognize
                    how forward was his defense of the Satanic School in the 1830s (Buckley 50).
                    Comparing Shelley to Keats, Gilfillan writes that the former is “superior”
                        <quote>in sustained stateliness, in sounding march, in extent of knowledge,
                        power of intellect, and purity of taste, and free…from [Keats’] babyism of
                        manner, affectations of style, endless sinkings away from the finest
                        eloquence. (90)</quote> Moreover, the preacher directly compares Shelley to
                    the biblical writers, as in the following excerpt. <quote> In somewhat lower,
                        but still lofty regions, we find the same facutly presiding…as in…Shelley.
                        In those writers who had the benefit of inspiration it is the same. Think of
                        Isaiah with his glowing eloquence! Ezekiel with his stupendous visions!
                        (Gilfillan 92)</quote> To call Shelley a prophet—for a minister of the
                    church to call Shelley a prophet—was itself an act of transgression. In the
                    years following his death, before Shelley’s reputation had recovered from early
                    scandal among the Victorian reading public, Gilfillan both sounded his genius to
                    the world and recommended him as an example to the ascendant poets who made up
                    the Spasmodic school.</p>
                  <p> The Spasmodics were criticized, as was Shelley, largely for the socio-political
                    instability that their work suggested, and from the same quarters. This claim
                    warrants a more space than I can give it here, but it is easy to imagine how
                    Smith’s epic <emph>A Life-Drama</emph> that crescendos in a rape scene, Dobell’s
                        <emph>Balder</emph> wherein a man kills his wife, might unsettle a
                    conservative readership. Kirstie Blair reads a prejudice in early reviewers,
                    noting how terms like “‘irregular” and “perverted” hint at the potential
                    immorality of this writing, and carry possible connotations of sexual
                    depravity,” a sexual depravity associated in the Victorian mind primarily with
                    Shelley and Byron. </p>
                  <p> It is no surprise that the chief critic of Spasmodism, was William Aytoun, Tory
                    and editor at (where else?) <emph>Blackwood’s Magazine</emph> from 1839 to his
                    death in1865. Aytoun wrote damning articles about Shelley and published them
                    alongside damning articles about the Spasmodics, because to him, and to many,
                    they comprised one movement: radicals. Aytoun is also where the term comes from.
                    We owe “Spasmodic” as a specific poetic group to Aytoun, who pilloried these
                    writers under that name in his satire <emph>Firmillian</emph> (1854), but we owe
                    the literary term to Charles Kingsley, who in 1853 used it to describe Shelley’s
                    verse:
                <quote>“and thus arose a spasmodic, vague extravagant, effeminate, school of poetry,
                    which… possess, elements in common with Shelley’s” (51).</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p> Spasmodic politics were more or less exactly in line with Shelley’s. It was a
                    working-class movement from the beginning. Bailey’s first readers were the
                    gathered printers and mechanics who helped produce the book and thereafter
                    formed a literary club. Smith was himself a pattern-tracer in a Glasgow
                    manufacturing house. Dobell was a religious non-conformist. Bigg was a firebrand
                    editor. Jones was a Chartist. For the most part, they threw themselves into
                    reformist causes with Shelleyan vigor. </p>
                  <p> This is important to note because even contemporary scholars have imagined the
                    Spasmodics as merely an aesthetic movement, uninterested in politics. Richard
                    Cronin calls Smith’s work “entirely apolitical,” claiming that “by the time he
                    wrote <emph>A Life-Drama</emph>, Smith had already given up on politics”
                    (“Alexander Smith and the Poetry of Displacement”). </p>
                  <p> Cronin here is likely following Arthur Hugh Clough, Matthew Arnold’s friend and
                    fellow Spasmodic detractor. Where Cronin calls Smith “escapist,” and “obsessed
                    with the Kentish countryside,” Clough writes “Yet really, and truth to tell, is
                    it not, upon the whole, an easy matter to sit under a green tree by a purling
                    brook, and indite pleasing stanzas on the beauties of nature and fresh air”
                    (99)? But that is not the Spasmodic project anymore than it is Shelley’s. </p>
                  <p> True, Smith had been attending Chartist meetings, participating in a working
                    men’s educational co-op, and editing a reformist journal before publication of
                        <emph>A Life-Drama</emph> (1853), and as Cronin points out, seeing the two
                    Chartists hung in the town square was likely sobering. But his work didn’t leave
                    the political at that point, nor at any other. </p>
                  <p> To mark<emph> A Life Drama</emph> as the end of Smith’s political phase is an
                    odd choice, since his very next poetic effort was a collaboration with the
                    Marxist/Chartist Sydney Dobell, called <emph>Sonnets on the War</emph> (1856).
                    There are few more politically engaged collections of poetry in the entire age:
                        <emph>Sonnets</emph> covers British positions on Hungary, America, Italy,
                    and the Crimea, in a pull-no-punches manner. With titles like “The Army
                    Surgeon,” “The Wounded I,” “The Wounded II,” “Vox Populi,” “Sebastapol,” and
                    “The Cavalry Charge,” the charge that the Spasmodics were “apolitical” hard to
                    maintain indeed. </p>
                  <p> Neither were these very political young writers simply twittering away in golden
                    bowers about the war. Their poetry was actually read, and, some say, affected
                    the outcome of certain political revolutions. The Italian liberation fighter
                    Guiseppe Mazzini (also friends with another Spasmodic, Ernest Jones) wrote that
                    Dobell’s <emph>The Roman</emph> was the poem he would have written about Italy,
                    had he been a poet (Kierstead 71) . </p>
                  <p> We should notice how rare this is. We have poems that interpret or record
                    political events, and ones about revolutionary leaders that are popular with
                    people, but rare is the political poem which is timely and forceful enough to
                    have been read, much less lauded by the leaders of the movement it represents.
                    And the poem was effective, as Christopher M. Kierstead writes. Mentioning
                        <emph>The Roman</emph> as a template for Rossetti’s later confrontation of
                    the “Italian Question,” he argues that Dobell’s poem “was a politically useful
                    means of vindicating the Italian cause in the minds of the British public at a
                    time when it needed reassurance after the downfall of Mazzini’s short-lived
                    Roman Republic in 1849” (71). </p>
                  <p> Mazzini continues his exhortation to Dobell, seeming himself to channel Shelley,
                    “and what you write flows from the soul, the all-loving, the all-embracing, the
                    prophet-soul” (qtd. Kierstead 71). “Prophet-soul” is right; in an avocation
                    coincident of “A Song: ‘Men of England,’” Dobell, dropping all poeticisms, wrote
                    in 1867 to the Italian rebels, “Fight! you mad, magnificent, foolish nation”
                    (Ellis 210). Add that Spasmodist Ernest Jones was a personal friend of Karl Marx
                    and Friedrich Engels, and the political range of Spasmodic poetics broadens
                    significantly.</p>
                  <p> In a kind of answer to claims that Shelley didn’t accomplish more politically,
                    Kierstead writes, “Ultimately, the poet does not claim for himself the role of
                    leader but instead, the role of instigator—one who senses the greatness of the
                    cause and acts with an almost mystical force in bringing political events to
                    fruition” (71). Mark Kipperman likewise writes defending Shelley’s
                    interventionist political poetry from detractors such as Matthew Arnold and,
                    more recently, Susan Wolfson. He states that Shelley’s hope in <emph>The Mask of
                        Anarchy</emph> for the “moral force of the masses’ protest” involves both a
                    “class demand” for “urgent material needs,” and a renewed “self-respect” in
                    which they, the victims, “stand for the absolute moral order of reciprocal
                    justice” (9). “Self-respect” is the “something more” alluded to by Hood who said
                    that reading Shelley “made me a Chartist, and something more.” The “mystical
                    force” Krierstead mentions is what Kipperman likely has in mind when he answers
                    concerning Shelley’s political potency, <quote>the dream vision of an aristocrat
                        may perhaps constitute a more incisive political analysis than a ballad
                        about the rebel framebreaker, General Ludd. In fact, peculiar though it may
                        seem, Adorno would probably see the dream vision section of Shelley’s poem
                        as even more subversive than its working-class balladry. (4)</quote> I have
                    argued here for a second answer: the poet not only as visionary, but as
                    instigator of visionaries. In the space of a single generation, Shelley had the
                    ear—had in some cases the beating hearts—of world leaders and revolutionaries
                    through the poetry of the Spasmodics, with which movement he was affiliated from
                    the first, which is itself more political than has heretofore been acknowledged,
                    and which in any fair legislation, ought to be trumpeted more broadly still.</p>

               <p>In the short run, government prosecution of radical publishers
                    after Peterloo affected literary sensibilities of late Romanticism, evident
                    in the fall in popularity of political satire in the 1820s. In the long run,
                    government repression, by silencing dissent, shaped the canon of radical and
                    Romantic literature. This essay explores the forgotten career of the radical
                    satirist and publisher, John Cahuac, cut short by his transportation.</p>

               <p> Donald Read, a Peterloo historian, has observed that the 1819 massacre of
                    political reformers by local yeomanry in Manchester’s St. Peter’s Field “had its
                    influence in the realm of the arts” and that it “inspired” Percy Shelley as well
                    as “many contemporary prints” (208). Indeed, Peterloo provided a lasting image
                    of political tyranny: mounted and uniformed riders slashing gratuitously with
                    sabers through a panicked crowd. Moreover, as James Chandler has aptly
                    expressed, “the more one reads in public or private commentary by intellectuals
                    across the political spectrum of England in 1819, the more one sees of
                    revolutionary hopes and fears” (21). And yet, while both Read’s and Chandler’s
                    observations are correct, both are optimistic, strictly speaking. Peterloo also,
                    and more significantly, inspired intense political and cultural repression. E.
                    P. Thompson somewhat wryly refers to the 1820s as “the quiet years” of radical
                    culture (171): despite the occasional outbursts by defiant publishers such as
                    Richard Carlile, editor of <emph>The Republican</emph>, or Thomas Wooler, editor
                    of the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph>, English radicalism—where it survived—was forced
                    underground (711-23). In his recent discussion of censorship in the eighteenth
                    century, Richard Darnton has argued that “state intervention in the literary
                    realm went far beyond the blue-penciling of texts. It extended to the shaping of
                    literature itself as a force at work throughout the social order” (20). This was
                    true in Peterloo-era England as well. Far from refined in its methods, the
                    Liverpool government was belligerent in its response to the mounting propaganda
                    war over public sympathy (Hilton 252-3; Gash 87-90). While Parliament wielded
                    “the hugely blunt instrument of suspending civil liberties,” the Home Office
                    “made furious efforts to mobilize a loyal press as a counterweight to the rash
                    of seditious publications” (Hilton 607; 252). Moreover, Lord Sidmouth spent “a
                    good deal of public money” on domestic spies and informants to thwart those
                    “disaffected demagogues” who sought to “harness social discontent” for the
                    agenda of a national revolution (Gash 87-90). It is more accurate to say, then,
                    that post-Peterloo repression, more than the event that prompted it, had a
                    profound and enduring influence on English literature and culture. Intense
                    repression not only arrested public responses to Peterloo in the 1820s, but also
                    profoundly affected literary sensibilities in the late Romantic period, not to
                    mention subsequent historical accounts of the submerged radical culture of the
                    1820s. The impact of post-Peterloo hegemony is epitomized by the history of John
                    Cahuac, a radical London publisher in 1819, who was effectively silenced and
                    removed from any political discourse, and the fate of his satirical writings,
                    almost entirely forgotten today, confirms the power of the state to affect both
                    contemporary literary sensibilities and future literary history.</p>
               <p>If the massacre itself provoked a flurry of indignant responses in 1819 and early
                    1820 from liberal communities, including Shelley’s now widely-celebrated lyrical
                    satire, <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph>, the consequences of the ensuing
                    repression were more far-reaching. The government systematically prosecuted and
                    imprisoned radical agitators, shut down newspapers and booksellers, ended
                    popular protests and large meetings, silenced authors or otherwise encouraged
                    them to turn away from popular politics, and broke apart liberal political
                    associations. Moreover, as the legal historian Michael Lobban has documented,
                    the government worked rapidly after Peterloo to redefine radical activity as
                    criminal activity: if “seditious libel” had been the prosecutorial weapon of
                    choice before Peterloo, the Peterloo trials provided case law that would
                    establish “the doctrine of unlawful assembly,” which provided terms such as
                    “breach of the peace, obstruction and nuisance” that could be used by
                    authorities as “a lever with which to control dissent” (352). Indeed, radicalism
                    after Peterloo, John Gardner argues, was largely “defeated, by a government that
                    deployed against it, methods that, though they may be morally reprehensible,
                    were both innovative and effective” (220). Prosecution devastated the
                    aspirations of reformers by reasserting the state’s authority to define the
                    agenda of public discourse. This left many of the radicals isolated, dejected,
                    and alienated, including many of the Romantics who had radical sympathies,
                    Shelley among them. As a result, Paul Foot remarks, “many disillusioned
                    revolutionaries … settled for what [was] ‘immediately practicable’ and drifted
                    gently to the right” (224). In short, imminent political persecution had a
                    coercive influence on the literature of the 1820s, most clearly evident in a
                    growing disillusionment with satire by the midpoint of the decade.</p>
               <p>The disillusionment with satire was a broad trend, but specific examples are
                    plentiful. Iain McCalman has observed that Carlile, himself no stranger to
                    hyperbole and sarcasm, surprisingly “blamed fellow radical pressmen … because
                    their propaganda had taken trivial forms” when forced to temporarily shut down
                        <emph>The Republican</emph> at the end of 1820, a little over a year after
                    Peterloo (175). McCalman paraphrases Carlile’s complaint: “squibs and
                    pasquinades could amuse and annoy but not influence serious political change”
                    (175). Similarly, Shelley’s series of responses to Peterloo until his drowning
                    in 1822 reveal a fall in his estimation of the political efficacy and literary
                    merits of satire—from his acerbic and combative “England in 1819” to his more
                    measured and earnest <emph>A Philosophical View of Reform</emph>, and finally to
                    his late and all-but-disengaged political fragments. In his late fragment,
                    “Satire upon Satire,” for example, he regrets the violence of the genre: “Tis
                    not worth while” to compose and publish satires because “harsh words beget hard
                    thoughts” (ll. 44-6; see Jones, “Shelley’s Fragment…”). Beleaguered by the
                    government’s campaign of repression, Carlile and Shelley, to mention only two
                    examples, came to recognize the shortcomings of satire to prompt any real
                    reform.</p>
               <p>The link between the government’s campaign of repression and a popular
                    dissatisfaction with satire has not been evident to all. For example, in his
                    survey of satire from 1789 to 1832, Gary Dyer documents how “satire largely
                    disappeared as a distinct literary form” (139) in the 1820s, and he attributes
                    this disappearance to the rise of a middle-class; to the death of Byron, which
                    made satire “passé;” and to marketplace trends: “publishers needed the reliable
                    profits fiction provided” (139). When citing statistics that reveal a yearly
                    decline in the sales of verse satire, he notes 1820 as an aberration and
                    acknowledges the flurry of radical publications that year, but he does not
                    explore the possibility that the subsequent decline of satire was precipitated
                    by the government’s counter-attacks against radical publications (140-143).
                    Nonetheless, the repression was real, and the government’s multifaceted campaign
                    has been documented (for an initial overview, see Thompson 711-23). “In the same
                    month that Carlile denigrated satirical radical literature,” McCalman notes,
                    “[Lord] Sidmouth [Secretary of the Home Office] and his officials were racking
                    their brains for ways to counteract the ‘deadly weapon’ of popular caricature”
                    because “George and his government were remarkably sensitive to popular ridicule
                    and caricature” (176), and through persistent prosecutions, they were largely
                    successful. Indeed, Marcus Wood concludes his study of radical satire of the
                    Romantic era in 1822 when satirical writing largely disappears. </p>
               <p>Chandler, in his study of English literature of 1819, summarizes succinctly that
                    “the growing agitation all came to an abrupt halt” owing to
                <quote>the combined effect of arrests of key leaders (Henry Hunt, Major Cartwright,
                    Francis Burdett, Richard Carlile, Sir Charles Wolseley), government
                    countermeasures (the Gag Acts, passed on December 30, 1819), and desperate
                    radical plots (The Cato Street Conspiracy, discovered on February 23, 1820).
                    (22)</quote>
                Of course, post-Peterloo repression did not crush radicalism entirely, but the
                    success of attempts to crush satire can be estimated on an immediate level by
                    the slump in bookshop sales after 1820, which Dyer documents, and, taking a
                    broader view, by how successfully government repression ultimately concealed its
                    own efforts. That authors such as Carlile and Shelley turned on the genre of
                    satire suggests their sense of powerlessness in the face of the government
                    counter-measures and unwillingness for one reason or another to address them
                    directly. Regardless, those who were engaged in more immediate prosecutions,
                    such as Thomas Dolby and John Cahuac, reveal more about the government’s actions
                    than those who avoided such engagements.</p>
               <p>To argue that Shelley grew disillusioned with satire is not to argue that
                    Shelley’s radical convictions wavered after Peterloo, or that he was a
                    fair-weather radical, as he famously accused both William Wordsworth and Robert
                    Southey of being. In fact, there have been a number of Shelley scholars,
                    including Michael Scrivener, Steven E. Jones, Mark Kipperman, and John Gardner,
                    who have researched post-Peterloo repression and who have reconstructed from
                    Shelley’s diverse writings a coherent logic to his political convictions, thus
                    demonstrating his steady commitment. These scholars have offered compelling
                    apologies that valorize his developing responses to the government’s campaign.
                    Kipperman, for example, has sought to counter critiques of Shelley’s
                    “aristocratic exile” in Italy and the assumption that his work had little impact
                    because Leigh Hunt suppressed much of it for over a decade (1). To this end,
                    Kipperman distinguishes the political “import” from the “impact” of <emph>The
                        Mask of Anarchy</emph>; that is, he distinguishes its immediate engagement
                    with and influence upon its contemporary political moment from its “total
                    historical and social situation” within “a larger and all-too-effective culture
                    of resistance” (3). This allows Kipperman to argue the significance of Shelley’s
                    participation in radical culture, regardless of whether or not his productions
                    were published. In other words, even if Shelley were aware of the possibility
                    that his writings would be withheld from popular circulation, his continued
                    involvement lent weight to the reform movement when it was forced underground.
                    Moreover, Kipperman continues, <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph> has “a moving
                    target” (4): the identified targets of the satirical humor, Lord Castlereagh,
                    Lord Eldon, and King George IV, should be read merely as incidental metaphors of
                    tyranny and corruption. If readers abstract from the specificity of political
                    allusions, a move that would be obvious to sympathetic readers in other
                    political contexts, the proto-Marxist rhetoric and visionary utopianism of the
                    poem become only more apparent. In this way, satirical humor may once again
                    prove to be a potent means to bring about an awakening of class consciousness.
                    If Chandler sets himself the task of examining “the historical situation of the
                    texts of England in 1819 and … the hermeneutic conceptualization of this very
                    work of historically situating texts” (38), Kipperman pushes aside this
                    methodological concern and attempts to free Shelley’s satires from the critical
                    tendency to static historical determination altogether. Simply put, rather than
                    attempt to historicize it, Kipperman urges readers to follow <emph>The Mask of
                        Anarchy</emph> as it reconfigures across historical contexts. It is a
                    compelling argument, especially when one considers the enduring popularity of
                    Shelley’s visionary writings in unions and working-class associations over the
                    next one hundred and fifty years. </p>
               <p>In any event, despite his political convictions, Shelley’s faith in political
                    satire was not unwavering in the final years of his life, and it is my aim to
                    continue the dialectical history, already begun by Scrivener, McCalman, and
                    Jones, that follows the evolving poetics of satire in the late Romantic period
                    at a time when efforts to suppress radical satire were mounting. Jones, whose
                    central argument about Shelley in <emph>Satire and Romanticism</emph> is that
                    his “radical-reformist satire was a central part of his <emph>oeuvre</emph>”
                    (108), compares Shelley’s 1819-1820 writings to those of Thomas Wooler, editor
                    of the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph> (108). Through this comparison, Jones reveals
                    not only how Shelley deployed “a public discourse that subsumed canonical and
                    subcanonical works alike,” but also and more importantly, that the satirical
                    mode was the essential link between radicalism and Romanticism (104). It is my
                    contention that while satire did indeed serve as this link between the poetic
                    and the political, the link was not long lasting. “In late 1824,” as Neil
                    Fraistat has observed, “England’s poet laureate, Robert Southey, publicly
                    derided the second bookshop of the radical William Benbow, the Byron’s Head, as
                    ‘one of those preparatory schools for the brothel and gallows; where obscenity,
                    sedition, and blasphemy are retailed in drams for the vulgar’” (409). If Southey
                    was particularly outspoken in this regard, most of the Romantics turned against
                    popular political satire after Peterloo. </p>
               <p>Indeed, by the mid-1820s, most Romantics disassociated themselves from satire,
                    often but not necessarily as a retreat from the politics of reform. In short, if
                    it had been cutting-edge in the late 1810s, satire ceased to be fashionable by
                    the mid-1820s. This turn on satire had a legacy that extended well beyond the
                    Romantic period; without identifying post-Peterloo repression, Marilyn Butler
                    notes that “With the passing of time, critics seem to have become less rather
                    than more aware of the satirical and intellectualist strain in Romantic writing”
                    (224). It has only been in the last few decades that critics such as Butler,
                    Haywood, Jones, and Wood have questioned the neglect of satire of the Romantic
                    era, a neglect I contend that was initially prompted by political necessity.</p>
               <p>To appreciate how precipitous the fall was after Peterloo, it is crucial to
                    understand that in the years leading up to Peterloo, radicals and Romantics
                    alike celebrated satire as both the pinnacle of wit and a practical tool for
                    advancing their various political agendas. Satire of the period expressed an
                    earnest conviction that it could identify corruption, exhibit popular interests,
                    redirect popular sympathies and loyalties, alienate political opponents as
                    agents of tyranny, and, ultimately, inspire the solidarity necessary to push
                    through political reform. This was the agenda of all satirical productions of
                    the period. Kyle Grimes has described the combative radical humor of the period
                    as a “verbal jujitsu,” which sought “to expose, disarm, and ridicule …
                    pretensions to authority” (182), but ultimately, its aim was to inspire
                    political solidarity among reformers. The refrain that concludes <emph>The Mask
                        of Anarchy</emph> epitomizes this aspiration: </p>
               <quote>

               </quote>
               <p>In the years subsequent to Peterloo, satirists retreated or were routed. “Why
                    crush a starving bookseller?,” Shelley furiously wrote about government
                    repression to Hunt on November 3, a few months after Peterloo, because in doing
                    so, “tyrants … strike in his person at all of their political enemies” and
                    “divert the attention of the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive
                    Government…” (72-3). As was frequently the case, Shelley’s political commentary
                    was astute. Publishers, including Richard Carlile, Thomas Wooler, William Hone,
                    Thomas Dolby, and Leigh Hunt, were prosecuted in high-profile cases, and many
                    were incarcerated, impressing on all the government’s determination to, in
                    Shelley’s word, “crush” radicalism. One casualty of this repression was John
                    Cahuac, one of Shelley’s “starving bookseller[s],” who was in fact “crushed” by
                    Sidmouth’s campaign against satirists and booksellers.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I discovered John Cahuac’s publications
                        while conducting research in the Pforzheimer Collection at the New York
                        Public Library. This research was made possible by a Carl H. Pforzheimer
                        Research Grant, awarded by the Keats-Shelley Association of America in 2011.
                        I am indebted to Liz Denlinger, who assisted me in finding Cahuac’s
                        publications in the Pforzheimer as well as to my former research assistant,
                        Amy Potter, who found and made coherent many of the records of Cahuac’s life
                        discussed here.</note> Cahuac shared Shelley’s radical sensibility prior to
                    Peterloo, but he had none of the financial advantages Shelley enjoyed, nor was
                    he abroad following Peterloo. Rather, Cahuac was on the front line of radical
                    resistance in England in 1819 and 1820, faced government prosecution, and
                    ultimately, lost. </p>
               <p>In 1819, Cahuac was a working-class publisher and bookseller at 53 Blackman
                    Street, Southwark—the Borough—of south London. After Peterloo, and while being
                    routinely abused by government agents, he composed and published a series of
                    satires. Three command attention: first, a rabble-rousing pamphlet, <emph>Who
                        Killed Cock Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the
                        Manchester Blot!</emph>, akin to those of his better-known contemporary,
                    Hone; second, an openly seditious <emph>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His
                        Oppressive Arrest for the Sale of an Alledged Libel,</emph> about Sidmouth’s
                    relentless campaign of prosecuting publishers while he directed the Home Office;
                    and third, a list of the jury members paid by the Crown during the Queen
                    Caroline scandal, in which Caroline sued for her right to the throne while her
                    husband sought a divorce. Not one of these satires was particularly original or
                    literary, but all three epitomize embattled radical culture post-Peterloo,
                    before it crumbled under repression. </p>
               <p>On September 10, 1823, four years after Peterloo, Cahuac was arrested. He was
                    tried promptly, and found guilty of receiving stolen property (a considerable
                    number of unbound but valuable books), for which he was sentenced to
                    transportation to Van Diemen’s Land for fourteen years, the standard maximum
                    sentence. Cahuac, like all political dissidents who were sentenced to
                    transportation, was “torn from every tie of relationship,” as Thomas Reid
                    reported in his 1822 exposé on the horrors of exile to Australia (2); he was
                    removed from English life, his political career was brought to an end, and his
                    participation in the reform movement to that point was all but erased from
                    history. In fact, references to Cahuac in histories of the period are almost
                    non-existent, but the extraordinarily brazen expressions of political defiance
                    in his post-Peterloo publications should not be lost to history, if for no other
                    reason than because they are exemplary of radicalism in the late Romantic
                    period. </p>
               <p> Although they are piecemeal, there are some records of Cahuac’s life, and taken
                    together, they can provide a sketch of his career. He was born around 1770
                    (records vary) in London to John and Mary Cahuac, the third of five children,
                    and he was baptized at St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, in 1771 (<emph>London,
                        England, Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812</emph>: Record for John
                    Cahuac). It seems that his father was the nephew of Bertrand Cahuac, a wine
                    seller who had migrated likely from Languedoc and whose tavern eventually became
                    the “Caveac” Masonic Lodge, one of many permutations of the original family name
                    (Simpson 30-31). In any case, as a young man, nineteen or twenty, John Cahuac
                    junior worked as a pawnbroker’s assistant for one Mr. Woodin in Drury-Lane, a
                    position which, according to court records, connected him to London’s criminal
                    underworld of fences (See the trials of Elizabeth Ford and Elizabeth Kelley on
                    15 September 1790 and James Bond on 8 December 1790, <emph>The Proceedings of
                        the Old Bailey</emph>). By 1793, he had broken out on his own as a
                    pawnbroker (again, court records suggest that he was still dealing with fences)
                    and then as an apothecary, assigned to the London Dispensary. He sought a
                    military appointment as an apothecary, but no records of any military service
                    exist. He married a woman of the same age named Mary, and they had a son, Henry
                    St. John Cahuac, in 1808 (they would have a second child, a daughter, Elizabeth,
                    who they called Eliza, in 1822) (<emph>Australia Death Index, 1787-1907</emph>).
                    There are no records concerning his parent’s home, his upbringing, or education,
                    and the first records we have of Cahuac’s radical activities suggest that he was
                    in his late thirties or early forties when he became politically active.</p>
               <p>By 1817, Cahuac was working cooperatively with the radical publisher, Thomas
                    Dolby. Dolby had a successful shop a few blocks from the Crown and Anchor public
                    house and was known as a radical reformer. Perhaps through this association,
                    Cahuac became, as J. Ann Hone describes him, one of the “ultra-radicals” in the
                    reform movement in London (287-288). On July 21, 1817, for example, he was the
                    appointed steward for the dinner celebrating the acquittal of Arthur Thistlewood
                    and James Watson at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, the regular meetinghouse of the
                    London Corresponding Society, of which Cahuac was a member (Hone 288).
                    Thistlewood and Watson, both Spencerian radicals, had tried to instigate rioting
                    at the mass meeting at Spa Fields on December 2, 1816, in an attempt to seize
                    control of the Tower of London and the Bank of England. Their acquittal was a
                    triumph for radicals, but their fortunes were short lived. Both were embroiled
                    in the Cato Street Conspiracy, when government spies entrapped them in a
                    manufactured plot to assassinate several members of the government. They were
                    arrested, paraded before an incredulous public, and hanged in 1820.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a fuller discussion of
                        the Cato Street Conspiracy, see Gash, Gardner, and Hilton.</note> Though he
                    seems to have been a close acquaintance to both Thistlewood and Watson, as J.
                    Ann Hone has documented, Cahuac does not appear to have had any involvement with
                    the Cato Street Conspiracy or to have been involved with the Spencerians. </p>
               <p>During the same period that Shelley was looking to set up residence in Italy in
                    1819, Cahuac moved to 53 Blackman Street, acquired and registered his own
                    printing press, as the Unlawful Societies Act of 1799 required, and shifted to
                    working as an independent publisher and bookseller. Because Southwark was home
                    to many dissenters and political discontents, he found a readership for radical
                    literature, but it is more likely that he anticipated this market than merely
                    responded to it. His imprint appears in various radical texts, including works
                    by Thomas Paine, Richard Price, and Elihu Palmer, and he was a distributor of
                        <emph>The Republican</emph>, published by Carlile, whom he seems to have
                    known personally, as well as <emph>The Black Dwarf</emph>. Moreover, with his
                    own press, he became more than just a bookseller; he edited and composed his own
                    radical literature. In that first year with his own press, for example, he
                    published “a New Edition” of Palmer’s <emph>Principles of Nature</emph>,
                    “Revised &amp; Corrected by J. Cahuac.” Later that year, he was tried for this
                    publication, but the “prosecution was compromised for a sum of money,” according
                    to the <emph>London Investigator</emph> (Cooper 82). Then came the news of
                    Peterloo.</p>
               <p>Immediately after Peterloo, in late 1819, Cahuac collaborated with Thomas
                    Rowlandson, the artist, illustrator, draftsman, and caricaturist. That he
                    collaborated with such a prominent figure demonstrates how well connected Cahuac
                    had become. Together they produced the pamphlet entitled, <emph>Who Killed Cock
                        Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the Manchester
                        Blot!</emph> The pamphlet presents a satirical allegory about the brutality
                    and corruption of the government, narrated in the form of an extended nursery
                    rhyme, with sequential caricatures, culminating in a caricature of the king as a
                    bloated peacock, who “Struts unconcern’d at / Cock Robin’s Sad tale.” Wood has
                    suggested that William Hone’s similar <emph>The Political House that Jack
                        Built</emph>, published in December 1819, “was the most notorious popular
                    satiric reaction to the Peterloo massacre” (213). He continues that it
                    “established the basic form in which the majority of Hone and Cruikshank’s other
                    satirical pamphlets were to be produced,” and that it “led to a host of
                    imitations and counter-imitations by both the radical and loyalist press.
                    Radical publishers including William Benbow, Thomas Dolby, John Fairburn, and
                    John Cahuac brought out satires based on the forms of nursery rhyme books, and
                    nursery rhyme parody became part of the currency of popular satire” (213). It
                    should be pointed out, however, that Cahuac’s pamphlet is also dated 1819; if
                    Hone’s was published in December, Cahuac had less than a month to write, have
                    Rowlandson illustrate, edit, print, and bind his imitation. It seems unlikely
                    that <emph>Who Killed Cock Robin?</emph> followed <emph>The Political
                        House</emph>, but rather that it was composed either simultaneously or,
                    perhaps, even before Hone’s publication. In any event, Cahuac was actively
                    participating in what Kipperman called the “larger and all-too-effective culture
                    of resistance” alongside such figures as Hone and Shelley.</p>
               <p> In 1819, this “culture of resistance” believed that satire was the way to reach
                    a popular audience and thereby to win popular support. Indeed, Gardner suggests
                    that “for a brief period in late 1819 Shelley made strenuous attempts … to open
                    himself to the quite different tradition embodied in the work of Hone,
                    Cruikshank, Wooler and the radical pamphleteers” (100), who exploited accessible
                    forms such as caricature, sarcasm and invective, hyperbole, sensational imagery,
                    and simple verse and rhyme schemes, all with the aim of developing a rhetoric of
                    political polarization that would alienate specific targets in power while
                    soliciting popular sympathy. It is perhaps impossible to measure the extent of
                    the political impact of these productions—Shelley’s were suppressed, copies of
                    Hone’s sold in the thousands—but what is clear is that radicals soon became
                    defensive. Cahuac, like all radical publishers in England, was on the frontline.
                    If one follows the fate of Cahuac or Dolby, Hunt’s decisions regarding
                    publishing Shelley’s works seem if nothing else to be prudent, as Gardner
                    suggests (100).</p>
               <p>The course of Thomas Dolby’s political career as a publisher and bookseller was
                    similar to Cahuac’s own, but, fortunately, unlike Cahuac, he published
                        memoirs.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I am indebted
                        to Karen Nangle and the Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke
                        Rare Book and Manuscript Library, for scanning one of the very few known
                        copies of Dolby’s memoirs.</note> The son of a tenant farmer and
                    roof-thatcher in Huntingdonsire, Dolby left his humble origins by attaching
                    himself as a personal assistant to a retired general. He recounts in his
                    autobiography that in 1808 he quit this service and set up shop in London as a
                    seller of stationery and books. Although he had had little formal education and
                    no familial resources to help establish his business in the city, Dolby was
                    nevertheless shrewd, resourceful, and sociable. He met Leigh and John Hunt (97),
                    began to sell radical newspapers, including Cobbett’s <emph>Political
                        Register</emph>, and, as Jonathan Topham has noted, “His shop became a focus
                    for radical activity” (81). </p>
               <p>By 1817 Dolby had acquired printing presses, establishing a national distribution
                    network, and in that year, as he records in his memoirs, “we all went
                    politically mad” (108). He met Henry Orator Hunt, endorsed his reformist
                    campaign before Peterloo (where Hunt was scheduled to be the keynote speaker),
                    and participated in events at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, the political
                    meetinghouse for many of the key reformists, which was conveniently one block
                    from his shop (109; and see Topham 81-3). Moreover, he began selling radical
                    satires, namely <emph>The Pasquin</emph> and the <emph>Political
                        Dictionary</emph>, which made him both successful and infamous: “In the
                    summer of 1819, I was arrested on two informations by the Attorney General for
                    selling two numbers of Sherwin’s <emph>Register</emph>, in which some strong
                    remarks were made on the employment of the military in civil affairs, and
                    particularly on the memorable Manchester massacre” (112). Dolby was targeted and
                    prosecuted by the government for selling radical satires, and his memoirs make
                    clear that he understood the political battle in which he was deeply
                    involved:
                <quote>I wish as far as possible to avoid political remarks in this book; but I must
                    just observe, that the Sidmouth and Castlereagh administration of that day …
                    groped their way onward with daggers and dark lanthorns. One of their favorite
                    objects was the slavery of the press. They did not strike the blow boldly at
                    once; but secretly connived at and encouraged the very mischief which publicly
                    they affected to deplore, in order that under such fostering care, it might rise
                    to such a pitch as to warrant them in going the full length they wished, for the
                    enslavement of the press generally. (112-3)</quote>
                While his attorneys were successful in having the court drop the charges in 1819,
                    Dolby was the special focus of Charles Murray, an attorney representing the
                    non-governmental, arch-Tory and anti-Jacobin Constitutional Association, which
                    hunted radicals after Peterloo. News of their activities hit the papers and, in
                    an August 16, 1821 letter, Byron called them the “atrocious crew” (345). Writing
                    considerably later in the century, James Taylor comments acerbically that the
                    soon-dubbed “Bridge-Street Gang,” named after their office location, were
                    comprised of 
                <quote>… a considerable number of wealthy and influential individuals [who] formed
                    themselves into an association for “discountenancing and opposing the
                    dissemination of seditious principles,” and for “supporting the laws for
                    suppressing seditious publications, and for defending the country from the fatal
                    influence of disloyalty and sedition.” (251)</quote>
                Taylor quotes from the Association’s eponymous manifesto, before discussing its
                    inevitable decline once the public began to scrutinize its activities.
                    Nevertheless, in his memoirs, Dolby accuses Murray and his gang of colluding
                    with the courts, of sabotaging his publishing business, which ultimately went
                    bankrupt, of terrorizing his family, leading to the death of his wife, and of
                    defrauding and betraying the people of England, all for personal aggrandizement
                    and financial gain (119-49). While it is unclear the extent to which any of this
                    is true, Dolby was indeed identified on May 30, 1820, by the now-notorious Home
                    Office informant, “J.S.” (John Shegog, whose correspondences are available in
                    the Public Record Office), as an active member of the “Liberal Alliance” (of
                    which Cahuac was also an active member) determined “to carry on Sedition and
                    Treason and to oppose His Majesty, Government, + the laws of the Realm” (PRO).
                    In any case, Murray and his “junto” retreated when questions were raised about
                    the standing of the Constitutional Association to bring the actions against
                    radicals, but not before Dolby was court-ordered to desist publishing political
                    material (149).</p>
               <p>In 1820, Cahuac appeared in court again, charged with seditious libel for selling
                    Carlile’s <emph>Republican</emph>. His defense was rather disingenuous: he
                    pleaded poverty and claimed that “he had merely sold the pamphlet in question
                    without ever having read it,” and that he “sold pamphlets on all questions,
                    whether opposed to or favorable to government,” according to the report, “The
                    King v. John Cahuac,” published in <emph>The Times</emph> (2). In the end, he
                    spent one month in Horsemonger Lane, Southwark’s prison, for seditious libel.
                    Despite his superficial disavowal in court, there is no doubt that Cahuac was
                    still a committed radical. After his release, he published an open letter to
                    Lord Sidmouth, which is nothing short of a full-scale counter-attack, bearing
                    the title, <emph>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His Oppressive Arrest for the Sale
                        of an Alledged Libel</emph>. Cahuac’s self-defense in this letter is a
                    thinly veiled attack. His most immediate issue was that the constables who had
                    arrested him had carried him beyond his neighborhood and outside of London so
                    that he would not have his neighbors as his jurors. Cahuac deems this as yet
                    another instance of recent corruption and abuse of power coming out of the Home
                    Office, but the fourteen-page pamphlet does not shy away from listing others:
                    (1) Sidmouth’s “paltry warfare against newsmen and bill-stickers,” (2) the
                    crown’s “ill-judged act of thanking inhuman butchers for slaughtering their
                    neighbors” at Peterloo, (3) the on-going abuses of over-taxation, rotten
                    boroughs, and poor treasury decisions, and (4) police corruption. What Cahuac’s
                    rant lacks in focus is made up for in wit and defiant indignation. For example,
                    he begins,
                <quote>My lord, Not having the honour of your Lordship’s acquaintance, nor even a
                    knowledge of your person, it cannot be supposed a particle of enmity could in
                    any shape dictate the present Address. Your Lordship will therefore please to
                    consider me as only defending myself from the machinations of those below you,
                    without the smallest intention of giving your Lordship offence. I am, my Lord,
                    one that venerates the Office of Magistrate, even in the hands of a dolt. –But
                    oppression naturally prompts even the beasts of the field to resistance.–
                    (1)</quote>
                Cahuac then warns Sidmouth that if the government does not open itself up to
                    reform, a revolution will ensue, but he carefully tempers this in a passage
                    remarkably similar to Shelley’s post-Peterloo political philosophy. Cahuac adds
                    that the people of England “have learned philosophy from the school of
                    oppression” (10) and that “they will leave the breaking of the peace to those
                    paid to protect it” (11). When his ranting threatens to outstrip his wit, which
                    is frequent, he interjects with poignant quotes from Swift, Addison,
                    Shakespeare, and the Bible. Nevertheless, the letter remains a fiery piece: “The
                    clergy tell us,” he continues, “out of Hell there is no redemption. That I deny,
                    my lord; I have escaped the Manchester yeoman, though not your lordship’s
                    informers” (8). Of course, after this publication, he continued to be
                    watched.</p>
               <p>In 1820, radicals called for support for Queen Caroline, hoping to incite popular
                    protest against mounting repression. She had come home from Spain to assume the
                    throne next to George IV, but the new king rebuked her and sought a divorce
                    through parliament. The radicals responded, not so much for her sake, but out of
                    antipathy for the seated government and the new King. They formed the Queen’s
                    Plate Committee, of which Cahuac was a member alongside such notable figures as
                    Major Cartwright, William Hone, and Thomas Dolby (Ingelhart 72; for further
                    discussion of the Committee’s activity, see Hone 316). Public outrage, the
                    committee hoped, might rekindle reform efforts. At this point, Cahuac published
                    the third of his three significant post-Peterloo pieces, a four-page pamphlet,
                        <emph>The Queen’s Judges! Or, a Penny Peep at the Peers</emph>, with an
                    epigraph below the title that reads, “—There is nothing like / A fair, free,
                    open trial, where the King / Can choose His judges and appoint His jury.” It
                    then lists in alphabetical order three hundred and sixty-nine jury members on
                    government payroll and how much each was paid, or as Cahuac has it, “the amount
                    of corrupt Influence attached to each individual Peer from Places, Pensions,
                    &amp;c.” The brashness of this publication was so unchecked that it caught the
                    attention of several American papers covering the Caroline affair, including
                        <emph>The Plough Boy</emph> out of Albany, which described in its “Weekly
                    Summary” the pamphlet’s circulation in England as “extensive” (71).
                    Unfortunately, as John Gardner has pointed out, the Caroline affair fizzled out,
                    and the hopes of radicals and reformers were disappointed; by 1821 it was
                    apparent that both Caroline and the radicals had failed to win popular support.
                    Years later, in a thinly-veiled attempt deny the success of his enemies, Dolby
                    reflected on the failure of his satirical publications,
                <quote>… it will be said the Constitutional Association checked and put a stop to
                    licentious publications. I deny that. Causes arise, and effects follow; causes
                    cease, and effects disappear whether such societies as Mr. Murray’s exist or
                    not. Satire is torpid, unless hatched into animation by some ruling vice or
                    folly. The more vicious the cause, the more stinging the effect. In the case
                    just concluded, the Queen’s arrival and treatment excited a strong feeling
                    throughout the country. Satire was awakened into stinging activity; but the
                    public madness subsided before the poor Queen died; the rage was over, and
                    satire became torpid again. <emph>The Pasquin</emph> and the <emph>Political
                        Dictionary</emph> were too late. The rage that would have devoured them a
                    year before, had gone by. They both died of inanition. Mr. Murray stepped in too
                    late to kill them, but just in time to make them stink; which is the only
                    service such a man is fit for. (149-50)</quote>
                Dolby does not discuss the terms of his plea deal in his memoir that put an end
                    to his career as a radical publisher, and throughout he downplays his own
                    involvement in radical activities, perhaps because he published his memoirs in
                    1827, before the radicals and the reform movement recovered.</p>
               <p>Shelley’s participation in the London radicalism was indirect, and by the middle
                    of 1820, this seeps into his writings. Steven Jones has demonstrated, for
                    example, that Shelley’s fragment “Satire upon Satire,” written at some point
                    between 1820 and 1821 but not published in his lifetime, calls into question the
                    aesthetic, moral, and political merits of the genre even though it
                    simultaneously launches a satirical attack upon Southey for his political
                    apostasy. The poem is, Jones concludes, “a self-conscious exploration of rather
                    than a sententious answer to questions about form and purpose in poetry” (163).
                    This is accurate, but the poem also reveals that Shelley’s earnest convictions
                    about the political utility of satire in 1819 were supplanted by a more private,
                    skeptical, and highly ironic estimation of satire. Nowhere in this reflection on
                    satire does Shelley consider the project of inspiring solidarity, as if such an
                    aim is no longer essential to the genre nor particularly relevant. In 1823, the
                    year after Shelley drowned off the coast of Italy, Cahuac was still politically
                    active in London. In March of that year, the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph> identified
                    Cahuac, alongside Major Cartwright, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Wooler, Capt. R Williams,
                    Mr. George Rogers, and Mr. Webb, as conducting “a select meeting of friends to a
                    Constitutional Reform in the Representation of the people in Parliament,” with
                    the express purpose of producing a document that “should be submitted to the
                    consideration of the Unrepresented throughout the kingdom, a form for
                    petitioning, which, by its instructiveness in the true principles of
                    Representation, and on the undeniableness of the Right of the people
                    universally, as might aid them in their exertions for recovering those rights”
                    (“Parliamentary Reform” 426-427). Gone is the humor, the invectives, and the
                    irony, though clearly Cahuac was still invested deeply in radicalism.</p>
               <p>Cahuac was also in deep trouble. On July 16, he, along with Thomas Beeman, was
                    indicted for stealing one hundred and six printed books from the Fleet Street
                    property of one Benjamin Bensley. Cahuac was charged with receiving the stolen
                    books, while Beeman what charged with their theft. (The books in question were
                    an octavo edition of Lingard’s <emph>History of England</emph>.) At their trial
                    on September 10, both Cahuac and Beeman denied having known each other or having
                    even met before their arrest, much less conspiring together to steal the books.
                    Moreover, Cahuac claimed that he legally purchased the books from somebody else
                    but that his confinement had kept him from locating this individual. The jury
                    took less than an hour to find both guilty (<emph>Edinburgh Annual
                        Register</emph>, vol. 16). Beeman was sentenced to seven years
                    transportation, but, suspiciously, there is no record of him every being
                    transported or incarcerated. Cahuac was sentenced to fourteen years
                    transportation, and we have extensive records of his deportation.</p>
               <p>On September 21, 1823, Leigh Hunt ran an announcement of the indictment of John
                    Cahuac in the<emph> Examiner</emph>, but not a subsequent report on the trial
                    (Hunt 618). There was an account, however, in <emph>The Annual Register</emph>,
                    which reported, “an unusual number (not less than 30)” of “respectable
                    witnesses” appeared in court to testify to Cahuac’s “good character” (“Old
                    Bailey” 125). The <emph>Register</emph>’s report does not mention that Cahuac
                    was a radical publisher who had been tried at least twice previously for
                    seditious libel, nor did it mention his London Corresponding Society membership,
                    nor his association with prominent radicals such as Major Cartwright and Francis
                    Burdett, among others, nor any of his own radical productions. In fact, there
                    seems to be a deliberate circuitousness in the <emph>Register</emph>’s report
                    about Cahuac’s radicalism. From his early years as a pawnbroker’s assistant,
                    Cahuac seems to have had criminal associations, and yet there are details about
                    this trial that are suspect, and it seems likely that his heavy sentence was the
                    result of his political activities rather than his alleged criminal ones.</p>
               <p>In 1824, with two hundred other convicts, Cahuac shipped out from Portsmouth on
                    board the Phoenix II, under Captain Robert White, on a journey that took one
                    hundred and fourteen days (<emph>Founders &amp; Survivors</emph>). He was never
                    to return to England. The “Gaol Report” filed upon his arrival in Van Dieman’s
                    Land reads, “[He is] a respectable Man &amp; may be relied upon” but also that
                    he was transported for the felony: “Buying Books, knowing them to have been
                    stolen, once for publishing a blasphemous libel” (<emph>Founders &amp;
                        Survivors</emph>). The report gives us our only physical description: In his
                    mid-fifties, Cahuac was five foot three and a half, had gray hair and eyes, his
                    left hand was crippled, and he had a notable scar over his left eye
                        (<emph>Founders &amp; Survivors</emph>). On August 15 1825, less than two
                    years after he was sentenced, he was granted permission to leave Van Dieman’s
                    Land and to proceed on to Sydney. He immediately submitted a petition “for his
                    family to be sent out to the Colony at Government expense” (<emph>Colonial
                        Secretary Index</emph>), giving inexplicably “H.R.H. Princess Sophia of
                    Gloucester as his only referee in England” (Picton Phillips 227). Surprisingly,
                    this was granted five days later as was a “recommendation for a ticket of
                    leave,” essentially probation that would allow him to find employment
                        (<emph>Colonial Secretary Index</emph>). Mary arrived with their two
                    children but died two years later in 1827. There are a few records of his life
                    in Australia, but John Cahuac’s political career as an English radical had ended
                    in 1823. He died in Australia in 1832, at roughly sixty-two years old.</p>

               <p>This essay reads Percy Bysshe Shelley's <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title> in the context of the
                    resurgence of critical interest in anarchist theory. The essay meditates on
                    how recent developments in anarchist-related critical theory, specifically
                    the work of Jacques Rancière, make visible an aesthetics of anarchism. Using
                    Rancière's re-contextualization of the Romantic aesthetic philosophies of
                    Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Schiller, the essay argues that Shelley's protest poem can be read
                    as an anarchism not only in terms of its political content, but, perhaps more
                    radically, with respect to its form. In so doing, the essay attempts to think
                    beyond the critical impasse in which <title level="m">The Mask</title> is understood as sacrificing
                    aesthetics for politics, or politics for aesthetics, by asking how <title level="m">The Mask</title>
                    might be read as expressing an anarchic politics, in Rancière's words,

               <p>Percy Shelley’s <emph>The Mask of Anarchy </emph>(1819) has been revered by
                    political radicals of all stripes, from Chartists to Marxists, and although a
                    Marxist orientation arguably comprises the “mainstream” interpretation of
                    Shelley as a political radical, the same history sees Shelley more or less
                    adopted as part of an international anarchist literary canon. Indeed, as Eric
                    Hobsbawm avers, in the early part of the twentieth century “interest in Shelley”
                    became something of a sign by which anarchists often recognized one another
                    (82). In his canonical 1962 history of the movement, George Woodcock noted that
                    it was in Shelley—as the chief disciple of William Godwin, his father-in-law and
                    unofficial founder of modern anarchism—“that anarchism first appears as a theme
                    of world literature. And, though Shelley must perhaps cede to Tolstoy the honour
                    of being the greatest of anarchist writers, he remains the greatest of anarchist
                    poets” (91).</p>
               <p> Yet, as Michael Scrivener noted some time ago, Shelley’s connection to anarchism
                    has received little more than “spotty acknowledgement” (35), a forgetting that
                    persists today despite the abiding critical interest in his politics. Recent
                    years, however, have seen a dramatic resurgence of popular and academic interest
                    in anarchist theory and practice, prompting Simon Critchley to propose an
                    “anarchist turn” across the disciplines (“The Anarchist Turn”). This turn marks,
                    among other things, a certain return by contemporary radical theorists to one of
                    the root insights of anarchist thinking; namely, its fundamental critique of
                        <emph>archē</emph>, the foundations or “first” principles which historically
                    serve as the metaphysical ground and justification for a hierarchical
                    construction of the social. If, as Kir Kuiken has recently argued, the political
                    and aesthetic upheavals that mark Romanticism make its aesthetics the locus “for
                    a fundamental set of questions that can no longer be resolved by reference to a
                    pre-given ground or authority” (4), then the recent anarchist turn is itself the
                    return of a certain Romanticism that remains to be thought through. </p>
               <p> In this essay, I explore the implications of the anarchist turn for Romanticism
                    as the possibility of a return to Woodcock’s view of Shelley as an anarchist
                    poet. My purpose, however, is not simply to interpret Shelley’s politics as
                    anarchist; rather, this essay meditates on how recent developments in anarchist
                    theory make visible an <emph>aesthetics</emph> of anarchism, and how this
                    aesthetics is deployed in one of Shelley’s most expressly anarchistic poems,
                        <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph>. What follows investigates this possibility
                    primarily via the work of Jacques Rancière, whose work on the politics of
                    aesthetics has strong ties to the anarchist turn.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See in particular May, “Kant via Rancière: From Ethics to
                        Anarchism” in <emph>How Not to Be Governed: Readings and Interpretations from the Critical Left</emph>,
                            65-82; Newman, “Post-Anarchism and Radical Politics Today” in <emph>Post
                                Anarchism: A Reader</emph>, 58-61.</note> The relationship
                    between anarchic and Romantic discourses in Rancière’s thinking, and their
                    importance for Romanticism itself, has yet to be explored in detail. The
                    coordinates for relating these discourses are found in Rancière’s notion of the
                    “aesthetic regime,” which he locates in the Romantic period. For Rancière, texts
                    such as Kant’s <emph>Critique of Judgment</emph> (1790),<note place="foot" resp="editors">Hereafter cited parenthetically using the abbreviation
                            <emph>CJ</emph>.</note> Schiller’s <emph>Letters on the Aesthetic
                        Education of Man </emph>(1795), Wordsworth’s preface to the <emph>Lyrical
                        Ballads </emph>(1802), and, for our purposes, Shelley’s <emph>Defence of
                        Poetry</emph>, generate a “literary formula for the democratic principle of
                    equality” (<emph>Politics of Literature </emph>10-11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">References to frequently cited Rancière texts are hereafter
                        indicated parenthetically by the following abbreviations: <emph>Aesthetics
                            and its Discontents </emph>= <emph>AD</emph>; <emph>The Politics of

                        indicated by shortened title.</note> This democratic principle does not
                    correspond to political anarchism per se but with a “primary ‘anarchism’ at the
                    heart of politics” as such, a “rupture in the logic of <emph>archē</emph>” which
                    “presupposes that a determinate superiority is exercised over an equally
                    determinate inferiority” (“Democracy” 174-75; <emph>Dissensus</emph> 30-31). </p>
               <p>This an-archy provides a critical architecture for understanding Shelley’s
                    relationship to anarchism not in terms of its political content but as
                        <emph>form</emph>, specifically in its paradoxical Kantian-Schillerian
                    modality as a “suspension” of relations of domination, which, I argue, provides
                    the aesthetic coordinates for <emph>The Mask</emph>’s emphasis on passive
                    resistance. Examining this an-archic conception of form, this essay thus
                    attempts to think beyond the critical impasse in which <emph>The Mask</emph> is
                    understood either as sacrificing aesthetics for politics<note place="foot" resp="editors">The history of critical reception of <emph>The Mask</emph>
                        either ignored the poem entirely (Bloom, Wasserman) or dismissed its
                        deliberately stripped-down verse as poetically inferior (Webb 93). Even
                        sympathetic appraisals by Scrivener, Richard Hendrix, Thomas Edwards, and
                        Stephen C. Behrendt alternately characterize Shelley’s blend of “dramatic
                        form” with “political insight” as “imperfect,” “contradictory,” and as such
                        potentially damaging to the very causes it seeks to promote (Scrivener 199,
                        Hendrix 68, Edwards 161-68, Behrendt 199).</note> or a mere “aesthetic
                    processing” <emph>of</emph> politics (Wolfson 195). Rather, by linking
                    Rancière’s analysis of the aesthetic regime to one of Shelley’s most exoteric
                    political poems, the essay asks how <emph>The Mask </emph>might be read as
                    expressing an an-archic politics “simply by being literature” (Rancière,
                        <emph>PL </emph>3).</p>
               <p>In this respect, parts of my argument dovetails with recent work on Shelley by
                    critics like Kuiken and Matthew Borushko, who have re-emphasized the centrality
                    of form in Shelley’s political texts. My analysis of the suspension of form in
                    Kant and Schiller via Rancière echoes what Borushko has called, via Adorno, the
                    “alliance between the aesthetic [form] and nonviolence” in Shelley’s
                        <emph>Mask</emph> (97). In turn, my own argument extends these critical
                    insights by linking this inherently political conception of the aesthetic to
                    Rancière’s aesthetic regime so as to provide a different accent on the critical
                    history that often touches upon, but rarely examines in depth or in
                    distinctively <emph>aesthetic</emph> terms, Shelley’s connection to the
                    anarchist political tradition.</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p> We can begin with a brief reminder of some of the core ideas informing
                        Rancière’s approach to the politics of aesthetics. Central to this approach
                        is his disjoining of the politics of literature from the politics of
                        writers. For Rancière, the politics of literature is not concerned with “the
                        personal engagements of writers in the social or political struggles of
                        their times,” nor to “the way writers represent social structures” or
                        “political movements . . . in their books.” Instead, the politics of
                        literature concerns the way literature “intervenes <emph>as</emph>
                        literature” in the “carving up of space and time, the visible and invisible,
                        speech and noise” (<emph>PL </emph>3; emphasis added). In this respect,
                        intervention is not the demonstration of a program for political resistance
                        in poetic form; rather, intervention is located in the articulation of form
                        itself, which Rancière sees in Kantian terms as the <emph>a priori
                        </emph>“shape” that reconfigures sensible-perceptual space. By disrupting
                        the tacit distribution organizing the sensible, form also bears a
                        distinctively political potential as “dissensus,” or the “reconfiguration of
                        the distribution of the sensible that defines the common of a community, by
                        introducing into it subjects and new objects, in rendering visible those who
                        were not, and of making understood as speakers those who were only
                        understood as noisy animals” (<emph>AD</emph> 25).</p>
                  <p> Rancière locates the historical emergence of this political dimension of
                        aesthetic form with the “aesthetic regime” of art during the Romantic
                        period. The aesthetic regime arises, in particular, in opposition to a prior
                        “representative” regime of art formulated on the basis of an Aristotelian
                        theory of <emph>mimesis</emph>. The representative was composed of three
                        interrelated elements analogous “with a fully hierarchical vision” of
                        society: the “primacy of action over characters,” a “hierarchy of genres
                        according to the dignity of their subject matter,” and the “primacy of the
                        art of speaking” (<emph>PA</emph> 22). The privileging of narrative as “the
                        imitation of men who act” establishes an opposition between the “rationality
                        of action against the empirical nature of life,” such that “the superiority
                        of the poem, which links actions” over other forms, appears “homologous to
                        the superiority of men who take part in the world of action” (<emph>PL
                        </emph>9-10). Men of action are further privileged in their possession of
                        efficacious speech: orators, princes, princesses, generals, and so on.
                        Moreover, the definitive nature of the rules for aesthetic production means
                        that works of art demand an equally determinate effect on their audience: a
                        successful tragedy, for instance, always culminates in a catharsis.</p>
                  <p>The aesthetic regime, conversely, emerges precisely when the hierarchies of
                        the representative begin to break down. The innovation of the aesthetic
                        regime is an acknowledgement that there are no pre-existing rules for what
                        counts as the subject of a work of art and, therefore, that there are no
                        solid boundaries between the forms of art and those of life: art is freed
                        “from any specific rule, from any hierarchy of the arts, subject matter, and
                        genre” (<emph>PA </emph>23). The aesthetic regime dismantles the
                        hierarchical distribution of subjects, instead promoting an “equality of
                        represented subjects” and an “indifference of style with regard to content,”
                        such that artists no longer have to represent subjects according to specific
                        rules (Rockhill 81). The aesthetic regime thus revitalizes aesthetics by
                        placing it in contact with life, while life is thought to be potentially
                        transformable by its renewed contact with art. One of the byproducts of the
                        aesthetic regime’s abolition of representative rules, however, is precisely
                        “the loss of any determinate relationship between a work and its audience,
                        between its sensible presence and an effect that will be its natural end”
                        (Rancière, “Art of the Possible”). </p>
                  <p> The aesthetic regime’s confusion of the lines between art and life finds its
                        historical parallel in the French Revolution, which overturned the social
                        and political hierarchies correspondent to the generic divisions within the
                        representative regime, while investing transformations of sensible
                        experience and the radical blurring of artistic boundaries with a desire
                        directed towards a future human community. The logic of this shift is
                        evident Wordsworth’s well-known refusal of the rules of engagement by which
                        poets are supposed to “gratify certain known habits of association,” along
                        with his arguments against poetic diction, and his promotion of the
                        “language really used by men” as the proper domain of poetry, all of which
                        exemplifies the aesthetic regime’s desire for art’s renewed contact with
                        life. In the <emph>Defence</emph>, Shelley’s demand for “the poetry of life”
                        (502) similarly manifests the aesthetic regime’s collapse of discursive
                        boundaries. For Shelley, imagination “has for its objects those forms which
                        are common to universal nature,” which includes not only poetry, but “the
                        kindred expressions of the poetical faculty; architecture, painting, music,
                        the dance, sculpture, philosophy, and we may add the forms of civil life”
                        (488). In turn, the <emph>Defence</emph> emphasizes “the connexion of poetry
                        and social good,” for poetry “contains within itself the seeds at once of
                        its own and of social renovation” (492). However, Shelley also acknowledges
                        the contingency of the artwork’s intention and its effect in the image of
                        the fading coal whose “transitory brightness” emits only a “feeble shadow”
                        of its original conception; hence, “it is impossible to predict the
                        greatness of its results” (504). </p>
                  <p> The collapse of the borders between art and life in the aesthetic regime is
                        not as straightforward as it appears, however. On the one hand, the
                        aesthetic regime inaugurates a project of “aesthetic revolution” through its
                        “suspension of the relations of domination” and their transformation “into
                        the generative principle of a world without domination” (Rancière,
                            <emph>AD</emph> 36). On the other, art can only gesture towards this
                        utopian future by virtue of its <emph>distance</emph> from life, that is, by
                        virtue of the autonomy of its form. For Rancière, it is the “resistant
                        figure of the work[’s form] in which political promise is negatively
                        preserved” that generates its an-archic potential (<emph>AD</emph> 36-37).
                        This paradox is compounded by the “generative contradiction” of form itself
                            (<emph>PA</emph> 29): in order for art to preserve its “political
                        promise” it must be distinct from the “natural” organization of bodies in
                        the distribution of the sensible. At the same time, this promise also means
                        that that art must be more than mere art; namely, it must become an agent of
                        transformation. Art can hold onto its political promise only through its
                        disincorporation from existing distributions of the sensible. The aesthetic
                        regime is therefore “inhabited by a heterogeneous power, the power of a form
                        of thought that has become foreign to itself” (<emph>PA </emph>23). This
                        heterogeneous power parallels dissensus: by virtue of its paradoxical
                        autonomy and heteronomy, form produces a gap in the sensible through its
                        neutralization of the customary meanings attributed to words and the
                        assigned relations between bodies and their capacities. It is through this
                        hiatus that form manifests alternative possibilities for a redistribution of
                        the sensible.</p>
                  <p> Rancière arrives at the constitutive paradox of the aesthetic regime through
                        an examination of Romantic aesthetic philosophy, in particular Schiller’s
                        rereading of Kant’s aesthetic judgment. What interests Rancière in Kant and
                        Schiller is their shared emphasis on discerning in aesthetic experience a
                        “form of judgment freed from the hierarchies of knowledge and those of
                        social life” (“Art of the Possible”). For Kant, aesthetic judgment proceeds
                        from a double negation that suspends both the law of the understanding and
                        the law of practical interest. Judgments of the type “this is beautiful” are
                        disinterested, Kant argues, since they function in the absence of any
                        determinate law of the understanding or as an object of desire. As
                        disinterested, aesthetic form is not the imposition of a conceptual unity on
                        manifold sensation but that aspect of an object freely reflected in the
                        imagination in the absence of any determinate concept or empirical interest,
                        so that the imagination is “as it were, at play in the observation of the
                        shape” (Kant, <emph>CJ</emph> 114). No longer subject either to the laws of
                        reason or of sensibility, imaginative play manifests a free and
                        indeterminate relation between the faculties of the imagination and the
                        understanding, which in turn produces “aesthetic common sense”: <quote> a
                            faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (<emph>a
                                priori</emph>) of everyone else’s way of representing in thought, in
                            order as it were to hold its judgment up to human reason as a whole . .
                            . by abstracting from the limitations that contingently attach to our
                            judging, which is in turn accomplished by leaving out as far as is
                            possible everything in one’s representational state that is matter, i.e.
                            sensation, and attending solely to the formal peculiarities of his
                            representation. (<emph>CJ </emph>175-76) </quote> Although Kant’s
                        conception of the aesthetic judgment of beauty is often de-emphasized in
                        favour of the sublime,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See especially J. F.
                            Lyotard, <emph>Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime</emph> (1994).
                            Lyotard politicizes Kant’s ideas on the beautiful and the sublime as
                            “conservative” and “radical” modes of aesthetics, respectively. Rancière
                            offers a productive counter-reading of this interpretation so as to
                            recuperate a radical politics of the beautiful itself. See Rancière,
                                <emph>Aesthetics and its Discontents</emph>, 88-105.</note> in
                        Rancière’s terms it is precisely the emphasis on form in the aesthetic
                        experience of beauty that generates the possibility of dissensus. Crucially,
                        Kant distinguishes his version of aesthetic common sense from the
                        common-sense “realism” of the Scottish Enlightenment, whose privileging of
                        sense-experience Schiller critiques as “judging all experience whatsoever by
                        one particular fragment of experience” (101). Conversely, the formalism of
                        the Kantian aesthetic judgment divests common sense of its unreflected
                        immediacy, encouraging a <emph>critical</emph> relation to the given.
                        Aesthetic common sense emerges precisely when the given empirical
                        distribution of “common sense” is no longer taken for granted. </p>
                  <p>Kant further describes the <emph>sensus communis</emph> generated by
                        aesthetic judgment as <emph>possible</emph> rather than “actual” (<emph>CJ
                        </emph>174). The universality of the aesthetic experience of form does not
                        affirm the <emph>sensus communis</emph> as an already existing state of
                        affairs, as it does for the Scottish realists, but identifies it as a
                        possibility whose withdrawal from the given opens towards Rancière’s
                        conception of equality as a supplement that “separates the community out
                        from the sum of the parts of the social body.” As a universal presupposition
                        in which “to think for oneself” is paradoxically “to think the position of
                        everyone else” (Kant, <emph>CJ</emph> 174), aesthetic common sense
                        identifies the moment when a singular judgment is no longer part of the
                        conventional distributions of the sensible, but identifies itself with
                        “human reason as a whole,” “a communal sphere different from the official
                        public sphere” (Rancière, “Democracy” 174-75). </p>
                  <p> Schiller’s rereading of Kant in the <emph>Letters on the Aesthetic Education
                            of Man</emph> makes the politics within aesthetic judgment explicit. For
                        Schiller, “if man is ever to solve that problem of politics in practice he
                        will have to approach it through the problem of the aesthetic” (90), whose
                        “play” encompasses the very definition of humanity itself: “man only plays
                        when he is in the fullest sense of the word a human being, and <emph>he is
                            only fully a human being when he plays</emph>” (131). In the sixth
                        letter, Schiller criticizes the increasingly “sharper divisions between the
                        sciences” and the “rigorous separation of ranks and occupations” (99) that
                        constitutes the representative regime and its itinerant police order. In
                        aesthetic play, conversely, the mind finds itself a “medium” between reason
                        and sensation: “it is, precisely because it is divided between the two,
                        removed from the constraint of the one as of the other. . . . By means of
                        beauty sensuous man is led to a form of thought” and “spiritual man is
                        brought back to matter” (129, 137). Schiller describes play as emerging in
                        the experience of form, which in its Kantian definition affects the “whole
                        man,” whereas subject matter affects “only one or other of his functions”
                        (151). Schiller encounters the contradictory play of this formal effect at
                        work in his description of the statue of the<emph> Juno Ludovisi</emph>:
                        “the whole figure reposes and dwells in itself, . . . neither yielding nor
                        resisting; here is no force to contend with force. . . . we find ourselves
                        at one and the same time in a state of utter repose and supreme agitation,
                        and there results that wondrous stirring of the heart for which mind has no
                        concept nor speech any name” (132). The aesthetic experience of the statue’s
                        autonomy is inextricably intertwined with its heteronomy, its strange
                        fascination promising a new form of life in its formal difference from
                        ordinary sensation. </p>
                  <p> For Rancière, Schiller’s conception of aesthetic play as the free agreement
                        between reason and sensation articulates a “pure instance of suspension, a
                        moment when form is experienced for itself,” which stands in direct contrast
                        to any “state that governs human societies and puts each person in his place
                        by separating those who command from those who obey” (<emph>PA </emph>24;
                            <emph>AD </emph>97). Hence, the free agreement made possible through
                        aesthetic experience is “already . . . dissensus” (<emph>AD</emph> 97). On
                        the one hand, aesthetic play is dissensus in its refusal of a cognition in
                        which one faculty is subordinated to another; on the other, it is the
                        refusal of any hierarchical division in which one form of life is superior
                        to another. In turn, Schiller’s desire for an “aesthetic education” of
                        humanity comes about as a distinctively nonviolent suspension of (sensible)
                        force contending with (rational) force. This suspension, mobilized by the
                        Kantian-Schillerian concept of form, locates an aesthetics of passive
                        resistance within the politics of Romantic aesthetics, a state in which
                        utter repose is paradoxically and simultaneously a mode of supreme
                        agitation. </p>
                  <p> In the <emph>Defence</emph>, Shelley also speaks of poetry as the play of
                        “exultation and horror, grief and pleasure, eternity and change” that in its
                        synthetic “union under its light yoke all irreconcilable things” (505). This
                        union does not reconcile us with things as they are but “makes us the
                        inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos,” defeating
                        both “the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of
                        surrounding impressions” as well as reason’s “enumeration of quantities
                        already known” (480). Neither “mere life,” nor “mere form,” the suspension
                        made possible in the experience of aesthetic play, creates what Schiller
                        calls “living Shape” [<emph>lebende Gestalt</emph>] (128). Echoing the
                        “Shape” that breeds living thoughts “As flowers beneath May’s footstep
                        waken” in <emph>The Mask </emph>(l. 122), Schiller’s “living Shape” expands
                        Kant’s formulation beyond mere disinterestedness to redeploy aesthetic play
                        as the figure through which both mind and world can be imagined otherwise:
                        on the basis of equality.</p>

                  <p> The tensions Rancière foregrounds in the Kantian-Schillerian notion of
                        aesthetic form—the suspension of attraction and repulsion, repose and
                        agitation, neither yielding nor resisting—provide coordinates through which
                        we can begin to approach similar tensions at work in <emph>The Mask of
                            Anarchy</emph>. The play of these tensions stage <emph>The Mask</emph>’s
                        political promise of equality inherent within the notion of form that
                        emerges with the aesthetic regime. </p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>The Mask</emph> is an especially appropriate example of how such
                        tensions operate; indeed, for much of its reception history, the poem finds
                        itself divided by the very politics and aesthetics it ostensibly tries to
                        reconcile. On the one hand, <emph>The Mask</emph>’s historical popularity
                        with radicals, including anarchists,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            index to American anarchist Benjamin Tucker’s magazine
                                <emph>Liberty</emph> (1881-1908) lists over twenty references to
                            Shelley. <emph>The Mask</emph> proved influential for Tucker himself,
                            who frequently editorialized in the pages of <emph>Liberty

                            power. Shelley was also frequently the subject of lectures at the
                            experimental Modern School founded in New York in 1911 by anarchists
                            Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman (Avrich 121, 129, 149, 352). “To the

                            such as Marcus Graham’s <emph>Anthology of Revolutionary Poetry
                            </emph>(1929), as well as singled out for praise in Victor Méric’s entry
                            on “Poésie” for Sébastien Faure’s <emph>Encyclopédie Anarchiste</emph>
                            (1934). See also Herbert Read, <emph>In Defence of Shelley &amp; Other

                                Defence of Poetry</emph> (1972).</note> has fed its reputation as
                        “the greatest poem of political protest ever written in English” (Holmes
                        532). To be sure, Shelley seems to have intended the poem to be read this
                        way; writing to Leigh Hunt in 1820, Shelley includes <emph>The Mask</emph>
                        as part of a “little volume of <emph>popular songs</emph>, wholly political,
                        &amp; destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination of the reformers”
                            (<emph>Letters </emph>2: 191). Conversely, Susan Wolfson has contested
                            <emph>The Mask</emph>’s celebrated interventionist status on the very
                        basis of its form, seeing in the poem’s blend of dream-vision and political
                        awakening a series of external and internal impasses that undermine the very
                        causes it seeks to promote. Such impasses, from the poem’s belated
                        publication in 1832 rendering it “unable to affect the struggle it
                        addresses” (195), to its framing as a dream-vision from which “the poet
                        never seems to awaken” (195-96), and its reduction of mass political action
                        to a “static aesthetic spectacle” (198-200, 203), disarticulate Shelley’s
                        attempt to put poetry to work in and as politics.</p>
                  <p> Yet even Wolfson’s penetrating reading of <emph>The Mask</emph>’s formal
                        contradictions remains within the scope of critical judgment that measures
                        the poem as a “litmus test” for Shelley’s politics (Kuiken 188). In this
                        respect, Wolfson less overturns the political monumentalization of Shelley
                        than reproduces it negatively as a sign of poetry’s failure to
                            <emph>be</emph> politics. Such approaches potentially miss something
                        crucial about the complex tensions between autonomy and heteronomy that
                        contribute to the aesthetic regime’s political theorization of form itself. </p>
                  <p> In order to gauge how <emph>The Mask </emph>can be an interventionist text
                        “as literature” let us return briefly to Shelley’s statement that <emph>The
                            Mask </emph>is a poem “destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination
                        of the reformers.” At first glance, Shelley’s comment would seem to posit a
                        simple cause and effect relation between poetry and politics. One notes the
                        subtle wording of the remark, however: what is being awakened is the
                            <emph>imaginations </emph>of the reformers. That is to say, what Shelley
                        expresses in <emph>The Mask </emph>is not necessarily poetry as the causal
                        spring of a failed, programmatic, model of politics, but a politics of
                        poetry capable of imagining new forms of collective life. This imagining
                        becomes possible through the poetic reconfiguration of the sensible; hence,
                        the imaginative awakening to which Shelley refers in his letter becomes the
                        “sense awakening” in <emph>The Mask</emph>, something “heard and felt” (l.
                        136-37).</p>
                  <p> Shelley’s much-discussed use of the court masque genre provides a convenient
                        starting point for the poem’s manner of “carving up” the sensible, since it
                        renders palpable the differences between representative and aesthetic
                        regimes. As Stuart Curran points out, Shelley inverts the hierarchy of
                        values typically associated with the masque-antimasque genres. Whereas in
                        the conventional masque, the vulgarity, grotesquerie, and chaos of the
                        antimasque are invoked only to be “superseded by the ritual celebration” of
                        “the received order of society and . . . its structures of authority”
                        (Curran 188, 190), Shelley repurposes the masque such that the authoritative
                        embodiments of order (“God, King, and Law”) now inhabit the “motley crowd”
                        typically associated with the antimasque (l. 27, 40-41, 66). Conversely,
                        Shelley transvalues the masque into an aesthetic form that gives voice to
                        that part that has no part, the “Heroes of unwritten story” (l. 148). In so
                        doing, <emph>The Mask</emph> reconfigures the masque-form as a genre
                        available to everyone: its subjects are no longer situated within the
                        hierarchical arrangement which defines the crowd as the chaotic “other” of
                        social authority, but rather access the passion of ritual celebration
                        hitherto reserved for these forms of authority as available to all.</p>
                  <p> The theoretical basis for this inversion is formulated in the
                            <emph>Defence</emph>, where Shelley redefines drama in the context of
                        the aesthetic regime’s an-archic breakdown of the representative hierarchy
                        of genres. Shelley shifts the meanings of the dramatic form from a code
                        properly separating genres to that “under which a greater number of modes of
                        expression of poetry are susceptible of being combined than any other”
                        (491-92). Though <emph>The Mask </emph>is not as ostentatious in its generic
                        hybridity as the “lyrical drama” of <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>, its
                        redeployment of the masque nonetheless performs a dramatic function which
                        Rancière identifies with “the practice of bringing into play the capacity of
                        the greatest number,” the “many” of the “Ye are many – they are few”
                        (“Democracy” 175). In this context, the function of the masque for Shelley
                        is not political action, insofar as action remains within the representative
                        schema that that aesthetic regime calls into question. Rather, its function
                        in bringing into play the capacity of the greatest number is the
                            <emph>suspension</emph> of action, exemplified both in the
                        transvaluation of “God, King, and Law” as the arbiters of Anarchy without
                        progression, as well as the equivalence of the multitude’s “folded arms and
                        looks” with “Weapons of unvanquished war” (l. 321-22). </p>
                  <p> This suspension of action is figured from the outset of the poem in the
                        ambiguous status of the speaker, who dreamily ventriloquizes a voice heard
                        “from over the Sea”: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> As I lay asleep in Italy,</l>
                           <l> There came a voice from over the Sea,</l>
                           <l> And with great power it forth led me,</l>
                           <l> To walk in visions of Poesy. (l. 1-4)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> For Wolfson, the quadruple single rhyme and the drowsy
                        sibilance of “As I-Sea-Poesy” generates an effect at once hypnotic and
                        claustrophobic. Initiating the verse’s rhyme scheme not with the first end
                        rhyme “Italy-me” but with the internal “as<emph>lee</emph>p-Italy,” which
                        then becomes “me” and “Poesy,” <emph>The Mask</emph> binds its desire for
                        political agency to the ideologically (en)closed “specular seeming” (Wolfson
                        197). This agency is further perplexed by the syntactic echoes between the
                        voice of the “indignant Earth” (l. 139) that calls for political action and
                        the poem’s specular preamble. The “As I” that initiates the dream sequence
                        thus returns as the “As if” through which the Earth’s “words of joy and fear
                        arose”: “As if their Own indignant Earth / . . . / Had felt her blood upon
                        her brow / . . . / As if her heart had cried aloud” (l. 138-39, 141, 147).
                        The poem’s form thus works to restrain the “political agency of the oratory
                        to a dream” (Wolfson 198).</p>
                  <p> But in making the oratory a dream, <emph>The Mask</emph> at once formally
                        demonstrates the restraint that the poem’s content will exhort as passive
                        resistance, while further displacing the hierarchical modes of sensibility
                        within the representative order. As Rancière notes, in the representative
                        order, “speaking was the act of the orator who persuades an assembly. . . .
                        The power of making art with words was linked to the power of a hierarchy of
                        speech, of a relationship of address regulated between speech acts and
                        defined audiences on whom these speech acts were supposed to produce the
                        effects of mobilizing” (<emph>PL </emph>12). It is precisely this hierarchy
                        of the active speech of men-in-action over a passive multitude that the poem
                        goes on to challenge by displacing both the source of the orator’s voice and
                        its addressee: its origin is not a localizable figure within the social
                        hierarchy but in the “Earth,” while its addressee is no longer “magistrates,
                        princes and preachers” but the “many,” or rather, as Rancière puts it, “any
                        one at all, no one in particular” (<emph>PL </emph>12). Like the masque form
                        itself, the representative function of oration here becomes subject to the
                        an-archic formula of the aesthetic regime that dismantles “the distinction
                        between men of speech-in-action and men of noisy suffering voice” (<emph>PL
                        </emph>13). The dream is the <emph>form</emph> of the oration; as such, the
                        oration functions only “as if” it were the objective content of a political
                        program. Rather, insofar as the dream is its form, the oration itself is a
                        “vision of Poesy,” an experimental shaping of the sensible materials
                            <emph>for</emph> a new program of political resistance, a program whose
                        content remains indeterminate, suspended between passion and action. </p>
                  <p>The dream frame can also be read as the necessary prerequisite for
                        allegorizing the paradoxical autonomy and heteronomy of aesthetic form. The
                        poem’s dream effect announces less the erasure of its historical-material
                        referentiality than what Herbert Marcuse calls a “sublimation” of it. The
                        function of aesthetic sublimation in its “transcendence of immediate
                        reality” is precisely to disrupt “the reified objectivity of established
                        social relations . . . while preserving its overwhelming presence” (Marcuse
                        6, 7). Hence the aesthetic stylization of the masque is doubled by the
                        poem’s reference to having been written “on the Occasion of the Massacre at
                        Manchester.” At the same time, the strangely unlocalizable “voice of the
                        Earth” that will emerge in the poem to exhort passive resistance from the
                        masses announces “a new dimension of experience” (Marcuse 7) through the “as
                        if” that hypothetically restores Henry Hunt’s truncated speech to the
                        Manchester assembly, the content of which becomes the sublimated form of
                        Shelley’s revised masque. The “truth” of the Peterloo massacre, then, is not
                        the event of the massacre itself, which would only confirm the existing
                        order of things, but the sublimated poetic world which breaks from this
                        reality so as to become “a vehicle [for] recognition and indictment”
                        (Marcuse 9), or in Rancière’s terms, dissensus. </p>
                  <p>At once recognized and indicted in the early part of <emph>The Mask</emph> is
                        the violence that sustains the consensual apparatus that defines normative
                        distributions of the sensible. Prior to Hope’s intervention, the poem is
                        suffused with images of theatricalized violence, as the pageant of Murder,
                        Fraud, and Anarchy tramples “to a mire of blood” the “adoring multitude” (l.
                        39-40), whose adulation shows them colluding in their own oppression. The
                        culminating point of the multitude’s complicity lies not only in its
                        “ideological blindness” (Borushko 103), however, but in the specifically
                        consensual mode that this blindness takes: “Then all cried with one accord;
                        / ‘Thou are King, and god, and Lord; / Anarchy, to Thee we bow / Be thy name
                        made holy now!’” (l. 70-74). It is only with the “one accord” that Anarchy’s
                        reign converts its more overt forms of theatricalized violence into
                        manageable forms of instituted violence: “Bank,” “Tower,” and “Parliament”
                        (l. 83, 84). </p>
                  <p>Arguably the central figure of dissensus in the poem is the “Shape arrayed in
                        mail” (l. 110): <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>A mist, a light, an image rose </l>
                           <l>. . . </l>
                           <l>With step as soft as wind it past </l>
                           <l>O’er the heads of men—so fast </l>
                           <l>That they knew the presence there, </l>
                           <l>And looked,—but all was empty air. (l. 118-21) </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> At once present and absent, the Shape marks a symbolic
                        break in the poem that marks the shift from (revised) antimasque to masque
                        and, in doing so, allegorizes the formal operation Rancière attributes to
                        the dissensus through which a multitude previously invisible becomes
                        visible. The Shape thereby opens a space in which equality will be inscribed
                        in the staging of a dispute which establishes a community existing solely
                        through its being divided from the status quo via a specifically aesthetic
                        production, “a mist, a light, an image” (l. 102). The voicing of this
                        dispute emerges through the anonymous figure of the “indignant Earth” (l.
                        139), whose speech evokes a counter-world that directly contrasts the
                        existing one. In its hortatory function, the counter-world evoked in the
                        rhetorical functions of the Earth’s speech enjoins the reader to undertake
                        an aesthetic play in the observation of the poem’s Shape. As Ronald
                        Tetreault points out, the Earth’s speech assumes an “imperative stance,”
                        especially in the jussive refrain for the multitude to “Rise like Lions
                        after Slumber” (205). Emphasis on the imperative is a conventional aspect of
                        the court masque, which finds the “Master of the Revels” giving “commands to
                        the masquers . . . phrased as wishes inviting corresponding actions”
                        (Tetreault 206). Just as Shelley transvalues the masque form, however, so
                        too must the rhetorical status of the poem’s repeated “let” shift in
                        emphasis from command to invitation: “Let a vast assembly be / And with
                        great solemnity / Declare with measured words that ye / Are, as God has made
                        ye, free” (l. 295-98). Insofar as freedom can be declared through “measured
                        words,” Shelley connects the invitation to think the possibility of a
                        counter-world via a poetics that invites its audience to recreate the words
                        of the poet on their own terms, thus rendering poetry itself a proving
                        ground for the equality it desires. </p>
                  <p> In the invitational refrain of the “let,” Shelley gestures towards passive
                        resistance as the political index of the experience of form itself. The
                        Shape, as the symbolic hiatus that begins the poem’s hortatory provocation,
                        prefigures a formal “suspension” that will be translated into the
                        multitude’s “folded arms and looks which are / Weapons of unvanquished war”
                        (l. 319-22). Emptying the poem's content of its action, Shelley evokes form as a
                        moment of utter repose that is simultaneously a moment of supreme agitation
                        that reconfigures the distribution of the sensible, linking the promise of
                        political autonomy as self-rule with the autonomy of the “Shape” of the work
                        of art itself, whose measured (s)words signal the work of art’s heteronomy
                        from things as they are. The “let” in turn invites the reader to take up the
                        role of what Rancière calls the “emancipated spectator.” Just as Schiller’s
                        rereading of Kant articulates an aesthetic that is already dissensus, the
                        multitude’s spectatorship before the spectacle of the masque as antimasque,
                        and the subsequent call for nonviolent resistance in the “let,” actively
                        dismantles “the opposition between viewing and acting”: “emancipation begins
                        . . . when we understand that viewing is also an action that [either]
                        confirms or transforms” the existing distribution of positions (Rancière,
                            <emph>Emancipated </emph>13). As Joseph Tanke explains, for Rancière
                        emancipated art “does not compel viewers to become active” by “dictating the
                        terms of participation”; rather, the formal emptiness and indeterminacy of
                        the Shape requires only “that we insist upon the postulates of equality
                        implied by the aesthetic [regime] of art” (93).</p>
                  <p> Shelley also hints at such postulates in more formally “external” ways.
                        Although <emph>The Mask</emph> appears highly regulated, Shelley employs
                        shifts in the distribution of the poem’s sensible structure and texture that
                        periodically disrupt its apparent uniformity. One such destabilization
                        occurs at the very outset with the pyhrric substitution “As I” slightly
                        modifying the sing-song metre of the poem’s predominant iambic tetrameter;
                        likewise, the frequent use of off-rhyme (“gown-on,” “who-fro”
                        “Hypocrisy-by,” “crown-shone,” and others); the seemingly random
                        distribution of five rather than four line stanzas (stanzas three,
                        thirty-three, thirty-eight, forty-seven, fifty-five, sixty-seven,
                        eighty-two, and the final stanza, ninety-one); and the use of stanzas
                        alternating between one and two principal end-rhymes intermittently strips
                        the veil of familiarity so as to call attention to possible reconfigurations
                        within the poem’s sensible texture. The poem thus affects a play between
                        regularity and irregularity which thematizes the Shape’s ability to bring
                        together opposites, generating an “irregularity in regularity” that turns
                        our attention to the contingency of the existing categories of the sensible,
                        but also towards the paradoxical synthesis of opposites—the violence of
                        nonviolence, the supreme agitation of repose—through which slight
                        displacements in the poem’s formal sensorium provides opportunities to
                        re-shape dominant configurations of the sensible. </p>
                  <p> Nonetheless, Shelley also acknowledges that aesthetics cannot fully
                        determine the political effects it would have on its audience. As Mark
                        Kipperman notes, the poet’s speech only directs the masses to the potential
                        of its self-possession; it does not, and cannot, predict its outcome
                        (“Shelley, Adorno”). This anxiety concerning the outcome of the poem’s
                        effects is reflected in the fact that the “sense” awakened by the Shape
                        gives voice and measure to words of both “joy and fear” (l. 138). Hence, the
                        voice deems it necessary to warn the multitude against violent revenge,
                        rendering the poem’s vision for a new collective a prospect for debate over
                        a freedom that is possible and desirable, but also contingent. The voice of
                        the Earth, an-archically democratic in its voicing of a wrong by which the
                        excluded identify immediately with the universal, functions as a dissensus
                        whose manifestation is an invitation and an incitement towards a future
                        possibility that must be incessantly renewed: “words [that] shall then
                        become / Like oppression’s thundered doom / Ringing through each heart and
                        brain, / Heard again—again—again” (l. 364-68). This indefinite circulation
                        of words that must always be heard again, whose transmission remains
                        uncertain in their circulation “outside any determined relationship of
                        address” (Rancière, <emph>PL </emph>12), thematizes the promise of an
                        an-archic world without hierarchies that constitutes the work of art in the
                        aesthetic regime. </p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Rancière’s exploration of the tensions within the aesthetic regime can
                        potentially help us understand both the Romantic period in broader terms,
                        but also hopefully offer a means to push forward the perennial debates
                        surrounding the relationship between politics and aesthetics in Shelley.
                        Rancière’s theorization of the aesthetic regime complicates received
                        conceptions of the relations between politics and aesthetics, offering a
                        more capacious view that departs from any strictly causal determination. As
                        such, the concept of the aesthetic regime opens even more promising horizons
                        with respect to Romantic texts that on their surface may not appear
                        political at all, or conversely, appear to suffer from a desire to
                        instrumentalize poetry as politics. In so doing, one can rethink the
                        “anarchism” of Romantic aesthetics beyond its conventional senses, while
                        retaining and renewing its anti-authoritarian potentialities beyond the
                        antinomy of aesthetic autonomy and political commitment.</p>
