            <p>Given the resurgence of interest in the relation between Shelley’s political essays
                and poetry, what concept of relationality can be posed to move beyond an old,
                entrenched opposition between the social commitment of prose and the abstract
                withdrawal of poetry to theorize a novel form of “political poetics”?<note
                    place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent reevaluations of Shelley’s political prose
                    and poetry can be found in edited collections by Alan M. Weinberg and Timothy
                    Webb, Darby Lewes, and Michael Scrivener.</note> In what ways do Shelley’s
                reflections on the history of modern revolution inform his ideas of literary
                experience and political subjectivity? How, moreover, does Shelley’s work provoke
                what he describes in <emph>A Defence of Poetry</emph> (1821) as “a beneficial change
                in opinion or institution” through aesthetic experience (535), without falling prey
                to an escapist flight into inwardness?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All
                    references to Shelley’s poetry and <emph>A Defence of Poetry</emph> are cited
                    from Donald Reiman and Neil Fraistat’s Norton edition, <emph>Shelley’s Poetry
                        and Prose</emph>, hereafter indicated as <emph>Norton </emph>in parenthesis.
                </note> Taking these questions as points of departure, this paper will locate within
                Shelley’s work a theory of <emph>aesthetic resistance</emph> by reading between his
                historical-political reflections on the British reform movement in <emph>A
                    Philosophical View of Reform</emph> (1819-20) and his critical aesthetics. </p>
            <p>Shelley’s reception, from his own time to the present, testifies to a persistent
                vexation over his radical mixtures of aesthetics with politics. William Hazlitt,
                reviewing what he describes as Shelley’s “electrical experiments in morals and
                philosophy,” sketches him as a reckless contrarian “drawn up by irresistible levity
                to the regions of mere speculation and fancy,” where “[b]ubbles are to him the only
                realities: —touch them, and they vanish” (201, 200). Matthew Arnold famously
                describes him as “a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his
                luminous wings in vain” (327), an ethereal figure that serves as an alibi for F. R.
                Leavis’ later complaint over Shelley’s “weak grasp upon the actual” (206). Though
                more recent criticism has rescued Shelley from such dismissive appraisals, critical
                concern over his “levity,” his immateriality and dreamy idealism, survives in the
                neglect or disavowal of his political works as naïve, patronizing, enthusiastic,
                ideological, or even dangerous. </p>
            <p>And yet, as I will argue, Shelley’s aesthetic departures from things as they are
                present new aesthetic formations that are subversive to established ways of
                experiencing the world. In this sense, Shelley’s political aesthetics stages a
                “dissensus,” to import Jacques Rancière’s term, where the prevailing form of common
                sense, the public sense of what is shared in collective life, is disrupted through
                artistic practices that reconfigure the “distribution of the sensible,” or
                partitions of sensory experience that legislate what is made visible and invisible
                in the common world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <emph>The Politics of
                        Aesthetics</emph>, the translator and editor Gabriel Rockhill proposes the
                    following helpful definition for the “distribution of the sensible” in
                    Rancière’s work: <quote>the implicit law governing the sensible
                        order that parcels out places and forms of participation in a common world
                        by first establishing the modes of perception within which these are
                        inscribed. The distribution of the sensible thus produces a system of
                        self-evident facts of perception based on the set horizons and modalities of
                        what is visible and audible as well as what can be said, thought, made, or
                        done. Strictly speaking, ‘distribution’ therefore refers both to forms of
                        inclusion and to forms of exclusion. (85)</quote></note> I will suggest that
                Shelley’s “levity,” his appeal to an aesthetic dimension in politics, creates new
                modes of experience that resist forms of inhumanity by making visible the otherwise
                invisible wrongs suffered by groups who remain excluded from participation in the
                public commons.</p>
            <p>At the time Shelley is writing his essays on the reform movement, British social and
                political life is undergoing a moral upheaval, a transvaluation of values arising,
                at least in part, from the growing international success of the American and French
                Declarations of universal rights. Attracted to the emancipatory potential of this
                new genre of writing, Shelley himself drafted a <emph>Declaration of Rights</emph>
                (1812), a broadside with thirty-one enumerated articles, organized around the two
                fundamental principles of the emerging rights tradition: “The rights of man are
                liberty, and an equal participation of the commonage of nature” (<emph>Prose</emph>
                56). But despite the claim of universal freedom and equality for all, one of the
                most disquieting paradoxes of Enlightenment rights discourse lies in the limited
                scope of its application, which excluded the equal recognition of women, slaves and
                free blacks, the poor and unpropertied, as well as many religious groups.<note
                    place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the paradoxes of human rights,
                    see Lynn Hunt.</note> Without solid foundations in the established laws and
                constitutions of states, the rights of man also ran the risk of becoming “metaphysic
                rights,” to use Edmund Burke’s phrase, a situation in which there is a perceived
                discrepancy between the <emph>a priori</emph> concepts of rights and the complex
                realities of pragmatic politics.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the
                        <emph>Reflections</emph>, Edmund Burke described this clash as a process of
                    “refractions and reflections”: <quote>These metaphysic rights
                        entering into common life, like rays of light which pierce into a dense
                        medium, are, by the laws of nature, refracted from that straight line.
                        Indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns, the
                        primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and
                        reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in
                        the simplicity of their original direction. (61)</quote></note> What these
                familiar critiques misrecognize is the vital life of rights, which is activated by
                the resistances of subjects who are denied the rights they have by virtue of their
                common humanity. Women’s rights, though conspicuously missing in the major rights
                declarations of 1776 and 1789, are powerfully championed in the political writings
                of Olympe de Gouges as well as Mary Wollstonecraft, and are publicly contested in
                the emergent genre of the Jacobin novel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a
                    perspicacious discussion of the place of revolutionary subjectivity and rights

                Haiti, slaves and free blacks revolted against British, Spanish, and French colonial
                forces, eventually claiming their rights as the citizens of an independent state in
                1804, an historic event that foreshadowed the British abolition of the African slave
                trade in 1807 and the subsequent emancipation of nearly eight hundred thousand
                colonial slaves in 1833.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See David Brion Davis for

            </p>
            <p>These transformative historical and political events taking place in England, Europe
                and America held out the possibility for what the Chorus of Spirits in the utopian
                Act IV of <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> announce as “the new world of man,” an age
                unfolding <emph>as if </emph>according to a universal plan of Promethean history
                (V.157). In a paragraph of the preface to <emph>Hellas</emph>, originally deleted by
                his publishers Charles and James Ollier, Shelley takes an even more revolutionary
                position to declare that his age has embarked on a “war of the oppressed against the
                oppressor,” a struggle that will produce “a new race” intolerant of the excesses of
                Sovereigns, “those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers”
                    (<emph>Norton</emph> 432). </p>
            <p>Shelley’s provocative announcement of an age of war with sovereign power marks a
                radical shift from a thinker like Kant who, nearly forty years earlier, claimed his
                time to be an age of Enlightenment, where the ruler keeps open, under the idea of
                liberal toleration, a space for the development and exercise of the free use of
                public reason. They do, however, share an aversion to the idea of forcing historical
                change through the unnecessary use of violence, especially if there is a non-violent
                alternative for political reform. “A revolution,” Kant argues, “may well put an end
                to autocratic despotism and to rapacious or power-seeking oppression, but it will
                never produce a true reform in the ways of thinking. Instead, new prejudices, like
                the ones they replaced, will serve as a leash to control the great unthinking mass”
                    (<emph>Political </emph>55). Shelley’s later political thought similarly
                advocates for a gradualist conception of social and political reform, but he also
                expresses a profound sympathy for global revolutionary movements, sympathy akin to
                Kant’s description of the spectatorial “enthusiasm” arising from the French
                    Revolution.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Despite his well-documented
                    enthusiasm for the American and French Revolutions, Kant notoriously denies any
                    notion of a constitutional “right of revolution,” claiming “the people can never
                    possess a right of coercion against the head of state, or be entitled to oppose
                    him in word or deed.” Of the English constitution, vaunted as an example to the
                    world, Kant says “we find no mention of what the people are entitled to do if
                    the monarch were to violate the contract of 1688” (<emph>Political </emph>83).
                    For Kant, any statement within a constitution of a right of resistance would
                    fail the test of publicity, because it must then declare the remedies and powers
                    responsible for keeping the sovereign within the bounds of the contract, a
                    remedy that would in fact create another sovereign, or even a third to judge
                    which sovereign power was in the right.</note> Spectators of world historical
                events possess, Kant argues, a capacity for universal, disinterested sympathy that
                reveals itself publicly as “wishful <emph>participation</emph> that borders closely
                on enthusiasm”; this affective response, provoked by the spectacle of a people’s
                struggle for natural rights and republicanism, testifies to a “moral predisposition
                in the human race” (<emph>Conflict</emph> 302). As a collective experience, the
                spectator’s shared feeling of enthusiasm marks the revolutionary event as “a sign of
                history” (301), or in other words, an event whose occurrence on the world stage,
                bursting forth as an unpredictable rupture in the prevailing historical-political
                reality, affords an indication of humanity’s inherent capacity to author its own
                progress. </p>
            <p>Jean-François Lyotard’s influential reading of Kantian enthusiasm as “a modality of
                sublime feeling” re-inscribes this form of revolutionary spectatorship within an
                aesthetic dimension by reading political judgment as an analogue for aesthetic
                reflective judgment (<emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Keeping in mind Cian Duffy’s and Peter Howell’s critique of Kantian approaches
                    to the sublime in Romantic studies, a critical look that foregrounds an
                    alternative notion of the sublime as “the site of a complex interaction between
                    different discourses” (3), my illustration of the affinity between Kant and
                    Shelley on the sublime will highlight the analogical relations between
                    aesthetics, politics, history, and, to a lesser extent, science.</note> Like the
                experience of the sublime in nature, where the imagination confronts instances of
                formlessness or immensity that exceed its ability to comprehend what it has just
                apprehended, revolutions “are formless and shapeless in the history of human nature”
                (33). The sublime, however, occasions a second moment of recovery. Following the
                painful experience of the imagination’s impotence, the judging subject is enlivened
                by the pleasurable discovery of our “supersensible vocation” to strive after Ideas
                of reason beyond the chaotic particulars of nature (Kant, <emph>Critique</emph>
                §27.141). Despite the violence and disorder of revolution, the spectator’s
                enthusiasm reveals a collective fervor for “the Idea of the republican contract,”
                which offers a sign, or “complex hypotyposis,” of humanity’s progress toward the
                better (Lyotard, <emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 33, 40). It is therefore not the event of
                the French Revolution in itself that affords an indication of historical progress,
                just as sublime feeling is not wholly attributable to the object of nature under
                investigation. Rather, the judging subject’s feeling of pleasurable pain arises from
                the imagination’s struggle to present an unpresentable Idea of history, such as the
                Idea of a republican constitution emerging from seemingly lawless political
                rebellion. It is the task of the world spectator to bear witness to political
                upheavals and to discern signs of the regulative Idea of purposive progress
                underlying world history. </p>
            <p>In the opening chapter of <emph>A Philosophical View of Reform</emph>, a text that
                shares Kant’s commitment to republicanism, Shelley traces what could be called a
                universal history from an <emph>enthusiastic</emph> point of view. Driven by the
                dialectical opposition between “the spirit of freedom and the spirit of tyranny”
                (214), his narrative of world historical upheavals pays close attention to the
                rebellions in England in 1688, America in 1776, and France in 1789, before looking
                forward to anticipate the wave of revolutions in the 1820s across Spain, Portugal,
                and Greece. Unlike other universal histories of the period, he also acknowledges the
                world historical significance of the slave rebellions in the West Indies. “Two
                nations of free negroes are already established,” writes Shelley, “one, in
                pernicious mockery of the usurpation over France, an empire, the other a republic;
                both animating yet terrific spectacles to those who inherit around them the
                degradation of slavery and the spirit of dominion” (214). The establishment of Haiti
                (Saint-Domingue) and Liberia—the former by revolutionary violence, the latter by
                colonial settlement—offered the world community further indications of the advance
                of human freedom, or “signs of the times” (213), even as the coherence of the
                Enlightenment narrative of “the march of progress” is disfigured by the use of
                violence in political rebellion as a means of last resort. </p>
            <p>In shifting to an aesthetic mode of representing the spectator’s sympathy for the
                actors of revolution, a form of spectatorship that takes place within what Lyotard
                calls the “the theatre hall of history” (<emph>Enthusiasm</emph> 29), Kant’s
                theorization of an aesthetic perspective <emph>within</emph> the political opens the
                possibility for a novel way to think through world historical change. As in William
                Blake’s “The Mental Traveller,” where “the Eye altering alters all” (62), the world
                spectator’s point of view and participatory mode of perceiving the events of history
                is as important as the events themselves. The aesthetic experience of viewing
                political events, “this game of great revolutions,” is transformed into a mode of
                mental drama, where the events of history are internalized and reflexively
                considered by spectators “who are not engaged in this game themselves” (Kant,
                    <emph>Conflict</emph> 302). Framed as drama and viewed from a cosmopolitan point
                of view, the sublime image of revolution creates a dissension within the “hearts of
                all spectators” (302). The stirring and discordant play of the faculties is not
                caused by a call to participate directly in rebellion, nor is it provoked by widely
                condemned images of the abuse of sovereign power under the <emph>ancien
                    régime</emph>, nor even by the horrific spectacle of the terror of Robespierre.
                What makes the spectator’s judgments subjectively universal and communicable, as in
                the case of aesthetic reflective judgment, is a shared common sense
                    (<emph>Critique</emph> §20-22, 40), or the pleasurable accord of the imagination
                and understanding without the mediation of a concept (in the case of the beautiful),
                or the discordant accord between the imagination and reason (in the case of the
                sublime). </p>
            <p>In his explication of Kantian common sense, Gilles Deleuze describes the unique form
                of common sense generated by the sublime as one “engendered in dissension” (53). The
                violence done to the imagination brings to light what Kant calls a “capacity for
                resistance,” that is, our disposition to confront nature’s seemingly unsurpassable
                authority over us (<emph>Critique</emph> §29.144). Sublime common sense, revelatory
                of our shared ability to resist the given sensory experience of the natural order,
                is therefore a dissensual common sense. The Kantian conception of a dissensus
                stirring in the psychic life of the judging subject, an inner aesthetic experience
                that manifests itself in artistic practices, links onto Shelley’s use of imagery
                drawn from the natural sublime as a mode of presenting “the operations of the human
                mind” on the verge of revolt (<emph>Norton</emph> 207). In <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>, for instance, the figure of “the sun-awakened avalanche,”
                accumulating “flake after flake, in Heaven-defying minds” (II.3.37, 39), prefigures
                the revolutionary overthrow of Jupiter’s rule by the palingenetic power of
                Demogorgon. </p>
            <p>Though Shelley joins a chorus of Romantic writers who figure revolutionary upheavals
                within the discourse of the natural sublime, his own restless experimentation with
                literary forms presents a subversive challenge to established norms and
                classifications of the arts, one that threatens to blur, even overturn, the
                carefully legislated boundaries between hierarchical orders of genre. The prospect
                of this kind of aesthetic revolution is, indeed, what triggers Hazlitt’s criticism
                of Shelley’s experiments:
            <quote>Curiosity is the only proper category of [Shelley’s] mind, and though a man in
                knowledge, he is a child in feeling. Hence he puts everything into a metaphysical
                crucible to judge it himself and exhibit it to others as a subject of interesting
                experiment, without first making it over to the ordeal of his common sense or trying
                it on his heart. … Mr. Shelley has been accused of vanity—I think he is chargeable
                with extreme levity; but this levity is so great that I do not believe he is
                sensible of its consequences. He strives to overturn all established creeds and
                systems; but this is in him an effect of constitution. He runs before the most
                extravagant opinions; but this is because he is held back by none of the merely
                mechanical checks of sympathy and habit. He tampers with all sorts of obnoxious
                subjects; but it is less because he is gratified with the rankness of the taint than
                captivated with the intellectual phosphoric light they emit. (200)</quote>
            Shelley, for Hazlitt, is a dangerous alchemist of Promethean proportions, not unlike
                Dr. Frankenstein working feverishly on his sublime monster, and with potentially
                horrific—if unintended—consequences when carried over into social and political
                life. Hazlitt’s charge against Shelley for possessing dangerous levels of levity, as
                though it were an inflammable gas in one of Humphrey Davy’s chemical experiments,
                coincides with rhetorical tropes deployed to critique the idealist claims of natural
                rights theorists at this time. In the <emph>Reflections on the Revolution in
                    France</emph> (1790), for example, Burke appeals to his reader to stand on “the
                firm ground of the British constitution” rather than emulate “in their desperate
                flights the aëronauts of France” (249), an analogy between the drafters of the 1789
                Declaration and the craze for hot-air balloon flights, beginning with the
                Montgolfier brothers’ first manned hot-air balloon flight in France in 1783.<note
                    place="foot" resp="editors"> See Richard Holmes, Chapter 3, for an exceptional
                    discussion of the hot-air balloon craze in the Romantic period, with a vivid
                    description of the first flight of the Montgolfier brothers.</note> Jeremy
                Bentham’s <emph>Anarchical Fallacies,</emph> too, makes light (pun intended) of
                natural rights as nonsensical rhetorical fictions, “nonsense upon stilts,” which
                tends toward “a spirit of insurrection to all laws” (501). This attack on the
                fictionality, the <emph>levity</emph>, of human rights discourse has a long legacy
                up to the present, with Alasdair MacIntyre’s claim that “there are no such rights,
                and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns” (67).
                Coincidently, Joseph Montgolfier named the property that lifted the balloon into the
                air as “levity,” a principle of flight that the young Shelley uses to send copies of
                his <emph>Declaration of Rights</emph> to the disenfranchised via fire balloons. In
                one of his early poems, “Sonnet: To a balloon, laden with Knowledge,” he deploys the
                balloon as a symbol of human freedom, “a ray of courage to the opprest and poor,”
                which soon “through the tyrant’s gilded domes shall roar” (<emph>Norton</emph> 6. 9,
                11). </p>
            <p>Unlike Burke and Bentham, who criticize what they perceive to be the anarchic and
                terroristic potential of natural rights, especially the “right of resistance,”
                Shelley sides with Richard Price in recognizing such a right as constitutionally
                guaranteed as a legacy of the English Revolution in 1688. In his famous lecture,
                    <emph>A Discourse on the Love of Country </emph>(1789), the lecture that incited
                Burke to write his <emph>Reflections</emph>, Price affirms that the English people
                accomplished a shift in the idea of sovereign power from “passive obedience,
                nonresistance, and the divine right of kings” toward the multitude’s active power to
                choose their sovereign on the basis of consent (190). This idea of the people as the
                autonomous and primary foundation of the sovereign’s legitimacy, as set out by John
                Locke in the <emph>Two Treatises on Government</emph> (1689), is also the source of
                Price’s provocative claim that it is the people’s right to resist sovereign power
                when it is abused, and ultimately to replace the “cashiered” king with a new
                individual or mode of governance chosen by the multitude. </p>
            <p>In Shelley’s most systematic political text, <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>,
                humanity’s natural right of resistance is, as we have seen, the vital principle that
                initiates and legitimizes social and political change. The text’s condensed
                universal history traces the hopeful realization of liberty and equality, the
                “elementary principles” of rights (216), as humanity progressively activates its
                irrepressible capacity to resist oppression. Beginning with the fall of the Roman
                Empire, he narrates the story of the human will to resist as it manifests in the
                republics of the Italian Renaissance, the Reformation, the English Civil War, the
                Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, up to the American and French
                Revolutions. Like the chained Prometheus forced to witness images of exploitation
                and repression, Shelley’s history registers each singular abuse of the rights of man
                as “rapid passing shadows, which forerun successful insurrection” (224). As a world
                spectator, he then turns an eye to liberatory movements in South America, China,
                Turkey, and India, struggles that are fueled, to a greater or lesser degree, by “the
                arts and philosophy of Europe” (226). In the theatre of his political thought, poets
                and philosophers play a crucial role as “unacknowledged legislators of the world”
                because their works circulate globally as “the contagion of good” (227, 225), sowing
                seeds of rebellion. And yet, the narrative also has the opposite effect of turning
                “European art and literature” into a colonizing discourse (226), thus usurping
                indigenous histories and systems of knowledge and, in turn, transforming the
                unacknowledged legislators into prophets <emph>of</emph> rather than
                    <emph>against</emph> empire. Human rights discourse today runs a similar risk of
                becoming an inhuman instrument of neo-colonial control and exploitation rather than
                a source for a more radical politics. </p>
            <p>However, Shelley’s critical history of the “mighty calamity of government” defies any
                uncomplicated reinscription into a narrative of British imperialism (228), and his
                criticisms of the British system of government are devastating, including his
                critique of the development of the national debt, the issuing of paper money, the
                system of landed property, and the misdistribution of parliamentary seats throughout
                England. His description of the apparatus of the British state coincides with what
                Rancière has called “the police,” or “the set of procedures whereby the aggregation
                and consent of collectivities is achieved, the organization of powers, the
                distribution of places and roles, and the systems for legitimizing this
                distribution” (<emph>Disagreement</emph> 28). Rancière’s concept of “policing,”
                which is usually offered as a description of politics, captures the anarchic
                character of Shelley’s proposals to reconfigure the exclusionary logic of the
                “police,” such as the extension of suffrage (though he retreats from granting women
                the vote), electoral reform, the abolishment of standing armies and sinecures, and
                the repayment of the national debt by the rich.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Though Shelley hesitates in advocating for female suffrage, he does express his
                    sympathy towards the idea of universal suffrage: “Mr. Bentham and other writers
                    have urged the admission of females to the right of suffrage; this attempt seems
                    somewhat immature. Should my opinion be the result of despondency, the writer of
                    these pages would be the last to withhold his vote from any system which might
                    tend to an equal and full development of the capacities of all living beings”
                        (<emph>Philosophical </emph>251). </note> He condemns the British system of
                elections for being chaotic, corrupt, and widely recognized in the popular press as
                entirely dysfunctional. In his later essay <emph>On the English Reform Bill</emph>
                (1831), Hegel is similarly critical of the “bizarre and informal irregularity and
                inequality which prevail[s] at present” (<emph>Political</emph> 234). After
                outlining the problems of rotten boroughs, the purchasing of seats, bribery, and the
                concentration of power in the hands of a small elite, Hegel observes, “It would be
                difficult to discover a comparable symptom of political corruption in any other
                people” (236). The challenge, as Shelley knows well, is to convince those in power,
                whose material interests are secured by unequal distributions and rights, to
                recognize the necessity of reform. </p>
            <p>As a counter to the logic of the police, Rancière reserves the term “politics” for
                changes that are antagonistic to the given order of the visible. Politics, then,
                refers to “whatever breaks with the tangible configuration whereby parties and parts
                or lack of them are defined by a supposition that, by definition, has no place in
                that configuration—that of the part of those who have no part”
                    (<emph>Disagreement</emph> 29). Political activity, in other words, unsettles
                the hierarchical distribution of bodies, places, roles, occupations, and so forth,
                such that previously marginalized groups and heterogeneous parts of the social whole
                are made visible within the configuration of what is perceptible, or “the
                distribution of the sensible.” Rancière’s aesthetics of politics involves,
                therefore, an egalitarian reconfiguration of what is intelligible on the occasions
                where the excluded, the parts that have no part, demand equal participation in the
                common world. </p>
            <p>To make a case for those without a place or part in the political process, Shelley
                recommends gradualist interventions as a first mode of reconfiguring the
                distribution of the sensible, such as the remedies of petitions, passive resistance,
                agitating public opinion, publishing dissenting opinions, and seeking the writings
                of poets and philosophers in a proto-public intellectual capacity. “Suppose the
                memorials to be severally written by Godwin, Hazlitt, Bentham and Hunt,” writes
                Shelley, “they would be worthy of the age and of the cause” (259). If all measures
                fail, however, the people must take the gravest of actions: “The last resort of
                resistance is undoubtedly insurrection” (260). In the final unfinished, fragmentary
                pages of <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>, we encounter a radical side of Shelley’s
                politics. If all peaceful, nonviolent measures are exhausted, violent upheaval is
                occasionally necessary as the end game of political struggle. Drawing on “the most
                approved writers on the English constitution,” Shelley argues, “which has in this
                instance been merely a declaration of the superior decisions of eternal justice, we
                possess a right of resistance” (260). What he is referring to is the contested
                declaration of the 1689 Bill of Rights, which includes a provision for Protestants
                to bear arms in self-defense, a provision that William Blackstone later interprets
                as “a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance
                and self-preservation when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient
                to restrain the violence of oppression” (143). After witnessing the bloody reprisals
                of counterrevolutionary measures on behalf of the state toward collective
                demonstration and peaceful protest, notably in the case of the Peterloo Massacre of
                16 August 1819, Shelley mines juridical-historical precedent to bolster his case for
                the multitude’s right to rebel. </p>
            <p>Shelley looks back to the English Revolutionary period as a source of inspiration not
                only in law and politics, but also in philosophy, poetry, and literature. Just
                before writing <emph>A Philosophical View</emph>, he began composing <emph>Charles
                    the First</emph> (1818)<emph>,</emph> which would have translated the
                revolutionary politics of the English Civil War into dramatic form. The events that
                led to the execution of a king and the “temporary abolition of aristocracy and
                episcopacy” were, for Shelley, a “mighty example” to the world of a people’s
                capacity for “bringing to justice one of the chiefs of a conspiracy of privileged
                murderers and robbers whose impunity had been the consecration of crime”
                    (<emph>Philosophical </emph>213). What makes this departure from the existing
                police order possible is the “exertion of the energies of intellectual power” on
                behalf of the poets and philosophers reflecting the “spirit of their age,”
                particularly Shakespeare and Lord Bacon, those unacknowledged legislators of a new
                mode of the perceptible (213, 227). Works of literature have the enduring value of
                opening up new horizons of possibility that have yet to be activated beyond the
                current social order; they disclose an aesthetic dimension of politics where the
                prevailing common sense, shared by all, confronts alterative sensible configurations
                of common life. </p>
            <p>The theory of aesthetic experience outlined in <emph>A Defence</emph>, as Robert
                Kaufman observes, is “quite similar to the one that Kant offers in the Third
                Critique’s Analytic of the Beautiful,” though with Shelley’s “self-conscious usage
                of a revolutionary vocabulary” (709). And akin to the Kantian doctrine of the
                faculties, Shelley divides the human mind into a faculty psychology, namely, the
                analytic power of reason and the synthetic power of imagination: reason legislates
                the logical, associational relations of distinct thoughts and quantities, while the
                imagination is the mind’s transformative, creative capacity to act upon primary
                elements of psychic life to forge new relations and forms. The imagination’s most
                privileged form of creation is poetry. In the process of outlining the relation
                between poetry and life, aesthetics and politics, Shelley offers a further
                distinction between a “restricted” and “unrestricted” idea of poetry: while the
                former refers to productions of the imagination in “metrical language”
                    (<emph>Norton</emph> 513), or individuated works, the latter refers to the
                activation of the human imagination in the form of a creative “poetical faculty”
                possessed by all with varying degrees of potency (531). The poetical faculty, in
                turn, is responsible for a two-fold process of first creating “new materials of
                knowledge, and power and pleasure,” and then formally ordering the new content
                “according to a certain rhythm and order which may be called the beautiful and the
                good” (531). Within the context of Shelley’s universal history, the restricted sense
                of poetry takes shape as the “great poem,” to which each individual poet contributes
                a verse (522); by contrast, the unrestricted poetry of the world has produced the
                various artistic disciplines as well as laws, civil societies, and religions. The
                poet of politics, therefore, “discovers those laws according to which things ought
                to be ordered” (513), and translates these laws into new practices of writing, like
                the modern genre of rights declarations sparked by the age of revolution. The
                original drafter of the American Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson,
                affords an exemplary case of a poet of laws and constitutions whose revolutionary
                influence was felt on the authors of the French Declaration.<note place="foot"
                    resp="editors"> Lynn Hunt reports that Jefferson’s original draft went through
                    “eighty-six alterations made by himself, the Committee of Five, or Congress”
                    (18). This painstaking level of revision and attention to detail stands at odds
                    with Shelley’s remark that it is an “error to assert that the finest passages of
                    poetry are produced by labour and study” (<emph>Norton</emph> 531). </note> This
                is not, however, to diminish the social importance of poetic works in favour of
                utilitarian forms of knowledge, as Thomas Love Peacock proposes in <emph>The Four
                    Ages of Poetry </emph>(1820). Shelley’s theory of poetry situates poetic
                thinking as a universally shared capacity in all subjects, a poetic common sense,
                though one that wanes as corruption reigns and language ossifies. During “periods of
                the decay of social life,” the task of the poet, in the restricted sense, is to
                spark the imagination by stirring the poetic faculty, “the faculty which contains
                within itself the seeds at once of its own and of social renovation” (520, 522).
                Where the calculating principle of instrumental reason deadens language, the
                practice and reception of poetry resuscitates the moral imagination. </p>
            <p>But how, then, does poetry excite an aesthetic of resistance, the catalyst of
                aesthetic revolution? Like the Kantian conception of aesthetic common sense, in
                which one “reflects on his own judgment from a universal standpoint”
                    (<emph>Critique</emph> §40.175), the Shelleyan poetic faculty is the point of
                genesis for an enlarged mentality, both for the poet and his audience. Shelley’s
                theory of history, however, grants the poet a more genetic role to play in the
                production of common sense; he describes how poets at an early moment in human
                history apprehend an enduring “rhythm and order” between “existence and perception,”
                and then invent forms of language and representation to link “perception and
                expression” (<emph>Norton</emph> 512). Over successive epochs, the narrative traces
                how poets have been agents of social transformation, preventing the decay of
                language and defamiliarizing habitual modes of perceiving the familiar world.
                Because the imagination is the creative power that organizes and combines the basic
                elements of social life according to the mind’s laws (“equality, diversity, unity,
                contrast, mutual dependence” [511]), and because the poet possesses the most potent
                poetic faculty, poets have the imaginative power to make new sense of the world, to
                redistribute the sensible. Poetry acts upon the reader by making the mind “the
                receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought” (517); the superior
                faculties are therefore not only <emph>enlarged</emph> by the sheer mass of the
                novel content but also <emph>awakened</emph> by the new formal relations that link
                familiar thoughts in unfamiliar ways. The enlarged mentality is a condition of
                possibility for the good because the viewer participates in a virtual form of “the
                common universe of which we are portions and percipients,” a common experience that
                allows one to “put himself in the place of another and of many others” (517).
                Poetry’s relation to morality does not reside in its doctrines—“Didactic poetry is
                my abhorrence,” Shelley writes in the Preface to <emph>Prometheus</emph>—but rather
                in its ability to expand the imagination beyond “the principle of self” in
                sympathetic identification with others (209, 531). Moreover, poetic experience opens
                up gaps within the perceptible, what Shelley calls “new intervals and interstices”
                (517), disjunctions that reveal an aesthetic dimension within the operations of
                psychic life and the perception of the world. The gaps that emerge in aesthetic
                experience afford opportunities for departure from things as they are, and poetry
                generates a “being within our being,” an <emph>epipsyche</emph>, which “defeats the
                curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding impressions”
                (533). This disjunction creates “dissensus,” to use Rancière’s term, “a conflict
                between <emph>sense</emph> and <emph>sense</emph>,” that is, “between a sensory
                presentation and a way of making sense of it, or between several sensory regimes
                and/or ‘bodies’” (<emph>Dissensus</emph> 139).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                    his essay, “The Paradoxes of Political Art,” Rancière offers a helpful outline
                    of dissensus in art: 
                    <quote>Dissensus is a conflict between sensory presentation and a
                    way of making sense of it, or between sensory regimes and / or ‘bodies’. This is
                    the way in which dissensus can be said to reside at the heart of politics, since
                    at bottom the latter itself consists in an activity that redraws the frame
                    within which common objects are determined. Politics breaks with the sensory
                    self-evidence of the ‘natural’ order that destines specific individuals and
                    groups to occupy positions of rule or of being ruled, assigning them to private
                    or public lives, pinning them down to a certain time and space, to specific
                    ‘bodies’, that is to specific ways of being, seeing, and saying.
                        (<emph>Dissensus</emph> 139)</quote></note> As a moment of dissensus, the epipsyche
                of aesthetic experience presents two divergent senses of the subject’s relation to
                itself and the world, namely, the prevailing configuration as well as a virtual
                alternative, thus opening new possibilities to recalibrate one’s perception of the
                established reality. </p>
            <p>Far from escaping social and political life, the aesthetic dimension suspends and
                distorts our conventional understanding of the historical world. The work of art
                enacts a defamiliarizing refusal of the actual, of pernicious habits and customs
                that have insinuated themselves into a normative idea of human nature. Such moments
                of <emph>epipsychic dissensus, </emph>or subversions of common sense perception,
                reappear as an ongoing strategy in Shelley’s work.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    Observing Shelley’s prevalent use of the concept of the “epipsyche,” Carlos
                    Baker long ago identified this movement as “the psyche-epipsyche strategy.”
                    Baker describes this term as follows: “To put the matter in Shelleyan terms, the
                    mind (psyche) imaginatively creates or envisions what it does not have
                    (epipsyche), and then seeks to possess epipsyche, to move towards it as a goal.
                    Therefore the psyche-epipsyche strategy in a nutshell is the evolution by the
                    mind of an ideal pattern towards which it then aspires” (<emph>Major
                        Poetry</emph> 53).</note> He begins to flesh out his concept of the
                epipsyche, or “little soul,” in his short essay “On Love,” where he describes it as
                “a miniature as it were of our entire self, yet deprived of all that we condemn or
                despise, the ideal prototype of every thing excellent or lovely that we are capable
                of conceiving as belonging to the nature of man” (<emph>Norton</emph> 504). As an
                animating principle within our psychic life, “a soul within our soul,” we strive to
                realize its material embodiment, or “antitype,” within the sensible world (504). It
                might seem odd to extract a radical politics from Shelley’s reflections on love,
                perhaps a moment of levity, but love’s sympathetic movement beyond the self serves
                as an activating principle in several of Shelley’s lyrical experiments, such as
                    <emph>Alastor</emph>, <emph>Epipsychidion</emph>, and <emph>Adonais</emph>. In
                the short time that remains, however, I will briefly highlight a unique example in
                which the epipsyche is turned on its head and the necessity of <emph>eros</emph> is
                intertwined with <emph>thanatos</emph>, that is, the scene of resistance between
                Prometheus and Jupiter’s Phantasm in the opening act of <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>. </p>
            <p>The drama opens with the tortured, enchained Prometheus declaring, after “three
                thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours” under Jupiter’s oppressive reign (I.12),
                that his blind hatred has ultimately resolved into pity for the “cruel King” (I.50),
                whose fateful fall will soon come to pass according to Demogorgon’s “mighty law” of
                Necessity (II.2.43). On the verge of mental revolution, Prometheus appeals to the
                Earth and her constituent parts (mountains, springs, air, and whirlwinds) to
                reiterate the forgotten curse he placed upon Jupiter long ago; what comes back from
                the world is the “sound of voices—not the voice / Which I gave forth” (I.112-13) and
                an “awful whisper” (I.132). The voices of the world are sensory but without standing
                in the symbolic order. The Titan senses a whisper “scarce like sound” (I.133); it
                “tingles through the frame / As lightning tingles, hovering ere it strike”
                (I.133-34). The voices of the Earth and her parts are felt as powerful sensory
                signals but without linguistic communication. Each exchange reveals Prometheus’ loss
                of the right to engage in a community of speakers, a capacity Lyotard supposes to be
                “perhaps the most fundamental human right” (“Other’s Rights” 141). Under the regime
                of Jupiter, the tyrant over “living things” (I.3), the Earth and the other elements
                of nature speak “the language of the dead” (I.138), an underground discourse of
                resistance unknown to the immortal Prometheus and his oppressor. To speak in the
                language of the living is to run the risk of Jupiter’s torture on “some wheel of
                pain” (I.141). The loss of an interlocutory community is not immediately apparent,
                however, because the “Daedal harmony” (IV.416) of the drama’s language produces the
                illusion of transparent dialogue, which, in turn, playfully mirrors and critiques
                the sinister way in which oppressive power generates a state of enforced consensus
                that masks the voices of those who remain excluded. Without the means to recall or
                present the curse he uttered to Jupiter, and without the capacity to understand the
                language of the witnesses, Prometheus finds himself the victim of what Lyotard calls
                a “differend,” that is, a situation in which “something ‘asks’ to be put into
                phrases, and suffers from the wrong of not being able to be put into phrases right
                away” (<emph>Differend</emph> 13). How can Prometheus work through his own psychic
                resistance to summon up the curse, without the testimony of Earth and her muted
                elements? </p>
            <p>Though we possess only fragments of Aeschylus’ lost play, <emph>Prometheus
                    Unbound</emph>, many classical scholars agree that Earth, or Gaia, is a
                mediating figure that reconciles Prometheus with Zeus by revealing the Titan’s
                secret knowledge of the danger that will come if the tyrant produces a child with
                    Thetis.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his reconstruction of the possible
                    narrative development of Aeschylus’ Promethean trilogy, D.J. Conacher suggests
                    that it is “reasonable to guess (as many commentators have done) that Gaia is in
                    some way an intermediary between the two antagonists in the revelation of
                    Prometheus’ secret to Zeus” (<emph>Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound</emph>
                    112).</note> Shelley’s Earth, however, resists her own interpellation into
                Jupiter’s state of consensus. Her task, to use Lyotard’s language, is “to bear
                witness to the differends by finding idioms for them” (13), a task that will help
                Prometheus to recollect and eventually revoke the misbegotten curse. To bridge the
                chasm between the “two worlds of life and death” (I.195), Earth proposes an
                alternative route that would intertwine both worlds by having a phantasm from the
                dead utter the curse in the language of the living. Rather than hear the curse from
                his own image, Prometheus opts for the specter of the reigning sovereign power. The
                invocation of Jupiter’s Phantasm stages a scene of dissensus between two seemingly
                incommensurable worlds, which not only facilitates Prometheus’ process of working
                through the repressed curse, but also bridges the domains of actuality and
                potentiality. Jupiter’s Phantasm is a kind of inverted epipsyche in that it affords
                Prometheus the opportunity to witness his disavowed sense of revenge and “calm hate”
                in a virtual, uncanny double of himself as tyrant (I.259), a transformative
                experience that precipitates his repentance and ultimate retraction of the curse.
                Prometheus’ experience of the phantasm is therefore not unlike the temporal sequence
                of sublime spectatorship: the feeling of misery and pain that accompanies his
                inability to present a seemingly ineffable event gives way to the pleasure of
                atonement that accompanies the reiteration and remorseful repeal of his words. This
                reading of the Phantasm also foregrounds the active role of Earth in refashioning
                the world; having created a breach in the sensible domain, she emerges as a
                revolutionary subject on behalf of her muted constituent parts—the parts of the
                world that have no part in Jupiter’s regime. Earth, in this sense, bears witness to
                an impassable differend and then generates novel passageways between existence and
                perception, then perception and expression, subversively restoring Prometheus’ right
                to speak to others. His monologic, lyric <emph>I</emph> becomes a dialogic, dramatic
                    <emph>we</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For this insight, I owe a
                    debt of gratitude to Tilottama Rajan’s essay, “Romanticism and the Death of
                    Lyric Consciousness,” in which she argues that the lyric <emph>cogito</emph> is
                    always already displaced by its inalienable difference: “My argument is that
                    pure lyric is a monological form, where narrative and drama alike are set in the
                    space of difference. The latter present the self in interaction with other
                    characters and events. But lyric, as a purely subjective form, is marked by the
                    exclusion of the other through which we become aware of the difference of the
                    self from itself” (196). </note>
            </p>
            <p>Shelley’s refusal of the normative constraints of common sense, to recall Hazlitt’s
                charge, is exemplified in his radical experiment with the “lyrical drama.”
                    <emph>Prometheus </emph>translates the conventions of Greek drama into a hybrid
                genre where the classical structures of Aeschylus’ work are combined, like a
                chemical mixture, with modern forms of lyric subjectivity and democratic equality
                that refigure established hierarchical divisions between lyric, drama, and
                    epic.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his essay “Lyrical Drama:
                        <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> and <emph>Hellas,</emph>” Stuart Curran
                    characterizes Shelley’s challenge as an “assault” on generic divisions: “’Lyric
                    drama’, like the similar designation of the previous generation, ‘lyrical
                    ballad’, is, instead, a deliberate assault on the integrity of the tripartite
                    generic division—epic, drama, lyric—inherited from Aristotle and Horace and
                    reinforced throughout the eighteenth century by major arbiters of neoclassical
                    criticism” (290). The recalibration of generic structures through the poetic
                    experiment of the lyrical drama brings to light Shelley’s revolutionary politics
                    of aesthetics at the level of form. </note> Shelley’s imaginative departures
                from generic models is matched by a radical innovation at the level of the
                narrative: instead of reconciling “the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind,”
                Prometheus emerges as a revolutionary figure who embodies “the highest perfection of
                moral and intellectual nature,” qualities that give the Titan’s patient defiance a
                sense of justice that is missing in the rebelliousness of Milton’s Satan (206-7).
                The image of Prometheus’ near-solipsistic solitude, not unlike Hegel’s description
                of the lyric subject as “an enclosed inner world” (<emph>Aesthetics</emph> 1115), is
                interrupted by the drama’s dialogic interaction with the world at large, which
                stages a scene of dissension that forges an alternative community of speakers and
                activates a new form of revolutionary subjectivity. But what ultimately makes this
                possible is the return of a repressed primordial power of resistance that emerges
                from the disjointure between the world of the living and the dead, that is, the
                overpowering force of Demogorgon. Just as tyrants rarely “leave a path to freedom
                but through their own blood” (<emph>Philosophical</emph> 213), Jupiter’s reign only
                comes to an end after a swift, decisive struggle with his more powerful offspring.
                Demogorgon’s defeat of Jupiter is the originary violence that founds the new
                Promethean age of humanity through “Destruction’s strength” (IV.564), a death drive
                that retreats from history until it is recalled once again, as a last resort, “To
                defy Power which seems Omnipotent” (IV.572). The disappearance of Demogorgon from
                the world at the end of Shelley’s lyrical drama mirrors, in an uncanny way, the
                withdrawal of the “right of resistance” after its revolutionary enactment in the
                Declarations of 1776 and 1789, serving only as a supplementary right in the French
                Declaration of 1793. Even in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the
                right to resist is only mentioned in the opening Preamble as an endgame to be
                avoided by granting universal rights to all peoples. And yet, as Shelley’s
                aesthetics of resistance brings to light, the capacity to resist is as irrepressible
                as the capacity for poetry: they are life and death instincts in humanity’s
                unsurpassable struggle to recreate the world. </p>
