               <p>This essay is motivated by three claims. The first is Percy Bysshe Shelley’s claim,
                  dramatized most notably at the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” that there
                  is a close relationship between aesthetic experience, political emancipation, and
                  what can be called anachronistically nonviolent resistance. The second claim belongs
                  to Theodor Adorno, who writes, in an early section of <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, of the “[uniting] of the aesthetic element of form with noncoercion” (7). The third
                  claim comprises Jacques Rancière’s definition of “critical art”—“a type of art that
                  sets out to build awareness of the mechanisms of domination to turn the spectator
                  into a conscious agent of world transformation” (<em>Discontents</em> 45)—and his delineation of critical art’s formal means: a “suspension of the relations
                  of domination” (<em>Discontents</em> 36). These three claims are by no means the same, but the terms they collectively
                  encompass—aesthetic form, the politics of art, the nondominative—indicate, I mean
                  to suggest, an overlooked aspect of the historical trajectory of the political possibility
                  of art, beginning with the Romantic redefinition of aesthetic experience and practice
                  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and then taking shape in twentieth-century
                  leftist rethinkings of politics and aesthetics in the Marxian dialectical tradition.
                  Shelley’s reimagining of political poetry is thus seminal here. In engaging the complex
                  historico-political moment of Peterloo, Shelley’s poetry enacts a form of critique
                  constitutionally oriented against the violence that defined the day. What emerges
                  is not just a politics of nonviolence but an aesthetics of nonviolence: art becoming
                  the space, the time, and the form of the noncoercive and nondominative—a becoming
                  that Adorno and Rancière help us to think.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While “The Mask of Anarchy,” written in response to the news of Peterloo reaching
                     Italy, has long been associated with modern nonviolence—from Gandhi’s quoting of it
                     to its prefiguring of the lasting images of Tiananmen Square in 1989

                     </div>—it has at the same time stood at the center of persistent debates over how to measure
                     the politics of a poem. One view might celebrate the poem’s overt political statements,
                     including its bracing criticism of the British government, its outrage at the use
                     of force against a peaceable assembly, and its disdain for Castlereagh, Eldon, and
                     Sidmouth, for example.

                     dubious at best and failed at worst, insofar as the poem was too radical for even
                     Leigh Hunt to publish, precluding it from effecting material change in England in
                     1819.

                     </div> What is more, often implicit in this view is a rhetorical question: how could a poem
                     ever effect political change? Thus the poem, along with others written by Shelley
                     in the wake of Peterloo, brings us up against the larger issue of the politics of
                     art: not only how to measure it, but what, in the first place, is it? To these questions
                     I might add, as a way of signaling the direction of this essay: what can it be?</p>
               </div>
               <p>My argument is that one possible answer to these questions resides in our grasp of
                  the Romantic construal of the aesthetic as nonviolence, first in Shelley’s poetics
                  in the aftermath of Peterloo, and then in the theorizations of art’s “autonomy” and
                  “criticality” in Adorno and Rancière, respectively. Indeed, thinking along these lines
                  provides a way around, or through, the Scylla and Charybdis of measurable efficacy
                  versus naïve idealism that defines the critical history of Shelley’s political poetry.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I.</span></h2>
               <p>Standing behind ongoing debates over the politics of Shelley’s poetry, explicitly
                  at times but also implicitly, is the influential distinction—and the generative tension—between
                  “committed” art and “autonomous” art that Adorno makes in his well-known and much-discussed
                  1962 essay “Commitment.” While distinguishable from tendentious art or the “advocacy
                  of a particular partisan position,” committed works of art are identifiable as “vehicles
                  for what the author wants to say” politically or philosophically, as in the case of
                  Sartre, whose works “operate with traditional plots and exalt them with an unshakable
                  faith in meanings that are to be transferred to reality” 81). In contradistinction,
                  autonomous works of art are “determinate negations of empirical reality.” This negation
                  is accomplished through the work’s governing principle of “inherent structure”—through
                  its “formal law” 92, 89)—which allows the work to become “knowledge in the form of
                  a nonconceptual object.” Autonomous art can be known through its “intractability,”
                  a primarily formal difficulty that “compels the change in attitude that committed
                  works only demand” 90).</p>
               <p>The intersection of Adorno’s “Commitment” and Shelley’s 1819 poetics is addressed
                  by Robert Kaufman and Mark Kipperman in <em>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist Poetry, 1819-1820</em>. Kaufman establishes the influence of Shelley not only on Adorno but also on Brecht
                  and Benjamin, as each writer worked out his own ideas about the emancipatory potential
                  of art. On this reading, Adorno’s notion of “commitment” derives in part from his
                  reading of Shelley—including of Brecht’s translations of “The Mask of Anarchy”; what
                  Adorno found in Shelley, Kaufman writes, is that “lyric experiment helps construct
                  and make available the intellectual-emotional apparatus for accessing, and to that
                  extent helps make available the social material of, ‘the new’ (‘the new’ here being
                  understood ultimately as the not-yet-grasped features of the mode of production and,
                  in fact, all that is emergent in the social)” (Kaufman 19). Shelley’s practice of
                  “lyric as experiment” thus functions as a “prerequisite to such subjectivity, critical
                  thought, and commitment” as would enable political emancipation (Kaufman 19). Suggesting
                  that Adorno is “unfairly hard” on Brecht’s political art in “Commitment,” Kipperman
                  carefully recovers the “historicity” of Shelley’s use of satire in “The Mask”—the
                  socio-material grounding and penetrating analysis, that is, of Shelley’s “committed”
                  poetry of 1819 that frees it from a verdict parallel to the one Adorno, fairly or
                  unfairly, delivers on Brecht (Kipperman 5, 7). Through their readings of form (lyric)
                  and genre (satire), both Kaufman and Kipperman are able effectively to reestablish
                  the force of Shelley’s commitments.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Nearly absent in name, though—but most certainly, I must be clear, not in spirit—from
                     both of these readings, is the other side of the coin in Adorno’s essay: autonomy.
                     In many ways, “Commitment” is a brief for autonomous art over committed art, and it
                     locates the emancipatory potential of the aesthetic in its autonomy from overt sociopolitical
                     and philosophical commitments. However, as W. J. T. Mitchell reminds us, even for
                     Adorno the distinction between autonomy and commitment does not result in a “simple
                     choice” between the two: “Commitment, in short, leads to kitsch, and formalism [autonomy]
                     leads to academicism. The compulsion and inescapability of formalism may lead to an
                     end just as dead as the cul-de-sac of propaganda” (Mitchell 322-3). Yet in the powerful
                     closing passages of “Commitment,” Adorno turns to autonomy, as distinguished from
                     recent French and German examples of “politically radical” committed art, in order
                     to delineate the emancipatory potential of the aesthetic, and in doing so subtly connects
                     autonomy, and the “politics” it engenders or indeed enacts, to nonviolence: <span class="quote">‘This is not the time for political works of art; rather, politics has migrated into
                        the autonomous work of art and it has penetrated most deeply into works that present
                        themselves as politically dead, as in Kafka’s parable about the children’s guns, where
                        the idea of nonviolence is fused with the dawning awareness of an emerging political
                        paralysis (“Commitment” 93-94).’</span> Adorno is referring to a set of untitled fragments in Kafka’s Notebook B that were
                     given the title “The Appeal” by Max Brod in 1937.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              for me. See Kafka, The Blue Octavo Notebooks 5-6. On Brod’s titling of the fragments,
                              see Gray 22.</span></div>
                     </div> The primary fragment consists of a first-person narrative by a resident of a tenement
                     building concerning an attempt by one of his fellow tenants to organize the residents—for
                     purposes which are not stated. The resident making the appeal, quotations from whom
                     occupy nearly the entire story, possesses toy guns, which he suggests he and his fellow
                     tenants might use in their efforts. This cryptic fragment also makes an appearance
                     in Adorno’s dense, lengthy, dialectical essay “Notes on Kafka,” where it is quoted
                     in its entirety and interpreted in the following pithy and provocative way: “This
                     is the figure of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka”).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The parable, as it appears in Adorno’s essay on Kafka: “‘In our house, this enormous
                              suburban house, a rented barracks overgrown with indestructible medieval ruins, there
                              was proclaimed today, on a misty, icy winter morning, the following call to arms:
                              “Fellow Tenants, I possess five toy guns. They are hanging in my closet, one on each
                              hook. The first is mine, the rest are for anyone who wants them. Should there be more
                              than four, the others will have to bring their own weapons and deposit them in my
                              closet. For there will have to be unity; without unity we will not move forward. Incidentally,…</span></div>
                     </div> That is, while existing as or containing “the figure of revolution,” the parable is
                     nonetheless “politically dead,” a deadness that can be understood as having no political
                     meanings transferable to reality, no representational or mimetic ties to the political,
                     material, empirical world. In other words, to focus on the parable’s depiction of,
                     say, the implied power-relations between the renters and their landlord; to consider
                     those relations allegorical of some other set of power-relations in society; to take
                     heart in the attempt to organize and build solidarity through the two “calls to arms”
                     despite their being unanswered—would be, it seems, to miss the work’s actual criticality.
                     The “figure of revolution” resides not in these commitments but primarily in the parable’s
                     formal resistance to those commitments and the ideologies of exchange with which they
                     are necessarily bound. If one recalls Adorno’s critique of Sartre in “Commitment,”
                     one can begin to see how a work such as “The Appeal” might function differently. Sartre’s
                     works “operate with traditional plots and exalt them with an unshakable faith in meanings
                     that are to be transferred to reality” (“Commitment” 81), Adorno writes. Not only
                     is Kafka’s parable structured without a standard plot or narrative framework, but
                     it also, through both the mediation of the narrative voice and the recursivity of
                     the quoted appeals themselves—such that the appeals are not even transferable to their
                     own immediate social reality in the fiction of the story—strays far from any codified
                     political meaning or effect. The layers of “political paralysis” Adorno sees in the
                     fragments thus begin to emerge. The narrative logic of the appeals (especially the
                     longer first appeal) is awkwardly self-negating: the appellant’s initial calls for
                     the miming of violence, his puzzling use of historical analogy, and his ultimate anxiety
                     over promoting himself as a leader all work to discredit his politics as well as to
                     render the cause utterly devoid of the means to intervene in and affect the situation.
                     No one takes up the call to arms: “In our house no one has the time or desire to read
                     such calls, much less to consider them” (“Notes on Kafka” 225).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Yet what should not be missed here is Adorno’s connecting of the formal autonomy of
                  the work of art—the very “figure of revolution”—with “the idea of nonviolence.” A
                  baseline formulation of this relationship would be that the difference between the
                  autonomous work and reality—the work’s very autonomy—is marked and defined in terms
                  of the violence of “the practical world,” a phrase Adorno uses in this context in
                  <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>. Hence the negation of the violent means of practical politics in Kafka’s parable
                  achieved through form: it is not the political content or justification of the call
                  to arms (which we do not know) that matters as much as its form, its status as a call
                  to arms in the first place. In this way, we see the “idea of nonviolence” in “The
                  Appeal” as the parable resists dramatizing a world wherein a call to arms, the use
                  of toy guns, and a false analogy work as political methods—which is to say, the entire
                  parable resists the coercion and domination that constitute everyday practical politics.</p>

                  before “Commitment” was published, offers further insight into the relationships among
                  the formal features of works of art, their political possibilities, and their emancipatory
                  nonviolence. Adorno brings the address to a close with a discussion of Mahler’s variation
                  technique. Rather than purely academic variation for the sake of variation, Adorno
                  argues, the individual “functional elements” of Mahler’s music are “too independent,
                  too evidently living beings in process” such that variation and deviation “transforms
                  the identical into the nonidentical” (“Mahler” 94-5). These functional figures of
                  deviation and variation contain the substance of Mahler’s music: as they “emerge,
                  persist, and disappear” they become, in a memorable phrase, “figures of disintegration”
                  95-6) What is formulated in such figures of disintegration, Adorno goes on to suggest,
                  is what he calls Mahler’s “nonviolent violence,” akin to “the power of a true humanity”
                  (96). That is, the figural disintegration of Mahler’s variation technique mimes violence
                  but nonetheless, crucially, resists the totalizing violence of ideological integration.
                  Mahler’s music “follows the notes where they lead,” Adorno writes, “from a sense of
                  identification with those who are cruelly knocked about and forced into line by aesthetic
                  norms and indeed by civilization” 96). The criticality of this nonviolent violence
                  rests upon the political possibility of resisting—through a formal, nonrepresentational
                  identification with “the victims”—the imposition of the norms of the world of domination.</p>
               <p>In <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, Adorno fleshes out the relationship between form and the nonviolent: <span class="quote">‘[Form] is the nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that nevertheless preserves it
                     as what it is in its divergences and contradictions, and for this reason form is actually
                     an unfolding of truth. A posited unity, it constantly suspends itself as such; essential
                     to it is that it interrupts itself through its other just as the essence of its coherence
                     is that it does not cohere. In its relation to its other—whose foreignness it mollifies
                     and yet maintains—form is what is anti-barbaric in art; through form art participates
                     in the civilization that it criticizes by its very existence. Form is the law of the
                     transfiguration of the existing, counter to which it represents freedom. (143)’</span> Adorno makes several large claims for the sociopolitical possibilities of aesthetic
                  form here: form represents freedom, form is the anti-barbaric aspect of art, and form
                  is how art can offer a critique of the world of which, despite being autonomous, it
                  nonetheless remains a part. The nonviolent synthesis that defines form becomes, on
                  the other end of the process of aesthetic construction and experience, a force of
                  anti-barbarism—at the very least its enactment or miming—in society. What is nonviolent,
                  and hence what is pitched against the barbarism of civilization, is the resistance
                  of art through its form to a reductive, pernicious, and ideological social totality.
                  Only through enlivening and maintaining the divergences, contradictions, and incoherences
                  of existence may art register a critical politics.</p>

               <p>A coherence that does not cohere is an apt way to characterize the unique form—and,
                  ultimately, the critical politics—of Shelley’s sonnet “England in 1819,” which stands,
                  next to “The Mask of Anarchy” and Shelley’s other post-Peterloo political poetry,
                  at the heart of ongoing debates in Romantic studies over how to read the politics
                  of a work of art. Indeed, even more so than “The Mask,” Shelley’s sonnet has been
                  celebrated for its foregrounding of and achievement in poetic form by at least two
                  of the most important formalist studies of Romantic poetry. Of form and content in
                  this Shelley’s “greatest sonnet,” Stuart Curran writes, “the melding . . . appears
                  seamless” yet “ultimately . . . is a paradox”: “the informing idea of this marriage
                  is an impossibility: the subject, as Shelley conceives it, is pitted against the form
                  itself” (54-5). “The form,” Curran concludes, “symbolically consumes itself, as surely
                  as the society it catalogs” (55). While noting the “forceful . . . play against formal
                  prescription” in among other places the sonnet’s syntax and deployment of a pivotal
                  concluding couplet, Susan Wolfson points to the “uncertain effect” of the formal means
                  Shelley uses to shape this attempt at political intervention (204). In the end, Wolfson
                  finds “indeterminacy” and “undecidability” at the heart of the sonnet, such that “the
                  charge to Shelley’s readers is to see how this poetic form keeps the [political] possibilities
                  in tension” (Wolfson 205). </p>
               <p>Taken together, Curran’s and Wolfson’s formalist readings can instigate a new angle
                  on the critical-political possibilities of Shelley’s sonnet if we recall Adorno’s
                  articulation of form as a “nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that nevertheless preserves
                  it as what it is in its divergences and contradictions.” That is, the posited, paradoxical
                  and ultimately unsuccessful (by some measures) marriage of aesthetic form and sociopolitical
                  content identified by Curran, and the unresolved and ultimately irresolvable semantic
                  and structural tensions analyzed by Wolfson—contradictions and divergences enlivened
                  by acts of formalist criticism—do not necessarily indicate that the sonnet lacks political
                  possibilities. Conversely, it is in the resistance of the sonnet to the identity of
                  form and content, and then to the ideology implied by the very notion of resolution—as
                  if, that is, the violence of Peterloo and all that it revealed about England in 1819
                  could ever yield a resolution that was not effectively a continuation of a violently
                  repressive status quo—that we can locate the beginnings of the sonnet’s dialectical
                  criticality. Indeed, James Chandler’s important reading of the historicist self-consciousness
                  informing the “ambiguity, paradox, and paranomasia” in Shelley’s “experiment with
                  the form of the sonnet” is a powerful example of such political possibility, as the
                  poem enacts a “commitment to the notion of changing history <em>by</em> interpreting it” (31).</p>
               <p>Yet I wish to suggest that the political possibility defining the sonnet’s formal
                  intricacies, and thus also undergirding the nuanced formalist readings it has engendered,
                  is a Romantic political aesthetic of nonviolence. That is to say, the poem resists
                  the barbarism of late 1819 in England not by declaring its commitments to radicalism
                  and to reform but rather by staking out its autonomy from the coercive methods of
                  practical politics, from the self-defeating violence of revolutionary politics—from,
                  in short, the entire economy of instrumental rationality, which, for Shelley, serves
                  as the structural or objective source of events such as Peterloo. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The poem enacts an aesthetics of nonviolence in a number of ways, beginning from its
                     well-established and often-remarked-upon resistance to the inherited norms of the
                     sonnet tradition. While we know both that the rhyme-based organization of this sonnet
                     may be unprecedented and that Shelley employs (or at the very least alludes to) the
                     thematic pivot of the hallmark closing couplet of the English sonnet tradition, these
                     formal idiosyncrasies continue to bear revisiting for the new avenues they open up.
                     The rhyme scheme divides the poem into two sections, though not in the traditional
                     octave-sestet manner of a Petrarchan sonnet. Rather, Shelley’s poem is organized as
                     a six-line section (rhyme scheme: <em>ababab</em>) followed by an eight-line section (rhyme scheme: <em>cdcdccdd</em>), essentially, one might say, a kind of inversion of the Italian form once we grasp
                     that the rhyme in the closing couplet originates in the eighth line of the poem.

               <p>“A people” begins the second and final sentence of the poem, its second section, its
                  octave, and thus here the sonnet might enjoin us to locate its volta. However, the
                  introduction of “a people” in line seven functions as a false volta, for rather than
                  representing the counterpoint that might be implied by the new section it announces
                  in the poem, it merely joins the chronicle of ills plaguing England in 1819. In other
                  words, the “people” are part of a detailed list—what Curran calls Shelley’s “pointillist
                  survey” (55)—that includes a “despised and dying King,” “Princes,” “Rulers,” “an army,”
                  “laws,” “Religion,” and a “senate.” “Starved and stabbed,” the “people” are identified
                  as the victims of violence—“th’untilled field” likely alludes to Peterloo—but the
                  poem’s formal insistence on not granting them the status of volta, of not locating
                  political agency or possibility in the straightforward solidarity implied by simply
                  the declaration of “a people,” conveys the structural nature of the violence characterizing
                  England in 1819. One cannot point alone to the king, to parliament, to the army, to
                  the laws, or even to the people in order to obtain purchase on the “tempestuous day”
                  post-Peterloo. Rejecting standard political attributions of causality and agency by
                  way of resisting the aesthetic laws—“golden and sanguine”—of the sonnet form, the
                  poem alternatively arranges the various factors of the condition of England in 1819
                  in constellar relations. </p>
               <p>It is through the positing of such relationality, a set of formal moves that refuses
                  the existing self-defeating and pernicious explanatory paradigms, that we can continue
                  to chart the poem’s aesthetics of nonviolence, present in both form (the poem’s autonomy)
                  and content (the poem’s commitments). On one level of the sonnet’s logic, the necessity
                  of “blood” to sustain the status quo will also cause the downfall of those who hold
                  power, as kings and princes eventually will “drop, blind in blood, without a blow.”
                  Yet on the level of form, the effect of their fall is rendered null by its placement
                  as the conclusion of the poem’s opening sestet, in other words, as the moment prior
                  to the false volta of “a people.” Reinforced by the full stop, the end of line six
                  might normally produce anticipation of the contrapuntal gesture of the next section.
                  But “a people” becomes part of what amounts to the political paralysis of England
                  in 1819 depicted by Shelley’s experimentation with the forms and norms of the sonnet.
                  Progress will not come with intervention as it is traditionally understood in the
                  liberal-reformist or even the radical political lexicon. The mere “dropping” of tyrants
                  and rulers is not emancipatory, for domination has taken the institutionalized form
                  of the “laws which tempt and slay.” The laws “slay” in their alliance with God and
                  King, as the contemporaneous “Mask of Anarchy” makes clear. But more balefully they
                  “tempt” those seeking political progress to rely upon them only, inevitably, to “slay”
                  those who seek redress.</p>
               <p>The sonnet refuses to advocate insurrection, for “an army” as metonymy of force is
                  a “two-edged” self-defeating political means; nor does the sonnet yield a positive
                  alternative program of political action. Rather, the poem’s formal play, an instance
                  of what Kaufman identifies as Shelley’s “lyric as experiment,” stands as a critique
                  of the violence of post-Peterloo politics in England. All of the items on Shelley’s
                  list—the “rulers” as well as the “people,” the “army” as well as the “laws”—turn out
                  to be “graves from which a glorious Phantom may / Burst, to illumine our tempestuous
                  day.” Indeed, the poem famously pivots, in the closing couplet, upon a modal auxiliary
                  that expresses possibility. It is often noted that Shelley here retains the English
                  sonnet’s central formal feature. But Shelley’s allusion to tradition is complex. The
                  poem certainly contains a concluding set of two rhymed lines through which, in terms
                  of both form and content, the problems articulated by the preceding twelve lines are
                  recast. However, its rhyme is not new: “may” and “day” repeat the “c” rhyme of the
                  pattern charted above, recalling “prey” and “slay” from the second group of rhymes
                  in the poem. What is more, the closing couplet is preceded by another couplet, this
                  one determined by the rhyme of “sealed” and “unrepealed.” One might then venture to
                  say that Shelley’s sonnet in fact concludes with two consecutive couplets in another
                  parry against the violence of aesthetic norms. Yet one might also find the relationship
                  of the concluding couplet to the rest of the poem—of, we might say, the very possibility
                  of emancipation to the society from which emancipation is necessary; of the “glorious
                  Phantom” to the “th’untilled field”—thus resistant to extant aesthetic, explanatory,
                  and political forms. The couplet, connected to the preceding lines by way of rhyme
                  (its commitments) and separate from those lines by way of its functional allusion
                  to sonnet tradition (its autonomy), creates, through its formal relations—its nonviolent
                  violence—the space wherein the diffuse material of England in 1819 may be constellated
                  rather than determined.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III.</span></h2>
               <p>In the broadest terms, Shelley’s aesthetics of nonviolence ultimately rests on the
                  resistance of the work of art to incorporation into the social totality: the resistance,
                  we might say, of “England in 1819” to England in 1819. This resistance is achieved
                  primarily through form, and it can properly be called nonviolence insofar as the society
                  and attendant politics against which it pitches itself are defined by, and effectively
                  carry out, domination. The nature of the relationship of art to domination is central
                  to Rancière’s conception of critical art, which takes us further in imagining the
                  unique political possibilities therein. “In its most general expression,” Rancière
                  writes, “critical art is a type of art that sets out to build awareness of the mechanisms
                  of domination to turn the spectator into a conscious agent of world transformation”
                  (<em>Discontents</em> 45). Beginning from the Romantic-age notions of free appearance and free play in
                  Schiller, and from the suspension of the power of the sensible experienced by the
                  spectator before an idle work of art, Rancière argues for a critical difference between
                  two realms: the sensorium of art and the sensorium of domination. This distinction
                  between sensoria is, in turn, the way in which art can have a politics: in fact, Rancière
                  argues that a specific politics is consubstantial with the suspension of the cognitive
                  power of the understanding that defines aesthetic experience. The suspension “defines
                  that which comes within the province of art through its adherence to a sensorium different
                  to that of domination” (30). “It is,” Rancière continues, “as an autonomous form of
                  experience that art concerns and infringes on the political division of the sensible”
                  (32).</p>
               <p>A work of art achieves its criticality through the “redistribution of the sensible,”
                  a key idea in Rancière’s aesthetic theory. In other words, art consists in constructing
                  spaces and relations to reconfigure materially and symbolically the territory of the
                  common. A work of art exists as the place wherein the relations among bodies, images,
                  times, spaces, “all the self-evident facts of perception based on the set of horizons
                  and modalities of what is visible and audible as well as what can be said, thought,
                  made or done” are reconfigured (<em>Politics</em> 89). Such a repartitioning of the realm of the sensible, effected by the status,
                  the mere existence, of works of art as objects of sensory experience, names the emancipatory,
                  nonviolent politics of art for Rancière. “Art is not, in the first instance,” Rancière
                  writes, <span class="quote">‘political because of the messages and sentiments it conveys concerning the state
                     of the world. Neither is it political because of the manner in which it might choose
                     to represent society’s structures, or social groups, their conflicts or identities.
                     It is political because of the very distance it takes with respect to these functions,
                     because of the type of space and time that it institutes, and the manner in which
                     it frames this time and peoples this space” (<em>Discontents</em> 23).’</span> A dramatic “redistribution of the sensible” is, indeed, an apt way to characterize
                  the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” the work that remains at the center of
                  our conversation on the politics of Shelley. In the poem, a figure called Hope places
                  herself down in front of Anarchy’s violent procession—an act of nonviolence that eerily
                  predicts future acts and images of nonviolence, from Gandhi and King to “Tank Man”
                  in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Hope’s nonviolence creates space and also, quite literally,
                  reconfigures time in the poem. The positional word “between” identifies the space
                  that now exists between Hope and Anarchy’s triumph; into this space “a mist, a light,
                  an image rose.” The arising of the mist, light, image is predicated on, though very
                  near simultaneous with, the creation of space. The simile-laden description of the
                  Shape, which amounts to six ballad stanzas of figural deviation technique, also establishes
                  an alternative experience of time insofar as the surface level experience of time
                  (the time of reading; the time of rhythm and meter) in the poem is given over wholly
                  to the Shape and the multitude’s compulsion to witness it.</p>

               <p>We are united with the multitude as we read the poem; we are suspended in the time
                  and space of the work’s sensorium, which has replaced the sensorium of violence and
                  domination represented by Anarchy’s procession. One might say that Shelley dramatizes
                  the repartitioning of the sensible. The sensory experience of the Shape, the experience
                  begat by Hope’s originary nonviolence, remains autonomous: the multitude’s looks and
                  “thoughts”—new thoughts, thoughts detached from and not emerging from Anarchy’s reign
                  of God and King and Law—“spring up.” Thoughts whose content is not told, I should
                  add, as if Shelley is asking us here to consider the very form of the new more so
                  than its content.</p>
               <p>Of course, while the multitude is idly and freely engrossed in the organic deviations
                  and variations of the Shape, Anarchy and the rest of the procession meet their end,
                  and the multitude is emancipated from the violence and domination of Anarchy’s reign.
                  The poem is suggesting the veritable equivalence and simultaneousness of aesthetic
                  experience, nonviolence, and the possibility of political change. One does not cause
                  the others; rather, as Rancière and Adorno would argue, albeit with different inflections,
                  one indeed amounts to the others: a nonviolent, autonomous aesthetic experience, an
                  experience of the power of form, is the only politics of poetry. In reconfiguring
                  the sensible, a work of art can simply refuse to play by the rules of, and thus resist,
                  the violence of the world.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">The parable, as it appears in Adorno’s essay on Kafka: “‘In our house, this enormous
               suburban house, a rented barracks overgrown with indestructible medieval ruins, there
               was proclaimed today, on a misty, icy winter morning, the following call to arms:
               “Fellow Tenants, I possess five toy guns. They are hanging in my closet, one on each
               hook. The first is mine, the rest are for anyone who wants them. Should there be more
               than four, the others will have to bring their own weapons and deposit them in my
               closet. For there will have to be unity; without unity we will not move forward. Incidentally,
               I only have guns which are entirely useless for any other purpose, the mechanism is
               ruined, the wads are torn off, only the hammers still snap. Therefore, it will not
               be very difficult to procure more such weapons should they be needed. But fundamentally,
               I will be just as happy, in the beginning, with people who have no guns. Those of
               us who do, will, at the crucial moment, take the unarmed into our midst. This is a
               strategy which proved itself with the first American farmers against the Indians;
               why shouldn’t it prove itself here as well, since the conditions are, after all, similar?
               We can even forget about guns, then, for the duration, and even the five guns are
               not absolutely necessary, and they will be used simply because they are already here.
               If the other four do not want to carry them, then they can forget about them. I alone
               will carry one, as the leader. But we shouldn’t have a leader, and so I, too, will
               destroy my gun our lay it aside.” That was the first call to arms. In our house no
               one has the time or desire to read such calls, much less consider them. Soon the little
               papers were swimming along in the stream of dirt which originates in the attic, is
               nourished by all the corridors, and spills down the stairs to struggle there with
               the opposing stream that swells upward from below. But a week later came a second
               call: “Fellow Tenants! So far no one has reported to me. I was, insofar as the necessity
               of earning my living allowed, constantly at home, and during the time of my absence,
               when the door to my room was always left open, a sheet of paper lay on my table on
               which anyone who so desired could enroll. No one has done so.”’ This is the figure
               of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka” 224-5).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
