                <div type="section">
            <p>This essay is motivated by three claims. The first is Percy Bysshe Shelley’s
                claim, dramatized most notably at the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” that
                there is a close relationship between aesthetic experience, political emancipation,
                and what can be called anachronistically nonviolent resistance. The second claim
                belongs to Theodor Adorno, who writes, in an early section of <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>,
                of the “[uniting] of the aesthetic element of form with noncoercion” (7). The third
                claim comprises Jacques Rancière’s definition of “critical art”—“a type of art that
                sets out to build awareness of the mechanisms of domination to turn the spectator
                into a conscious agent of world transformation” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 45)—and
                his delineation of critical art’s formal means: a “suspension of the relations of
                domination” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 36). These three claims are by no means the
                same, but the terms they collectively encompass—aesthetic form, the politics of art,
                the nondominative—indicate, I mean to suggest, an overlooked aspect of the
                historical trajectory of the political possibility of art, beginning with the
                Romantic redefinition of aesthetic experience and practice in the late eighteenth
                and early nineteenth centuries and then taking shape in twentieth-century leftist
                rethinkings of politics and aesthetics in the Marxian dialectical tradition.
                Shelley’s reimagining of political poetry is thus seminal here. In engaging the
                complex historico-political moment of Peterloo, Shelley’s poetry enacts a form of
                critique constitutionally oriented against the violence that defined the day. What
                emerges is not just a politics of nonviolence but an aesthetics of nonviolence: art
                becoming the space, the time, and the form of the noncoercive and nondominative—a
                becoming that Adorno and Rancière help us to think. </p>
            <p>While “The Mask of Anarchy,” written in response to the news of Peterloo reaching
                Italy, has long been associated with modern nonviolence—from Gandhi’s quoting of
                it to its prefiguring of the lasting images of Tiananmen Square in 1989<note
                    place="foot" resp="editors"> On Gandhi and Shelley, see Weber 28-30. The images
                    of Beijing in 1989 I refer to include the several photographs of the individual
                    known as “Tank Man” by Charlie Coe, Stuart Franklin, Terril Jones, Jeff Widener,
                    and Arthur Tsang Hin Wah.</note>—it has at the same time stood at the center
                of persistent debates over how to measure the politics of a poem. One view might
                celebrate the poem’s overt political statements, including its bracing criticism of
                the British government, its outrage at the use of force against a peaceable
                assembly, and its disdain for Castlereagh, Eldon, and Sidmouth, for example.<note
                    place="foot" resp="editors"> For versions of this view, see Cameron 343-50,
                    Holmes 532-540, and Thompson 659.</note> Yet another angle on the poem
                characterizes its political aspirations as, in the end, dubious at best and failed
                at worst, insofar as the poem was too radical for even Leigh Hunt to publish,
                precluding it from effecting material change in England in 1819.<note place="foot"
                    resp="editors"> For the most powerful argument along these lines, see Wolfson
                    195-206.</note> What is more, often implicit in this view is a rhetorical
                question: how could a poem ever effect political change? Thus the poem, along with
                others written by Shelley in the wake of Peterloo, brings us up against the larger
                issue of the politics of art: not only how to measure it, but what, in the first
                place, is it? To these questions I might add, as a way of signaling the direction of
                this essay: what can it be?</p>
            <p>My argument is that one possible answer to these questions resides in our grasp of
                the Romantic construal of the aesthetic as nonviolence, first in Shelley’s poetics
                in the aftermath of Peterloo, and then in the theorizations of art’s “autonomy” and
                “criticality” in Adorno and Rancière, respectively. Indeed, thinking along these
                lines provides a way around, or through, the Scylla and Charybdis of measurable
                efficacy versus naïve idealism that defines the critical history of Shelley’s
                political poetry.</p>

            <p>Standing behind ongoing debates over the politics of Shelley’s poetry, explicitly
                at times but also implicitly, is the influential distinction—and the generative
                tension—between “committed” art and “autonomous” art that Adorno makes in his
                well-known and much-discussed 1962 essay “Commitment.” While distinguishable from
                tendentious art or the “advocacy of a particular partisan position,” committed works
                of art are identifiable as “vehicles for what the author wants to say” politically
                or philosophically, as in the case of Sartre, whose works “operate with traditional
                plots and exalt them with an unshakable faith in meanings that are to be transferred
                to reality” 81). In contradistinction, autonomous works of art are “determinate
                negations of empirical reality.” This negation is accomplished through the work’s
                governing principle of “inherent structure”—through its “formal law” 92, 89)—which
                allows the work to become “knowledge in the form of a nonconceptual object.”
                Autonomous art can be known through its “intractability,” a primarily formal
                difficulty that “compels the change in attitude that committed works only demand”
                90).</p>
            <p>The intersection of Adorno’s “Commitment” and Shelley’s 1819 poetics is addressed
                by Robert Kaufman and Mark Kipperman in <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist
                    Poetry, 1819-1820</emph>. Kaufman establishes the influence of Shelley not only
                on Adorno but also on Brecht and Benjamin, as each writer worked out his own ideas
                about the emancipatory potential of art. On this reading, Adorno’s notion of
                “commitment” derives in part from his reading of Shelley—including of Brecht’s
                translations of “The Mask of Anarchy”; what Adorno found in Shelley, Kaufman writes,
                is that “lyric experiment helps construct and make available the
                intellectual-emotional apparatus for accessing, and to that extent helps make
                available the social material of, ‘the new’ (‘the new’ here being understood
                ultimately as the not-yet-grasped features of the mode of production and, in fact,
                all that is emergent in the social)” (Kaufman 19). Shelley’s practice of “lyric as
                experiment” thus functions as a “prerequisite to such subjectivity, critical
                thought, and commitment” as would enable political emancipation (Kaufman 19).
                Suggesting that Adorno is “unfairly hard” on Brecht’s political art in “Commitment,”
                Kipperman carefully recovers the “historicity” of Shelley’s use of satire in “The
                Mask”—the socio-material grounding and penetrating analysis, that is, of Shelley’s
                “committed” poetry of 1819 that frees it from a verdict parallel to the one Adorno,
                fairly or unfairly, delivers on Brecht (Kipperman 5, 7). Through their readings of
                form (lyric) and genre (satire), both Kaufman and Kipperman are able effectively to
                reestablish the force of Shelley’s commitments.</p>
            <p>Nearly absent in name, though—but most certainly, I must be clear, not in
                spirit—from both of these readings, is the other side of the coin in Adorno’s essay:
                autonomy. In many ways, “Commitment” is a brief for autonomous art over committed
                art, and it locates the emancipatory potential of the aesthetic in its autonomy from
                overt sociopolitical and philosophical commitments. However, as W. J. T. Mitchell
                reminds us, even for Adorno the distinction between autonomy and commitment does not
                result in a “simple choice” between the two: “Commitment, in short, leads to kitsch,
                and formalism [autonomy] leads to academicism. The compulsion and inescapability of
                formalism may lead to an end just as dead as the cul-de-sac of propaganda” (Mitchell
                322-3). Yet in the powerful closing passages of “Commitment,” Adorno turns to
                autonomy, as distinguished from recent French and German examples of “politically
                radical” committed art, in order to delineate the emancipatory potential of the
                aesthetic, and in doing so subtly connects autonomy, and the “politics” it engenders
                or indeed enacts, to nonviolence: 
            <quote> This is not the time for political works of art; rather, politics has migrated into
                the autonomous work of art and it has penetrated most deeply into works that present
                themselves as politically dead, as in Kafka’s parable about the children’s guns,
                where the idea of nonviolence is fused with the dawning awareness of an emerging
                political paralysis (“Commitment” 93-94).</quote>
            Adorno is referring to a set of untitled fragments in Kafka’s Notebook B that were
                given the title “The Appeal” by Max Brod in 1937.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    I wish to thank Jared Green for first identifying “The Appeal” as Adorno’s
                    reference for me. See Kafka, <emph>The Blue Octavo Notebooks</emph> 5-6. On
                    Brod’s titling of the fragments, see Gray 22.</note> The primary fragment
                consists of a first-person narrative by a resident of a tenement building concerning
                an attempt by one of his fellow tenants to organize the residents—for purposes which
                are not stated. The resident making the appeal, quotations from whom occupy nearly
                the entire story, possesses toy guns, which he suggests he and his fellow tenants
                might use in their efforts. This cryptic fragment also makes an appearance in
                Adorno’s dense, lengthy, dialectical essay “Notes on Kafka,” where it is quoted in
                its entirety and interpreted in the following pithy and provocative way: “This is
                the figure of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka”).<note place="foot"
                    resp="editors"> The parable, as it appears in Adorno’s essay on Kafka: “‘In our
                    house, this enormous suburban house, a rented barracks overgrown with
                    indestructible medieval ruins, there was proclaimed today, on a misty, icy
                    winter morning, the following call to arms: “Fellow Tenants, I possess five toy
                    guns. They are hanging in my closet, one on each hook. The first is mine, the
                    rest are for anyone who wants them. Should there be more than four, the others
                    will have to bring their own weapons and deposit them in my closet. For there
                    will have to be unity; without unity we will not move forward. Incidentally, I
                    only have guns which are entirely useless for any other purpose, the mechanism
                    is ruined, the wads are torn off, only the hammers still snap. Therefore, it
                    will not be very difficult to procure more such weapons should they be needed.
                    But fundamentally, I will be just as happy, in the beginning, with people who
                    have no guns. Those of us who do, will, at the crucial moment, take the unarmed
                    into our midst. This is a strategy which proved itself with the first American
                    farmers against the Indians; why shouldn’t it prove itself here as well, since
                    the conditions are, after all, similar? We can even forget about guns, then, for
                    the duration, and even the five guns are not absolutely necessary, and they will
                    be used simply because they are already here. If the other four do not want to
                    carry them, then they can forget about them. I alone will carry one, as the
                    leader. But we shouldn’t have a leader, and so I, too, will destroy my gun our
                    lay it aside.” That was the first call to arms. In our house no one has the time
                    or desire to read such calls, much less consider them. Soon the little papers
                    were swimming along in the stream of dirt which originates in the attic, is
                    nourished by all the corridors, and spills down the stairs to struggle there
                    with the opposing stream that swells upward from below. But a week later came a
                    second call: “Fellow Tenants! So far no one has reported to me. I was, insofar
                    as the necessity of earning my living allowed, constantly at home, and during
                    the time of my absence, when the door to my room was always left open, a sheet
                    of paper lay on my table on which anyone who so desired could enroll. No one has
                    done so.”’ This is the figure of revolution in Kafka” (“Notes on Kafka”
                    224-5).</note> That is, while existing as or containing “the figure of
                revolution,” the parable is nonetheless “politically dead,” a deadness that can be
                understood as having no political meanings transferable to reality, no
                representational or mimetic ties to the political, material, empirical world. In
                other words, to focus on the parable’s depiction of, say, the implied
                power-relations between the renters and their landlord; to consider those relations
                allegorical of some other set of power-relations in society; to take heart in the
                attempt to organize and build solidarity through the two “calls to arms” despite
                their being unanswered—would be, it seems, to miss the work’s actual criticality.
                The “figure of revolution” resides not in these commitments but primarily in the
                parable’s formal resistance to those commitments and the ideologies of exchange with
                which they are necessarily bound. If one recalls Adorno’s critique of Sartre in
                “Commitment,” one can begin to see how a work such as “The Appeal” might function
                differently. Sartre’s works “operate with traditional plots and exalt them with an
                unshakable faith in meanings that are to be transferred to reality” (“Commitment”
                81), Adorno writes. Not only is Kafka’s parable structured without a standard plot
                or narrative framework, but it also, through both the mediation of the narrative
                voice and the recursivity of the quoted appeals themselves—such that the appeals are
                not even transferable to their own immediate social reality in the fiction of the
                story—strays far from any codified political meaning or effect. The layers of
                “political paralysis” Adorno sees in the fragments thus begin to emerge. The
                narrative logic of the appeals (especially the longer first appeal) is awkwardly
                self-negating: the appellant’s initial calls for the miming of violence, his
                puzzling use of historical analogy, and his ultimate anxiety over promoting himself
                as a leader all work to discredit his politics as well as to render the cause
                utterly devoid of the means to intervene in and affect the situation. No one takes
                up the call to arms: “In our house no one has the time or desire to read such calls,
                much less to consider them” (“Notes on Kafka” 225).</p>
            <p>Yet what should not be missed here is Adorno’s connecting of the formal autonomy
                of the work of art—the very “figure of revolution”—with “the idea of nonviolence.” A
                baseline formulation of this relationship would be that the difference between the
                autonomous work and reality—the work’s very autonomy—is marked and defined in terms
                of the violence of “the practical world,” a phrase Adorno uses in this context in
                    <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>. Hence the negation of the violent means of
                practical politics in Kafka’s parable achieved through form: it is not the political
                content or justification of the call to arms (which we do not know) that matters as
                much as its form, its status as a call to arms in the first place. In this way, we
                see the “idea of nonviolence” in “The Appeal” as the parable resists dramatizing a
                world wherein a call to arms, the use of toy guns, and a false analogy work as
                political methods—which is to say, the entire parable resists the coercion and
                domination that constitute everyday practical politics.</p>
            <p>A look at Adorno’s centenary address on Mahler, given in Vienna in 1960, two years
                before “Commitment” was published, offers further insight into the relationships
                among the formal features of works of art, their political possibilities, and their
                emancipatory nonviolence. Adorno brings the address to a close with a discussion of
                Mahler’s variation technique. Rather than purely academic variation for the sake of
                variation, Adorno argues, the individual “functional elements” of Mahler’s music are
                “too independent, too evidently living beings in process” such that variation and
                deviation “transforms the identical into the nonidentical” (“Mahler” 94-5). These
                functional figures of deviation and variation contain the substance of Mahler’s
                music: as they “emerge, persist, and disappear” they become, in a memorable phrase,
                “figures of disintegration” 95-6) What is formulated in such figures of
                disintegration, Adorno goes on to suggest, is what he calls Mahler’s “nonviolent
                violence,” akin to “the power of a true humanity” (96). That is, the figural
                disintegration of Mahler’s variation technique mimes violence but nonetheless,
                crucially, resists the totalizing violence of ideological integration. Mahler’s
                music “follows the notes where they lead,” Adorno writes, “from a sense of
                identification with those who are cruelly knocked about and forced into line by
                aesthetic norms and indeed by civilization” 96). The criticality of this nonviolent
                violence rests upon the political possibility of resisting—through a formal,
                nonrepresentational identification with “the victims”—the imposition of the norms of
                the world of domination.</p>
            <p>In <emph>Aesthetic Theory</emph>, Adorno fleshes out the relationship between
                form and the nonviolent:
            <quote>[Form] is the nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that nevertheless preserves it as
                what it is in its divergences and contradictions, and for this reason form is
                actually an unfolding of truth. A posited unity, it constantly suspends itself as
                such; essential to it is that it interrupts itself through its other just as the
                essence of its coherence is that it does not cohere. In its relation to its
                other—whose foreignness it mollifies and yet maintains—form is what is anti-barbaric
                in art; through form art participates in the civilization that it criticizes by its
                very existence. Form is the law of the transfiguration of the existing, counter to
                which it represents freedom. (143)</quote>
            Adorno makes several large claims for the sociopolitical possibilities of aesthetic
                form here: form represents freedom, form is the anti-barbaric aspect of art, and
                form is how art can offer a critique of the world of which, despite being
                autonomous, it nonetheless remains a part. The nonviolent synthesis that defines
                form becomes, on the other end of the process of aesthetic construction and
                experience, a force of anti-barbarism—at the very least its enactment or miming—in
                society. What is nonviolent, and hence what is pitched against the barbarism of
                civilization, is the resistance of art through its form to a reductive, pernicious,
                and ideological social totality. Only through enlivening and maintaining the
                divergences, contradictions, and incoherences of existence may art register a
                critical politics.</p></div>

            <p>A coherence that does not cohere is an apt way to characterize the unique
                form—and, ultimately, the critical politics—of Shelley’s sonnet “England in 1819,”
                which stands, next to “The Mask of Anarchy” and Shelley’s other post-Peterloo
                political poetry, at the heart of ongoing debates in Romantic studies over how to
                read the politics of a work of art. Indeed, even more so than “The Mask,” Shelley’s
                sonnet has been celebrated for its foregrounding of and achievement in poetic form
                by at least two of the most important formalist studies of Romantic poetry. Of form
                and content in this Shelley’s “greatest sonnet,” Stuart Curran writes, “the melding
                . . . appears seamless” yet “ultimately . . . is a paradox”: “the informing idea of
                this marriage is an impossibility: the subject, as Shelley conceives it, is pitted
                against the form itself” (54-5). “The form,” Curran concludes, “symbolically
                consumes itself, as surely as the society it catalogs” (55). While noting the
                “forceful . . . play against formal prescription” in among other places the sonnet’s
                syntax and deployment of a pivotal concluding couplet, Susan Wolfson points to the
                “uncertain effect” of the formal means Shelley uses to shape this attempt at
                political intervention (204). In the end, Wolfson finds “indeterminacy” and
                “undecidability” at the heart of the sonnet, such that “the charge to Shelley’s
                readers is to see how this poetic form keeps the [political] possibilities in
                tension” (Wolfson 205). </p>
            <p>Taken together, Curran’s and Wolfson’s formalist readings can instigate a new
                angle on the critical-political possibilities of Shelley’s sonnet if we recall
                Adorno’s articulation of form as a “nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that
                nevertheless preserves it as what it is in its divergences and contradictions.” That
                is, the posited, paradoxical and ultimately unsuccessful (by some measures) marriage
                of aesthetic form and sociopolitical content identified by Curran, and the
                unresolved and ultimately irresolvable semantic and structural tensions analyzed by
                Wolfson—contradictions and divergences enlivened by acts of formalist criticism—do
                not necessarily indicate that the sonnet lacks political possibilities. Conversely,
                it is in the resistance of the sonnet to the identity of form and content, and then
                to the ideology implied by the very notion of resolution—as if, that is, the
                violence of Peterloo and all that it revealed about England in 1819 could ever yield
                a resolution that was not effectively a continuation of a violently repressive
                status quo—that we can locate the beginnings of the sonnet’s dialectical
                criticality. Indeed, James Chandler’s important reading of the historicist
                self-consciousness informing the “ambiguity, paradox, and paranomasia” in Shelley’s
                “experiment with the form of the sonnet” is a powerful example of such political
                possibility, as the poem enacts a “commitment to the notion of changing history
                    <emph>by</emph> interpreting it” (31).</p>
            <p>Yet I wish to suggest that the political possibility defining the sonnet’s formal
                intricacies, and thus also undergirding the nuanced formalist readings it has
                engendered, is a Romantic political aesthetic of nonviolence. That is to say, the
                poem resists the barbarism of late 1819 in England not by declaring its commitments
                to radicalism and to reform but rather by staking out its autonomy from the coercive
                methods of practical politics, from the self-defeating violence of revolutionary
                politics—from, in short, the entire economy of instrumental rationality, which, for
                Shelley, serves as the structural or objective source of events such as Peterloo. </p>
            <p>The poem enacts an aesthetics of nonviolence in a number of ways, beginning from
                its well-established and often-remarked-upon resistance to the inherited norms of
                the sonnet tradition. While we know both that the rhyme-based organization of this
                sonnet may be unprecedented and that Shelley employs (or at the very least alludes
                to) the thematic pivot of the hallmark closing couplet of the English sonnet
                tradition, these formal idiosyncrasies continue to bear revisiting for the new
                avenues they open up. The rhyme scheme divides the poem into two sections, though
                not in the traditional octave-sestet manner of a Petrarchan sonnet. Rather,
                Shelley’s poem is organized as a six-line section (rhyme scheme:
                <emph>ababab</emph>) followed by an eight-line section (rhyme scheme:
                    <emph>cdcdccdd</emph>), essentially, one might say, a kind of inversion of the
                Italian form once we grasp that the rhyme in the closing couplet originates in the
                eighth line of the poem.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephen Behrendt notes
                    that Shelley inverts the Petrarchan form in another sonnet, “[Lift not the
                    painted veil]” (Behrendt 232).</note></p>

            <p>While the opening sestet describes those who occupy the highest seats of power, the
                “king” (1), “princes” (3), and “rulers” (4) subsisting on the “blood” (6) of “their
                fainting country” (5), the closing “octave” hinges on the introduction of “a people”
                (7) into the portrait of England in 1819:</p>
            <quote><lg><l>An old, mad, blind, despised and dying King;</l>
            <l>Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow</l>
            <l>Through public scorn,— mud from a muddy spring;</l>
            <l>Rulers who neither see nor feel nor know,</l>
            <l>But leechlike to their fainting country cling</l>
            <l>Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.</l>
            <l>A people starved and stabbed in th’untilled field;</l>
            <l>An army, whom liberticide and prey</l>
            <l>Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;</l>
            <l>Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;</l>
            <l>Religion Christless, Godless—a book sealed;</l>
            <l>A senate, Time’s worst statute, unrepealed—</l>
            <l>Are graves from which a glorious Phantom may</l>
            <l>Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day. (Shelley 326-7)</l></lg></quote>
            <p>“A people” begins the second and final sentence of the poem, its second section,
                its octave, and thus here the sonnet might enjoin us to locate its volta. However,
                the introduction of “a people” in line seven functions as a false volta, for rather
                than representing the counterpoint that might be implied by the new section it
                announces in the poem, it merely joins the chronicle of ills plaguing England in
                1819. In other words, the “people” are part of a detailed list—what Curran calls
                Shelley’s “pointillist survey” (55)—that includes a “despised and dying King,”
                “Princes,” “Rulers,” “an army,” “laws,” “Religion,” and a “senate.” “Starved and
                stabbed,” the “people” are identified as the victims of violence—“th’untilled field”
                likely alludes to Peterloo—but the poem’s formal insistence on not granting them the
                status of volta, of not locating political agency or possibility in the
                straightforward solidarity implied by simply the declaration of “a people,” conveys
                the structural nature of the violence characterizing England in 1819. One cannot
                point alone to the king, to parliament, to the army, to the laws, or even to the
                people in order to obtain purchase on the “tempestuous day” post-Peterloo. Rejecting
                standard political attributions of causality and agency by way of resisting the
                aesthetic laws—“golden and sanguine”—of the sonnet form, the poem alternatively
                arranges the various factors of the condition of England in 1819 in constellar
                relations. </p>
            <p>It is through the positing of such relationality, a set of formal moves that
                refuses the existing self-defeating and pernicious explanatory paradigms, that we
                can continue to chart the poem’s aesthetics of nonviolence, present in both form
                (the poem’s autonomy) and content (the poem’s commitments). On one level of the
                sonnet’s logic, the necessity of “blood” to sustain the status quo will also cause
                the downfall of those who hold power, as kings and princes eventually will “drop,
                blind in blood, without a blow.” Yet on the level of form, the effect of their fall
                is rendered null by its placement as the conclusion of the poem’s opening sestet, in
                other words, as the moment prior to the false volta of “a people.” Reinforced by the
                full stop, the end of line six might normally produce anticipation of the
                contrapuntal gesture of the next section. But “a people” becomes part of what
                amounts to the political paralysis of England in 1819 depicted by Shelley’s
                experimentation with the forms and norms of the sonnet. Progress will not come with
                intervention as it is traditionally understood in the liberal-reformist or even the
                radical political lexicon. The mere “dropping” of tyrants and rulers is not
                emancipatory, for domination has taken the institutionalized form of the “laws which
                tempt and slay.” The laws “slay” in their alliance with God and King, as the
                contemporaneous “Mask of Anarchy” makes clear. But more balefully they “tempt” those
                seeking political progress to rely upon them only, inevitably, to “slay” those who
                seek redress.</p>
            <p>The sonnet refuses to advocate insurrection, for “an army” as metonymy of force
                is a “two-edged” self-defeating political means; nor does the sonnet yield a
                positive alternative program of political action. Rather, the poem’s formal play, an
                instance of what Kaufman identifies as Shelley’s “lyric as experiment,” stands as a
                critique of the violence of post-Peterloo politics in England. All of the items on
                Shelley’s list—the “rulers” as well as the “people,” the “army” as well as the
                “laws”—turn out to be “graves from which a glorious Phantom may / Burst, to illumine
                our tempestuous day.” Indeed, the poem famously pivots, in the closing couplet, upon
                a modal auxiliary that expresses possibility. It is often noted that Shelley here
                retains the English sonnet’s central formal feature. But Shelley’s allusion to
                tradition is complex. The poem certainly contains a concluding set of two rhymed
                lines through which, in terms of both form and content, the problems articulated by
                the preceding twelve lines are recast. However, its rhyme is not new: “may” and
                “day” repeat the “c” rhyme of the pattern charted above, recalling “prey” and “slay”
                from the second group of rhymes in the poem. What is more, the closing couplet is
                preceded by another couplet, this one determined by the rhyme of “sealed” and
                “unrepealed.” One might then venture to say that Shelley’s sonnet in fact concludes
                with two consecutive couplets in another parry against the violence of aesthetic
                norms. Yet one might also find the relationship of the concluding couplet to the
                rest of the poem—of, we might say, the very possibility of emancipation to the
                society from which emancipation is necessary; of the “glorious Phantom” to the
                “th’untilled field”—thus resistant to extant aesthetic, explanatory, and political
                forms. The couplet, connected to the preceding lines by way of rhyme (its
                commitments) and separate from those lines by way of its functional allusion to
                sonnet tradition (its autonomy), creates, through its formal relations—its
                nonviolent violence—the space wherein the diffuse material of England in 1819 may be
                constellated rather than determined.</p>

            <p>In the broadest terms, Shelley’s aesthetics of nonviolence ultimately rests on
                the resistance of the work of art to incorporation into the social totality: the
                resistance, we might say, of “England in 1819” to England in 1819. This resistance
                is achieved primarily through form, and it can properly be called nonviolence
                insofar as the society and attendant politics against which it pitches itself are
                defined by, and effectively carry out, domination. The nature of the relationship of
                art to domination is central to Rancière’s conception of critical art, which takes
                us further in imagining the unique political possibilities therein. “In its most
                general expression,” Rancière writes, “critical art is a type of art that sets out
                to build awareness of the mechanisms of domination to turn the spectator into a
                conscious agent of world transformation” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 45). Beginning
                from the Romantic-age notions of free appearance and free play in Schiller, and from
                the suspension of the power of the sensible experienced by the spectator before an
                idle work of art, Rancière argues for a critical difference between two realms: the
                sensorium of art and the sensorium of domination. This distinction between sensoria
                is, in turn, the way in which art can have a politics: in fact, Rancière argues that
                a specific politics is consubstantial with the suspension of the cognitive power of
                the understanding that defines aesthetic experience. The suspension “defines that
                which comes within the province of art through its adherence to a sensorium
                different to that of domination” (30). “It is,” Rancière continues, “as an
                autonomous form of experience that art concerns and infringes on the political
                division of the sensible” (32). </p>
            <p>A work of art achieves its criticality through the “redistribution of the
                sensible,” a key idea in Rancière’s aesthetic theory. In other words, art consists
                in constructing spaces and relations to reconfigure materially and symbolically the
                territory of the common. A work of art exists as the place wherein the relations
                among bodies, images, times, spaces, “all the self-evident facts of perception based
                on the set of horizons and modalities of what is visible and audible as well as what
                can be said, thought, made or done” are reconfigured (<emph>Politics</emph> 89).
                Such a repartitioning of the realm of the sensible, effected by the status, the mere
                existence, of works of art as objects of sensory experience, names the emancipatory,
                nonviolent politics of art for Rancière. “Art is not, in the first instance,”
                Rancière writes, 
            <quote> political because of the messages and sentiments it conveys concerning the state of
                the world. Neither is it political because of the manner in which it might choose to
                represent society’s structures, or social groups, their conflicts or identities. It
                is political because of the very distance it takes with respect to these functions,
                because of the type of space and time that it institutes, and the manner in which it
                frames this time and peoples this space” (<emph>Discontents</emph> 23).</quote>
            A dramatic “redistribution of the sensible” is, indeed, an apt way to
                characterize the pivotal moment in “The Mask of Anarchy,” the work that remains at
                the center of our conversation on the politics of Shelley. In the poem, a figure
                called Hope places herself down in front of Anarchy’s violent procession—an act of
                nonviolence that eerily predicts future acts and images of nonviolence, from Gandhi
                and King to “Tank Man” in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Hope’s nonviolence creates space
                and also, quite literally, reconfigures time in the poem. The positional word
                “between” identifies the space that now exists between Hope and Anarchy’s triumph;
                into this space “a mist, a light, an image rose.” The arising of the mist, light,
                image is predicated on, though very near simultaneous with, the creation of space.
                The simile-laden description of the Shape, which amounts to six ballad stanzas of
                figural deviation technique, also establishes an alternative experience of time
                insofar as the surface level experience of time (the time of reading; the time of
                rhythm and meter) in the poem is given over wholly to the Shape and the multitude’s
                compulsion to witness it. </p>

            <p>We are united with the multitude as we read the poem; we are suspended in the
                time and space of the work’s sensorium, which has replaced the sensorium of violence
                and domination represented by Anarchy’s procession. One might say that Shelley
                dramatizes the repartitioning of the sensible. The sensory experience of the Shape,
                the experience begat by Hope’s originary nonviolence, remains autonomous: the
                multitude’s looks and “thoughts”—new thoughts, thoughts detached from and not
                emerging from Anarchy’s reign of God and King and Law—“spring up.” Thoughts whose
                content is not told, I should add, as if Shelley is asking us here to consider the
                very form of the new more so than its content.</p>
            <p>Of course, while the multitude is idly and freely engrossed in the organic
                deviations and variations of the Shape, Anarchy and the rest of the procession meet
                their end, and the multitude is emancipated from the violence and domination of
                Anarchy’s reign. The poem is suggesting the veritable equivalence and
                simultaneousness of aesthetic experience, nonviolence, and the possibility of
                political change. One does not cause the others; rather, as Rancière and Adorno
                would argue, albeit with different inflections, one indeed amounts to the others: a
                nonviolent, autonomous aesthetic experience, an experience of the power of form, is
                the only politics of poetry. In reconfiguring the sensible, a work of art can simply
                refuse to play by the rules of, and thus resist, the violence of the world.</p>
