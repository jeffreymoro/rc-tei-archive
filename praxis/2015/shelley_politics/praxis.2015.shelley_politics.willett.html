            <p>Shelley's political legacy passed through an often-neglected school of writers to
               world leaders and revolutionaries globally in the decades following his death. When
               assessing his legacy, we should not overlook those early, ardent appreciators known
               as "the Spasmodic School." Alexander Smith, Sydney Dobell, J. Stanyan Bigg, and even
               James Thomson B.V. took Shelley's call to a revolution conducted through imaginative
               sympathy seriously, and together, helped to fan his "fading coal" to flame.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Shelley’s Spasmodic Afterlife</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Matthew Arnold’s much-derided jibe about ineffectual angels is not the only remark
               on Shelley’s political impotence. Early reviewers were quick to dismiss both his radicalism
               and radical ambition. <em>The Quarterly Review</em>, for example, compares him (presciently) to a drowning man, flailing his arms about
               to no avail, as Kim Wheatley has shown (8). Wheatley argues that reviewers’ vituperative
               recrimination of his project amounts to a kind of paranoid politics, casting his gestures
               as ineffectual for fear of their possible political power. </p>
            <p>Scholars such as Mark Redfield, Paul Foot, David Duff, and Cian Duffy have recently
               made inroads into recreating the political Shelley, suppressed for so much of the
               century that followed him, and ignored for much of ours. Likewise, Shelley’s influence
               on later poets has been repeatedly, if not comprehensively, remarked through the work
               of Anthony Harrison, Herbert Tucker, and others.</p>
            <p>But a reconsideration of the political (broadly considered) in Shelley is due in the
               wake of recent scholarship from Slavoj Žižek and Jacques Ranciere, among others, tying
               the political and aesthetic. The bifurcation of those concepts is still very much
               with us. Eugene Stelig wrote in 2013, for example (of Wordsworth), “by the end of
               the decade, the identity conflict between poetry and politics was essentially over,
               having been resolved in favor of the former” (745-6). That attempting to write political
               poetry creates an “identity conflict” is taken for granted. This essay considers another
               dimension of the political in Shelley: not a revolution of the mind, nor the moral
               force of his verse and example, but the <em>realpolitik</em> carried on in his name, and the politico-poetic revolution he actually enacted.</p>
            <p>Among the most important of Shelley's legacies is the overlooked school of poets writing
               in the years following his death, known at first derisively, and then popularly as
               the "The Spasmodics." The Spasmodics took Shelley as their hero and model, and unlike
               him, lived to see their (his) politico-poetic vision take shape. Through the Spasmodics
               then, Shelley’s trumpet of prophecy sounded to legions of readers both in the English
               literary world and beyond.</p>
            <p>My claims in this essay are three: 1) that despite Arnoldian-Victorianist portraits
               of Shelley as politically-ineffectual (and this despite the fact that, whatever his
               intentions, he largely <em>was</em> ineffectual during his short life) Shelley’s effect on the popular generation of
               poets immediately following his death was both profound and heretofore unremarked,
               2) that the most popular school thereof—the Spasmodics—are better categorized as a
               Shelleyan rather than Keatsian, and 3) that this is so in part because of their works'
               political force, despite that modern Victorianist critics—like the Victorians before
               them—call their work “apolitical.”</p>
            <p>This reconsideration will, I hope, do a few things for us. It extends work already
               begun by Susan Schmidt and Michael Rossington on Shelley’s reception worldwide in
               the years following his death, especially among the working classes. It also offers
               a glimpse at how early Victorians—Christians, moralists—began the project of rehabilitating
               Shelley’s work, and reputation, making it (if only slightly) more palatable for domestic
               consumption. In that, it participates in conversations on the Romantic/Victorian divide
               hosted by Richard Cronin and Anthony Harrison and gives us a picture of how Romantic,
               and more specifically, Shelleyan, poetics were incorporated into what afterward became
               known as the early part of a new period. Some ancillary questions pop up that might
               be further considered elsewhere: what does the Shelleyan poetic project actually look
               like, as distinct from Keatsian/Huntian/Byronic? What would a School of Shelley look
               like, if not this? </p>

                     </div> The Spasmodic poets are a group of once-popular writers working mainly on ars-poetic
                     epics in the 1850s. Philip James Bailey (1816-1902), Sydney Dobell (1824-1874), Alexander
                     Smith (1830-1867), and J. Stanyan Bigg (1828-1865) are the principle authors in this
                     group, but there are other minor writers, and some major ones who can be so classed.

                     </div> Understood as inheritors of the Romantic tradition, their work outsold everything
                     in the nineteenth-century apart from Byron, but since they were mostly working-class
                     writers, and because of Victorian critical reaction to late-Romantic epistemology,
                     their fame died quickly by the 1860s.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In their 2004 special issue of <em>Victorian Poetry</em>, editors Charles LaPorte and Jason Rudy note that Spasmodism “struck nearly all readers
                  as a demonstrably new mode of poetic composition,” featuring “a wavering between poetic
                  identities—masculine and feminine—virile and susceptible” (422, 424). Herbert Tucker
                  points out their attention to “the sanctity of the moment of heightened perception,
                  and the totality of the truth to which creative poets enjoy privileged if fitful access”
                  (429). Both are expanding on George Saintsbury’s definition of Spasmodism as <span class="quote">‘a kind of solidifying or at least centripetalizing of the loose and floating endeavours
                     toward something new and strange...by a certain gorgeousness or intricacy of language,
                     by a scrupulous avoidance of the commonplace in subject, by more or less elaborately
                     hinted or expressed unorthodoxy in religion or philosophy. (155)’</span> Though they were extremely popular, especially in the 1850s, it has become fashionable
                  to argue that the Spasmodics do not form anything like a real literary movement. Some
                  say that the Spasmodics “constitute a school only in name” (LaPorte, Rudy 421). Richard
                  Cronin writes that “not until J.H. Buckley’s essay, ‘The Spasmodic School’...in 1966...did
                  the term achieve any substantial content” (142). Buckley’s essay, actually published
                  in 1951 as a chapter in <em>The Victorian Temper</em>, argues that “the Spasmodics can be classed together as members of a ‘school’ only
                  insofar as...they subscribed...to a fairly coherent philosophy of incoherence” (43).</p>
               <p>This is not quite true, however. Not only did earlier critics consider the Spasmodics
                  a “school of poetry,” with similar traits and goals and members, but the members themselves
                  seemed to have thought of themselves as belonging to such a group and common project.
                  <em>The Cambridge History of English Literature</em> described in 1922—44 years before Cronin’s reference—that they constituted “a fairly
                  definite group, of which...[Bailey] was the leader: the so-called Spasmodics” (147).
                  Contemporary reviews also categorized these same authors as belonging to “a definite
                  group”: an article from <em>The Leader</em> in 1854 treats Bigg, Dobell, and Massey under the heading “The Latest School of Poetry.”
                  Smith himself writes in his posthumous collection of essays <em>Last Leaves</em>, “While noticing this ebb and flow of poetical reputations, it may not be too much
                  to infer that the oblivion to which the Spasmodic School has been consigned for the
                  last few years has been to a considerable extent undeserved” (174). In fact, <em>The Scottish Review </em>wrote of the Spasmodics as early as 1855, "Tennyson can scarcely be said to have founded
                  a school; Bailey has" (347).</p>
               <p>The Spasmodics then, were not “a school only in name” as Rudy, Cronin, and others
                  argue, but were thought of immediately as one, with fixed members and characteristics,
                  and thought of themselves as belonging to one. Although it is true that there isn’t
                  a formal aesthetic charter in place like Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em> or Wordsworth’s prefaces to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> announcing an express purpose, the Spasmodics comprise a coherent school and a serious
                  movement that merits discussion both as a group of individuals working toward a common
                  aesthetic and as a body of work.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Spasmodics were not only a school appreciated by the masses but were
                  influences on most of the important poets then living. Charles LaPorte has recently
                  shown how Smith’s aesthetic balance informed and structured Elizabeth Barrett-Browning’s
                  masterwork, <em>Aurora Leigh</em>. Heather Morton has shown Spasmodic influence on Swinburne. The Rossettis were ardent
                  admirers. Dobell was a close friend and literary encouragement to the Brontes. And
                  these are just a very few. As will be shown, since they conceived of themselves as
                  Shelley’s wild west wind, blowing change and revolution hither and yon, their widespread
                  poetic influence ought to be considered as part of Shelley’s legacy.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Spasmodics were not only influential poetically, but politically, to
                  which notion we will shortly return in more detail. However little we think of them
                  now, the Spasmodics affected world leaders in Italy, Germany, and Russia, among others,
                  which we can add to Shelley’s attempts at reform in Ireland, England, and Greece,
                  since he can be considered the movement’s progenitor. Some of this work on Shelley’s
                  political influence has been done. Bouthaina Shaaban, for example, maps references
                  to Shelley in the Chartist press, a valuable reference for scholars working either
                  on Shelley’s reception or on Chartism. That Shelley's poetry was read by revolutionaries
                  is not new knowledge, but that his politico-poetic ideals were fleshed out, more or
                  less instantly upon the widespread availability of his poems, is. </p>
               <p>The Spasmodics are referred to by their contemporaries as having belonged to “The
                  School of Keats” (Clough 159). One critic in the <em>Saturday Review</em> compared Keats and the Spasmodics under the heading "Poetical Nuisances": <span class="quote">‘A new poetical school is springing up which ought to be brought under the Nuisances
                     Removal Act. Just as society is trying to put down the bone boilers and glue-makers,
                     so must criticism awaken to its new and dirtier duties. Extirpation is the only remedy.
                     What insults the natural propriety is only to be handed over to the police...Here
                     is a writer who has got hold of...the mannerism of Keats, and the impudence of Leigh
                     Hunt...who is as dull as Bailey, and as sensual as Alexander Smith. (Saturday Review
                     327)’</span> Critics thought this because, by the 1850s, Keats’ reputation had not sufficiently
                  recovered—in part by Lord Houghton's <em>Life</em> in 1856 and the letters thereafter—and to link a writer with him was an insult. The
                  comparison is meant to call up images of the lower classes, effeminacy, escapism,
                  and a kind of unmanly poetic striving for fame.</p>
               <p>Even now scholars set them alongside Keats, thinking they wrote apolitical, escapist
                  verse in an anti-classicist mode. I argue that we've been wrong on both those scores
                  and that “The School of Shelley” is the more appropriate label due to the Spasmodics’
                  deep engagement with his work and various homages to it, and for their Shelleyan political
                  engagements.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Resuscitating Shelley</span></h2>
               <p>Among Shelley’s first and most ardent readers were the Chartists. Chartist poet Thomas
                  Frost records how reading Shelley made him “a chartist, and something more” (cited
                  in Sanders 8). W. J. Linton records the reading of Shelley’s <em>Queen Mab</em> as one of his formative experiences (cited in Sanders 8). If Shelley’s attempts at
                  political insurrection didn’t always materialize, his attempts at poetical insurrection
                  did. Shelley spawned a cadre of imitators—ballad-mongers, rebels—and many of these
                  found their ways to Chartism.</p>
               <p>In what he calls “the Chartist Imaginary,” Mike Sanders shows how poetry was, for
                  that group, no mere decoration but an essential component of the movement, since it
                  “transforms the consciousness of the reader” (9). This is Shelley’s project written
                  on the polis. Sanders explains how exposure to writers like Burns and Shelley created
                  in working-class writers a transformation that was “qualitative and total…it does
                  not alter any specific opinions held by its readers, but is experienced by them as
                  the acquisition of new powers in general” (10).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Chartist readings of Shelley are important here because many Chartists were also Spasmodics,
                     and vice versa. In fact, some say the movements are indistinguishable.

                              overtones, while Chartism is primarily a political one, that has poetic basis.</span></div>
                     </div> Ernest Jones is the most important of these double agents, since he was widely acknowledged
                     the last leader of the Chartists and is also included among the first Spasmodics.
                     Phyllis Mary Ashraf, who also lists Shelley as an exemplar for Chartists in her <em>Introduction to Working-Class Literature in Great Britain </em>also has Ebenezer Jones and Gerald Massey as Chartist poets, which is important, since
                     they are also always listed among Spasmodics. In any case, Spasmodism and Chartism
                     shared numerous members, aesthetics, and concerns.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Not content simply to read Shelley’s verse, and to espouse his politics, many Spasmodics
                  penned him various forms of homage. James Thomson—the last Spasmodic—is known to history
                  by his <em>nom de plume</em>, “James Thomson B.V.,” which serves to distinguish him from the earlier James Thomson,
                  author of <em>The Seasons</em>, and to acknowledge his debt to his two heroes. “Bysshe Vanolis” is meant to reference
                  Shelley’s middle name and the German poet Novalis. Thomson writes a defense in 1860
                  called simply “Shelley,” deriding the harsh treatment Shelley received both during
                  and after his life. Thomson argues, <span class="quote">‘probably no man of this century has suffered more and more severely, both in person
                     and reputation, from this rash convictive bigotry than Percy Bysshe Shelley. Florence
                     to the living Dante was not more cruelly unjust than England to the living Shelley.
                     (14)’</span> If we have come to recognize this hyper-defensive language with regard to Shelley’s
                  reputation, we should also recognize that much of it comes through the Spasmodics.</p>
               <p>In 1861, Thomson writes a long narrative poem, again called “Shelley,” wherein he
                  both recalls the earlier poet, and imitates his syntax. The poem begins, </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">UPON a grassy slope of shore I lay</div>
                     <div class="l">Hour after hour, from sunset into night,</div>
                     <div class="l">Outgazing tranquil o'er the tranquil bay,</div>
                     <div class="l">And dreaming in a mood of rare delight.</div>
                     <div class="l">Yes, for some hours, sky-pure sea-calm star-bright<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">My spirit was in tune with heaven and earth,</div>
                     <div class="l">Nor felt the discords of its mortal birth. (1-7) </div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Shelleyan lyricism pervades Thomson’s poetry, early and late. Nearly 20 years after
                  this publication, still an acolyte, Thomson took Shelley as a guide through atheism
                  and despair in his magnum opus, <em>City of Dreadful Night (1880)</em>.</p>
               <p>Thomson was not alone among the Spasmodics in revering Shelley. Sydney Dobell’s lecture,
                  “On the Nature of Poetry,” delivered in Edinburgh in 1857, was a direct answer to
                  Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em>, and his own poems owe much to Shelley’s. Dobell’s friend and collaborator Alexander
                  Smith offered a clear-eyed summary of Dobell’s indebtedness: “Of all recent writers,”
                  Smith writes, “[Dobell] bears the closest resemblance to Shelley. He has much of Shelley’s
                  impracticability, exaggeration, and hectic over-color; he has all Shelley’s subtlety,
                  analytic habit and power, splendor of imagery, dramatic instinct, and rich-flowing
                  lyrical impulse” (189). Smith may be overstating the case, as would be usual, but
                  he’s not far off the mark.</p>
               <p>Though it is possible the Spasmodic poets came independently to appreciations of Shelley,
                  they were likely encouraged so to do by the editor cum patron George Gilfillan (1815-1873).
                  Reverend Gilfillan, an immensely popular minister from Dundee, Scotland, is probably
                  the second most important critic in the early Victorian period, after Carlyle. Like
                  the rest of the Spasmodic School, his reputation has faded, but as author of Walter
                  Scott’s biography and the best-selling <em>Bards of the Bible</em>, editor of Robert Burns, and much else, he was for a time a tastemaker without parallel.
                  Gilfillan is often credited with having founded the Spasmodic School, since he was
                  an early supporter of Alexander Smith and Sydney Dobell, to a large extent architecting
                  their careers.</p>
               <p>Gilfillan possessed a remarkable breath of literary taste and was in a position to
                  inflict that taste on others. As LaPorte and Rudy note, “he worked toward broadening
                  the usual horizons of the British poetic tradition” (427). They point out, rightly,
                  that many lesser-known British poets, from Gilfillan’s volume of the same name, have
                  been vindicated by history: <span class="quote">‘John Gower, Thomas Hoccleve, John Lydgate, Sir John Skelton, George Gascoigne, Sir
                     Philip Sidney, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Donne,
                     Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, Robert Herrick, Catharine Phillips, Andrew
                     Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas Chatterton ’</span> are listed there among others (427). He was also a staunch, a radical, supporter
                  of Shelley.</p>
               <p>Though most now condemn Gilfillan's moralizing conservatism, we should recognize how
                  forward was his defense of the Satanic School in the 1830s (Buckley 50). Comparing
                  Shelley to Keats, Gilfillan writes that the former is “superior” <span class="quote">‘in sustained stateliness, in sounding march, in extent of knowledge, power of intellect,
                     and purity of taste, and free…from [Keats’] babyism of manner, affectations of style,
                     endless sinkings away from the finest eloquence. (90)’</span> Moreover, the preacher directly compares Shelley to the biblical writers, as in the
                  following excerpt. <span class="quote">‘In somewhat lower, but still lofty regions, we find the same facutly presiding…as
                     in…Shelley. In those writers who had the benefit of inspiration it is the same. Think
                     of Isaiah with his glowing eloquence! Ezekiel with his stupendous visions! (Gilfillan
                     92)’</span> To call Shelley a prophet—for a minister of the church to call Shelley a prophet—was
                  itself an act of transgression. In the years following his death, before Shelley’s
                  reputation had recovered from early scandal among the Victorian reading public, Gilfillan
                  both sounded his genius to the world and recommended him as an example to the ascendant
                  poets who made up the Spasmodic school.</p>
               <p>The Spasmodics were criticized, as was Shelley, largely for the socio-political instability
                  that their work suggested, and from the same quarters. This claim warrants a more
                  space than I can give it here, but it is easy to imagine how Smith’s epic <em>A Life-Drama</em> that crescendos in a rape scene, Dobell’s <em>Balder</em> wherein a man kills his wife, might unsettle a conservative readership. Kirstie Blair
                  reads a prejudice in early reviewers, noting how terms like “‘irregular” and “perverted”
                  hint at the potential immorality of this writing, and carry possible connotations
                  of sexual depravity,” a sexual depravity associated in the Victorian mind primarily
                  with Shelley and Byron.</p>
               <p>It is no surprise that the chief critic of Spasmodism, was William Aytoun, Tory and
                  editor at (where else?) <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em> from 1839 to his death in1865. Aytoun wrote damning articles about Shelley and published
                  them alongside damning articles about the Spasmodics, because to him, and to many,
                  they comprised one movement: radicals. Aytoun is also where the term comes from. We
                  owe “Spasmodic” as a specific poetic group to Aytoun, who pilloried these writers
                  under that name in his satire <em>Firmillian</em> (1854), but we owe the literary term to Charles Kingsley, who in 1853 used it to
                  describe Shelley’s verse: <span class="quote">‘“and thus arose a spasmodic, vague extravagant, effeminate, school of poetry, which…
                     possess, elements in common with Shelley’s” (51).’</span></p>
               <p>Spasmodic politics were more or less exactly in line with Shelley’s. It was a working-class
                  movement from the beginning. Bailey’s first readers were the gathered printers and
                  mechanics who helped produce the book and thereafter formed a literary club. Smith
                  was himself a pattern-tracer in a Glasgow manufacturing house. Dobell was a religious
                  non-conformist. Bigg was a firebrand editor. Jones was a Chartist. For the most part,
                  they threw themselves into reformist causes with Shelleyan vigor. </p>
               <p>This is important to note because even contemporary scholars have imagined the Spasmodics
                  as merely an aesthetic movement, uninterested in politics. Richard Cronin calls Smith’s
                  work “entirely apolitical,” claiming that “by the time he wrote <em>A Life-Drama</em>, Smith had already given up on politics” (“Alexander Smith and the Poetry of Displacement”).</p>
               <p>Cronin here is likely following Arthur Hugh Clough, Matthew Arnold’s friend and fellow
                  Spasmodic detractor. Where Cronin calls Smith “escapist,” and “obsessed with the Kentish
                  countryside,” Clough writes “Yet really, and truth to tell, is it not, upon the whole,
                  an easy matter to sit under a green tree by a purling brook, and indite pleasing stanzas
                  on the beauties of nature and fresh air” (99)? But that is not the Spasmodic project
                  anymore than it is Shelley’s. </p>
               <p>True, Smith had been attending Chartist meetings, participating in a working men’s
                  educational co-op, and editing a reformist journal before publication of <em>A Life-Drama</em> (1853), and as Cronin points out, seeing the two Chartists hung in the town square
                  was likely sobering. But his work didn’t leave the political at that point, nor at
                  any other.</p>
               <p>To mark<em>A Life Drama</em> as the end of Smith’s political phase is an odd choice, since his very next poetic
                  effort was a collaboration with the Marxist/Chartist Sydney Dobell, called <em>Sonnets on the War</em> (1856). There are few more politically engaged collections of poetry in the entire
                  age: <em>Sonnets</em> covers British positions on Hungary, America, Italy, and the Crimea, in a pull-no-punches
                  manner. With titles like “The Army Surgeon,” “The Wounded I,” “The Wounded II,” “Vox
                  Populi,” “Sebastapol,” and “The Cavalry Charge,” the charge that the Spasmodics were
                  “apolitical” hard to maintain indeed.</p>
               <p>Neither were these very political young writers simply twittering away in golden bowers
                  about the war. Their poetry was actually read, and, some say, affected the outcome
                  of certain political revolutions. The Italian liberation fighter Guiseppe Mazzini
                  (also friends with another Spasmodic, Ernest Jones) wrote that Dobell’s <em>The Roman</em> was the poem he would have written about Italy, had he been a poet (Kierstead 71)
                  .</p>
               <p>We should notice how rare this is. We have poems that interpret or record political
                  events, and ones about revolutionary leaders that are popular with people, but rare
                  is the political poem which is timely and forceful enough to have been read, much
                  less lauded by the leaders of the movement it represents. And the poem was effective,
                  as Christopher M. Kierstead writes. Mentioning <em>The Roman</em> as a template for Rossetti’s later confrontation of the “Italian Question,” he argues
                  that Dobell’s poem “was a politically useful means of vindicating the Italian cause
                  in the minds of the British public at a time when it needed reassurance after the
                  downfall of Mazzini’s short-lived Roman Republic in 1849” (71).</p>
               <p>Mazzini continues his exhortation to Dobell, seeming himself to channel Shelley, “and
                  what you write flows from the soul, the all-loving, the all-embracing, the prophet-soul”
                  (qtd. Kierstead 71). “Prophet-soul” is right; in an avocation coincident of “A Song:
                  ‘Men of England,’” Dobell, dropping all poeticisms, wrote in 1867 to the Italian rebels,
                  “Fight! you mad, magnificent, foolish nation” (Ellis 210). Add that Spasmodist Ernest
                  Jones was a personal friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and the political range
                  of Spasmodic poetics broadens significantly.</p>
               <p>In a kind of answer to claims that Shelley didn’t accomplish more politically, Kierstead
                  writes, “Ultimately, the poet does not claim for himself the role of leader but instead,
                  the role of instigator—one who senses the greatness of the cause and acts with an
                  almost mystical force in bringing political events to fruition” (71). Mark Kipperman
                  likewise writes defending Shelley’s interventionist political poetry from detractors
                  such as Matthew Arnold and, more recently, Susan Wolfson. He states that Shelley’s
                  hope in <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> for the “moral force of the masses’ protest” involves both a “class demand” for “urgent
                  material needs,” and a renewed “self-respect” in which they, the victims, “stand for
                  the absolute moral order of reciprocal justice” (9). “Self-respect” is the “something
                  more” alluded to by Hood who said that reading Shelley “made me a Chartist, and something
                  more.” The “mystical force” Krierstead mentions is what Kipperman likely has in mind
                  when he answers concerning Shelley’s political potency, <span class="quote">‘the dream vision of an aristocrat may perhaps constitute a more incisive political
                     analysis than a ballad about the rebel framebreaker, General Ludd. In fact, peculiar
                     though it may seem, Adorno would probably see the dream vision section of Shelley’s
                     poem as even more subversive than its working-class balladry. (4)’</span> I have argued here for a second answer: the poet not only as visionary, but as instigator
                  of visionaries. In the space of a single generation, Shelley had the ear—had in some
                  cases the beating hearts—of world leaders and revolutionaries through the poetry of
                  the Spasmodics, with which movement he was affiliated from the first, which is itself
                  more political than has heretofore been acknowledged, and which in any fair legislation,
                  ought to be trumpeted more broadly still.</p>
