                <p rend="noCount">In the short run, government prosecution of radical publishers
                    after Peterloo affected literary sensibilities of late Romanticism, evident
                    in the fall in popularity of political satire in the 1820s. In the long run,
                    government repression, by silencing dissent, shaped the canon of radical and
                    Romantic literature. This essay explores the forgotten career of the radical

                <p> Donald Read, a Peterloo historian, has observed that the 1819 massacre of
                    political reformers by local yeomanry in Manchester’s St. Peter’s Field “had its
                    influence in the realm of the arts” and that it “inspired” Percy Shelley as well
                    as “many contemporary prints” (208). Indeed, Peterloo provided a lasting image
                    of political tyranny: mounted and uniformed riders slashing gratuitously with
                    sabers through a panicked crowd. Moreover, as James Chandler has aptly
                    expressed, “the more one reads in public or private commentary by intellectuals
                    across the political spectrum of England in 1819, the more one sees of
                    revolutionary hopes and fears” (21). And yet, while both Read’s and Chandler’s
                    observations are correct, both are optimistic, strictly speaking. Peterloo also,
                    and more significantly, inspired intense political and cultural repression. E.
                    P. Thompson somewhat wryly refers to the 1820s as “the quiet years” of radical
                    culture (171): despite the occasional outbursts by defiant publishers such as
                    Richard Carlile, editor of <emph>The Republican</emph>, or Thomas Wooler, editor
                    of the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph>, English radicalism—where it survived—was forced
                    underground (711-23). In his recent discussion of censorship in the eighteenth
                    century, Richard Darnton has argued that “state intervention in the literary
                    realm went far beyond the blue-penciling of texts. It extended to the shaping of
                    literature itself as a force at work throughout the social order” (20). This was
                    true in Peterloo-era England as well. Far from refined in its methods, the
                    Liverpool government was belligerent in its response to the mounting propaganda
                    war over public sympathy (Hilton 252-3; Gash 87-90). While Parliament wielded
                    “the hugely blunt instrument of suspending civil liberties,” the Home Office
                    “made furious efforts to mobilize a loyal press as a counterweight to the rash
                    of seditious publications” (Hilton 607; 252). Moreover, Lord Sidmouth spent “a
                    good deal of public money” on domestic spies and informants to thwart those
                    “disaffected demagogues” who sought to “harness social discontent” for the
                    agenda of a national revolution (Gash 87-90). It is more accurate to say, then,
                    that post-Peterloo repression, more than the event that prompted it, had a
                    profound and enduring influence on English literature and culture. Intense
                    repression not only arrested public responses to Peterloo in the 1820s, but also
                    profoundly affected literary sensibilities in the late Romantic period, not to
                    mention subsequent historical accounts of the submerged radical culture of the
                    1820s. The impact of post-Peterloo hegemony is epitomized by the history of John
                    Cahuac, a radical London publisher in 1819, who was effectively silenced and
                    removed from any political discourse, and the fate of his satirical writings,
                    almost entirely forgotten today, confirms the power of the state to affect both
                    contemporary literary sensibilities and future literary history.</p>
                <p>If the massacre itself provoked a flurry of indignant responses in 1819 and early
                    1820 from liberal communities, including Shelley’s now widely-celebrated lyrical
                    satire, <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph>, the consequences of the ensuing
                    repression were more far-reaching. The government systematically prosecuted and
                    imprisoned radical agitators, shut down newspapers and booksellers, ended
                    popular protests and large meetings, silenced authors or otherwise encouraged
                    them to turn away from popular politics, and broke apart liberal political
                    associations. Moreover, as the legal historian Michael Lobban has documented,
                    the government worked rapidly after Peterloo to redefine radical activity as
                    criminal activity: if “seditious libel” had been the prosecutorial weapon of
                    choice before Peterloo, the Peterloo trials provided case law that would
                    establish “the doctrine of unlawful assembly,” which provided terms such as
                    “breach of the peace, obstruction and nuisance” that could be used by
                    authorities as “a lever with which to control dissent” (352). Indeed, radicalism
                    after Peterloo, John Gardner argues, was largely “defeated, by a government that
                    deployed against it, methods that, though they may be morally reprehensible,
                    were both innovative and effective” (220). Prosecution devastated the
                    aspirations of reformers by reasserting the state’s authority to define the
                    agenda of public discourse. This left many of the radicals isolated, dejected,
                    and alienated, including many of the Romantics who had radical sympathies,
                    Shelley among them. As a result, Paul Foot remarks, “many disillusioned
                    revolutionaries … settled for what [was] ‘immediately practicable’ and drifted
                    gently to the right” (224). In short, imminent political persecution had a
                    coercive influence on the literature of the 1820s, most clearly evident in a
                    growing disillusionment with satire by the midpoint of the decade.</p>
                <p>The disillusionment with satire was a broad trend, but specific examples are
                    plentiful. Iain McCalman has observed that Carlile, himself no stranger to
                    hyperbole and sarcasm, surprisingly “blamed fellow radical pressmen … because
                    their propaganda had taken trivial forms” when forced to temporarily shut down
                        <emph>The Republican</emph> at the end of 1820, a little over a year after
                    Peterloo (175). McCalman paraphrases Carlile’s complaint: “squibs and
                    pasquinades could amuse and annoy but not influence serious political change”
                    (175). Similarly, Shelley’s series of responses to Peterloo until his drowning
                    in 1822 reveal a fall in his estimation of the political efficacy and literary
                    merits of satire—from his acerbic and combative “England in 1819” to his more
                    measured and earnest <emph>A Philosophical View of Reform</emph>, and finally to
                    his late and all-but-disengaged political fragments. In his late fragment,
                    “Satire upon Satire,” for example, he regrets the violence of the genre: “Tis
                    not worth while” to compose and publish satires because “harsh words beget hard
                    thoughts” (ll. 44-6; see Jones, “Shelley’s Fragment…”). Beleaguered by the
                    government’s campaign of repression, Carlile and Shelley, to mention only two
                    examples, came to recognize the shortcomings of satire to prompt any real
                    reform.</p>
                <p>The link between the government’s campaign of repression and a popular
                    dissatisfaction with satire has not been evident to all. For example, in his
                    survey of satire from 1789 to 1832, Gary Dyer documents how “satire largely
                    disappeared as a distinct literary form” (139) in the 1820s, and he attributes
                    this disappearance to the rise of a middle-class; to the death of Byron, which
                    made satire “passé;” and to marketplace trends: “publishers needed the reliable
                    profits fiction provided” (139). When citing statistics that reveal a yearly
                    decline in the sales of verse satire, he notes 1820 as an aberration and
                    acknowledges the flurry of radical publications that year, but he does not
                    explore the possibility that the subsequent decline of satire was precipitated
                    by the government’s counter-attacks against radical publications (140-143).
                    Nonetheless, the repression was real, and the government’s multifaceted campaign
                    has been documented (for an initial overview, see Thompson 711-23). “In the same
                    month that Carlile denigrated satirical radical literature,” McCalman notes,
                    “[Lord] Sidmouth [Secretary of the Home Office] and his officials were racking
                    their brains for ways to counteract the ‘deadly weapon’ of popular caricature”
                    because “George and his government were remarkably sensitive to popular ridicule
                    and caricature” (176), and through persistent prosecutions, they were largely
                    successful. Indeed, Marcus Wood concludes his study of radical satire of the
                    Romantic era in 1822 when satirical writing largely disappears. </p>
                <p>Chandler, in his study of English literature of 1819, summarizes succinctly that
                    “the growing agitation all came to an abrupt halt” owing to
                <quote>the combined effect of arrests of key leaders (Henry Hunt, Major Cartwright,
                    Francis Burdett, Richard Carlile, Sir Charles Wolseley), government
                    countermeasures (the Gag Acts, passed on December 30, 1819), and desperate
                    radical plots (The Cato Street Conspiracy, discovered on February 23, 1820).
                    (22)</quote>
                Of course, post-Peterloo repression did not crush radicalism entirely, but the
                    success of attempts to crush satire can be estimated on an immediate level by
                    the slump in bookshop sales after 1820, which Dyer documents, and, taking a
                    broader view, by how successfully government repression ultimately concealed its
                    own efforts. That authors such as Carlile and Shelley turned on the genre of
                    satire suggests their sense of powerlessness in the face of the government
                    counter-measures and unwillingness for one reason or another to address them
                    directly. Regardless, those who were engaged in more immediate prosecutions,
                    such as Thomas Dolby and John Cahuac, reveal more about the government’s actions
                    than those who avoided such engagements.</p>
                <p>To argue that Shelley grew disillusioned with satire is not to argue that
                    Shelley’s radical convictions wavered after Peterloo, or that he was a
                    fair-weather radical, as he famously accused both William Wordsworth and Robert
                    Southey of being. In fact, there have been a number of Shelley scholars,
                    including Michael Scrivener, Steven E. Jones, Mark Kipperman, and John Gardner,
                    who have researched post-Peterloo repression and who have reconstructed from
                    Shelley’s diverse writings a coherent logic to his political convictions, thus
                    demonstrating his steady commitment. These scholars have offered compelling
                    apologies that valorize his developing responses to the government’s campaign.
                    Kipperman, for example, has sought to counter critiques of Shelley’s
                    “aristocratic exile” in Italy and the assumption that his work had little impact
                    because Leigh Hunt suppressed much of it for over a decade (1). To this end,
                    Kipperman distinguishes the political “import” from the “impact” of <emph>The
                        Mask of Anarchy</emph>; that is, he distinguishes its immediate engagement
                    with and influence upon its contemporary political moment from its “total
                    historical and social situation” within “a larger and all-too-effective culture
                    of resistance” (3). This allows Kipperman to argue the significance of Shelley’s
                    participation in radical culture, regardless of whether or not his productions
                    were published. In other words, even if Shelley were aware of the possibility
                    that his writings would be withheld from popular circulation, his continued
                    involvement lent weight to the reform movement when it was forced underground.
                    Moreover, Kipperman continues, <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph> has “a moving
                    target” (4): the identified targets of the satirical humor, Lord Castlereagh,
                    Lord Eldon, and King George IV, should be read merely as incidental metaphors of
                    tyranny and corruption. If readers abstract from the specificity of political
                    allusions, a move that would be obvious to sympathetic readers in other
                    political contexts, the proto-Marxist rhetoric and visionary utopianism of the
                    poem become only more apparent. In this way, satirical humor may once again
                    prove to be a potent means to bring about an awakening of class consciousness.
                    If Chandler sets himself the task of examining “the historical situation of the
                    texts of England in 1819 and … the hermeneutic conceptualization of this very
                    work of historically situating texts” (38), Kipperman pushes aside this
                    methodological concern and attempts to free Shelley’s satires from the critical
                    tendency to static historical determination altogether. Simply put, rather than
                    attempt to historicize it, Kipperman urges readers to follow <emph>The Mask of
                        Anarchy</emph> as it reconfigures across historical contexts. It is a
                    compelling argument, especially when one considers the enduring popularity of
                    Shelley’s visionary writings in unions and working-class associations over the
                    next one hundred and fifty years. </p>
                <p>In any event, despite his political convictions, Shelley’s faith in political
                    satire was not unwavering in the final years of his life, and it is my aim to
                    continue the dialectical history, already begun by Scrivener, McCalman, and
                    Jones, that follows the evolving poetics of satire in the late Romantic period
                    at a time when efforts to suppress radical satire were mounting. Jones, whose
                    central argument about Shelley in <emph>Satire and Romanticism</emph> is that
                    his “radical-reformist satire was a central part of his <emph>oeuvre</emph>”
                    (108), compares Shelley’s 1819-1820 writings to those of Thomas Wooler, editor
                    of the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph> (108). Through this comparison, Jones reveals
                    not only how Shelley deployed “a public discourse that subsumed canonical and
                    subcanonical works alike,” but also and more importantly, that the satirical
                    mode was the essential link between radicalism and Romanticism (104). It is my
                    contention that while satire did indeed serve as this link between the poetic
                    and the political, the link was not long lasting. “In late 1824,” as Neil
                    Fraistat has observed, “England’s poet laureate, Robert Southey, publicly
                    derided the second bookshop of the radical William Benbow, the Byron’s Head, as
                    ‘one of those preparatory schools for the brothel and gallows; where obscenity,
                    sedition, and blasphemy are retailed in drams for the vulgar’” (409). If Southey
                    was particularly outspoken in this regard, most of the Romantics turned against
                    popular political satire after Peterloo. </p>
                <p>Indeed, by the mid-1820s, most Romantics disassociated themselves from satire,
                    often but not necessarily as a retreat from the politics of reform. In short, if
                    it had been cutting-edge in the late 1810s, satire ceased to be fashionable by
                    the mid-1820s. This turn on satire had a legacy that extended well beyond the
                    Romantic period; without identifying post-Peterloo repression, Marilyn Butler
                    notes that “With the passing of time, critics seem to have become less rather
                    than more aware of the satirical and intellectualist strain in Romantic writing”
                    (224). It has only been in the last few decades that critics such as Butler,
                    Haywood, Jones, and Wood have questioned the neglect of satire of the Romantic
                    era, a neglect I contend that was initially prompted by political necessity.</p>
                <p>To appreciate how precipitous the fall was after Peterloo, it is crucial to
                    understand that in the years leading up to Peterloo, radicals and Romantics
                    alike celebrated satire as both the pinnacle of wit and a practical tool for
                    advancing their various political agendas. Satire of the period expressed an
                    earnest conviction that it could identify corruption, exhibit popular interests,
                    redirect popular sympathies and loyalties, alienate political opponents as
                    agents of tyranny, and, ultimately, inspire the solidarity necessary to push
                    through political reform. This was the agenda of all satirical productions of
                    the period. Kyle Grimes has described the combative radical humor of the period
                    as a “verbal jujitsu,” which sought “to expose, disarm, and ridicule …
                    pretensions to authority” (182), but ultimately, its aim was to inspire
                    political solidarity among reformers. The refrain that concludes <emph>The Mask
                        of Anarchy</emph> epitomizes this aspiration: </p>
                <quote><lg><l>Rise Like Lions after slumber </l>
                <l>In unvanquishable number— </l>

                <l>Which in sleep had fallen on you— </l>
                <l>Ye are many—they are few. (<emph>Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</emph> 326) </l></lg></quote>
                <p>In the years subsequent to Peterloo, satirists retreated or were routed. “Why
                    crush a starving bookseller?,” Shelley furiously wrote about government
                    repression to Hunt on November 3, a few months after Peterloo, because in doing
                    so, “tyrants … strike in his person at all of their political enemies” and
                    “divert the attention of the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive
                    Government…” (72-3). As was frequently the case, Shelley’s political commentary
                    was astute. Publishers, including Richard Carlile, Thomas Wooler, William Hone,
                    Thomas Dolby, and Leigh Hunt, were prosecuted in high-profile cases, and many
                    were incarcerated, impressing on all the government’s determination to, in
                    Shelley’s word, “crush” radicalism. One casualty of this repression was John
                    Cahuac, one of Shelley’s “starving bookseller[s],” who was in fact “crushed” by
                    Sidmouth’s campaign against satirists and booksellers.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> I discovered John Cahuac’s publications
                        while conducting research in the Pforzheimer Collection at the New York
                        Public Library. This research was made possible by a Carl H. Pforzheimer
                        Research Grant, awarded by the Keats-Shelley Association of America in 2011.
                        I am indebted to Liz Denlinger, who assisted me in finding Cahuac’s
                        publications in the Pforzheimer as well as to my former research assistant,
                        Amy Potter, who found and made coherent many of the records of Cahuac’s life
                        discussed here.</note> Cahuac shared Shelley’s radical sensibility prior to
                    Peterloo, but he had none of the financial advantages Shelley enjoyed, nor was
                    he abroad following Peterloo. Rather, Cahuac was on the front line of radical
                    resistance in England in 1819 and 1820, faced government prosecution, and
                    ultimately, lost. </p>
                <p>In 1819, Cahuac was a working-class publisher and bookseller at 53 Blackman
                    Street, Southwark—the Borough—of south London. After Peterloo, and while being
                    routinely abused by government agents, he composed and published a series of
                    satires. Three command attention: first, a rabble-rousing pamphlet, <emph>Who
                        Killed Cock Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the
                        Manchester Blot!</emph>, akin to those of his better-known contemporary,
                    Hone; second, an openly seditious <emph>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His
                        Oppressive Arrest for the Sale of an Alledged Libel,</emph> about Sidmouth’s
                    relentless campaign of prosecuting publishers while he directed the Home Office;
                    and third, a list of the jury members paid by the Crown during the Queen
                    Caroline scandal, in which Caroline sued for her right to the throne while her
                    husband sought a divorce. Not one of these satires was particularly original or
                    literary, but all three epitomize embattled radical culture post-Peterloo,
                    before it crumbled under repression. </p>
                <p>On September 10, 1823, four years after Peterloo, Cahuac was arrested. He was
                    tried promptly, and found guilty of receiving stolen property (a considerable
                    number of unbound but valuable books), for which he was sentenced to
                    transportation to Van Diemen’s Land for fourteen years, the standard maximum
                    sentence. Cahuac, like all political dissidents who were sentenced to
                    transportation, was “torn from every tie of relationship,” as Thomas Reid
                    reported in his 1822 exposé on the horrors of exile to Australia (2); he was
                    removed from English life, his political career was brought to an end, and his
                    participation in the reform movement to that point was all but erased from
                    history. In fact, references to Cahuac in histories of the period are almost
                    non-existent, but the extraordinarily brazen expressions of political defiance
                    in his post-Peterloo publications should not be lost to history, if for no other
                    reason than because they are exemplary of radicalism in the late Romantic
                    period. </p>
                <p> Although they are piecemeal, there are some records of Cahuac’s life, and taken
                    together, they can provide a sketch of his career. He was born around 1770
                    (records vary) in London to John and Mary Cahuac, the third of five children,
                    and he was baptized at St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, in 1771 (<emph>London,
                        England, Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812</emph>: Record for John
                    Cahuac). It seems that his father was the nephew of Bertrand Cahuac, a wine
                    seller who had migrated likely from Languedoc and whose tavern eventually became
                    the “Caveac” Masonic Lodge, one of many permutations of the original family name
                    (Simpson 30-31). In any case, as a young man, nineteen or twenty, John Cahuac
                    junior worked as a pawnbroker’s assistant for one Mr. Woodin in Drury-Lane, a
                    position which, according to court records, connected him to London’s criminal
                    underworld of fences (See the trials of Elizabeth Ford and Elizabeth Kelley on
                    15 September 1790 and James Bond on 8 December 1790, <emph>The Proceedings of
                        the Old Bailey</emph>). By 1793, he had broken out on his own as a
                    pawnbroker (again, court records suggest that he was still dealing with fences)
                    and then as an apothecary, assigned to the London Dispensary. He sought a
                    military appointment as an apothecary, but no records of any military service
                    exist. He married a woman of the same age named Mary, and they had a son, Henry
                    St. John Cahuac, in 1808 (they would have a second child, a daughter, Elizabeth,
                    who they called Eliza, in 1822) (<emph>Australia Death Index, 1787-1907</emph>).
                    There are no records concerning his parent’s home, his upbringing, or education,
                    and the first records we have of Cahuac’s radical activities suggest that he was
                    in his late thirties or early forties when he became politically active.</p>
                <p>By 1817, Cahuac was working cooperatively with the radical publisher, Thomas
                    Dolby. Dolby had a successful shop a few blocks from the Crown and Anchor public
                    house and was known as a radical reformer. Perhaps through this association,
                    Cahuac became, as J. Ann Hone describes him, one of the “ultra-radicals” in the
                    reform movement in London (287-288). On July 21, 1817, for example, he was the
                    appointed steward for the dinner celebrating the acquittal of Arthur Thistlewood
                    and James Watson at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, the regular meetinghouse of the
                    London Corresponding Society, of which Cahuac was a member (Hone 288).
                    Thistlewood and Watson, both Spencerian radicals, had tried to instigate rioting
                    at the mass meeting at Spa Fields on December 2, 1816, in an attempt to seize
                    control of the Tower of London and the Bank of England. Their acquittal was a
                    triumph for radicals, but their fortunes were short lived. Both were embroiled
                    in the Cato Street Conspiracy, when government spies entrapped them in a
                    manufactured plot to assassinate several members of the government. They were
                    arrested, paraded before an incredulous public, and hanged in 1820.<note

                        the Cato Street Conspiracy, see Gash, Gardner, and Hilton.</note> Though he
                    seems to have been a close acquaintance to both Thistlewood and Watson, as J.
                    Ann Hone has documented, Cahuac does not appear to have had any involvement with
                    the Cato Street Conspiracy or to have been involved with the Spencerians. </p>
                <p>During the same period that Shelley was looking to set up residence in Italy in
                    1819, Cahuac moved to 53 Blackman Street, acquired and registered his own
                    printing press, as the Unlawful Societies Act of 1799 required, and shifted to
                    working as an independent publisher and bookseller. Because Southwark was home
                    to many dissenters and political discontents, he found a readership for radical
                    literature, but it is more likely that he anticipated this market than merely
                    responded to it. His imprint appears in various radical texts, including works
                    by Thomas Paine, Richard Price, and Elihu Palmer, and he was a distributor of
                        <emph>The Republican</emph>, published by Carlile, whom he seems to have
                    known personally, as well as <emph>The Black Dwarf</emph>. Moreover, with his
                    own press, he became more than just a bookseller; he edited and composed his own
                    radical literature. In that first year with his own press, for example, he
                    published “a New Edition” of Palmer’s <emph>Principles of Nature</emph>,
                    “Revised &amp; Corrected by J. Cahuac.” Later that year, he was tried for this
                    publication, but the “prosecution was compromised for a sum of money,” according
                    to the <emph>London Investigator</emph> (Cooper 82). Then came the news of
                    Peterloo.</p>
                <p>Immediately after Peterloo, in late 1819, Cahuac collaborated with Thomas
                    Rowlandson, the artist, illustrator, draftsman, and caricaturist. That he
                    collaborated with such a prominent figure demonstrates how well connected Cahuac
                    had become. Together they produced the pamphlet entitled, <emph>Who Killed Cock
                        Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the Manchester
                        Blot!</emph> The pamphlet presents a satirical allegory about the brutality
                    and corruption of the government, narrated in the form of an extended nursery
                    rhyme, with sequential caricatures, culminating in a caricature of the king as a
                    bloated peacock, who “Struts unconcern’d at / Cock Robin’s Sad tale.” Wood has
                    suggested that William Hone’s similar <emph>The Political House that Jack
                        Built</emph>, published in December 1819, “was the most notorious popular
                    satiric reaction to the Peterloo massacre” (213). He continues that it
                    “established the basic form in which the majority of Hone and Cruikshank’s other
                    satirical pamphlets were to be produced,” and that it “led to a host of
                    imitations and counter-imitations by both the radical and loyalist press.
                    Radical publishers including William Benbow, Thomas Dolby, John Fairburn, and
                    John Cahuac brought out satires based on the forms of nursery rhyme books, and
                    nursery rhyme parody became part of the currency of popular satire” (213). It
                    should be pointed out, however, that Cahuac’s pamphlet is also dated 1819; if
                    Hone’s was published in December, Cahuac had less than a month to write, have
                    Rowlandson illustrate, edit, print, and bind his imitation. It seems unlikely
                    that <emph>Who Killed Cock Robin?</emph> followed <emph>The Political
                        House</emph>, but rather that it was composed either simultaneously or,
                    perhaps, even before Hone’s publication. In any event, Cahuac was actively
                    participating in what Kipperman called the “larger and all-too-effective culture
                    of resistance” alongside such figures as Hone and Shelley.</p>
                <p> In 1819, this “culture of resistance” believed that satire was the way to reach
                    a popular audience and thereby to win popular support. Indeed, Gardner suggests
                    that “for a brief period in late 1819 Shelley made strenuous attempts … to open
                    himself to the quite different tradition embodied in the work of Hone,
                    Cruikshank, Wooler and the radical pamphleteers” (100), who exploited accessible
                    forms such as caricature, sarcasm and invective, hyperbole, sensational imagery,
                    and simple verse and rhyme schemes, all with the aim of developing a rhetoric of
                    political polarization that would alienate specific targets in power while
                    soliciting popular sympathy. It is perhaps impossible to measure the extent of
                    the political impact of these productions—Shelley’s were suppressed, copies of
                    Hone’s sold in the thousands—but what is clear is that radicals soon became
                    defensive. Cahuac, like all radical publishers in England, was on the frontline.
                    If one follows the fate of Cahuac or Dolby, Hunt’s decisions regarding
                    publishing Shelley’s works seem if nothing else to be prudent, as Gardner
                    suggests (100).</p>
                <p>The course of Thomas Dolby’s political career as a publisher and bookseller was
                    similar to Cahuac’s own, but, fortunately, unlike Cahuac, he published
                        memoirs.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> I am indebted
                        to Karen Nangle and the Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke
                        Rare Book and Manuscript Library, for scanning one of the very few known
                        copies of Dolby’s memoirs.</note> The son of a tenant farmer and
                    roof-thatcher in Huntingdonsire, Dolby left his humble origins by attaching
                    himself as a personal assistant to a retired general. He recounts in his
                    autobiography that in 1808 he quit this service and set up shop in London as a
                    seller of stationery and books. Although he had had little formal education and
                    no familial resources to help establish his business in the city, Dolby was
                    nevertheless shrewd, resourceful, and sociable. He met Leigh and John Hunt (97),
                    began to sell radical newspapers, including Cobbett’s <emph>Political
                        Register</emph>, and, as Jonathan Topham has noted, “His shop became a focus
                    for radical activity” (81). </p>
                <p>By 1817 Dolby had acquired printing presses, establishing a national distribution
                    network, and in that year, as he records in his memoirs, “we all went
                    politically mad” (108). He met Henry Orator Hunt, endorsed his reformist
                    campaign before Peterloo (where Hunt was scheduled to be the keynote speaker),
                    and participated in events at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, the political
                    meetinghouse for many of the key reformists, which was conveniently one block
                    from his shop (109; and see Topham 81-3). Moreover, he began selling radical
                    satires, namely <emph>The Pasquin</emph> and the <emph>Political
                        Dictionary</emph>, which made him both successful and infamous: “In the
                    summer of 1819, I was arrested on two informations by the Attorney General for
                    selling two numbers of Sherwin’s <emph>Register</emph>, in which some strong
                    remarks were made on the employment of the military in civil affairs, and
                    particularly on the memorable Manchester massacre” (112). Dolby was targeted and
                    prosecuted by the government for selling radical satires, and his memoirs make
                    clear that he understood the political battle in which he was deeply
                    involved:
                <quote>I wish as far as possible to avoid political remarks in this book; but I must
                    just observe, that the Sidmouth and Castlereagh administration of that day …
                    groped their way onward with daggers and dark lanthorns. One of their favorite
                    objects was the slavery of the press. They did not strike the blow boldly at
                    once; but secretly connived at and encouraged the very mischief which publicly
                    they affected to deplore, in order that under such fostering care, it might rise
                    to such a pitch as to warrant them in going the full length they wished, for the
                    enslavement of the press generally. (112-3)</quote>
                While his attorneys were successful in having the court drop the charges in 1819,
                    Dolby was the special focus of Charles Murray, an attorney representing the
                    non-governmental, arch-Tory and anti-Jacobin Constitutional Association, which
                    hunted radicals after Peterloo. News of their activities hit the papers and, in
                    an August 16, 1821 letter, Byron called them the “atrocious crew” (345). Writing
                    considerably later in the century, James Taylor comments acerbically that the
                    soon-dubbed “Bridge-Street Gang,” named after their office location, were
                    comprised of 
                <quote>… a considerable number of wealthy and influential individuals [who] formed
                    themselves into an association for “discountenancing and opposing the
                    dissemination of seditious principles,” and for “supporting the laws for
                    suppressing seditious publications, and for defending the country from the fatal
                    influence of disloyalty and sedition.” (251)</quote>
                Taylor quotes from the Association’s eponymous manifesto, before discussing its
                    inevitable decline once the public began to scrutinize its activities.
                    Nevertheless, in his memoirs, Dolby accuses Murray and his gang of colluding
                    with the courts, of sabotaging his publishing business, which ultimately went
                    bankrupt, of terrorizing his family, leading to the death of his wife, and of
                    defrauding and betraying the people of England, all for personal aggrandizement
                    and financial gain (119-49). While it is unclear the extent to which any of this
                    is true, Dolby was indeed identified on May 30, 1820, by the now-notorious Home
                    Office informant, “J.S.” (John Shegog, whose correspondences are available in
                    the Public Record Office), as an active member of the “Liberal Alliance” (of
                    which Cahuac was also an active member) determined “to carry on Sedition and
                    Treason and to oppose His Majesty, Government, + the laws of the Realm” (PRO).
                    In any case, Murray and his “junto” retreated when questions were raised about
                    the standing of the Constitutional Association to bring the actions against
                    radicals, but not before Dolby was court-ordered to desist publishing political
                    material (149).</p>
                <p>In 1820, Cahuac appeared in court again, charged with seditious libel for selling
                    Carlile’s <emph>Republican</emph>. His defense was rather disingenuous: he
                    pleaded poverty and claimed that “he had merely sold the pamphlet in question
                    without ever having read it,” and that he “sold pamphlets on all questions,
                    whether opposed to or favorable to government,” according to the report, “The
                    King v. John Cahuac,” published in <emph>The Times</emph> (2). In the end, he
                    spent one month in Horsemonger Lane, Southwark’s prison, for seditious libel.
                    Despite his superficial disavowal in court, there is no doubt that Cahuac was
                    still a committed radical. After his release, he published an open letter to
                    Lord Sidmouth, which is nothing short of a full-scale counter-attack, bearing
                    the title, <emph>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His Oppressive Arrest for the Sale
                        of an Alledged Libel</emph>. Cahuac’s self-defense in this letter is a
                    thinly veiled attack. His most immediate issue was that the constables who had
                    arrested him had carried him beyond his neighborhood and outside of London so
                    that he would not have his neighbors as his jurors. Cahuac deems this as yet
                    another instance of recent corruption and abuse of power coming out of the Home
                    Office, but the fourteen-page pamphlet does not shy away from listing others:
                    (1) Sidmouth’s “paltry warfare against newsmen and bill-stickers,” (2) the
                    crown’s “ill-judged act of thanking inhuman butchers for slaughtering their
                    neighbors” at Peterloo, (3) the on-going abuses of over-taxation, rotten
                    boroughs, and poor treasury decisions, and (4) police corruption. What Cahuac’s
                    rant lacks in focus is made up for in wit and defiant indignation. For example,
                    he begins,
                <quote>My lord, Not having the honour of your Lordship’s acquaintance, nor even a
                    knowledge of your person, it cannot be supposed a particle of enmity could in
                    any shape dictate the present Address. Your Lordship will therefore please to
                    consider me as only defending myself from the machinations of those below you,
                    without the smallest intention of giving your Lordship offence. I am, my Lord,
                    one that venerates the Office of Magistrate, even in the hands of a dolt. –But
                    oppression naturally prompts even the beasts of the field to resistance.–
                    (1)</quote>
                Cahuac then warns Sidmouth that if the government does not open itself up to
                    reform, a revolution will ensue, but he carefully tempers this in a passage
                    remarkably similar to Shelley’s post-Peterloo political philosophy. Cahuac adds
                    that the people of England “have learned philosophy from the school of
                    oppression” (10) and that “they will leave the breaking of the peace to those
                    paid to protect it” (11). When his ranting threatens to outstrip his wit, which
                    is frequent, he interjects with poignant quotes from Swift, Addison,
                    Shakespeare, and the Bible. Nevertheless, the letter remains a fiery piece: “The
                    clergy tell us,” he continues, “out of Hell there is no redemption. That I deny,
                    my lord; I have escaped the Manchester yeoman, though not your lordship’s
                    informers” (8). Of course, after this publication, he continued to be
                    watched.</p>
                <p>In 1820, radicals called for support for Queen Caroline, hoping to incite popular
                    protest against mounting repression. She had come home from Spain to assume the
                    throne next to George IV, but the new king rebuked her and sought a divorce
                    through parliament. The radicals responded, not so much for her sake, but out of
                    antipathy for the seated government and the new King. They formed the Queen’s
                    Plate Committee, of which Cahuac was a member alongside such notable figures as
                    Major Cartwright, William Hone, and Thomas Dolby (Ingelhart 72; for further
                    discussion of the Committee’s activity, see Hone 316). Public outrage, the
                    committee hoped, might rekindle reform efforts. At this point, Cahuac published
                    the third of his three significant post-Peterloo pieces, a four-page pamphlet,
                        <emph>The Queen’s Judges! Or, a Penny Peep at the Peers</emph>, with an
                    epigraph below the title that reads, “—There is nothing like / A fair, free,
                    open trial, where the King / Can choose His judges and appoint His jury.” It
                    then lists in alphabetical order three hundred and sixty-nine jury members on
                    government payroll and how much each was paid, or as Cahuac has it, “the amount
                    of corrupt Influence attached to each individual Peer from Places, Pensions,
                    &amp;c.” The brashness of this publication was so unchecked that it caught the
                    attention of several American papers covering the Caroline affair, including
                        <emph>The Plough Boy</emph> out of Albany, which described in its “Weekly
                    Summary” the pamphlet’s circulation in England as “extensive” (71).
                    Unfortunately, as John Gardner has pointed out, the Caroline affair fizzled out,
                    and the hopes of radicals and reformers were disappointed; by 1821 it was
                    apparent that both Caroline and the radicals had failed to win popular support.
                    Years later, in a thinly-veiled attempt deny the success of his enemies, Dolby
                    reflected on the failure of his satirical publications,
                <quote>… it will be said the Constitutional Association checked and put a stop to
                    licentious publications. I deny that. Causes arise, and effects follow; causes
                    cease, and effects disappear whether such societies as Mr. Murray’s exist or
                    not. Satire is torpid, unless hatched into animation by some ruling vice or
                    folly. The more vicious the cause, the more stinging the effect. In the case
                    just concluded, the Queen’s arrival and treatment excited a strong feeling
                    throughout the country. Satire was awakened into stinging activity; but the
                    public madness subsided before the poor Queen died; the rage was over, and
                    satire became torpid again. <emph>The Pasquin</emph> and the <emph>Political
                        Dictionary</emph> were too late. The rage that would have devoured them a
                    year before, had gone by. They both died of inanition. Mr. Murray stepped in too
                    late to kill them, but just in time to make them stink; which is the only
                    service such a man is fit for. (149-50)</quote>
                Dolby does not discuss the terms of his plea deal in his memoir that put an end
                    to his career as a radical publisher, and throughout he downplays his own
                    involvement in radical activities, perhaps because he published his memoirs in
                    1827, before the radicals and the reform movement recovered.</p>
                <p>Shelley’s participation in the London radicalism was indirect, and by the middle
                    of 1820, this seeps into his writings. Steven Jones has demonstrated, for
                    example, that Shelley’s fragment “Satire upon Satire,” written at some point
                    between 1820 and 1821 but not published in his lifetime, calls into question the
                    aesthetic, moral, and political merits of the genre even though it
                    simultaneously launches a satirical attack upon Southey for his political
                    apostasy. The poem is, Jones concludes, “a self-conscious exploration of rather
                    than a sententious answer to questions about form and purpose in poetry” (163).
                    This is accurate, but the poem also reveals that Shelley’s earnest convictions
                    about the political utility of satire in 1819 were supplanted by a more private,
                    skeptical, and highly ironic estimation of satire. Nowhere in this reflection on
                    satire does Shelley consider the project of inspiring solidarity, as if such an
                    aim is no longer essential to the genre nor particularly relevant. In 1823, the
                    year after Shelley drowned off the coast of Italy, Cahuac was still politically
                    active in London. In March of that year, the <emph>Black Dwarf</emph> identified
                    Cahuac, alongside Major Cartwright, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Wooler, Capt. R Williams,
                    Mr. George Rogers, and Mr. Webb, as conducting “a select meeting of friends to a
                    Constitutional Reform in the Representation of the people in Parliament,” with
                    the express purpose of producing a document that “should be submitted to the
                    consideration of the Unrepresented throughout the kingdom, a form for
                    petitioning, which, by its instructiveness in the true principles of
                    Representation, and on the undeniableness of the Right of the people
                    universally, as might aid them in their exertions for recovering those rights”
                    (“Parliamentary Reform” 426-427). Gone is the humor, the invectives, and the
                    irony, though clearly Cahuac was still invested deeply in radicalism.</p>
                <p>Cahuac was also in deep trouble. On July 16, he, along with Thomas Beeman, was
                    indicted for stealing one hundred and six printed books from the Fleet Street
                    property of one Benjamin Bensley. Cahuac was charged with receiving the stolen
                    books, while Beeman what charged with their theft. (The books in question were
                    an octavo edition of Lingard’s <emph>History of England</emph>.) At their trial
                    on September 10, both Cahuac and Beeman denied having known each other or having
                    even met before their arrest, much less conspiring together to steal the books.
                    Moreover, Cahuac claimed that he legally purchased the books from somebody else
                    but that his confinement had kept him from locating this individual. The jury
                    took less than an hour to find both guilty (<emph>Edinburgh Annual
                        Register</emph>, vol. 16). Beeman was sentenced to seven years
                    transportation, but, suspiciously, there is no record of him every being
                    transported or incarcerated. Cahuac was sentenced to fourteen years
                    transportation, and we have extensive records of his deportation.</p>
                <p>On September 21, 1823, Leigh Hunt ran an announcement of the indictment of John
                    Cahuac in the<emph> Examiner</emph>, but not a subsequent report on the trial
                    (Hunt 618). There was an account, however, in <emph>The Annual Register</emph>,
                    which reported, “an unusual number (not less than 30)” of “respectable
                    witnesses” appeared in court to testify to Cahuac’s “good character” (“Old
                    Bailey” 125). The <emph>Register</emph>’s report does not mention that Cahuac
                    was a radical publisher who had been tried at least twice previously for
                    seditious libel, nor did it mention his London Corresponding Society membership,
                    nor his association with prominent radicals such as Major Cartwright and Francis
                    Burdett, among others, nor any of his own radical productions. In fact, there
                    seems to be a deliberate circuitousness in the <emph>Register</emph>’s report
                    about Cahuac’s radicalism. From his early years as a pawnbroker’s assistant,
                    Cahuac seems to have had criminal associations, and yet there are details about
                    this trial that are suspect, and it seems likely that his heavy sentence was the
                    result of his political activities rather than his alleged criminal ones.</p>
                <p>In 1824, with two hundred other convicts, Cahuac shipped out from Portsmouth on
                    board the Phoenix II, under Captain Robert White, on a journey that took one
                    hundred and fourteen days (<emph>Founders &amp; Survivors</emph>). He was never
                    to return to England. The “Gaol Report” filed upon his arrival in Van Dieman’s
                    Land reads, “[He is] a respectable Man &amp; may be relied upon” but also that
                    he was transported for the felony: “Buying Books, knowing them to have been
                    stolen, once for publishing a blasphemous libel” (<emph>Founders &amp;
                        Survivors</emph>). The report gives us our only physical description: In his
                    mid-fifties, Cahuac was five foot three and a half, had gray hair and eyes, his
                    left hand was crippled, and he had a notable scar over his left eye
                        (<emph>Founders &amp; Survivors</emph>). On August 15 1825, less than two
                    years after he was sentenced, he was granted permission to leave Van Dieman’s
                    Land and to proceed on to Sydney. He immediately submitted a petition “for his
                    family to be sent out to the Colony at Government expense” (<emph>Colonial
                        Secretary Index</emph>), giving inexplicably “H.R.H. Princess Sophia of
                    Gloucester as his only referee in England” (Picton Phillips 227). Surprisingly,
                    this was granted five days later as was a “recommendation for a ticket of
                    leave,” essentially probation that would allow him to find employment
                        (<emph>Colonial Secretary Index</emph>). Mary arrived with their two
                    children but died two years later in 1827. There are a few records of his life
                    in Australia, but John Cahuac’s political career as an English radical had ended
                    in 1823. He died in Australia in 1832, at roughly sixty-two years old.</p>
