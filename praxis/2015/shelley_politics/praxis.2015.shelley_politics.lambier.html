               <p>Given the resurgence of interest in the relation between Shelley’s political essays
                  and poetry, what concept of relationality can be posed to move beyond an old, entrenched
                  opposition between the social commitment of prose and the abstract withdrawal of poetry
                  to theorize a novel form of “political poetics”?

                  </div> In what ways do Shelley’s reflections on the history of modern revolution inform his
                  ideas of literary experience and political subjectivity? How, moreover, does Shelley’s
                  work provoke what he describes in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1821) as “a beneficial change in opinion or institution” through aesthetic experience
                  (535), without falling prey to an escapist flight into inwardness?

                           as Norton in parenthesis.</span></div>
                  </div> Taking these questions as points of departure, this paper will locate within Shelley’s
                  work a theory of <em>aesthetic resistance</em> by reading between his historical-political reflections on the British reform movement
                  in <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em> (1819-20) and his critical aesthetics.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Shelley’s reception, from his own time to the present, testifies to a persistent vexation
               over his radical mixtures of aesthetics with politics. William Hazlitt, reviewing
               what he describes as Shelley’s “electrical experiments in morals and philosophy,”
               sketches him as a reckless contrarian “drawn up by irresistible levity to the regions
               of mere speculation and fancy,” where “[b]ubbles are to him the only realities: —touch
               them, and they vanish” (201, 200). Matthew Arnold famously describes him as “a beautiful
               and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain” (327), an ethereal
               figure that serves as an alibi for F. R. Leavis’ later complaint over Shelley’s “weak
               grasp upon the actual” (206). Though more recent criticism has rescued Shelley from
               such dismissive appraisals, critical concern over his “levity,” his immateriality
               and dreamy idealism, survives in the neglect or disavowal of his political works as
               naïve, patronizing, enthusiastic, ideological, or even dangerous. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And yet, as I will argue, Shelley’s aesthetic departures from things as they are present
                  new aesthetic formations that are subversive to established ways of experiencing the
                  world. In this sense, Shelley’s political aesthetics stages a “dissensus,” to import
                  Jacques Rancière’s term, where the prevailing form of common sense, the public sense
                  of what is shared in collective life, is disrupted through artistic practices that
                  reconfigure the “distribution of the sensible,” or partitions of sensory experience
                  that legislate what is made visible and invisible in the common world.

                           the following helpful definition for the “distribution of the sensible” in Rancière’s
                           work: ‘the implicit law governing the sensible order that parcels out places and forms
                           of participation in a common world by first establishing the modes of perception within
                           which these are inscribed. The distribution of the sensible thus produces a system
                           of self-evident facts of perception based on the set horizons and modalities of what
                           is visible and audible as well as what can be said, thought, made, or done. Strictly
                           spe…</span></div>
                  </div> I will suggest that Shelley’s “levity,” his appeal to an aesthetic dimension in politics,
                  creates new modes of experience that resist forms of inhumanity by making visible
                  the otherwise invisible wrongs suffered by groups who remain excluded from participation
                  in the public commons.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At the time Shelley is writing his essays on the reform movement, British social and
                  political life is undergoing a moral upheaval, a transvaluation of values arising,
                  at least in part, from the growing international success of the American and French
                  Declarations of universal rights. Attracted to the emancipatory potential of this
                  new genre of writing, Shelley himself drafted a <em>Declaration of Rights</em> (1812), a broadside with thirty-one enumerated articles, organized around the two
                  fundamental principles of the emerging rights tradition: “The rights of man are liberty,
                  and an equal participation of the commonage of nature” (<em>Prose</em> 56). But despite the claim of universal freedom and equality for all, one of the most
                  disquieting paradoxes of Enlightenment rights discourse lies in the limited scope
                  of its application, which excluded the equal recognition of women, slaves and free
                  blacks, the poor and unpropertied, as well as many religious groups.

                  </div> Without solid foundations in the established laws and constitutions of states, the
                  rights of man also ran the risk of becoming “metaphysic rights,” to use Edmund Burke’s
                  phrase, a situation in which there is a perceived discrepancy between the <em>a priori</em> concepts of rights and the complex realities of pragmatic politics.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In the Reflections, Edmund Burke described this clash as a process of “refractions
                           and reflections”: ‘These metaphysic rights entering into common life, like rays of
                           light which pierce into a dense medium, are, by the laws of nature, refracted from
                           that straight line. Indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and
                           concerns, the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections,
                           that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their
                           original direction. (61)’</span></div>
                  </div> What these familiar critiques misrecognize is the vital life of rights, which is activated
                  by the resistances of subjects who are denied the rights they have by virtue of their
                  common humanity. Women’s rights, though conspicuously missing in the major rights
                  declarations of 1776 and 1789, are powerfully championed in the political writings
                  of Olympe de Gouges as well as Mary Wollstonecraft, and are publicly contested in
                  the emergent genre of the Jacobin novel.

                  Spanish, and French colonial forces, eventually claiming their rights as the citizens
                  of an independent state in 1804, an historic event that foreshadowed the British abolition
                  of the African slave trade in 1807 and the subsequent emancipation of nearly eight
                  hundred thousand colonial slaves in 1833.

            <p>These transformative historical and political events taking place in England, Europe
               and America held out the possibility for what the Chorus of Spirits in the utopian
               Act IV of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> announce as “the new world of man,” an age unfolding <em>as if </em>according to a universal plan of Promethean history (V.157). In a paragraph of the
               preface to <em>Hellas</em>, originally deleted by his publishers Charles and James Ollier, Shelley takes an
               even more revolutionary position to declare that his age has embarked on a “war of
               the oppressed against the oppressor,” a struggle that will produce “a new race” intolerant
               of the excesses of Sovereigns, “those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers
               and swindlers” (<em>Norton</em> 432).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Shelley’s provocative announcement of an age of war with sovereign power marks a radical
                  shift from a thinker like Kant who, nearly forty years earlier, claimed his time to
                  be an age of Enlightenment, where the ruler keeps open, under the idea of liberal
                  toleration, a space for the development and exercise of the free use of public reason.
                  They do, however, share an aversion to the idea of forcing historical change through
                  the unnecessary use of violence, especially if there is a non-violent alternative
                  for political reform. “A revolution,” Kant argues, “may well put an end to autocratic
                  despotism and to rapacious or power-seeking oppression, but it will never produce
                  a true reform in the ways of thinking. Instead, new prejudices, like the ones they
                  replaced, will serve as a leash to control the great unthinking mass” (<em>Political </em>55). Shelley’s later political thought similarly advocates for a gradualist conception
                  of social and political reform, but he also expresses a profound sympathy for global
                  revolutionary movements, sympathy akin to Kant’s description of the spectatorial “enthusiasm”
                  arising from the French Revolution.

                           notoriously denies any notion of a constitutional “right of revolution,” claiming
                           “the people can never possess a right of coercion against the head of state, or be
                           entitled to oppose him in word or deed.” Of the English constitution, vaunted as an
                           example to the world, Kant says “we find no mention of what the people are entitled
                           to do if the monarch were to violate the contract of 1688” (Political 83). For Kant,
                           any statement within a constitution of a right of resistance would fail the test of
                           publicity, be…</span></div>
                  </div> Spectators of world historical events possess, Kant argues, a capacity for universal,
                  disinterested sympathy that reveals itself publicly as “wishful <em>participation</em> that borders closely on enthusiasm”; this affective response, provoked by the spectacle
                  of a people’s struggle for natural rights and republicanism, testifies to a “moral
                  predisposition in the human race” (<em>Conflict</em> 302). As a collective experience, the spectator’s shared feeling of enthusiasm marks
                  the revolutionary event as “a sign of history” (301), or in other words, an event
                  whose occurrence on the world stage, bursting forth as an unpredictable rupture in
                  the prevailing historical-political reality, affords an indication of humanity’s inherent
                  capacity to author its own progress.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Jean-François Lyotard’s influential reading of Kantian enthusiasm as “a modality of
                  sublime feeling” re-inscribes this form of revolutionary spectatorship within an aesthetic
                  dimension by reading political judgment as an analogue for aesthetic reflective judgment
                  (<em>Enthusiasm</em> 29).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Keeping in mind Cian Duffy’s and Peter Howell’s critique of Kantian approaches to
                           the sublime in Romantic studies, a critical look that foregrounds an alternative notion
                           of the sublime as “the site of a complex interaction between different discourses”
                           (3), my illustration of the affinity between Kant and Shelley on the sublime will
                           highlight the analogical relations between aesthetics, politics, history, and, to
                           a lesser extent, science.</span></div>
                  </div> Like the experience of the sublime in nature, where the imagination confronts instances
                  of formlessness or immensity that exceed its ability to comprehend what it has just
                  apprehended, revolutions “are formless and shapeless in the history of human nature”
                  (33). The sublime, however, occasions a second moment of recovery. Following the painful
                  experience of the imagination’s impotence, the judging subject is enlivened by the
                  pleasurable discovery of our “supersensible vocation” to strive after Ideas of reason
                  beyond the chaotic particulars of nature (Kant, <em>Critique</em> §27.141). Despite the violence and disorder of revolution, the spectator’s enthusiasm
                  reveals a collective fervor for “the Idea of the republican contract,” which offers
                  a sign, or “complex hypotyposis,” of humanity’s progress toward the better (Lyotard, <em>Enthusiasm</em> 33, 40). It is therefore not the event of the French Revolution in itself that affords
                  an indication of historical progress, just as sublime feeling is not wholly attributable
                  to the object of nature under investigation. Rather, the judging subject’s feeling
                  of pleasurable pain arises from the imagination’s struggle to present an unpresentable
                  Idea of history, such as the Idea of a republican constitution emerging from seemingly
                  lawless political rebellion. It is the task of the world spectator to bear witness
                  to political upheavals and to discern signs of the regulative Idea of purposive progress
                  underlying world history.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the opening chapter of <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em>, a text that shares Kant’s commitment to republicanism, Shelley traces what could
               be called a universal history from an <em>enthusiastic</em> point of view. Driven by the dialectical opposition between “the spirit of freedom
               and the spirit of tyranny” (214), his narrative of world historical upheavals pays
               close attention to the rebellions in England in 1688, America in 1776, and France
               in 1789, before looking forward to anticipate the wave of revolutions in the 1820s
               across Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Unlike other universal histories of the period,
               he also acknowledges the world historical significance of the slave rebellions in
               the West Indies. “Two nations of free negroes are already established,” writes Shelley,
               “one, in pernicious mockery of the usurpation over France, an empire, the other a
               republic; both animating yet terrific spectacles to those who inherit around them
               the degradation of slavery and the spirit of dominion” (214). The establishment of
               Haiti (Saint-Domingue) and Liberia—the former by revolutionary violence, the latter
               by colonial settlement—offered the world community further indications of the advance
               of human freedom, or “signs of the times” (213), even as the coherence of the Enlightenment
               narrative of “the march of progress” is disfigured by the use of violence in political
               rebellion as a means of last resort.</p>
            <p>In shifting to an aesthetic mode of representing the spectator’s sympathy for the
               actors of revolution, a form of spectatorship that takes place within what Lyotard
               calls the “the theatre hall of history” (<em>Enthusiasm</em> 29), Kant’s theorization of an aesthetic perspective <em>within</em> the political opens the possibility for a novel way to think through world historical
               change. As in William Blake’s “The Mental Traveller,” where “the Eye altering alters
               all” (62), the world spectator’s point of view and participatory mode of perceiving
               the events of history is as important as the events themselves. The aesthetic experience
               of viewing political events, “this game of great revolutions,” is transformed into
               a mode of mental drama, where the events of history are internalized and reflexively
               considered by spectators “who are not engaged in this game themselves” (Kant, <em>Conflict</em> 302). Framed as drama and viewed from a cosmopolitan point of view, the sublime image
               of revolution creates a dissension within the “hearts of all spectators” (302). The
               stirring and discordant play of the faculties is not caused by a call to participate
               directly in rebellion, nor is it provoked by widely condemned images of the abuse
               of sovereign power under the <em>ancien régime</em>, nor even by the horrific spectacle of the terror of Robespierre. What makes the
               spectator’s judgments subjectively universal and communicable, as in the case of aesthetic
               reflective judgment, is a shared common sense (<em>Critique</em> §20-22, 40), or the pleasurable accord of the imagination and understanding without
               the mediation of a concept (in the case of the beautiful), or the discordant accord
               between the imagination and reason (in the case of the sublime).</p>
            <p>In his explication of Kantian common sense, Gilles Deleuze describes the unique form
               of common sense generated by the sublime as one “engendered in dissension” (53). The
               violence done to the imagination brings to light what Kant calls a “capacity for resistance,”
               that is, our disposition to confront nature’s seemingly unsurpassable authority over
               us (<em>Critique</em> §29.144). Sublime common sense, revelatory of our shared ability to resist the given
               sensory experience of the natural order, is therefore a dissensual common sense. The
               Kantian conception of a dissensus stirring in the psychic life of the judging subject,
               an inner aesthetic experience that manifests itself in artistic practices, links onto
               Shelley’s use of imagery drawn from the natural sublime as a mode of presenting “the
               operations of the human mind” on the verge of revolt (<em>Norton</em> 207). In <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, for instance, the figure of “the sun-awakened avalanche,” accumulating “flake after
               flake, in Heaven-defying minds” (II.3.37, 39), prefigures the revolutionary overthrow
               of Jupiter’s rule by the palingenetic power of Demogorgon.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Though Shelley joins a chorus of Romantic writers who figure revolutionary upheavals
                  within the discourse of the natural sublime, his own restless experimentation with
                  literary forms presents a subversive challenge to established norms and classifications
                  of the arts, one that threatens to blur, even overturn, the carefully legislated boundaries
                  between hierarchical orders of genre. The prospect of this kind of aesthetic revolution
                  is, indeed, what triggers Hazlitt’s criticism of Shelley’s experiments: <span class="quote">‘Curiosity is the only proper category of [Shelley’s] mind, and though a man in knowledge,
                     he is a child in feeling. Hence he puts everything into a metaphysical crucible to
                     judge it himself and exhibit it to others as a subject of interesting experiment,
                     without first making it over to the ordeal of his common sense or trying it on his
                     heart. … Mr. Shelley has been accused of vanity—I think he is chargeable with extreme
                     levity; but this levity is so great that I do not believe he is sensible of its consequences.
                     He strives to overturn all established creeds and systems; but this is in him an effect
                     of constitution. He runs before the most extravagant opinions; but this is because
                     he is held back by none of the merely mechanical checks of sympathy and habit. He
                     tampers with all sorts of obnoxious subjects; but it is less because he is gratified
                     with the rankness of the taint than captivated with the intellectual phosphoric light
                     they emit. (200)’</span> Shelley, for Hazlitt, is a dangerous alchemist of Promethean proportions, not unlike
                  Dr. Frankenstein working feverishly on his sublime monster, and with potentially horrific—if
                  unintended—consequences when carried over into social and political life. Hazlitt’s
                  charge against Shelley for possessing dangerous levels of levity, as though it were
                  an inflammable gas in one of Humphrey Davy’s chemical experiments, coincides with
                  rhetorical tropes deployed to critique the idealist claims of natural rights theorists
                  at this time. In the <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> (1790), for example, Burke appeals to his reader to stand on “the firm ground of the
                  British constitution” rather than emulate “in their desperate flights the aëronauts
                  of France” (249), an analogy between the drafters of the 1789 Declaration and the
                  craze for hot-air balloon flights, beginning with the Montgolfier brothers’ first
                  manned hot-air balloon flight in France in 1783.

                  </div> Jeremy Bentham’s <em>Anarchical Fallacies,</em> too, makes light (pun intended) of natural rights as nonsensical rhetorical fictions,
                  “nonsense upon stilts,” which tends toward “a spirit of insurrection to all laws”
                  (501). This attack on the fictionality, the <em>levity</em>, of human rights discourse has a long legacy up to the present, with Alasdair MacIntyre’s
                  claim that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches
                  and in unicorns” (67). Coincidently, Joseph Montgolfier named the property that lifted
                  the balloon into the air as “levity,” a principle of flight that the young Shelley
                  uses to send copies of his <em>Declaration of Rights</em> to the disenfranchised via fire balloons. In one of his early poems, “Sonnet: To a
                  balloon, laden with Knowledge,” he deploys the balloon as a symbol of human freedom,
                  “a ray of courage to the opprest and poor,” which soon “through the tyrant’s gilded
                  domes shall roar” (<em>Norton</em> 6. 9, 11).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Unlike Burke and Bentham, who criticize what they perceive to be the anarchic and
               terroristic potential of natural rights, especially the “right of resistance,” Shelley
               sides with Richard Price in recognizing such a right as constitutionally guaranteed
               as a legacy of the English Revolution in 1688. In his famous lecture, <em>A Discourse on the Love of Country </em>(1789), the lecture that incited Burke to write his <em>Reflections</em>, Price affirms that the English people accomplished a shift in the idea of sovereign
               power from “passive obedience, nonresistance, and the divine right of kings” toward
               the multitude’s active power to choose their sovereign on the basis of consent (190).
               This idea of the people as the autonomous and primary foundation of the sovereign’s
               legitimacy, as set out by John Locke in the <em>Two Treatises on Government</em> (1689), is also the source of Price’s provocative claim that it is the people’s right
               to resist sovereign power when it is abused, and ultimately to replace the “cashiered”
               king with a new individual or mode of governance chosen by the multitude.</p>
            <p>In Shelley’s most systematic political text, <em>A Philosophical View</em>, humanity’s natural right of resistance is, as we have seen, the vital principle
               that initiates and legitimizes social and political change. The text’s condensed universal
               history traces the hopeful realization of liberty and equality, the “elementary principles”
               of rights (216), as humanity progressively activates its irrepressible capacity to
               resist oppression. Beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire, he narrates the story
               of the human will to resist as it manifests in the republics of the Italian Renaissance,
               the Reformation, the English Civil War, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment,
               up to the American and French Revolutions. Like the chained Prometheus forced to witness
               images of exploitation and repression, Shelley’s history registers each singular abuse
               of the rights of man as “rapid passing shadows, which forerun successful insurrection”
               (224). As a world spectator, he then turns an eye to liberatory movements in South
               America, China, Turkey, and India, struggles that are fueled, to a greater or lesser
               degree, by “the arts and philosophy of Europe” (226). In the theatre of his political
               thought, poets and philosophers play a crucial role as “unacknowledged legislators
               of the world” because their works circulate globally as “the contagion of good” (227,
               225), sowing seeds of rebellion. And yet, the narrative also has the opposite effect
               of turning “European art and literature” into a colonizing discourse (226), thus usurping
               indigenous histories and systems of knowledge and, in turn, transforming the unacknowledged
               legislators into prophets <em>of</em> rather than <em>against</em> empire. Human rights discourse today runs a similar risk of becoming an inhuman instrument
               of neo-colonial control and exploitation rather than a source for a more radical politics.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>However, Shelley’s critical history of the “mighty calamity of government” defies
                  any uncomplicated reinscription into a narrative of British imperialism (228), and
                  his criticisms of the British system of government are devastating, including his
                  critique of the development of the national debt, the issuing of paper money, the
                  system of landed property, and the misdistribution of parliamentary seats throughout
                  England. His description of the apparatus of the British state coincides with what
                  Rancière has called “the police,” or “the set of procedures whereby the aggregation
                  and consent of collectivities is achieved, the organization of powers, the distribution
                  of places and roles, and the systems for legitimizing this distribution” (<em>Disagreement</em> 28). Rancière’s concept of “policing,” which is usually offered as a description of
                  politics, captures the anarchic character of Shelley’s proposals to reconfigure the
                  exclusionary logic of the “police,” such as the extension of suffrage (though he retreats
                  from granting women the vote), electoral reform, the abolishment of standing armies
                  and sinecures, and the repayment of the national debt by the rich.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Though Shelley hesitates in advocating for female suffrage, he does express his sympathy
                           towards the idea of universal suffrage: “Mr. Bentham and other writers have urged
                           the admission of females to the right of suffrage; this attempt seems somewhat immature.
                           Should my opinion be the result of despondency, the writer of these pages would be
                           the last to withhold his vote from any system which might tend to an equal and full
                           development of the capacities of all living beings” (Philosophical 251).</span></div>
                  </div> He condemns the British system of elections for being chaotic, corrupt, and widely
                  recognized in the popular press as entirely dysfunctional. In his later essay <em>On the English Reform Bill</em> (1831), Hegel is similarly critical of the “bizarre and informal irregularity and
                  inequality which prevail[s] at present” (<em>Political</em> 234). After outlining the problems of rotten boroughs, the purchasing of seats, bribery,
                  and the concentration of power in the hands of a small elite, Hegel observes, “It
                  would be difficult to discover a comparable symptom of political corruption in any
                  other people” (236). The challenge, as Shelley knows well, is to convince those in
                  power, whose material interests are secured by unequal distributions and rights, to
                  recognize the necessity of reform.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As a counter to the logic of the police, Rancière reserves the term “politics” for
               changes that are antagonistic to the given order of the visible. Politics, then, refers
               to “whatever breaks with the tangible configuration whereby parties and parts or lack
               of them are defined by a supposition that, by definition, has no place in that configuration—that
               of the part of those who have no part” (<em>Disagreement</em> 29). Political activity, in other words, unsettles the hierarchical distribution
               of bodies, places, roles, occupations, and so forth, such that previously marginalized
               groups and heterogeneous parts of the social whole are made visible within the configuration
               of what is perceptible, or “the distribution of the sensible.” Rancière’s aesthetics
               of politics involves, therefore, an egalitarian reconfiguration of what is intelligible
               on the occasions where the excluded, the parts that have no part, demand equal participation
               in the common world.</p>
            <p>To make a case for those without a place or part in the political process, Shelley
               recommends gradualist interventions as a first mode of reconfiguring the distribution
               of the sensible, such as the remedies of petitions, passive resistance, agitating
               public opinion, publishing dissenting opinions, and seeking the writings of poets
               and philosophers in a proto-public intellectual capacity. “Suppose the memorials to
               be severally written by Godwin, Hazlitt, Bentham and Hunt,” writes Shelley, “they
               would be worthy of the age and of the cause” (259). If all measures fail, however,
               the people must take the gravest of actions: “The last resort of resistance is undoubtedly
               insurrection” (260). In the final unfinished, fragmentary pages of <em>A Philosophical View</em>, we encounter a radical side of Shelley’s politics. If all peaceful, nonviolent measures
               are exhausted, violent upheaval is occasionally necessary as the end game of political
               struggle. Drawing on “the most approved writers on the English constitution,” Shelley
               argues, “which has in this instance been merely a declaration of the superior decisions
               of eternal justice, we possess a right of resistance” (260). What he is referring
               to is the contested declaration of the 1689 Bill of Rights, which includes a provision
               for Protestants to bear arms in self-defense, a provision that William Blackstone
               later interprets as “a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right
               of resistance and self-preservation when the sanctions of society and laws are found
               insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression” (143). After witnessing the bloody
               reprisals of counterrevolutionary measures on behalf of the state toward collective
               demonstration and peaceful protest, notably in the case of the Peterloo Massacre of
               16 August 1819, Shelley mines juridical-historical precedent to bolster his case for
               the multitude’s right to rebel.</p>
            <p>Shelley looks back to the English Revolutionary period as a source of inspiration
               not only in law and politics, but also in philosophy, poetry, and literature. Just
               before writing <em>A Philosophical View</em>, he began composing <em>Charles the First</em> (1818)<em>,</em> which would have translated the revolutionary politics of the English Civil War into
               dramatic form. The events that led to the execution of a king and the “temporary abolition
               of aristocracy and episcopacy” were, for Shelley, a “mighty example” to the world
               of a people’s capacity for “bringing to justice one of the chiefs of a conspiracy
               of privileged murderers and robbers whose impunity had been the consecration of crime”
               (<em>Philosophical </em>213). What makes this departure from the existing police order possible is the “exertion
               of the energies of intellectual power” on behalf of the poets and philosophers reflecting
               the “spirit of their age,” particularly Shakespeare and Lord Bacon, those unacknowledged
               legislators of a new mode of the perceptible (213, 227). Works of literature have
               the enduring value of opening up new horizons of possibility that have yet to be activated
               beyond the current social order; they disclose an aesthetic dimension of politics
               where the prevailing common sense, shared by all, confronts alterative sensible configurations
               of common life.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The theory of aesthetic experience outlined in <em>A Defence</em>, as Robert Kaufman observes, is “quite similar to the one that Kant offers in the
                  Third Critique’s Analytic of the Beautiful,” though with Shelley’s “self-conscious
                  usage of a revolutionary vocabulary” (709). And akin to the Kantian doctrine of the
                  faculties, Shelley divides the human mind into a faculty psychology, namely, the analytic
                  power of reason and the synthetic power of imagination: reason legislates the logical,
                  associational relations of distinct thoughts and quantities, while the imagination
                  is the mind’s transformative, creative capacity to act upon primary elements of psychic
                  life to forge new relations and forms. The imagination’s most privileged form of creation
                  is poetry. In the process of outlining the relation between poetry and life, aesthetics
                  and politics, Shelley offers a further distinction between a “restricted” and “unrestricted”
                  idea of poetry: while the former refers to productions of the imagination in “metrical
                  language” (<em>Norton</em> 513), or individuated works, the latter refers to the activation of the human imagination
                  in the form of a creative “poetical faculty” possessed by all with varying degrees
                  of potency (531). The poetical faculty, in turn, is responsible for a two-fold process
                  of first creating “new materials of knowledge, and power and pleasure,” and then formally
                  ordering the new content “according to a certain rhythm and order which may be called
                  the beautiful and the good” (531). Within the context of Shelley’s universal history,
                  the restricted sense of poetry takes shape as the “great poem,” to which each individual
                  poet contributes a verse (522); by contrast, the unrestricted poetry of the world
                  has produced the various artistic disciplines as well as laws, civil societies, and
                  religions. The poet of politics, therefore, “discovers those laws according to which
                  things ought to be ordered” (513), and translates these laws into new practices of
                  writing, like the modern genre of rights declarations sparked by the age of revolution.
                  The original drafter of the American Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson,
                  affords an exemplary case of a poet of laws and constitutions whose revolutionary
                  influence was felt on the authors of the French Declaration.

                           of revision and attention to detail stands at odds with Shelley’s remark that it is
                           an “error to assert that the finest passages of poetry are produced by labour and
                           study” (Norton 531).</span></div>
                  </div> This is not, however, to diminish the social importance of poetic works in favour
                  of utilitarian forms of knowledge, as Thomas Love Peacock proposes in <em>The Four Ages of Poetry </em>(1820). Shelley’s theory of poetry situates poetic thinking as a universally shared
                  capacity in all subjects, a poetic common sense, though one that wanes as corruption
                  reigns and language ossifies. During “periods of the decay of social life,” the task
                  of the poet, in the restricted sense, is to spark the imagination by stirring the
                  poetic faculty, “the faculty which contains within itself the seeds at once of its
                  own and of social renovation” (520, 522). Where the calculating principle of instrumental
                  reason deadens language, the practice and reception of poetry resuscitates the moral
                  imagination.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But how, then, does poetry excite an aesthetic of resistance, the catalyst of aesthetic
                  revolution? Like the Kantian conception of aesthetic common sense, in which one “reflects
                  on his own judgment from a universal standpoint” (<em>Critique</em> §40.175), the Shelleyan poetic faculty is the point of genesis for an enlarged mentality,
                  both for the poet and his audience. Shelley’s theory of history, however, grants the
                  poet a more genetic role to play in the production of common sense; he describes how
                  poets at an early moment in human history apprehend an enduring “rhythm and order”
                  between “existence and perception,” and then invent forms of language and representation
                  to link “perception and expression” (<em>Norton</em> 512). Over successive epochs, the narrative traces how poets have been agents of social
                  transformation, preventing the decay of language and defamiliarizing habitual modes
                  of perceiving the familiar world. Because the imagination is the creative power that
                  organizes and combines the basic elements of social life according to the mind’s laws
                  (“equality, diversity, unity, contrast, mutual dependence” [511]), and because the
                  poet possesses the most potent poetic faculty, poets have the imaginative power to
                  make new sense of the world, to redistribute the sensible. Poetry acts upon the reader
                  by making the mind “the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought”
                  (517); the superior faculties are therefore not only <em>enlarged</em> by the sheer mass of the novel content but also <em>awakened</em> by the new formal relations that link familiar thoughts in unfamiliar ways. The enlarged
                  mentality is a condition of possibility for the good because the viewer participates
                  in a virtual form of “the common universe of which we are portions and percipients,”
                  a common experience that allows one to “put himself in the place of another and of
                  many others” (517). Poetry’s relation to morality does not reside in its doctrines—“Didactic
                  poetry is my abhorrence,” Shelley writes in the Preface to <em>Prometheus</em>—but rather in its ability to expand the imagination beyond “the principle of self”
                  in sympathetic identification with others (209, 531). Moreover, poetic experience
                  opens up gaps within the perceptible, what Shelley calls “new intervals and interstices”
                  (517), disjunctions that reveal an aesthetic dimension within the operations of psychic
                  life and the perception of the world. The gaps that emerge in aesthetic experience
                  afford opportunities for departure from things as they are, and poetry generates a
                  “being within our being,” an <em>epipsyche</em>, which “defeats the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding
                  impressions” (533). This disjunction creates “dissensus,” to use Rancière’s term,
                  “a conflict between <em>sense</em> and <em>sense</em>,” that is, “between a sensory presentation and a way of making sense of it, or between
                  several sensory regimes and/or ‘bodies’” (<em>Dissensus</em> 139).

                           of dissensus in art: ‘Dissensus is a conflict between sensory presentation and a way
                           of making sense of it, or between sensory regimes and / or ‘bodies’. This is the way
                           in which dissensus can be said to reside at the heart of politics, since at bottom
                           the latter itself consists in an activity that redraws the frame within which common
                           objects are determined. Politics breaks with the sensory self-evidence of the ‘natural’
                           order that destines specific individuals and groups to occupy positions of rule or
                           of being …</span></div>

                  a defamiliarizing refusal of the actual, of pernicious habits and customs that have
                  insinuated themselves into a normative idea of human nature. Such moments of <em>epipsychic dissensus, </em>or subversions of common sense perception, reappear as an ongoing strategy in Shelley’s

                           long ago identified this movement as “the psyche-epipsyche strategy.” Baker describes
                           this term as follows: “To put the matter in Shelleyan terms, the mind (psyche) imaginatively
                           creates or envisions what it does not have (epipsyche), and then seeks to possess
                           epipsyche, to move towards it as a goal. Therefore the psyche-epipsyche strategy in
                           a nutshell is the evolution by the mind of an ideal pattern towards which it then
                           aspires” (Major Poetry 53).</span></div>
                  </div> He begins to flesh out his concept of the epipsyche, or “little soul,” in his short
                  essay “On Love,” where he describes it as “a miniature as it were of our entire self,
                  yet deprived of all that we condemn or despise, the ideal prototype of every thing
                  excellent or lovely that we are capable of conceiving as belonging to the nature of
                  man” (<em>Norton</em> 504). As an animating principle within our psychic life, “a soul within our soul,”
                  we strive to realize its material embodiment, or “antitype,” within the sensible world
                  (504). It might seem odd to extract a radical politics from Shelley’s reflections
                  on love, perhaps a moment of levity, but love’s sympathetic movement beyond the self
                  serves as an activating principle in several of Shelley’s lyrical experiments, such
                  as <em>Alastor</em>, <em>Epipsychidion</em>, and <em>Adonais</em>. In the short time that remains, however, I will briefly highlight a unique example
                  in which the epipsyche is turned on its head and the necessity of <em>eros</em> is intertwined with <em>thanatos</em>, that is, the scene of resistance between Prometheus and Jupiter’s Phantasm in the
                  opening act of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The drama opens with the tortured, enchained Prometheus declaring, after “three thousand
               years of sleep-unsheltered hours” under Jupiter’s oppressive reign (I.12), that his
               blind hatred has ultimately resolved into pity for the “cruel King” (I.50), whose
               fateful fall will soon come to pass according to Demogorgon’s “mighty law” of Necessity
               (II.2.43). On the verge of mental revolution, Prometheus appeals to the Earth and
               her constituent parts (mountains, springs, air, and whirlwinds) to reiterate the forgotten
               curse he placed upon Jupiter long ago; what comes back from the world is the “sound
               of voices—not the voice / Which I gave forth” (I.112-13) and an “awful whisper” (I.132).
               The voices of the world are sensory but without standing in the symbolic order. The
               Titan senses a whisper “scarce like sound” (I.133); it “tingles through the frame
               / As lightning tingles, hovering ere it strike” (I.133-34). The voices of the Earth
               and her parts are felt as powerful sensory signals but without linguistic communication.
               Each exchange reveals Prometheus’ loss of the right to engage in a community of speakers,
               a capacity Lyotard supposes to be “perhaps the most fundamental human right” (“Other’s
               Rights” 141). Under the regime of Jupiter, the tyrant over “living things” (I.3),
               the Earth and the other elements of nature speak “the language of the dead” (I.138),
               an underground discourse of resistance unknown to the immortal Prometheus and his
               oppressor. To speak in the language of the living is to run the risk of Jupiter’s
               torture on “some wheel of pain” (I.141). The loss of an interlocutory community is
               not immediately apparent, however, because the “Daedal harmony” (IV.416) of the drama’s
               language produces the illusion of transparent dialogue, which, in turn, playfully
               mirrors and critiques the sinister way in which oppressive power generates a state
               of enforced consensus that masks the voices of those who remain excluded. Without
               the means to recall or present the curse he uttered to Jupiter, and without the capacity
               to understand the language of the witnesses, Prometheus finds himself the victim of
               what Lyotard calls a “differend,” that is, a situation in which “something ‘asks’
               to be put into phrases, and suffers from the wrong of not being able to be put into
               phrases right away” (<em>Differend</em> 13). How can Prometheus work through his own psychic resistance to summon up the
               curse, without the testimony of Earth and her muted elements?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Though we possess only fragments of Aeschylus’ lost play, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, many classical scholars agree that Earth, or Gaia, is a mediating figure that reconciles
                  Prometheus with Zeus by revealing the Titan’s secret knowledge of the danger that
                  will come if the tyrant produces a child with Thetis.

                           trilogy, D.J. Conacher suggests that it is “reasonable to guess (as many commentators
                           have done) that Gaia is in some way an intermediary between the two antagonists in
                           the revelation of Prometheus’ secret to Zeus” (Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound 112).</span></div>
                  </div> Shelley’s Earth, however, resists her own interpellation into Jupiter’s state of consensus.
                  Her task, to use Lyotard’s language, is “to bear witness to the differends by finding
                  idioms for them” (13), a task that will help Prometheus to recollect and eventually
                  revoke the misbegotten curse. To bridge the chasm between the “two worlds of life
                  and death” (I.195), Earth proposes an alternative route that would intertwine both
                  worlds by having a phantasm from the dead utter the curse in the language of the living.
                  Rather than hear the curse from his own image, Prometheus opts for the specter of
                  the reigning sovereign power. The invocation of Jupiter’s Phantasm stages a scene
                  of dissensus between two seemingly incommensurable worlds, which not only facilitates
                  Prometheus’ process of working through the repressed curse, but also bridges the domains
                  of actuality and potentiality. Jupiter’s Phantasm is a kind of inverted epipsyche
                  in that it affords Prometheus the opportunity to witness his disavowed sense of revenge
                  and “calm hate” in a virtual, uncanny double of himself as tyrant (I.259), a transformative
                  experience that precipitates his repentance and ultimate retraction of the curse.
                  Prometheus’ experience of the phantasm is therefore not unlike the temporal sequence
                  of sublime spectatorship: the feeling of misery and pain that accompanies his inability
                  to present a seemingly ineffable event gives way to the pleasure of atonement that
                  accompanies the reiteration and remorseful repeal of his words. This reading of the
                  Phantasm also foregrounds the active role of Earth in refashioning the world; having
                  created a breach in the sensible domain, she emerges as a revolutionary subject on
                  behalf of her muted constituent parts—the parts of the world that have no part in
                  Jupiter’s regime. Earth, in this sense, bears witness to an impassable differend and
                  then generates novel passageways between existence and perception, then perception
                  and expression, subversively restoring Prometheus’ right to speak to others. His monologic,
                  lyric <em>I</em> becomes a dialogic, dramatic <em>we</em>.

                           events. But lyric, as a purely subjective form, is marked by the exclusion of the

                  </div> Shelley’s imaginative departures from generic models is matched by a radical innovation
                  at the level of the narrative: instead of reconciling “the Champion with the Oppressor
                  of mankind,” Prometheus emerges as a revolutionary figure who embodies “the highest
                  perfection of moral and intellectual nature,” qualities that give the Titan’s patient
                  defiance a sense of justice that is missing in the rebelliousness of Milton’s Satan
                  (206-7). The image of Prometheus’ near-solipsistic solitude, not unlike Hegel’s description
                  of the lyric subject as “an enclosed inner world” (<em>Aesthetics</em> 1115), is interrupted by the drama’s dialogic interaction with the world at large,
                  which stages a scene of dissension that forges an alternative community of speakers
                  and activates a new form of revolutionary subjectivity. But what ultimately makes
                  this possible is the return of a repressed primordial power of resistance that emerges
                  from the disjointure between the world of the living and the dead, that is, the overpowering
                  force of Demogorgon. Just as tyrants rarely “leave a path to freedom but through their
                  own blood” (<em>Philosophical</em> 213), Jupiter’s reign only comes to an end after a swift, decisive struggle with his
                  more powerful offspring. Demogorgon’s defeat of Jupiter is the originary violence
                  that founds the new Promethean age of humanity through “Destruction’s strength” (IV.564),
                  a death drive that retreats from history until it is recalled once again, as a last
                  resort, “To defy Power which seems Omnipotent” (IV.572). The disappearance of Demogorgon
                  from the world at the end of Shelley’s lyrical drama mirrors, in an uncanny way, the
                  withdrawal of the “right of resistance” after its revolutionary enactment in the Declarations
                  of 1776 and 1789, serving only as a supplementary right in the French Declaration
                  of 1793. Even in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the right to resist
                  is only mentioned in the opening Preamble as an endgame to be avoided by granting
                  universal rights to all peoples. And yet, as Shelley’s aesthetics of resistance brings
                  to light, the capacity to resist is as irrepressible as the capacity for poetry: they
                  are life and death instincts in humanity’s unsurpassable struggle to recreate the
                  world.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>The Politics of Aesthetics</em>, the translator and editor Gabriel Rockhill proposes the following helpful definition
               for the “distribution of the sensible” in Rancière’s work: <span class="quote">‘the implicit law governing the sensible order that parcels out places and forms of
                  participation in a common world by first establishing the modes of perception within
                  which these are inscribed. The distribution of the sensible thus produces a system
                  of self-evident facts of perception based on the set horizons and modalities of what
                  is visible and audible as well as what can be said, thought, made, or done. Strictly
                  speaking, ‘distribution’ therefore refers both to forms of inclusion and to forms
                  of exclusion. (85)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

                  into a dense medium, are, by the laws of nature, refracted from that straight line.
                  Indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns, the primitive
                  rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes
                  absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Despite his well-documented enthusiasm for the American and French Revolutions, Kant
               notoriously denies any notion of a constitutional “right of revolution,” claiming
               “the people can never possess a right of coercion against the head of state, or be
               entitled to oppose him in word or deed.” Of the English constitution, vaunted as an
               example to the world, Kant says “we find no mention of what the people are entitled
               to do if the monarch were to violate the contract of 1688” (<em>Political </em>83). For Kant, any statement within a constitution of a right of resistance would
               fail the test of publicity, because it must then declare the remedies and powers responsible
               for keeping the sovereign within the bounds of the contract, a remedy that would in
               fact create another sovereign, or even a third to judge which sovereign power was
               in the right.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Keeping in mind Cian Duffy’s and Peter Howell’s critique of Kantian approaches to
               the sublime in Romantic studies, a critical look that foregrounds an alternative notion
               of the sublime as “the site of a complex interaction between different discourses”
               (3), my illustration of the affinity between Kant and Shelley on the sublime will
               highlight the analogical relations between aesthetics, politics, history, and, to
               a lesser extent, science.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Though Shelley hesitates in advocating for female suffrage, he does express his sympathy
               towards the idea of universal suffrage: “Mr. Bentham and other writers have urged
               the admission of females to the right of suffrage; this attempt seems somewhat immature.
               Should my opinion be the result of despondency, the writer of these pages would be
               the last to withhold his vote from any system which might tend to an equal and full
               development of the capacities of all living beings” (<em>Philosophical </em>251).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Lynn Hunt reports that Jefferson’s original draft went through “eighty-six alterations
               made by himself, the Committee of Five, or Congress” (18). This painstaking level
               of revision and attention to detail stands at odds with Shelley’s remark that it is
               an “error to assert that the finest passages of poetry are produced by labour and
               study” (<em>Norton</em> 531).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">In his essay, “The Paradoxes of Political Art,” Rancière offers a helpful outline
               of dissensus in art: <span class="quote">‘Dissensus is a conflict between sensory presentation and a way of making sense of
                  it, or between sensory regimes and / or ‘bodies’. This is the way in which dissensus
                  can be said to reside at the heart of politics, since at bottom the latter itself
                  consists in an activity that redraws the frame within which common objects are determined.
                  Politics breaks with the sensory self-evidence of the ‘natural’ order that destines
                  specific individuals and groups to occupy positions of rule or of being ruled, assigning
                  them to private or public lives, pinning them down to a certain time and space, to
                  specific ‘bodies’, that is to specific ways of being, seeing, and saying. (<em>Dissensus</em> 139)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Observing Shelley’s prevalent use of the concept of the “epipsyche,” Carlos Baker
               long ago identified this movement as “the psyche-epipsyche strategy.” Baker describes
               this term as follows: “To put the matter in Shelleyan terms, the mind (psyche) imaginatively
               creates or envisions what it does not have (epipsyche), and then seeks to possess
               epipsyche, to move towards it as a goal. Therefore the psyche-epipsyche strategy in
               a nutshell is the evolution by the mind of an ideal pattern towards which it then
               aspires” (<em>Major Poetry</em> 53).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">In his reconstruction of the possible narrative development of Aeschylus’ Promethean
               trilogy, D.J. Conacher suggests that it is “reasonable to guess (as many commentators
               have done) that Gaia is in some way an intermediary between the two antagonists in
               the revelation of Prometheus’ secret to Zeus” (<em>Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound</em> 112).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">For this insight, I owe a debt of gratitude to Tilottama Rajan’s essay, “Romanticism
               and the Death of Lyric Consciousness,” in which she argues that the lyric <em>cogito</em> is always already displaced by its inalienable difference: “My argument is that pure
               lyric is a monological form, where narrative and drama alike are set in the space
               of difference. The latter present the self in interaction with other characters and
               events. But lyric, as a purely subjective form, is marked by the exclusion of the
               other through which we become aware of the difference of the self from itself” (196).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">In his essay “Lyrical Drama: <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and <em>Hellas,</em>” Stuart Curran characterizes Shelley’s challenge as an “assault” on generic divisions:
               “’Lyric drama’, like the similar designation of the previous generation, ‘lyrical
               ballad’, is, instead, a deliberate assault on the integrity of the tripartite generic
               division—epic, drama, lyric—inherited from Aristotle and Horace and reinforced throughout
               the eighteenth century by major arbiters of neoclassical criticism” (290). The recalibration
               of generic structures through the poetic experiment of the lyrical drama brings to
               light Shelley’s revolutionary politics of aesthetics at the level of form.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
