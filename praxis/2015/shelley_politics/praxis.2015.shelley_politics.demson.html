               <h1><span class="head">Remembering John Cahuac: Post-Peterloo Repression and the Fate of Radical-Romantic
                     Satire </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Donald Read, a Peterloo historian, has observed that the 1819 massacre of political
               reformers by local yeomanry in Manchester’s St. Peter’s Field “had its influence in
               the realm of the arts” and that it “inspired” Percy Shelley as well as “many contemporary
               prints” (208). Indeed, Peterloo provided a lasting image of political tyranny: mounted
               and uniformed riders slashing gratuitously with sabers through a panicked crowd. Moreover,
               as James Chandler has aptly expressed, “the more one reads in public or private commentary
               by intellectuals across the political spectrum of England in 1819, the more one sees
               of revolutionary hopes and fears” (21). And yet, while both Read’s and Chandler’s
               observations are correct, both are optimistic, strictly speaking. Peterloo also, and
               more significantly, inspired intense political and cultural repression. E. P. Thompson
               somewhat wryly refers to the 1820s as “the quiet years” of radical culture (171):
               despite the occasional outbursts by defiant publishers such as Richard Carlile, editor
               of <em>The Republican</em>, or Thomas Wooler, editor of the <em>Black Dwarf</em>, English radicalism—where it survived—was forced underground (711-23). In his recent
               discussion of censorship in the eighteenth century, Richard Darnton has argued that
               “state intervention in the literary realm went far beyond the blue-penciling of texts.
               It extended to the shaping of literature itself as a force at work throughout the
               social order” (20). This was true in Peterloo-era England as well. Far from refined
               in its methods, the Liverpool government was belligerent in its response to the mounting
               propaganda war over public sympathy (Hilton 252-3; Gash 87-90). While Parliament wielded
               “the hugely blunt instrument of suspending civil liberties,” the Home Office “made
               furious efforts to mobilize a loyal press as a counterweight to the rash of seditious
               publications” (Hilton 607; 252). Moreover, Lord Sidmouth spent “a good deal of public
               money” on domestic spies and informants to thwart those “disaffected demagogues” who
               sought to “harness social discontent” for the agenda of a national revolution (Gash
               87-90). It is more accurate to say, then, that post-Peterloo repression, more than
               the event that prompted it, had a profound and enduring influence on English literature
               and culture. Intense repression not only arrested public responses to Peterloo in
               the 1820s, but also profoundly affected literary sensibilities in the late Romantic
               period, not to mention subsequent historical accounts of the submerged radical culture
               of the 1820s. The impact of post-Peterloo hegemony is epitomized by the history of
               John Cahuac, a radical London publisher in 1819, who was effectively silenced and
               removed from any political discourse, and the fate of his satirical writings, almost
               entirely forgotten today, confirms the power of the state to affect both contemporary
               literary sensibilities and future literary history.</p>
            <p>If the massacre itself provoked a flurry of indignant responses in 1819 and early
               1820 from liberal communities, including Shelley’s now widely-celebrated lyrical satire,
               <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>, the consequences of the ensuing repression were more far-reaching. The government
               systematically prosecuted and imprisoned radical agitators, shut down newspapers and
               booksellers, ended popular protests and large meetings, silenced authors or otherwise
               encouraged them to turn away from popular politics, and broke apart liberal political
               associations. Moreover, as the legal historian Michael Lobban has documented, the
               government worked rapidly after Peterloo to redefine radical activity as criminal
               activity: if “seditious libel” had been the prosecutorial weapon of choice before
               Peterloo, the Peterloo trials provided case law that would establish “the doctrine
               of unlawful assembly,” which provided terms such as “breach of the peace, obstruction
               and nuisance” that could be used by authorities as “a lever with which to control
               dissent” (352). Indeed, radicalism after Peterloo, John Gardner argues, was largely
               “defeated, by a government that deployed against it, methods that, though they may
               be morally reprehensible, were both innovative and effective” (220). Prosecution devastated
               the aspirations of reformers by reasserting the state’s authority to define the agenda
               of public discourse. This left many of the radicals isolated, dejected, and alienated,
               including many of the Romantics who had radical sympathies, Shelley among them. As
               a result, Paul Foot remarks, “many disillusioned revolutionaries … settled for what
               [was] ‘immediately practicable’ and drifted gently to the right” (224). In short,
               imminent political persecution had a coercive influence on the literature of the 1820s,
               most clearly evident in a growing disillusionment with satire by the midpoint of the
               decade.</p>
            <p>The disillusionment with satire was a broad trend, but specific examples are plentiful.
               Iain McCalman has observed that Carlile, himself no stranger to hyperbole and sarcasm,
               surprisingly “blamed fellow radical pressmen … because their propaganda had taken
               trivial forms” when forced to temporarily shut down <em>The Republican</em> at the end of 1820, a little over a year after Peterloo (175). McCalman paraphrases
               Carlile’s complaint: “squibs and pasquinades could amuse and annoy but not influence
               serious political change” (175). Similarly, Shelley’s series of responses to Peterloo
               until his drowning in 1822 reveal a fall in his estimation of the political efficacy
               and literary merits of satire—from his acerbic and combative “England in 1819” to
               his more measured and earnest <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em>, and finally to his late and all-but-disengaged political fragments. In his late
               fragment, “Satire upon Satire,” for example, he regrets the violence of the genre:
               “Tis not worth while” to compose and publish satires because “harsh words beget hard
               thoughts” (ll. 44-6; see Jones, “Shelley’s Fragment…”). Beleaguered by the government’s
               campaign of repression, Carlile and Shelley, to mention only two examples, came to
               recognize the shortcomings of satire to prompt any real reform.</p>
            <p>The link between the government’s campaign of repression and a popular dissatisfaction
               with satire has not been evident to all. For example, in his survey of satire from
               1789 to 1832, Gary Dyer documents how “satire largely disappeared as a distinct literary
               form” (139) in the 1820s, and he attributes this disappearance to the rise of a middle-class;
               to the death of Byron, which made satire “passé;” and to marketplace trends: “publishers
               needed the reliable profits fiction provided” (139). When citing statistics that reveal
               a yearly decline in the sales of verse satire, he notes 1820 as an aberration and
               acknowledges the flurry of radical publications that year, but he does not explore
               the possibility that the subsequent decline of satire was precipitated by the government’s
               counter-attacks against radical publications (140-143). Nonetheless, the repression
               was real, and the government’s multifaceted campaign has been documented (for an initial
               overview, see Thompson 711-23). “In the same month that Carlile denigrated satirical
               radical literature,” McCalman notes, “[Lord] Sidmouth [Secretary of the Home Office]
               and his officials were racking their brains for ways to counteract the ‘deadly weapon’
               of popular caricature” because “George and his government were remarkably sensitive
               to popular ridicule and caricature” (176), and through persistent prosecutions, they
               were largely successful. Indeed, Marcus Wood concludes his study of radical satire
               of the Romantic era in 1822 when satirical writing largely disappears. </p>
            <p>Chandler, in his study of English literature of 1819, summarizes succinctly that “the
               growing agitation all came to an abrupt halt” owing to <span class="quote">‘the combined effect of arrests of key leaders (Henry Hunt, Major Cartwright, Francis
                  Burdett, Richard Carlile, Sir Charles Wolseley), government countermeasures (the Gag
                  Acts, passed on December 30, 1819), and desperate radical plots (The Cato Street Conspiracy,
                  discovered on February 23, 1820). (22)’</span> Of course, post-Peterloo repression did not crush radicalism entirely, but the success
               of attempts to crush satire can be estimated on an immediate level by the slump in
               bookshop sales after 1820, which Dyer documents, and, taking a broader view, by how
               successfully government repression ultimately concealed its own efforts. That authors
               such as Carlile and Shelley turned on the genre of satire suggests their sense of
               powerlessness in the face of the government counter-measures and unwillingness for
               one reason or another to address them directly. Regardless, those who were engaged
               in more immediate prosecutions, such as Thomas Dolby and John Cahuac, reveal more
               about the government’s actions than those who avoided such engagements.</p>
            <p>To argue that Shelley grew disillusioned with satire is not to argue that Shelley’s
               radical convictions wavered after Peterloo, or that he was a fair-weather radical,
               as he famously accused both William Wordsworth and Robert Southey of being. In fact,
               there have been a number of Shelley scholars, including Michael Scrivener, Steven
               E. Jones, Mark Kipperman, and John Gardner, who have researched post-Peterloo repression
               and who have reconstructed from Shelley’s diverse writings a coherent logic to his
               political convictions, thus demonstrating his steady commitment. These scholars have
               offered compelling apologies that valorize his developing responses to the government’s
               campaign. Kipperman, for example, has sought to counter critiques of Shelley’s “aristocratic
               exile” in Italy and the assumption that his work had little impact because Leigh Hunt
               suppressed much of it for over a decade (1). To this end, Kipperman distinguishes
               the political “import” from the “impact” of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>; that is, he distinguishes its immediate engagement with and influence upon its contemporary
               political moment from its “total historical and social situation” within “a larger
               and all-too-effective culture of resistance” (3). This allows Kipperman to argue the
               significance of Shelley’s participation in radical culture, regardless of whether
               or not his productions were published. In other words, even if Shelley were aware
               of the possibility that his writings would be withheld from popular circulation, his
               continued involvement lent weight to the reform movement when it was forced underground.
               Moreover, Kipperman continues, <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> has “a moving target” (4): the identified targets of the satirical humor, Lord Castlereagh,
               Lord Eldon, and King George IV, should be read merely as incidental metaphors of tyranny
               and corruption. If readers abstract from the specificity of political allusions, a
               move that would be obvious to sympathetic readers in other political contexts, the
               proto-Marxist rhetoric and visionary utopianism of the poem become only more apparent.
               In this way, satirical humor may once again prove to be a potent means to bring about
               an awakening of class consciousness. If Chandler sets himself the task of examining
               “the historical situation of the texts of England in 1819 and … the hermeneutic conceptualization
               of this very work of historically situating texts” (38), Kipperman pushes aside this
               methodological concern and attempts to free Shelley’s satires from the critical tendency
               to static historical determination altogether. Simply put, rather than attempt to
               historicize it, Kipperman urges readers to follow <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> as it reconfigures across historical contexts. It is a compelling argument, especially
               when one considers the enduring popularity of Shelley’s visionary writings in unions
               and working-class associations over the next one hundred and fifty years.</p>
            <p>In any event, despite his political convictions, Shelley’s faith in political satire
               was not unwavering in the final years of his life, and it is my aim to continue the
               dialectical history, already begun by Scrivener, McCalman, and Jones, that follows
               the evolving poetics of satire in the late Romantic period at a time when efforts
               to suppress radical satire were mounting. Jones, whose central argument about Shelley
               in <em>Satire and Romanticism</em> is that his “radical-reformist satire was a central part of his <em>oeuvre</em>” (108), compares Shelley’s 1819-1820 writings to those of Thomas Wooler, editor of
               the <em>Black Dwarf</em> (108). Through this comparison, Jones reveals not only how Shelley deployed “a public
               discourse that subsumed canonical and subcanonical works alike,” but also and more
               importantly, that the satirical mode was the essential link between radicalism and
               Romanticism (104). It is my contention that while satire did indeed serve as this
               link between the poetic and the political, the link was not long lasting. “In late
               1824,” as Neil Fraistat has observed, “England’s poet laureate, Robert Southey, publicly
               derided the second bookshop of the radical William Benbow, the Byron’s Head, as ‘one
               of those preparatory schools for the brothel and gallows; where obscenity, sedition,
               and blasphemy are retailed in drams for the vulgar’” (409). If Southey was particularly
               outspoken in this regard, most of the Romantics turned against popular political satire
               after Peterloo.</p>
            <p>Indeed, by the mid-1820s, most Romantics disassociated themselves from satire, often
               but not necessarily as a retreat from the politics of reform. In short, if it had
               been cutting-edge in the late 1810s, satire ceased to be fashionable by the mid-1820s.
               This turn on satire had a legacy that extended well beyond the Romantic period; without
               identifying post-Peterloo repression, Marilyn Butler notes that “With the passing
               of time, critics seem to have become less rather than more aware of the satirical
               and intellectualist strain in Romantic writing” (224). It has only been in the last
               few decades that critics such as Butler, Haywood, Jones, and Wood have questioned
               the neglect of satire of the Romantic era, a neglect I contend that was initially
               prompted by political necessity.</p>
            <p>To appreciate how precipitous the fall was after Peterloo, it is crucial to understand
               that in the years leading up to Peterloo, radicals and Romantics alike celebrated
               satire as both the pinnacle of wit and a practical tool for advancing their various
               political agendas. Satire of the period expressed an earnest conviction that it could
               identify corruption, exhibit popular interests, redirect popular sympathies and loyalties,
               alienate political opponents as agents of tyranny, and, ultimately, inspire the solidarity
               necessary to push through political reform. This was the agenda of all satirical productions
               of the period. Kyle Grimes has described the combative radical humor of the period
               as a “verbal jujitsu,” which sought “to expose, disarm, and ridicule … pretensions
               to authority” (182), but ultimately, its aim was to inspire political solidarity among
               reformers. The refrain that concludes <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> epitomizes this aspiration:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the years subsequent to Peterloo, satirists retreated or were routed. “Why crush
                  a starving bookseller?,” Shelley furiously wrote about government repression to Hunt
                  on November 3, a few months after Peterloo, because in doing so, “tyrants … strike
                  in his person at all of their political enemies” and “divert the attention of the
                  people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive Government…” (72-3). As was frequently
                  the case, Shelley’s political commentary was astute. Publishers, including Richard
                  Carlile, Thomas Wooler, William Hone, Thomas Dolby, and Leigh Hunt, were prosecuted
                  in high-profile cases, and many were incarcerated, impressing on all the government’s
                  determination to, in Shelley’s word, “crush” radicalism. One casualty of this repression
                  was John Cahuac, one of Shelley’s “starving bookseller[s],” who was in fact “crushed”
                  by Sidmouth’s campaign against satirists and booksellers.

                  </div> Cahuac shared Shelley’s radical sensibility prior to Peterloo, but he had none of
                  the financial advantages Shelley enjoyed, nor was he abroad following Peterloo. Rather,
                  Cahuac was on the front line of radical resistance in England in 1819 and 1820, faced
                  government prosecution, and ultimately, lost.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In 1819, Cahuac was a working-class publisher and bookseller at 53 Blackman Street,
               Southwark—the Borough—of south London. After Peterloo, and while being routinely abused
               by government agents, he composed and published a series of satires. Three command
               attention: first, a rabble-rousing pamphlet, <em>Who Killed Cock Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the Manchester
                  Blot!</em>, akin to those of his better-known contemporary, Hone; second, an openly seditious
               <em>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His Oppressive Arrest for the Sale of an Alledged Libel,</em> about Sidmouth’s relentless campaign of prosecuting publishers while he directed
               the Home Office; and third, a list of the jury members paid by the Crown during the
               Queen Caroline scandal, in which Caroline sued for her right to the throne while her
               husband sought a divorce. Not one of these satires was particularly original or literary,
               but all three epitomize embattled radical culture post-Peterloo, before it crumbled
               under repression.</p>
            <p>On September 10, 1823, four years after Peterloo, Cahuac was arrested. He was tried
               promptly, and found guilty of receiving stolen property (a considerable number of
               unbound but valuable books), for which he was sentenced to transportation to Van Diemen’s
               Land for fourteen years, the standard maximum sentence. Cahuac, like all political
               dissidents who were sentenced to transportation, was “torn from every tie of relationship,”
               as Thomas Reid reported in his 1822 exposé on the horrors of exile to Australia (2);
               he was removed from English life, his political career was brought to an end, and
               his participation in the reform movement to that point was all but erased from history.
               In fact, references to Cahuac in histories of the period are almost non-existent,
               but the extraordinarily brazen expressions of political defiance in his post-Peterloo
               publications should not be lost to history, if for no other reason than because they
               are exemplary of radicalism in the late Romantic period. </p>
            <p>Although they are piecemeal, there are some records of Cahuac’s life, and taken together,
               they can provide a sketch of his career. He was born around 1770 (records vary) in
               London to John and Mary Cahuac, the third of five children, and he was baptized at
               St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, in 1771 (<em>London, England, Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812</em>: Record for John Cahuac). It seems that his father was the nephew of Bertrand Cahuac,
               a wine seller who had migrated likely from Languedoc and whose tavern eventually became
               the “Caveac” Masonic Lodge, one of many permutations of the original family name (Simpson
               30-31). In any case, as a young man, nineteen or twenty, John Cahuac junior worked
               as a pawnbroker’s assistant for one Mr. Woodin in Drury-Lane, a position which, according
               to court records, connected him to London’s criminal underworld of fences (See the
               trials of Elizabeth Ford and Elizabeth Kelley on 15 September 1790 and James Bond
               on 8 December 1790, <em>The Proceedings of the Old Bailey</em>). By 1793, he had broken out on his own as a pawnbroker (again, court records suggest
               that he was still dealing with fences) and then as an apothecary, assigned to the
               London Dispensary. He sought a military appointment as an apothecary, but no records
               of any military service exist. He married a woman of the same age named Mary, and
               they had a son, Henry St. John Cahuac, in 1808 (they would have a second child, a
               daughter, Elizabeth, who they called Eliza, in 1822) (<em>Australia Death Index, 1787-1907</em>). There are no records concerning his parent’s home, his upbringing, or education,
               and the first records we have of Cahuac’s radical activities suggest that he was in
               his late thirties or early forties when he became politically active.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By 1817, Cahuac was working cooperatively with the radical publisher, Thomas Dolby.
                  Dolby had a successful shop a few blocks from the Crown and Anchor public house and
                  was known as a radical reformer. Perhaps through this association, Cahuac became,
                  as J. Ann Hone describes him, one of the “ultra-radicals” in the reform movement in
                  London (287-288). On July 21, 1817, for example, he was the appointed steward for
                  the dinner celebrating the acquittal of Arthur Thistlewood and James Watson at the
                  Crown and Anchor Tavern, the regular meetinghouse of the London Corresponding Society,
                  of which Cahuac was a member (Hone 288). Thistlewood and Watson, both Spencerian radicals,
                  had tried to instigate rioting at the mass meeting at Spa Fields on December 2, 1816,
                  in an attempt to seize control of the Tower of London and the Bank of England. Their
                  acquittal was a triumph for radicals, but their fortunes were short lived. Both were
                  embroiled in the Cato Street Conspiracy, when government spies entrapped them in a
                  manufactured plot to assassinate several members of the government. They were arrested,
                  paraded before an incredulous public, and hanged in 1820.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a fuller discussion of the Cato Street Conspiracy, see Gash, Gardner, and Hilton.</span></div>
                  </div> Though he seems to have been a close acquaintance to both Thistlewood and Watson,
                  as J. Ann Hone has documented, Cahuac does not appear to have had any involvement
                  with the Cato Street Conspiracy or to have been involved with the Spencerians.</p>
            </div>
            <p>During the same period that Shelley was looking to set up residence in Italy in 1819,
               Cahuac moved to 53 Blackman Street, acquired and registered his own printing press,
               as the Unlawful Societies Act of 1799 required, and shifted to working as an independent
               publisher and bookseller. Because Southwark was home to many dissenters and political
               discontents, he found a readership for radical literature, but it is more likely that
               he anticipated this market than merely responded to it. His imprint appears in various
               radical texts, including works by Thomas Paine, Richard Price, and Elihu Palmer, and
               he was a distributor of <em>The Republican</em>, published by Carlile, whom he seems to have known personally, as well as <em>The Black Dwarf</em>. Moreover, with his own press, he became more than just a bookseller; he edited and
               composed his own radical literature. In that first year with his own press, for example,
               he published “a New Edition” of Palmer’s <em>Principles of Nature</em>, “Revised &amp; Corrected by J. Cahuac.” Later that year, he was tried for this publication,
               but the “prosecution was compromised for a sum of money,” according to the <em>London Investigator</em> (Cooper 82). Then came the news of Peterloo.</p>
            <p>Immediately after Peterloo, in late 1819, Cahuac collaborated with Thomas Rowlandson,
               the artist, illustrator, draftsman, and caricaturist. That he collaborated with such
               a prominent figure demonstrates how well connected Cahuac had become. Together they
               produced the pamphlet entitled, <em>Who Killed Cock Robin? A Satirical Tragedy, or Hieroglyphic Prophecy on the Manchester
                  Blot!</em> The pamphlet presents a satirical allegory about the brutality and corruption of
               the government, narrated in the form of an extended nursery rhyme, with sequential
               caricatures, culminating in a caricature of the king as a bloated peacock, who “Struts
               unconcern’d at / Cock Robin’s Sad tale.” Wood has suggested that William Hone’s similar
               <em>The Political House that Jack Built</em>, published in December 1819, “was the most notorious popular satiric reaction to
               the Peterloo massacre” (213). He continues that it “established the basic form in
               which the majority of Hone and Cruikshank’s other satirical pamphlets were to be produced,”
               and that it “led to a host of imitations and counter-imitations by both the radical
               and loyalist press. Radical publishers including William Benbow, Thomas Dolby, John
               Fairburn, and John Cahuac brought out satires based on the forms of nursery rhyme
               books, and nursery rhyme parody became part of the currency of popular satire” (213).
               It should be pointed out, however, that Cahuac’s pamphlet is also dated 1819; if Hone’s
               was published in December, Cahuac had less than a month to write, have Rowlandson
               illustrate, edit, print, and bind his imitation. It seems unlikely that <em>Who Killed Cock Robin?</em> followed <em>The Political House</em>, but rather that it was composed either simultaneously or, perhaps, even before Hone’s
               publication. In any event, Cahuac was actively participating in what Kipperman called
               the “larger and all-too-effective culture of resistance” alongside such figures as
               Hone and Shelley.</p>
            <p>In 1819, this “culture of resistance” believed that satire was the way to reach a
               popular audience and thereby to win popular support. Indeed, Gardner suggests that
               “for a brief period in late 1819 Shelley made strenuous attempts … to open himself
               to the quite different tradition embodied in the work of Hone, Cruikshank, Wooler
               and the radical pamphleteers” (100), who exploited accessible forms such as caricature,
               sarcasm and invective, hyperbole, sensational imagery, and simple verse and rhyme
               schemes, all with the aim of developing a rhetoric of political polarization that
               would alienate specific targets in power while soliciting popular sympathy. It is
               perhaps impossible to measure the extent of the political impact of these productions—Shelley’s
               were suppressed, copies of Hone’s sold in the thousands—but what is clear is that
               radicals soon became defensive. Cahuac, like all radical publishers in England, was
               on the frontline. If one follows the fate of Cahuac or Dolby, Hunt’s decisions regarding
               publishing Shelley’s works seem if nothing else to be prudent, as Gardner suggests
               (100).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The course of Thomas Dolby’s political career as a publisher and bookseller was similar
                  to Cahuac’s own, but, fortunately, unlike Cahuac, he published memoirs.

                           Rare Book and Manuscript Library, for scanning one of the very few known copies of
                           Dolby’s memoirs.</span></div>
                  </div> The son of a tenant farmer and roof-thatcher in Huntingdonsire, Dolby left his humble
                  origins by attaching himself as a personal assistant to a retired general. He recounts
                  in his autobiography that in 1808 he quit this service and set up shop in London as
                  a seller of stationery and books. Although he had had little formal education and
                  no familial resources to help establish his business in the city, Dolby was nevertheless
                  shrewd, resourceful, and sociable. He met Leigh and John Hunt (97), began to sell
                  radical newspapers, including Cobbett’s <em>Political Register</em>, and, as Jonathan Topham has noted, “His shop became a focus for radical activity”
                  (81).</p>
            </div>
            <p>By 1817 Dolby had acquired printing presses, establishing a national distribution
               network, and in that year, as he records in his memoirs, “we all went politically
               mad” (108). He met Henry Orator Hunt, endorsed his reformist campaign before Peterloo
               (where Hunt was scheduled to be the keynote speaker), and participated in events at
               the Crown and Anchor Tavern, the political meetinghouse for many of the key reformists,
               which was conveniently one block from his shop (109; and see Topham 81-3). Moreover,
               he began selling radical satires, namely <em>The Pasquin</em> and the <em>Political Dictionary</em>, which made him both successful and infamous: “In the summer of 1819, I was arrested
               on two informations by the Attorney General for selling two numbers of Sherwin’s <em>Register</em>, in which some strong remarks were made on the employment of the military in civil
               affairs, and particularly on the memorable Manchester massacre” (112). Dolby was targeted
               and prosecuted by the government for selling radical satires, and his memoirs make
               clear that he understood the political battle in which he was deeply involved: <span class="quote">‘I wish as far as possible to avoid political remarks in this book; but I must just
                  observe, that the Sidmouth and Castlereagh administration of that day … groped their
                  way onward with daggers and dark lanthorns. One of their favorite objects was the
                  slavery of the press. They did not strike the blow boldly at once; but secretly connived
                  at and encouraged the very mischief which publicly they affected to deplore, in order
                  that under such fostering care, it might rise to such a pitch as to warrant them in
                  going the full length they wished, for the enslavement of the press generally. (112-3)’</span> While his attorneys were successful in having the court drop the charges in 1819,
               Dolby was the special focus of Charles Murray, an attorney representing the non-governmental,
               arch-Tory and anti-Jacobin Constitutional Association, which hunted radicals after
               Peterloo. News of their activities hit the papers and, in an August 16, 1821 letter,
               Byron called them the “atrocious crew” (345). Writing considerably later in the century,
               James Taylor comments acerbically that the soon-dubbed “Bridge-Street Gang,” named
               after their office location, were comprised of <span class="quote">‘… a considerable number of wealthy and influential individuals [who] formed themselves
                  into an association for “discountenancing and opposing the dissemination of seditious
                  principles,” and for “supporting the laws for suppressing seditious publications,
                  and for defending the country from the fatal influence of disloyalty and sedition.”
                  (251)’</span> Taylor quotes from the Association’s eponymous manifesto, before discussing its inevitable
               decline once the public began to scrutinize its activities. Nevertheless, in his memoirs,
               Dolby accuses Murray and his gang of colluding with the courts, of sabotaging his
               publishing business, which ultimately went bankrupt, of terrorizing his family, leading
               to the death of his wife, and of defrauding and betraying the people of England, all
               for personal aggrandizement and financial gain (119-49). While it is unclear the extent
               to which any of this is true, Dolby was indeed identified on May 30, 1820, by the
               now-notorious Home Office informant, “J.S.” (John Shegog, whose correspondences are
               available in the Public Record Office), as an active member of the “Liberal Alliance”
               (of which Cahuac was also an active member) determined “to carry on Sedition and Treason
               and to oppose His Majesty, Government, + the laws of the Realm” (PRO). In any case,
               Murray and his “junto” retreated when questions were raised about the standing of
               the Constitutional Association to bring the actions against radicals, but not before
               Dolby was court-ordered to desist publishing political material (149).</p>
            <p>In 1820, Cahuac appeared in court again, charged with seditious libel for selling
               Carlile’s <em>Republican</em>. His defense was rather disingenuous: he pleaded poverty and claimed that “he had
               merely sold the pamphlet in question without ever having read it,” and that he “sold
               pamphlets on all questions, whether opposed to or favorable to government,” according
               to the report, “The King v. John Cahuac,” published in <em>The Times</em> (2). In the end, he spent one month in Horsemonger Lane, Southwark’s prison, for
               seditious libel. Despite his superficial disavowal in court, there is no doubt that
               Cahuac was still a committed radical. After his release, he published an open letter
               to Lord Sidmouth, which is nothing short of a full-scale counter-attack, bearing the
               title, <em>Letter to Lord Sidmouth, on His Oppressive Arrest for the Sale of an Alledged Libel</em>. Cahuac’s self-defense in this letter is a thinly veiled attack. His most immediate
               issue was that the constables who had arrested him had carried him beyond his neighborhood
               and outside of London so that he would not have his neighbors as his jurors. Cahuac
               deems this as yet another instance of recent corruption and abuse of power coming
               out of the Home Office, but the fourteen-page pamphlet does not shy away from listing
               others: (1) Sidmouth’s “paltry warfare against newsmen and bill-stickers,” (2) the
               crown’s “ill-judged act of thanking inhuman butchers for slaughtering their neighbors”
               at Peterloo, (3) the on-going abuses of over-taxation, rotten boroughs, and poor treasury
               decisions, and (4) police corruption. What Cahuac’s rant lacks in focus is made up
               for in wit and defiant indignation. For example, he begins, <span class="quote">‘My lord, Not having the honour of your Lordship’s acquaintance, nor even a knowledge
                  of your person, it cannot be supposed a particle of enmity could in any shape dictate
                  the present Address. Your Lordship will therefore please to consider me as only defending
                  myself from the machinations of those below you, without the smallest intention of
                  giving your Lordship offence. I am, my Lord, one that venerates the Office of Magistrate,
                  even in the hands of a dolt. –But oppression naturally prompts even the beasts of
                  the field to resistance.– (1)’</span> Cahuac then warns Sidmouth that if the government does not open itself up to reform,
               a revolution will ensue, but he carefully tempers this in a passage remarkably similar
               to Shelley’s post-Peterloo political philosophy. Cahuac adds that the people of England
               “have learned philosophy from the school of oppression” (10) and that “they will leave
               the breaking of the peace to those paid to protect it” (11). When his ranting threatens
               to outstrip his wit, which is frequent, he interjects with poignant quotes from Swift,
               Addison, Shakespeare, and the Bible. Nevertheless, the letter remains a fiery piece:
               “The clergy tell us,” he continues, “out of Hell there is no redemption. That I deny,
               my lord; I have escaped the Manchester yeoman, though not your lordship’s informers”
               (8). Of course, after this publication, he continued to be watched.</p>
            <p>In 1820, radicals called for support for Queen Caroline, hoping to incite popular
               protest against mounting repression. She had come home from Spain to assume the throne
               next to George IV, but the new king rebuked her and sought a divorce through parliament.
               The radicals responded, not so much for her sake, but out of antipathy for the seated
               government and the new King. They formed the Queen’s Plate Committee, of which Cahuac
               was a member alongside such notable figures as Major Cartwright, William Hone, and
               Thomas Dolby (Ingelhart 72; for further discussion of the Committee’s activity, see
               Hone 316). Public outrage, the committee hoped, might rekindle reform efforts. At
               this point, Cahuac published the third of his three significant post-Peterloo pieces,
               a four-page pamphlet, <em>The Queen’s Judges! Or, a Penny Peep at the Peers</em>, with an epigraph below the title that reads, “—There is nothing like / A fair, free,
               open trial, where the King / Can choose His judges and appoint His jury.” It then
               lists in alphabetical order three hundred and sixty-nine jury members on government
               payroll and how much each was paid, or as Cahuac has it, “the amount of corrupt Influence
               attached to each individual Peer from Places, Pensions, &amp;c.” The brashness of this
               publication was so unchecked that it caught the attention of several American papers
               covering the Caroline affair, including <em>The Plough Boy</em> out of Albany, which described in its “Weekly Summary” the pamphlet’s circulation
               in England as “extensive” (71). Unfortunately, as John Gardner has pointed out, the
               Caroline affair fizzled out, and the hopes of radicals and reformers were disappointed;
               by 1821 it was apparent that both Caroline and the radicals had failed to win popular
               support. Years later, in a thinly-veiled attempt deny the success of his enemies,
               Dolby reflected on the failure of his satirical publications, <span class="quote">‘… it will be said the Constitutional Association checked and put a stop to licentious
                  publications. I deny that. Causes arise, and effects follow; causes cease, and effects
                  disappear whether such societies as Mr. Murray’s exist or not. Satire is torpid, unless
                  hatched into animation by some ruling vice or folly. The more vicious the cause, the
                  more stinging the effect. In the case just concluded, the Queen’s arrival and treatment
                  excited a strong feeling throughout the country. Satire was awakened into stinging
                  activity; but the public madness subsided before the poor Queen died; the rage was
                  over, and satire became torpid again. <em>The Pasquin</em> and the <em>Political Dictionary</em> were too late. The rage that would have devoured them a year before, had gone by.
                  They both died of inanition. Mr. Murray stepped in too late to kill them, but just
                  in time to make them stink; which is the only service such a man is fit for. (149-50)’</span> Dolby does not discuss the terms of his plea deal in his memoir that put an end to
               his career as a radical publisher, and throughout he downplays his own involvement
               in radical activities, perhaps because he published his memoirs in 1827, before the
               radicals and the reform movement recovered.</p>
            <p>Shelley’s participation in the London radicalism was indirect, and by the middle of
               1820, this seeps into his writings. Steven Jones has demonstrated, for example, that
               Shelley’s fragment “Satire upon Satire,” written at some point between 1820 and 1821
               but not published in his lifetime, calls into question the aesthetic, moral, and political
               merits of the genre even though it simultaneously launches a satirical attack upon
               Southey for his political apostasy. The poem is, Jones concludes, “a self-conscious
               exploration of rather than a sententious answer to questions about form and purpose
               in poetry” (163). This is accurate, but the poem also reveals that Shelley’s earnest
               convictions about the political utility of satire in 1819 were supplanted by a more
               private, skeptical, and highly ironic estimation of satire. Nowhere in this reflection
               on satire does Shelley consider the project of inspiring solidarity, as if such an
               aim is no longer essential to the genre nor particularly relevant. In 1823, the year
               after Shelley drowned off the coast of Italy, Cahuac was still politically active
               in London. In March of that year, the <em>Black Dwarf</em> identified Cahuac, alongside Major Cartwright, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Wooler, Capt. R
               Williams, Mr. George Rogers, and Mr. Webb, as conducting “a select meeting of friends
               to a Constitutional Reform in the Representation of the people in Parliament,” with
               the express purpose of producing a document that “should be submitted to the consideration
               of the Unrepresented throughout the kingdom, a form for petitioning, which, by its
               instructiveness in the true principles of Representation, and on the undeniableness
               of the Right of the people universally, as might aid them in their exertions for recovering
               those rights” (“Parliamentary Reform” 426-427). Gone is the humor, the invectives,
               and the irony, though clearly Cahuac was still invested deeply in radicalism.</p>
            <p>Cahuac was also in deep trouble. On July 16, he, along with Thomas Beeman, was indicted
               for stealing one hundred and six printed books from the Fleet Street property of one
               Benjamin Bensley. Cahuac was charged with receiving the stolen books, while Beeman
               what charged with their theft. (The books in question were an octavo edition of Lingard’s
               <em>History of England</em>.) At their trial on September 10, both Cahuac and Beeman denied having known each
               other or having even met before their arrest, much less conspiring together to steal
               the books. Moreover, Cahuac claimed that he legally purchased the books from somebody
               else but that his confinement had kept him from locating this individual. The jury
               took less than an hour to find both guilty (<em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>, vol. 16). Beeman was sentenced to seven years transportation, but, suspiciously,
               there is no record of him every being transported or incarcerated. Cahuac was sentenced
               to fourteen years transportation, and we have extensive records of his deportation.</p>
            <p>On September 21, 1823, Leigh Hunt ran an announcement of the indictment of John Cahuac
               in the<em>Examiner</em>, but not a subsequent report on the trial (Hunt 618). There was an account, however,
               in <em>The Annual Register</em>, which reported, “an unusual number (not less than 30)” of “respectable witnesses”
               appeared in court to testify to Cahuac’s “good character” (“Old Bailey” 125). The
               <em>Register</em>’s report does not mention that Cahuac was a radical publisher who had been tried
               at least twice previously for seditious libel, nor did it mention his London Corresponding
               Society membership, nor his association with prominent radicals such as Major Cartwright
               and Francis Burdett, among others, nor any of his own radical productions. In fact,
               there seems to be a deliberate circuitousness in the <em>Register</em>’s report about Cahuac’s radicalism. From his early years as a pawnbroker’s assistant,
               Cahuac seems to have had criminal associations, and yet there are details about this
               trial that are suspect, and it seems likely that his heavy sentence was the result
               of his political activities rather than his alleged criminal ones.</p>
            <p>In 1824, with two hundred other convicts, Cahuac shipped out from Portsmouth on board
               the Phoenix II, under Captain Robert White, on a journey that took one hundred and
               fourteen days (<em>Founders &amp; Survivors</em>). He was never to return to England. The “Gaol Report” filed upon his arrival in
               Van Dieman’s Land reads, “[He is] a respectable Man &amp; may be relied upon” but also
               that he was transported for the felony: “Buying Books, knowing them to have been stolen,
               once for publishing a blasphemous libel” (<em>Founders &amp; Survivors</em>). The report gives us our only physical description: In his mid-fifties, Cahuac was
               five foot three and a half, had gray hair and eyes, his left hand was crippled, and
               he had a notable scar over his left eye (<em>Founders &amp; Survivors</em>). On August 15 1825, less than two years after he was sentenced, he was granted permission
               to leave Van Dieman’s Land and to proceed on to Sydney. He immediately submitted a
               petition “for his family to be sent out to the Colony at Government expense” (<em>Colonial Secretary Index</em>), giving inexplicably “H.R.H. Princess Sophia of Gloucester as his only referee in
               England” (Picton Phillips 227). Surprisingly, this was granted five days later as
               was a “recommendation for a ticket of leave,” essentially probation that would allow
               him to find employment (<em>Colonial Secretary Index</em>). Mary arrived with their two children but died two years later in 1827. There are
               a few records of his life in Australia, but John Cahuac’s political career as an English
               radical had ended in 1823. He died in Australia in 1832, at roughly sixty-two years
               old.</p>
