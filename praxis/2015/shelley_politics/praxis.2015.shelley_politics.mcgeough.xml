                <p rend="noCount">This essay reads Percy Bysshe Shelley's <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title> in the context of the
                    resurgence of critical interest in anarchist theory. The essay meditates on
                    how recent developments in anarchist-related critical theory, specifically
                    the work of Jacques Rancière, make visible an aesthetics of anarchism. Using
                    Rancière's re-contextualization of the Romantic aesthetic philosophies of
                    Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Schiller, the essay argues that Shelley's protest poem can be read
                    as an anarchism not only in terms of its political content, but, perhaps more
                    radically, with respect to its form. In so doing, the essay attempts to think
                    beyond the critical impasse in which <title level="m">The Mask</title> is understood as sacrificing

                    might be read as expressing an anarchic politics, in Rancière's words,

                <p>Percy Shelley’s <emph>The Mask of Anarchy </emph>(1819) has been revered by
                    political radicals of all stripes, from Chartists to Marxists, and although a
                    Marxist orientation arguably comprises the “mainstream” interpretation of
                    Shelley as a political radical, the same history sees Shelley more or less
                    adopted as part of an international anarchist literary canon. Indeed, as Eric
                    Hobsbawm avers, in the early part of the twentieth century “interest in Shelley”
                    became something of a sign by which anarchists often recognized one another
                    (82). In his canonical 1962 history of the movement, George Woodcock noted that
                    it was in Shelley—as the chief disciple of William Godwin, his father-in-law and
                    unofficial founder of modern anarchism—“that anarchism first appears as a theme
                    of world literature. And, though Shelley must perhaps cede to Tolstoy the honour
                    of being the greatest of anarchist writers, he remains the greatest of anarchist
                    poets” (91).</p>
                <p> Yet, as Michael Scrivener noted some time ago, Shelley’s connection to anarchism
                    has received little more than “spotty acknowledgement” (35), a forgetting that
                    persists today despite the abiding critical interest in his politics. Recent
                    years, however, have seen a dramatic resurgence of popular and academic interest
                    in anarchist theory and practice, prompting Simon Critchley to propose an
                    “anarchist turn” across the disciplines (“The Anarchist Turn”). This turn marks,
                    among other things, a certain return by contemporary radical theorists to one of
                    the root insights of anarchist thinking; namely, its fundamental critique of
                        <emph>archē</emph>, the foundations or “first” principles which historically
                    serve as the metaphysical ground and justification for a hierarchical
                    construction of the social. If, as Kir Kuiken has recently argued, the political
                    and aesthetic upheavals that mark Romanticism make its aesthetics the locus “for
                    a fundamental set of questions that can no longer be resolved by reference to a
                    pre-given ground or authority” (4), then the recent anarchist turn is itself the
                    return of a certain Romanticism that remains to be thought through. </p>
                <p> In this essay, I explore the implications of the anarchist turn for Romanticism
                    as the possibility of a return to Woodcock’s view of Shelley as an anarchist
                    poet. My purpose, however, is not simply to interpret Shelley’s politics as
                    anarchist; rather, this essay meditates on how recent developments in anarchist
                    theory make visible an <emph>aesthetics</emph> of anarchism, and how this
                    aesthetics is deployed in one of Shelley’s most expressly anarchistic poems,
                        <emph>The Mask of Anarchy</emph>. What follows investigates this possibility
                    primarily via the work of Jacques Rancière, whose work on the politics of
                    aesthetics has strong ties to the anarchist turn.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">See in particular May, “Kant via Rancière: From Ethics to
                        Anarchism” in <emph>How Not to Be Governed: Readings and Interpretations from the Critical Left</emph>,
                            65-82; Newman, “Post-Anarchism and Radical Politics Today” in <emph>Post
                                Anarchism: A Reader</emph>, 58-61.</note> The relationship
                    between anarchic and Romantic discourses in Rancière’s thinking, and their
                    importance for Romanticism itself, has yet to be explored in detail. The
                    coordinates for relating these discourses are found in Rancière’s notion of the
                    “aesthetic regime,” which he locates in the Romantic period. For Rancière, texts
                    such as Kant’s <emph>Critique of Judgment</emph> (1790),<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">Hereafter cited parenthetically using the abbreviation

                        Poetry</emph>, generate a “literary formula for the democratic principle of
                    equality” (<emph>Politics of Literature </emph>10-11).<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">References to frequently cited Rancière texts are hereafter
                        indicated parenthetically by the following abbreviations: <emph>Aesthetics

                        indicated by shortened title.</note> This democratic principle does not
                    correspond to political anarchism per se but with a “primary ‘anarchism’ at the
                    heart of politics” as such, a “rupture in the logic of <emph>archē</emph>” which
                    “presupposes that a determinate superiority is exercised over an equally
                    determinate inferiority” (“Democracy” 174-75; <emph>Dissensus</emph> 30-31). </p>
                <p>This an-archy provides a critical architecture for understanding Shelley’s
                    relationship to anarchism not in terms of its political content but as
                        <emph>form</emph>, specifically in its paradoxical Kantian-Schillerian
                    modality as a “suspension” of relations of domination, which, I argue, provides
                    the aesthetic coordinates for <emph>The Mask</emph>’s emphasis on passive
                    resistance. Examining this an-archic conception of form, this essay thus
                    attempts to think beyond the critical impasse in which <emph>The Mask</emph> is
                    understood either as sacrificing aesthetics for politics<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">The history of critical reception of <emph>The Mask</emph>
                        either ignored the poem entirely (Bloom, Wasserman) or dismissed its
                        deliberately stripped-down verse as poetically inferior (Webb 93). Even
                        sympathetic appraisals by Scrivener, Richard Hendrix, Thomas Edwards, and
                        Stephen C. Behrendt alternately characterize Shelley’s blend of “dramatic
                        form” with “political insight” as “imperfect,” “contradictory,” and as such
                        potentially damaging to the very causes it seeks to promote (Scrivener 199,
                        Hendrix 68, Edwards 161-68, Behrendt 199).</note> or a mere “aesthetic
                    processing” <emph>of</emph> politics (Wolfson 195). Rather, by linking
                    Rancière’s analysis of the aesthetic regime to one of Shelley’s most exoteric
                    political poems, the essay asks how <emph>The Mask </emph>might be read as
                    expressing an an-archic politics “simply by being literature” (Rancière,
                        <emph>PL </emph>3).</p>
                <p>In this respect, parts of my argument dovetails with recent work on Shelley by
                    critics like Kuiken and Matthew Borushko, who have re-emphasized the centrality
                    of form in Shelley’s political texts. My analysis of the suspension of form in
                    Kant and Schiller via Rancière echoes what Borushko has called, via Adorno, the
                    “alliance between the aesthetic [form] and nonviolence” in Shelley’s
                        <emph>Mask</emph> (97). In turn, my own argument extends these critical
                    insights by linking this inherently political conception of the aesthetic to
                    Rancière’s aesthetic regime so as to provide a different accent on the critical
                    history that often touches upon, but rarely examines in depth or in
                    distinctively <emph>aesthetic</emph> terms, Shelley’s connection to the
                    anarchist political tradition.</p>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>I.</head>
                    <p> We can begin with a brief reminder of some of the core ideas informing
                        Rancière’s approach to the politics of aesthetics. Central to this approach
                        is his disjoining of the politics of literature from the politics of
                        writers. For Rancière, the politics of literature is not concerned with “the
                        personal engagements of writers in the social or political struggles of
                        their times,” nor to “the way writers represent social structures” or
                        “political movements . . . in their books.” Instead, the politics of
                        literature concerns the way literature “intervenes <emph>as</emph>
                        literature” in the “carving up of space and time, the visible and invisible,
                        speech and noise” (<emph>PL </emph>3; emphasis added). In this respect,
                        intervention is not the demonstration of a program for political resistance
                        in poetic form; rather, intervention is located in the articulation of form
                        itself, which Rancière sees in Kantian terms as the <emph>a priori
                        </emph>“shape” that reconfigures sensible-perceptual space. By disrupting
                        the tacit distribution organizing the sensible, form also bears a
                        distinctively political potential as “dissensus,” or the “reconfiguration of
                        the distribution of the sensible that defines the common of a community, by
                        introducing into it subjects and new objects, in rendering visible those who
                        were not, and of making understood as speakers those who were only
                        understood as noisy animals” (<emph>AD</emph> 25).</p>
                    <p> Rancière locates the historical emergence of this political dimension of
                        aesthetic form with the “aesthetic regime” of art during the Romantic
                        period. The aesthetic regime arises, in particular, in opposition to a prior
                        “representative” regime of art formulated on the basis of an Aristotelian
                        theory of <emph>mimesis</emph>. The representative was composed of three
                        interrelated elements analogous “with a fully hierarchical vision” of
                        society: the “primacy of action over characters,” a “hierarchy of genres
                        according to the dignity of their subject matter,” and the “primacy of the
                        art of speaking” (<emph>PA</emph> 22). The privileging of narrative as “the
                        imitation of men who act” establishes an opposition between the “rationality
                        of action against the empirical nature of life,” such that “the superiority
                        of the poem, which links actions” over other forms, appears “homologous to
                        the superiority of men who take part in the world of action” (<emph>PL
                        </emph>9-10). Men of action are further privileged in their possession of
                        efficacious speech: orators, princes, princesses, generals, and so on.
                        Moreover, the definitive nature of the rules for aesthetic production means
                        that works of art demand an equally determinate effect on their audience: a
                        successful tragedy, for instance, always culminates in a catharsis.</p>
                    <p>The aesthetic regime, conversely, emerges precisely when the hierarchies of
                        the representative begin to break down. The innovation of the aesthetic
                        regime is an acknowledgement that there are no pre-existing rules for what
                        counts as the subject of a work of art and, therefore, that there are no
                        solid boundaries between the forms of art and those of life: art is freed
                        “from any specific rule, from any hierarchy of the arts, subject matter, and
                        genre” (<emph>PA </emph>23). The aesthetic regime dismantles the
                        hierarchical distribution of subjects, instead promoting an “equality of
                        represented subjects” and an “indifference of style with regard to content,”
                        such that artists no longer have to represent subjects according to specific
                        rules (Rockhill 81). The aesthetic regime thus revitalizes aesthetics by
                        placing it in contact with life, while life is thought to be potentially
                        transformable by its renewed contact with art. One of the byproducts of the
                        aesthetic regime’s abolition of representative rules, however, is precisely
                        “the loss of any determinate relationship between a work and its audience,
                        between its sensible presence and an effect that will be its natural end”
                        (Rancière, “Art of the Possible”). </p>
                    <p> The aesthetic regime’s confusion of the lines between art and life finds its
                        historical parallel in the French Revolution, which overturned the social
                        and political hierarchies correspondent to the generic divisions within the
                        representative regime, while investing transformations of sensible
                        experience and the radical blurring of artistic boundaries with a desire
                        directed towards a future human community. The logic of this shift is
                        evident Wordsworth’s well-known refusal of the rules of engagement by which
                        poets are supposed to “gratify certain known habits of association,” along
                        with his arguments against poetic diction, and his promotion of the
                        “language really used by men” as the proper domain of poetry, all of which
                        exemplifies the aesthetic regime’s desire for art’s renewed contact with
                        life. In the <emph>Defence</emph>, Shelley’s demand for “the poetry of life”
                        (502) similarly manifests the aesthetic regime’s collapse of discursive
                        boundaries. For Shelley, imagination “has for its objects those forms which
                        are common to universal nature,” which includes not only poetry, but “the
                        kindred expressions of the poetical faculty; architecture, painting, music,
                        the dance, sculpture, philosophy, and we may add the forms of civil life”
                        (488). In turn, the <emph>Defence</emph> emphasizes “the connexion of poetry
                        and social good,” for poetry “contains within itself the seeds at once of
                        its own and of social renovation” (492). However, Shelley also acknowledges
                        the contingency of the artwork’s intention and its effect in the image of
                        the fading coal whose “transitory brightness” emits only a “feeble shadow”
                        of its original conception; hence, “it is impossible to predict the
                        greatness of its results” (504). </p>
                    <p> The collapse of the borders between art and life in the aesthetic regime is
                        not as straightforward as it appears, however. On the one hand, the
                        aesthetic regime inaugurates a project of “aesthetic revolution” through its
                        “suspension of the relations of domination” and their transformation “into
                        the generative principle of a world without domination” (Rancière,
                            <emph>AD</emph> 36). On the other, art can only gesture towards this
                        utopian future by virtue of its <emph>distance</emph> from life, that is, by
                        virtue of the autonomy of its form. For Rancière, it is the “resistant
                        figure of the work[’s form] in which political promise is negatively
                        preserved” that generates its an-archic potential (<emph>AD</emph> 36-37).
                        This paradox is compounded by the “generative contradiction” of form itself
                            (<emph>PA</emph> 29): in order for art to preserve its “political
                        promise” it must be distinct from the “natural” organization of bodies in
                        the distribution of the sensible. At the same time, this promise also means
                        that that art must be more than mere art; namely, it must become an agent of
                        transformation. Art can hold onto its political promise only through its
                        disincorporation from existing distributions of the sensible. The aesthetic
                        regime is therefore “inhabited by a heterogeneous power, the power of a form
                        of thought that has become foreign to itself” (<emph>PA </emph>23). This
                        heterogeneous power parallels dissensus: by virtue of its paradoxical
                        autonomy and heteronomy, form produces a gap in the sensible through its
                        neutralization of the customary meanings attributed to words and the
                        assigned relations between bodies and their capacities. It is through this
                        hiatus that form manifests alternative possibilities for a redistribution of
                        the sensible.</p>
                    <p> Rancière arrives at the constitutive paradox of the aesthetic regime through
                        an examination of Romantic aesthetic philosophy, in particular Schiller’s
                        rereading of Kant’s aesthetic judgment. What interests Rancière in Kant and
                        Schiller is their shared emphasis on discerning in aesthetic experience a
                        “form of judgment freed from the hierarchies of knowledge and those of
                        social life” (“Art of the Possible”). For Kant, aesthetic judgment proceeds
                        from a double negation that suspends both the law of the understanding and
                        the law of practical interest. Judgments of the type “this is beautiful” are
                        disinterested, Kant argues, since they function in the absence of any
                        determinate law of the understanding or as an object of desire. As
                        disinterested, aesthetic form is not the imposition of a conceptual unity on
                        manifold sensation but that aspect of an object freely reflected in the
                        imagination in the absence of any determinate concept or empirical interest,
                        so that the imagination is “as it were, at play in the observation of the
                        shape” (Kant, <emph>CJ</emph> 114). No longer subject either to the laws of
                        reason or of sensibility, imaginative play manifests a free and
                        indeterminate relation between the faculties of the imagination and the
                        understanding, which in turn produces “aesthetic common sense”: <quote> a
                            faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (<emph>a
                                priori</emph>) of everyone else’s way of representing in thought, in
                            order as it were to hold its judgment up to human reason as a whole . .
                            . by abstracting from the limitations that contingently attach to our
                            judging, which is in turn accomplished by leaving out as far as is
                            possible everything in one’s representational state that is matter, i.e.
                            sensation, and attending solely to the formal peculiarities of his
                            representation. (<emph>CJ </emph>175-76) </quote> Although Kant’s
                        conception of the aesthetic judgment of beauty is often de-emphasized in
                        favour of the sublime,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See especially J. F.
                            Lyotard, <emph>Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime</emph> (1994).
                            Lyotard politicizes Kant’s ideas on the beautiful and the sublime as
                            “conservative” and “radical” modes of aesthetics, respectively. Rancière
                            offers a productive counter-reading of this interpretation so as to
                            recuperate a radical politics of the beautiful itself. See Rancière,
                                <emph>Aesthetics and its Discontents</emph>, 88-105.</note> in
                        Rancière’s terms it is precisely the emphasis on form in the aesthetic
                        experience of beauty that generates the possibility of dissensus. Crucially,
                        Kant distinguishes his version of aesthetic common sense from the
                        common-sense “realism” of the Scottish Enlightenment, whose privileging of
                        sense-experience Schiller critiques as “judging all experience whatsoever by
                        one particular fragment of experience” (101). Conversely, the formalism of
                        the Kantian aesthetic judgment divests common sense of its unreflected
                        immediacy, encouraging a <emph>critical</emph> relation to the given.
                        Aesthetic common sense emerges precisely when the given empirical
                        distribution of “common sense” is no longer taken for granted. </p>
                    <p>Kant further describes the <emph>sensus communis</emph> generated by
                        aesthetic judgment as <emph>possible</emph> rather than “actual” (<emph>CJ
                        </emph>174). The universality of the aesthetic experience of form does not
                        affirm the <emph>sensus communis</emph> as an already existing state of
                        affairs, as it does for the Scottish realists, but identifies it as a
                        possibility whose withdrawal from the given opens towards Rancière’s
                        conception of equality as a supplement that “separates the community out
                        from the sum of the parts of the social body.” As a universal presupposition
                        in which “to think for oneself” is paradoxically “to think the position of
                        everyone else” (Kant, <emph>CJ</emph> 174), aesthetic common sense
                        identifies the moment when a singular judgment is no longer part of the
                        conventional distributions of the sensible, but identifies itself with
                        “human reason as a whole,” “a communal sphere different from the official
                        public sphere” (Rancière, “Democracy” 174-75). </p>
                    <p> Schiller’s rereading of Kant in the <emph>Letters on the Aesthetic Education
                            of Man</emph> makes the politics within aesthetic judgment explicit. For
                        Schiller, “if man is ever to solve that problem of politics in practice he
                        will have to approach it through the problem of the aesthetic” (90), whose
                        “play” encompasses the very definition of humanity itself: “man only plays
                        when he is in the fullest sense of the word a human being, and <emph>he is
                            only fully a human being when he plays</emph>” (131). In the sixth
                        letter, Schiller criticizes the increasingly “sharper divisions between the
                        sciences” and the “rigorous separation of ranks and occupations” (99) that
                        constitutes the representative regime and its itinerant police order. In
                        aesthetic play, conversely, the mind finds itself a “medium” between reason
                        and sensation: “it is, precisely because it is divided between the two,
                        removed from the constraint of the one as of the other. . . . By means of
                        beauty sensuous man is led to a form of thought” and “spiritual man is
                        brought back to matter” (129, 137). Schiller describes play as emerging in
                        the experience of form, which in its Kantian definition affects the “whole
                        man,” whereas subject matter affects “only one or other of his functions”
                        (151). Schiller encounters the contradictory play of this formal effect at
                        work in his description of the statue of the<emph> Juno Ludovisi</emph>:
                        “the whole figure reposes and dwells in itself, . . . neither yielding nor
                        resisting; here is no force to contend with force. . . . we find ourselves
                        at one and the same time in a state of utter repose and supreme agitation,
                        and there results that wondrous stirring of the heart for which mind has no
                        concept nor speech any name” (132). The aesthetic experience of the statue’s
                        autonomy is inextricably intertwined with its heteronomy, its strange
                        fascination promising a new form of life in its formal difference from
                        ordinary sensation. </p>
                    <p> For Rancière, Schiller’s conception of aesthetic play as the free agreement
                        between reason and sensation articulates a “pure instance of suspension, a
                        moment when form is experienced for itself,” which stands in direct contrast
                        to any “state that governs human societies and puts each person in his place
                        by separating those who command from those who obey” (<emph>PA </emph>24;
                            <emph>AD </emph>97). Hence, the free agreement made possible through
                        aesthetic experience is “already . . . dissensus” (<emph>AD</emph> 97). On
                        the one hand, aesthetic play is dissensus in its refusal of a cognition in
                        which one faculty is subordinated to another; on the other, it is the
                        refusal of any hierarchical division in which one form of life is superior
                        to another. In turn, Schiller’s desire for an “aesthetic education” of
                        humanity comes about as a distinctively nonviolent suspension of (sensible)
                        force contending with (rational) force. This suspension, mobilized by the
                        Kantian-Schillerian concept of form, locates an aesthetics of passive
                        resistance within the politics of Romantic aesthetics, a state in which
                        utter repose is paradoxically and simultaneously a mode of supreme
                        agitation. </p>
                    <p> In the <emph>Defence</emph>, Shelley also speaks of poetry as the play of
                        “exultation and horror, grief and pleasure, eternity and change” that in its
                        synthetic “union under its light yoke all irreconcilable things” (505). This
                        union does not reconcile us with things as they are but “makes us the
                        inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos,” defeating
                        both “the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of
                        surrounding impressions” as well as reason’s “enumeration of quantities
                        already known” (480). Neither “mere life,” nor “mere form,” the suspension
                        made possible in the experience of aesthetic play, creates what Schiller
                        calls “living Shape” [<emph>lebende Gestalt</emph>] (128). Echoing the
                        “Shape” that breeds living thoughts “As flowers beneath May’s footstep
                        waken” in <emph>The Mask </emph>(l. 122), Schiller’s “living Shape” expands
                        Kant’s formulation beyond mere disinterestedness to redeploy aesthetic play
                        as the figure through which both mind and world can be imagined otherwise:

                    <p> The tensions Rancière foregrounds in the Kantian-Schillerian notion of
                        aesthetic form—the suspension of attraction and repulsion, repose and
                        agitation, neither yielding nor resisting—provide coordinates through which
                        we can begin to approach similar tensions at work in <emph>The Mask of
                            Anarchy</emph>. The play of these tensions stage <emph>The Mask</emph>’s
                        political promise of equality inherent within the notion of form that
                        emerges with the aesthetic regime. </p>
                    <p><emph>The Mask</emph> is an especially appropriate example of how such
                        tensions operate; indeed, for much of its reception history, the poem finds
                        itself divided by the very politics and aesthetics it ostensibly tries to
                        reconcile. On the one hand, <emph>The Mask</emph>’s historical popularity
                        with radicals, including anarchists,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            index to American anarchist Benjamin Tucker’s magazine
                                <emph>Liberty</emph> (1881-1908) lists over twenty references to
                            Shelley. <emph>The Mask</emph> proved influential for Tucker himself,
                            who frequently editorialized in the pages of <emph>Liberty
                            </emph>concerning the use of violence as a means of overthrowing State
                            power. Shelley was also frequently the subject of lectures at the
                            experimental Modern School founded in New York in 1911 by anarchists
                            Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman (Avrich 121, 129, 149, 352). “To the
                            Men of England,” sections of <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>, and
                                <emph>The Mask</emph> were anthologized in popular anarchist texts
                            such as Marcus Graham’s <emph>Anthology of Revolutionary Poetry
                            </emph>(1929), as well as singled out for praise in Victor Méric’s entry
                            on “Poésie” for Sébastien Faure’s <emph>Encyclopédie Anarchiste</emph>
                            (1934). See also Herbert Read, <emph>In Defence of Shelley &amp; Other
                                Essays</emph> (1936); Paul Goodman, <emph>Speaking and Language: A
                                Defence of Poetry</emph> (1972).</note> has fed its reputation as
                        “the greatest poem of political protest ever written in English” (Holmes
                        532). To be sure, Shelley seems to have intended the poem to be read this
                        way; writing to Leigh Hunt in 1820, Shelley includes <emph>The Mask</emph>
                        as part of a “little volume of <emph>popular songs</emph>, wholly political,
                        &amp; destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination of the reformers”
                            (<emph>Letters </emph>2: 191). Conversely, Susan Wolfson has contested
                            <emph>The Mask</emph>’s celebrated interventionist status on the very
                        basis of its form, seeing in the poem’s blend of dream-vision and political
                        awakening a series of external and internal impasses that undermine the very
                        causes it seeks to promote. Such impasses, from the poem’s belated
                        publication in 1832 rendering it “unable to affect the struggle it
                        addresses” (195), to its framing as a dream-vision from which “the poet
                        never seems to awaken” (195-96), and its reduction of mass political action
                        to a “static aesthetic spectacle” (198-200, 203), disarticulate Shelley’s
                        attempt to put poetry to work in and as politics.</p>
                    <p> Yet even Wolfson’s penetrating reading of <emph>The Mask</emph>’s formal
                        contradictions remains within the scope of critical judgment that measures
                        the poem as a “litmus test” for Shelley’s politics (Kuiken 188). In this
                        respect, Wolfson less overturns the political monumentalization of Shelley
                        than reproduces it negatively as a sign of poetry’s failure to
                            <emph>be</emph> politics. Such approaches potentially miss something
                        crucial about the complex tensions between autonomy and heteronomy that
                        contribute to the aesthetic regime’s political theorization of form itself. </p>
                    <p> In order to gauge how <emph>The Mask </emph>can be an interventionist text
                        “as literature” let us return briefly to Shelley’s statement that <emph>The
                            Mask </emph>is a poem “destined to awaken &amp; direct the imagination
                        of the reformers.” At first glance, Shelley’s comment would seem to posit a
                        simple cause and effect relation between poetry and politics. One notes the
                        subtle wording of the remark, however: what is being awakened is the
                            <emph>imaginations </emph>of the reformers. That is to say, what Shelley
                        expresses in <emph>The Mask </emph>is not necessarily poetry as the causal
                        spring of a failed, programmatic, model of politics, but a politics of
                        poetry capable of imagining new forms of collective life. This imagining
                        becomes possible through the poetic reconfiguration of the sensible; hence,
                        the imaginative awakening to which Shelley refers in his letter becomes the
                        “sense awakening” in <emph>The Mask</emph>, something “heard and felt” (l.
                        136-37).</p>
                    <p> Shelley’s much-discussed use of the court masque genre provides a convenient
                        starting point for the poem’s manner of “carving up” the sensible, since it
                        renders palpable the differences between representative and aesthetic
                        regimes. As Stuart Curran points out, Shelley inverts the hierarchy of
                        values typically associated with the masque-antimasque genres. Whereas in
                        the conventional masque, the vulgarity, grotesquerie, and chaos of the
                        antimasque are invoked only to be “superseded by the ritual celebration” of
                        “the received order of society and . . . its structures of authority”
                        (Curran 188, 190), Shelley repurposes the masque such that the authoritative
                        embodiments of order (“God, King, and Law”) now inhabit the “motley crowd”
                        typically associated with the antimasque (l. 27, 40-41, 66). Conversely,
                        Shelley transvalues the masque into an aesthetic form that gives voice to
                        that part that has no part, the “Heroes of unwritten story” (l. 148). In so
                        doing, <emph>The Mask</emph> reconfigures the masque-form as a genre
                        available to everyone: its subjects are no longer situated within the
                        hierarchical arrangement which defines the crowd as the chaotic “other” of
                        social authority, but rather access the passion of ritual celebration
                        hitherto reserved for these forms of authority as available to all.</p>
                    <p> The theoretical basis for this inversion is formulated in the
                            <emph>Defence</emph>, where Shelley redefines drama in the context of
                        the aesthetic regime’s an-archic breakdown of the representative hierarchy
                        of genres. Shelley shifts the meanings of the dramatic form from a code
                        properly separating genres to that “under which a greater number of modes of
                        expression of poetry are susceptible of being combined than any other”
                        (491-92). Though <emph>The Mask </emph>is not as ostentatious in its generic
                        hybridity as the “lyrical drama” of <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>, its
                        redeployment of the masque nonetheless performs a dramatic function which
                        Rancière identifies with “the practice of bringing into play the capacity of
                        the greatest number,” the “many” of the “Ye are many – they are few”
                        (“Democracy” 175). In this context, the function of the masque for Shelley
                        is not political action, insofar as action remains within the representative
                        schema that that aesthetic regime calls into question. Rather, its function
                        in bringing into play the capacity of the greatest number is the
                            <emph>suspension</emph> of action, exemplified both in the
                        transvaluation of “God, King, and Law” as the arbiters of Anarchy without
                        progression, as well as the equivalence of the multitude’s “folded arms and
                        looks” with “Weapons of unvanquished war” (l. 321-22). </p>
                    <p> This suspension of action is figured from the outset of the poem in the
                        ambiguous status of the speaker, who dreamily ventriloquizes a voice heard
                        “from over the Sea”: <quote><lg>
                                <l> As I lay asleep in Italy,</l>
                                <l> There came a voice from over the Sea,</l>
                                <l> And with great power it forth led me,</l>
                                <l> To walk in visions of Poesy. (l. 1-4)</l>
                            </lg></quote> For Wolfson, the quadruple single rhyme and the drowsy
                        sibilance of “As I-Sea-Poesy” generates an effect at once hypnotic and
                        claustrophobic. Initiating the verse’s rhyme scheme not with the first end
                        rhyme “Italy-me” but with the internal “as<emph>lee</emph>p-Italy,” which
                        then becomes “me” and “Poesy,” <emph>The Mask</emph> binds its desire for
                        political agency to the ideologically (en)closed “specular seeming” (Wolfson
                        197). This agency is further perplexed by the syntactic echoes between the
                        voice of the “indignant Earth” (l. 139) that calls for political action and
                        the poem’s specular preamble. The “As I” that initiates the dream sequence
                        thus returns as the “As if” through which the Earth’s “words of joy and fear
                        arose”: “As if their Own indignant Earth / . . . / Had felt her blood upon
                        her brow / . . . / As if her heart had cried aloud” (l. 138-39, 141, 147).
                        The poem’s form thus works to restrain the “political agency of the oratory
                        to a dream” (Wolfson 198).</p>
                    <p> But in making the oratory a dream, <emph>The Mask</emph> at once formally
                        demonstrates the restraint that the poem’s content will exhort as passive
                        resistance, while further displacing the hierarchical modes of sensibility
                        within the representative order. As Rancière notes, in the representative
                        order, “speaking was the act of the orator who persuades an assembly. . . .
                        The power of making art with words was linked to the power of a hierarchy of
                        speech, of a relationship of address regulated between speech acts and
                        defined audiences on whom these speech acts were supposed to produce the
                        effects of mobilizing” (<emph>PL </emph>12). It is precisely this hierarchy
                        of the active speech of men-in-action over a passive multitude that the poem
                        goes on to challenge by displacing both the source of the orator’s voice and
                        its addressee: its origin is not a localizable figure within the social
                        hierarchy but in the “Earth,” while its addressee is no longer “magistrates,
                        princes and preachers” but the “many,” or rather, as Rancière puts it, “any
                        one at all, no one in particular” (<emph>PL </emph>12). Like the masque form
                        itself, the representative function of oration here becomes subject to the
                        an-archic formula of the aesthetic regime that dismantles “the distinction
                        between men of speech-in-action and men of noisy suffering voice” (<emph>PL
                        </emph>13). The dream is the <emph>form</emph> of the oration; as such, the
                        oration functions only “as if” it were the objective content of a political
                        program. Rather, insofar as the dream is its form, the oration itself is a
                        “vision of Poesy,” an experimental shaping of the sensible materials
                            <emph>for</emph> a new program of political resistance, a program whose
                        content remains indeterminate, suspended between passion and action. </p>
                    <p>The dream frame can also be read as the necessary prerequisite for
                        allegorizing the paradoxical autonomy and heteronomy of aesthetic form. The
                        poem’s dream effect announces less the erasure of its historical-material
                        referentiality than what Herbert Marcuse calls a “sublimation” of it. The
                        function of aesthetic sublimation in its “transcendence of immediate
                        reality” is precisely to disrupt “the reified objectivity of established
                        social relations . . . while preserving its overwhelming presence” (Marcuse
                        6, 7). Hence the aesthetic stylization of the masque is doubled by the
                        poem’s reference to having been written “on the Occasion of the Massacre at
                        Manchester.” At the same time, the strangely unlocalizable “voice of the
                        Earth” that will emerge in the poem to exhort passive resistance from the
                        masses announces “a new dimension of experience” (Marcuse 7) through the “as
                        if” that hypothetically restores Henry Hunt’s truncated speech to the
                        Manchester assembly, the content of which becomes the sublimated form of
                        Shelley’s revised masque. The “truth” of the Peterloo massacre, then, is not
                        the event of the massacre itself, which would only confirm the existing
                        order of things, but the sublimated poetic world which breaks from this
                        reality so as to become “a vehicle [for] recognition and indictment”
                        (Marcuse 9), or in Rancière’s terms, dissensus. </p>
                    <p>At once recognized and indicted in the early part of <emph>The Mask</emph> is
                        the violence that sustains the consensual apparatus that defines normative
                        distributions of the sensible. Prior to Hope’s intervention, the poem is
                        suffused with images of theatricalized violence, as the pageant of Murder,
                        Fraud, and Anarchy tramples “to a mire of blood” the “adoring multitude” (l.
                        39-40), whose adulation shows them colluding in their own oppression. The
                        culminating point of the multitude’s complicity lies not only in its
                        “ideological blindness” (Borushko 103), however, but in the specifically
                        consensual mode that this blindness takes: “Then all cried with one accord;
                        / ‘Thou are King, and god, and Lord; / Anarchy, to Thee we bow / Be thy name
                        made holy now!’” (l. 70-74). It is only with the “one accord” that Anarchy’s
                        reign converts its more overt forms of theatricalized violence into
                        manageable forms of instituted violence: “Bank,” “Tower,” and “Parliament”
                        (l. 83, 84). </p>
                    <p>Arguably the central figure of dissensus in the poem is the “Shape arrayed in
                        mail” (l. 110): <quote><lg>
                                <l>A mist, a light, an image rose </l>
                                <l>. . . </l>
                                <l>With step as soft as wind it past </l>
                                <l>O’er the heads of men—so fast </l>
                                <l>That they knew the presence there, </l>
                                <l>And looked,—but all was empty air. (l. 118-21) </l>
                            </lg></quote> At once present and absent, the Shape marks a symbolic
                        break in the poem that marks the shift from (revised) antimasque to masque
                        and, in doing so, allegorizes the formal operation Rancière attributes to
                        the dissensus through which a multitude previously invisible becomes
                        visible. The Shape thereby opens a space in which equality will be inscribed
                        in the staging of a dispute which establishes a community existing solely
                        through its being divided from the status quo via a specifically aesthetic
                        production, “a mist, a light, an image” (l. 102). The voicing of this
                        dispute emerges through the anonymous figure of the “indignant Earth” (l.
                        139), whose speech evokes a counter-world that directly contrasts the
                        existing one. In its hortatory function, the counter-world evoked in the
                        rhetorical functions of the Earth’s speech enjoins the reader to undertake
                        an aesthetic play in the observation of the poem’s Shape. As Ronald
                        Tetreault points out, the Earth’s speech assumes an “imperative stance,”
                        especially in the jussive refrain for the multitude to “Rise like Lions
                        after Slumber” (205). Emphasis on the imperative is a conventional aspect of
                        the court masque, which finds the “Master of the Revels” giving “commands to
                        the masquers . . . phrased as wishes inviting corresponding actions”
                        (Tetreault 206). Just as Shelley transvalues the masque form, however, so
                        too must the rhetorical status of the poem’s repeated “let” shift in
                        emphasis from command to invitation: “Let a vast assembly be / And with
                        great solemnity / Declare with measured words that ye / Are, as God has made
                        ye, free” (l. 295-98). Insofar as freedom can be declared through “measured
                        words,” Shelley connects the invitation to think the possibility of a
                        counter-world via a poetics that invites its audience to recreate the words
                        of the poet on their own terms, thus rendering poetry itself a proving
                        ground for the equality it desires. </p>
                    <p> In the invitational refrain of the “let,” Shelley gestures towards passive
                        resistance as the political index of the experience of form itself. The
                        Shape, as the symbolic hiatus that begins the poem’s hortatory provocation,
                        prefigures a formal “suspension” that will be translated into the
                        multitude’s “folded arms and looks which are / Weapons of unvanquished war”
                        (l. 319-22). Emptying the poem's content of its action, Shelley evokes form as a
                        moment of utter repose that is simultaneously a moment of supreme agitation
                        that reconfigures the distribution of the sensible, linking the promise of
                        political autonomy as self-rule with the autonomy of the “Shape” of the work
                        of art itself, whose measured (s)words signal the work of art’s heteronomy
                        from things as they are. The “let” in turn invites the reader to take up the
                        role of what Rancière calls the “emancipated spectator.” Just as Schiller’s
                        rereading of Kant articulates an aesthetic that is already dissensus, the
                        multitude’s spectatorship before the spectacle of the masque as antimasque,
                        and the subsequent call for nonviolent resistance in the “let,” actively
                        dismantles “the opposition between viewing and acting”: “emancipation begins
                        . . . when we understand that viewing is also an action that [either]
                        confirms or transforms” the existing distribution of positions (Rancière,
                            <emph>Emancipated </emph>13). As Joseph Tanke explains, for Rancière
                        emancipated art “does not compel viewers to become active” by “dictating the
                        terms of participation”; rather, the formal emptiness and indeterminacy of
                        the Shape requires only “that we insist upon the postulates of equality
                        implied by the aesthetic [regime] of art” (93).</p>
                    <p> Shelley also hints at such postulates in more formally “external” ways.
                        Although <emph>The Mask</emph> appears highly regulated, Shelley employs
                        shifts in the distribution of the poem’s sensible structure and texture that
                        periodically disrupt its apparent uniformity. One such destabilization
                        occurs at the very outset with the pyhrric substitution “As I” slightly
                        modifying the sing-song metre of the poem’s predominant iambic tetrameter;
                        likewise, the frequent use of off-rhyme (“gown-on,” “who-fro”
                        “Hypocrisy-by,” “crown-shone,” and others); the seemingly random
                        distribution of five rather than four line stanzas (stanzas three,
                        thirty-three, thirty-eight, forty-seven, fifty-five, sixty-seven,
                        eighty-two, and the final stanza, ninety-one); and the use of stanzas
                        alternating between one and two principal end-rhymes intermittently strips
                        the veil of familiarity so as to call attention to possible reconfigurations
                        within the poem’s sensible texture. The poem thus affects a play between
                        regularity and irregularity which thematizes the Shape’s ability to bring
                        together opposites, generating an “irregularity in regularity” that turns
                        our attention to the contingency of the existing categories of the sensible,
                        but also towards the paradoxical synthesis of opposites—the violence of
                        nonviolence, the supreme agitation of repose—through which slight
                        displacements in the poem’s formal sensorium provides opportunities to
                        re-shape dominant configurations of the sensible. </p>
                    <p> Nonetheless, Shelley also acknowledges that aesthetics cannot fully
                        determine the political effects it would have on its audience. As Mark
                        Kipperman notes, the poet’s speech only directs the masses to the potential
                        of its self-possession; it does not, and cannot, predict its outcome
                        (“Shelley, Adorno”). This anxiety concerning the outcome of the poem’s
                        effects is reflected in the fact that the “sense” awakened by the Shape
                        gives voice and measure to words of both “joy and fear” (l. 138). Hence, the
                        voice deems it necessary to warn the multitude against violent revenge,
                        rendering the poem’s vision for a new collective a prospect for debate over
                        a freedom that is possible and desirable, but also contingent. The voice of
                        the Earth, an-archically democratic in its voicing of a wrong by which the
                        excluded identify immediately with the universal, functions as a dissensus
                        whose manifestation is an invitation and an incitement towards a future
                        possibility that must be incessantly renewed: “words [that] shall then
                        become / Like oppression’s thundered doom / Ringing through each heart and
                        brain, / Heard again—again—again” (l. 364-68). This indefinite circulation
                        of words that must always be heard again, whose transmission remains
                        uncertain in their circulation “outside any determined relationship of
                        address” (Rancière, <emph>PL </emph>12), thematizes the promise of an
                        an-archic world without hierarchies that constitutes the work of art in the
                        aesthetic regime. </p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Rancière’s exploration of the tensions within the aesthetic regime can
                        potentially help us understand both the Romantic period in broader terms,
                        but also hopefully offer a means to push forward the perennial debates
                        surrounding the relationship between politics and aesthetics in Shelley.
                        Rancière’s theorization of the aesthetic regime complicates received
                        conceptions of the relations between politics and aesthetics, offering a
                        more capacious view that departs from any strictly causal determination. As
                        such, the concept of the aesthetic regime opens even more promising horizons
                        with respect to Romantic texts that on their surface may not appear
                        political at all, or conversely, appear to suffer from a desire to
                        instrumentalize poetry as politics. In so doing, one can rethink the
                        “anarchism” of Romantic aesthetics beyond its conventional senses, while
                        retaining and renewing its anti-authoritarian potentialities beyond the
                        antinomy of aesthetic autonomy and political commitment.</p>
