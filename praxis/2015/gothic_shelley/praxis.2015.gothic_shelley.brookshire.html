            <p>When Shelley published <em>Zastrozzi</em> in 1810, its Gothic conventions had already become a target of satire in the wake
               of anti-Jacobin polemics against the revolutionary zeal expressed in the “Pamphlet
               Wars” (1790-91). Although Shelley was entering an ideological battle that had apparently
               already been won by reactionary anti-Jacobin forces, conservative paranoia provided
               a target-rich environment for a transgressive aesthetic that played upon fears of
               persecution, conspiracy, and libertinism. Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning
               <em>Zastrozzi</em> not as a satire of the Gothic (as several prominent Shelley scholars have suggested)
               nor a mouthpiece (in the character of <em>Zastrozzi</em>) for his own subversive philosophical commitments, but as a diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin
               paranoiac fantasy, expressed through one of their favorite targets of derision—the
               gothic novel.</p>

            </header><br/><div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>Zastrozzi</em> (1810) was Shelley’s first significant publication and reflects his early enthusiasm
                  for the Gothic and sensationalist literature of the period. Both in theme and style, <em>Zastrozzi</em> is indebted to several of Shelley’s favorite Gothic novels, particularly Ann Radcliffe’s <em>The Italian</em> (1797), Matthew G. Lewis’s <em>The Monk</em> (1796), and Charlotte Dacre’s <em>Zofloya</em> (1806). A cursory reading of the novel reveals many obligatory Gothic trappings—an
                  ominous castle, a gloomy cave, a demon-like seductress (Matilda), a hero-victim entrapped
                  by circumstances beyond his control (Verezzi), a spectral villain bent on revenge
                  (Zastrozzi), and shadowy figures of established authority—all saturated with the requisite
                  dose of brooding atmospherics and sublime scenery that often reflect the characters’
                  “distempered” emotional states. Although <em>Zastrozzi</em> lacks the historical scope, descriptive detail, and narrative polish of Shelley’s
                  models, the novel develops an elaborate pursuit-escape narrative trajectory that is
                  both tightly structured and unfolds at an energetic pace, incorporating aspects of
                  Gothic romance, sentimentalist fiction, and the philosophical novel. (For readers
                  unfamiliar with <em>Zastrozzi</em>, see the footnote for a brief synopsis of the novel.)

                           from the society of all he held dear on earth, the victim of secret enemies, and exiled
                           from happiness . . .” (61). Verezzi has been abducted in his sleep and then brought
                           to a cave and chained to a rock by the “sublime” and “malevolent” Zastrozzi, for reasons
                           we are as yet unaware. When a “scintillating flame” of lightning destroys the cavern,
                           Verezzi is able to escape, but is further pursued by Zastrozzi and his co-conspirator

            <p>Although <em>Zastrozzi</em> concludes with a traditional moral resolution that would placate a genteel readership,
               the few contemporary reviews of <em>Zastrozzi</em> were unflattering, if not vitriolic, and no doubt contributed to Shelley’s lifelong
               acrimony towards critical responses to his work in the press. The critical atmosphere
               of the early nineteenth century towards the glut of sensationalist fiction of the
               period is well exemplified in this passage from the following “Prospectus” that was
               submitted in support of the <em>New London Review; or Monthly Report of Authors and Books</em> (1799): “Though no arrogance will be indulged in this publication, whatever disturbs
               the public harmony, insults legal authority, outrages the best regards of the heart,
               invalidates the radical obligations of morality, attacks the vital springs of established
               functions of piety, or in any respect clashes with the sacred forms of decency, however
               witty, elegant, and well written, can be noticed only in terms of severe and unequivocal
               reprehension” (qtd. in Grenby 177).</p>
            <p>In the spirit of such regulative moral criticism, the <em>Critical Review</em>, for example, offered these trenchant observations on Shelley’s “shameless and disgusting
               volume”: “Zastrozzi is one of the most savage and improbable demons that ever issued
               from a diseased brain . . . a more discordant, disgusting, and despicable performance
               has not, we are persuaded, issued from the press for some time.” The review concludes,
               in language used to describe Shelley by future reviewers of his controversial poetry,
               that “We know not when we have felt so much indignation as in the perusal of this
               execrable production. The author of it cannot be too severely reprobated. Not all
               his ‘<em>scintillated eyes</em>,’ his ‘<em>battling emotions</em>,’ his ‘<em>frigorific torpidity</em> of despair,’ nor his ‘<em>Lethean torpor</em>,’ with the rest of his nonsensical and stupid jargon, ought to save him from infamy,
               and his volume from the flames” (329-31). <em>The Gentleman’s Magazine</em> was less dismissive in this pithy, though naive, account: “. . . by placing the scene
               on the Continent, the Author has availed himself of characters and vices which, however
               useful in narratives of this description, thank God, are not to be found in this country”
               (258). Mary Shelley herself, along with Shelley’s early biographers, encapsulates
               a critical perspective that would dominate Shelley studies well into the twentieth
               century: “He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature, but had not fostered
               these tastes at their genuine sources—the romances and chivalry of the middle ages—but
               in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days. Under the influence
               of these he, at the age of fifteen, wrote two short prose romances of slender merit.
               The sentiments and language were exaggerated, the composition imitative and poor”
               (I, 101-2).</p>
            <p>Although less vitriolic than the <em>Critical Review</em>, many Shelley scholars begin discussing Shelley’s Gothic novels and early poetry
               (if they are discussed at all) by offering what amounts to an apology. Shelley’s Gothic
               sensibility is thought to be an embarrassment at worst or a transitional phase at
               best. Kenneth Neill Cameron, for example, writes that Shelley, during his “votary
               of Romance“ period, “was genuinely interested in the mysterious and the occult . .
               . and in his novels he was, from time to time, carried away by his subject . . . but
               he wrote largely with his tongue in his own cheek—delighting, at times, in parodying
               his own style—aware, as he was writing the novels, of their inherent ridiculousness,
               but interested in a quick, schoolboy fame”, and “if Shelley’s gothic novels are bad,
               his horror poetry written in the same period is worse” (28,33). For Cameron, it is
               not until Shelley reads Godwin (“his master”) and assumes his “social duties” that
               his work rises to the level of serious critical attention. A. J. Hartley (following
               Frederick Jones), argues that Shelley’s “‘taste for romances’ definitely ended in
               November, 1810, when he ordered a copy of [Godwin’s <em>Political Justice</em>] from Stockdale” (v). David Seed reads <em>Zastrozzi</em> as a “crude and largely unconscious exploration of sexual fear” and finds the character
               of Zastrozzi to be “banal and a stereotype” (5). Eustace Chesser, in his Freudian
               reading of <em>Zastrozzi</em> (and perhaps channeling Peacock), claims that Shelley “was not a rebel without a
               cause—he had too many causes. He was an introvert with no strong sense of reality.
               . . . His all too short life was a continuous refusal to accept responsibility. He
               never completely grew up. His vision was centred upon the world as he would like it
               to be, not on the world as it is” (12). More forgiving is Frederick Frank, who reads
               <em>Zastrozzi</em> as “a dark fable of identity” (ix) that “combine[s] an expert knowledge of the elaborate
               technology of the Gothic romance and its mandatory apparatus with the future poet’s
               desire to arrive at a Gothic aesthetic through which beauty and horror could be expressed
               simultaneously” (ix). Frank concludes, however, that <em>Zastrozzi</em> is “basically a solipsistic excursion” (x).</p>
            <p>These interpretive approaches minimize the significance of Shelley’s early Gothic
               works in two ways: first, they treat Shelley’s Gothic sensibility as an undisciplined
               exercise of formal mimicry in a tarnished genre that bears little relevance to his
               mature work; and second, they treat the Gothic as a foreign element that is superseded
               by the transcendent idealism of Shelley’s later poetry. Each of these approaches drain
               Shelley’s Gothic of its concrete historical particularity and disavow the antagonisms
               around which his early work circulates. The young Shelley’s construction of a post-Enlightenment
               Gothic subject produces an impasse that is not easily recuperated within the context
               of his later works, which may productively be read as reaction-formations against
               the consequences that such a Gothic subject precipitates. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The most recent studies of Shelley’s Gothic novels, though still few, have been informed
                  by the growing interest in the complex relations between the Gothic and Romanticism,
                  and by the emergence of Gothic studies as a legitimate discipline of scholarly inquiry.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, for example, Michael Gamer’s Romanticism and the Gothic, Robert Miles’s Gothic
                           Writing, Anne Williams’s Art of Darkness: A Poetics of Gothic, and David Richter’s
                           The Progress of Romance.</span></div>
                  </div> As the essays in this volume argue, readers of Shelley’s early Gothic works must lift
                  the painted veil of two centuries of largely dismissive criticism and revisit these
                  works with fresh eyes and an appreciation for the ways in which Shelley delimits the
                  residual “Gothic complex” of symbols in the service of articulating an emergent Romantic
                  revolutionary consciousness. In one his early essays on Shelley’s Gothic novels, Jerrold
                  Hogle shows how <em>Zastrozzi</em> anticipates Shelley’s mature poetry and metaphysical writings, noting that <em>Zastrozzi</em> is “about the higher unity of the self prohibiting its arrival with antitheses of
                  its own making. Every sequence circles back on the mind’s dark chamber where the soul
                  chooses to diffuse and battle itself and thus envelop the chamber in gloom” (85).
                  And in <em>Romantic Narrative</em>, Tilottama Rajan’s post-Lacanian analysis of <em>Zastrozzi</em> reveals the “madness” at the core of Shelley’s exploration of psychosis and perversion,
                  an “irruption of the Real into the Symbolic” that is “staged in the laboratory of
                  a mental theater” (64). While I agree with Hogle and Rajan that Shelley’s early Gothic
                  works stage the antagonistic, intersubjective dynamics of self and Other(s), I argue
                  that <em>Zastrozzi’s</em> significance is deepened even further by considering the literary-political-historical
                  context in which it was written. <em>Zastrozzi</em> not only establishes the “Gothic complex” that Hogle so well describes, but the novel
                  also reflects that complex of symbols and images back into itself to illuminate the
                  late eighteenth-century reactionary fantasies that generate it and against which Shelley
                  would fashion a revised “republicanism” in his subsequent poetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Stephen Behrendt has argued, Shelley often exploits conventional forms to transmit
                  radical ideas,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                           9-53). Cf. also Steven Jones’s Shelley’s Satire.</span></div>
                  </div> so it is not surprising that Shelley would choose the Gothic as a vehicle through
                  which to surreptitiously express his interests. Indeed, one is tempted to read Zastrozzi’s
                  various philosophical exhortations (which Hannah More would have characterized as
                  “speculative infidelity”) in the context of Shelley’s own iconoclastic positions at
                  the time. For example, in series of letters to Hogg between 1810 and 1811 Shelley
                  writes, in language that could have been spoken by Zastrozzi himself: “Oh! I burn
                  with impatience for the moment of Xtianity's dissolution, it has injured me; I swear
                  on the altar of perjured love to revenge myself on the hated cause of the effect which <em>even now</em> I can scarcely help deploring. . . . I swear that never will I forgive Christianity!
                  it is the only point on which I allow myself to encourage revenge. . . . Oh how I
                  wish I <em>were</em> the Antichrist, that it were <em>mine</em> to crush the Demon, to hurl him to his native Hell never to rise again—I expect to
                  gratify some of this insatiable feeling in Poetry” (27–35). In an extended philosophical
                  discussion with Matilda, Zastrozzi expresses the same antipathy to religious orthodoxy:
                  “Am I not convinced of the non-existence of a Deity? am I not convinced that death
                  will but render this soul more free, more unfettered? Why need I then shudder at death?
                  why need any one, whose mind has risen above the shackles of prejudice, the errors
                  of a false and injurious superstition” (153).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Throughout the novel, Zastrozzi argues in favor of a number of often contradictory
               Enlightenment philosophical motifs, from the utilitarian calculus of pleasures and
               pains to Godwinian perfectibilitarianism to mechanistic determinism to, ultimately,
               a self-pitying strain of nihilistic fatalism: “whatever procures pleasure is right”;
               man “was created for no other purpose but to obtain happiness”; “rather than suppose
               that by its own innate and energetical exertions, this soul must endure for ever,
               that no fortuitous occurrences, no incidental events, can affect its happiness; but
               by daring boldly, by striving to verge from the beaten path, whilst yet trammeled
               in the chains of mortality, it will gain superior advantages in a future state”; “fate
               wills us to die: and I intend to meet death, to encounter annihilation with tranquility.”
               Yet despite his avowed atheism, Zastrozzi’s elaborate scheme for revenge against Verezzi
               depends upon the existence of a Christian heaven and hell and the immortality of the
               soul. Reflecting upon the murder of his father, Zastrozzi laments: “But I destroyed
               his <em>body</em> alone . . . time has taught me better: his son’s <em>soul</em> is hell-doomed to all eternity: he destroyed himself; but my machinations, though
               unseen, effected his destruction” (155).</p>
            <p>John Whatley argues that Zastrozzi is “a well-spoken and committed Atheist” (203)
               and that Shelley’s “representatives of atheism and revolution are yet ‘villains’ who
               through conspiracy, deceit, and violence forward social disruption, but they are equally
               fascinating in their power to satirize and undercut Church morality and to allow the
               fulfillment of desire” (209). A closer reading, however, reveals Zastrozzi to be an
               equal-opportunity sophist, more Hobbesian or Machiavellian than Godwinian, who appropriates
               into a bricolage of contradictory positions whatever discourse suits his purposes.
               He may be “well-spoken,” but he is hardly “committed” to any particular cause other
               than revenge. And neither he nor Matilda successfully “undercut Church morality.”
               Matilda ultimately reconciles herself to the Church and Zastrozzi is executed by the
               Inquisition, whose absolute authority is never in doubt and remains fully intact at
               the conclusion of the novel. On the one hand we can point to the hypocritical self-interest
               of Matilda’s religious awakening and Zastrozzi’s Satanic-like resistance against absolute
               authority, but on the other hand we have to ask if such supposed insights are really
               all that subversive? From a progressive standpoint, is Shelley asking us to identify
               with murderers who are, despite their transgressive and liberating ambitions, consumed
               by self-gratification? Is Shelley championing a Bataillean “expenditure” beyond the
               pleasure principle that ultimately seeks to sustain prohibitions for the purpose of
               producing the desire to transgress them? We should perhaps be inclined to take Shelley
               at his word when he admonishes one reader of the novel against confusing his own radicalism
               with that of his characters: “If he takes me for any one whose character I have drawn
               in <em>Zastrozzi</em> he is mistaken quite” (<em>Letters</em> 11).</p>
            <p>Such is the interpretive crux of <em>Zastrozzi</em>, caught in the balance between the reactionary and revolutionary impulses of the
               Gothic aesthetic. Revolutionary desire is always in danger of falling into what Peter
               Starr calls a “logic of specular doubling” or “structural repetition” that mirrors
               the oppressive mechanisms of power it seeks to displace. Starr explains, “If one undertakes
               direct, political action . . . then the logics of specular doubling and structural
               repetition apply. But if one refuses such action, then one’s revolt will at best be
               hopelessly marginal, at worst a reinforcement of institutionalized power” (8). For
               Shelley, the most vivid example of such a scenario would have been the degeneration
               of republicanism into terror during the French Revolution, where, according to Starr,
               revolutionaries became “trapped in a dualistic, paranoid world where rivalry springs
               from the narcissistic illusion of one’s own subjective unity” (9). In the figure of
               Zastrozzi, Shelley demonstrates his budding appreciation for the complexities and
               dangers of revolutionary change and the ways in which desire is inextricably bound
               to even the most abstract of political commitments.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But if Shelley’s aim is simply to diagnose the failings of Enlightenment revolutionary
                  discourse by drawing attention to the destructive desires that underwrite its universalizing
                  drive, then we might expect Shelley to adopt a narrative strategy similar to that
                  employed by Charlotte Dacre in <em>Zofloya</em>. The narrator of <em>Zofloya</em> informs us early on that to understand the transgressive desires of Victoria we must
                  elucidate, in the spirit of Enlightenment curiosity and utilitarian ethics, the “causes”
                  of her destructive behavior: “The historian who would wish his lessons to sink deep
                  into the heart, thereby essaying to render mankind virtuous and more happy, must not
                  content himself with simply detailing a series of events—he must ascertain causes,
                  and follow progressively their effects; he must draw deductions from incidents as
                  they arise, and ever revert to the actuating principle” (3). Throughout the course
                  of the novel, however, the narrator’s attempts to account for Victoria’s increasingly
                  complex desires and motivations seem inadequate, almost to the point of comic absurdity.
                  The failure to reduce Victoria’s subjectivity to a network of causal determinations
                  (for example, negligent parenting), suggests that Dacre’s narration works ironically
                  as a critique of Enlightenment itself, particularly the more dogmatic strains of French
                  mechanistic materialism (La Mettrie’s <em>L’Homme Machine</em> and Holbach’s <em>Systême de la Nature</em>, for example) that reduce human relationships to a scientific model of strict necessity.
                  Shelley’s investment in materialism, however, was strengthening during the period
                  of <em>Zastrozzi</em>’s composition, so he was, perhaps, disinclined to adopt Dacre’s ironic stance toward
                  Enlightenment critical gestures.

                           from which he would not awaken from his own dogmatic slumber until the Alastor volume
                           of 1816. Adriana Cracuin has pointed out that in spite of Zofloya’s transgressive
                           content, Dacre herself was politically conservative. So it stands to reason that she
                           would have been more inclined to critique Enlightenment doctrine than Shelley, who
                           never abandoned the revolutionary principles of the Enlightenment.</span></div>
                  </div> Shelley’s narrator, too, adds a layer of ironic subtext, but from a different ideological
                  perspective. The narrator often pauses to comment upon characters and events from
                  a position of the “Church morality” that Whatley identifies, which signals the narrator’s
                  complicity with conservative ideology and, by extension, with Verezzi. Zastrozzi is
                  admonished for his “sophistry,” and his inability to “contemplate the wonderful operations,
                  the mysterious ways of Providence” (102); and when Matilda prays for God’s forgiveness,
                  the narrator happily reports that “mercy, by the All-benevolent of heaven, is never
                  refused to those humbly, yet trusting in his goodness, ask it” (150). But again, this
                  does not necessarily undercut church morality because, given the exaggerated evil
                  and narcissism of Matilda and Zastrozzi, the disapprobation towards them would be
                  wholly justifiable.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I argue that Shelley deftly subverts conventional ideology while at the same time
                  satisfying its moral prescriptions by splitting the diegetic reality from its subversive
                  subtext, revealing an intersubjective dynamic that complicates any reading of the
                  novel that either reduces the characters to static Gothic stereotypes or that resolves
                  the narrative action within a determinate nexus of cause and effect. Because the narrative
                  is doubly refracted through a conservative lens (the narrator and Verezzi), we must
                  resist the impulse to valorize the characters of Verezzi and Julia at the expense
                  of Matilda and Zastrozzi, who are actually the far more interesting and complicated
                  characters in the novel (and like Milton’s Satan, more “ethical”). The temptation
                  to identify with Verezzi and Julia persists nonetheless, particularly when we consider
                  the similarity between the situation in which Verezzi finds himself at the beginning
                  of the novel and that of Prometheus in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: “Verezzi was chained to a piece of rock which remained immovable. The violence of
                  the storm was past, but the hail descended rapidly, each stone of which wounded his
                  naked limbs. Every flash of lighting, although now distant, dazzled his eyes, unaccustomed
                  as they had been to the least ray of light” (64). Several critics have commented upon
                  the similarity here between Verezzi and Prometheus,

                  the course of the novel and distorts any interpretation of Shelley’s early work through
                  the retroactive gaze of his later treatment of similar themes.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Reading Verezzi as a precursor to the “champion of mankind” strains credulity. As
               much as we might empathize with his suffering, Verezzi is a passive “hero” who represents
               unreflecting, reactionary aristocratic privilege, one of the primary targets of Shelley’s
               subversive critique. Furthermore, Verezzi occupies a space that is traditionally populated
               by female protagonists in Gothic novels: in <em>Zastrozzi</em>, it is the <em>male,</em> rather than a young, virtuous female, who is pursued, confined, and tormented by
               a sublime figure of phallic power—two if we count Matilda and her predatory sexuality.
               Throughout the course of the novel, Verezzi is coded as feminine, and the only feature
               which signifies his masculinity is his choice of love objects. The attitude towards
               gender and power expressed in the novel is ambiguous, subject to continual destabilization
               as Matilda and Verezzi negotiate their gendered positions in relation to one another,
               finally reaching a provisional, though compromised, equilibrium within a common fantasy
               space.</p>
            <p><em>Zastrozzi</em>’s explicit representations of subversion are a <em>semblance</em> designed to alert us to a far more subversive strategy at work in the novel, one
               that is more historically informed than has been previously recognized and that interrogates
               the intellectual context in which it was written. By the time Shelley published <em>Zastrozzi</em> in 1810, the popularity of the Gothic genre was in decline and its conventions had
               already become a target of satire and parody in the wake of the anti-Jacobin backlash
               against the revolutionary zeal expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” of 1790-91. As M.
               O. Grenby argues in <em>The Anti-Jacobin Novel</em>, “The ‘Revolution debate,’ the ‘war of ideas,’ withered away, not because every champion
               of radical doctrine had been utterly converted by the logic of the conservatives,
               but because few of them . . . could be found who wished to defy a near unanimous and
               highly militant anti-Jacobinism to put forward what had suddenly become dangerously
               unorthodox opinions” (5). The young Shelley was not one to shy away from such opinions,
               but he was also sly enough to understand that progressive principles had been perverted
               into monstrous caricatures.</p>
            <p>The ambiguous status of the Gothic’s transgressive revolutionary potential, on the
               one hand, and its reactionary, ameliorative impulse, on the other, participates in
               a larger aesthetic context in which the master signifiers of the Revolutionary era
               were points of bitter contention between those, like Edmund Burke, who framed the
               established authority of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> in sublime terms and the republicanism of Revolution as monstrous; and those, like
               Paine, Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and other Enlightenment progressives, who framed the
               Revolution in sublime terms and the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> as monstrous. Burkean aesthetic categories of the sublime and beautiful reflect the
               predominant eighteenth-century hierarchy: sublime qualities of nobility, reason, and
               awe are associated with men; and beautiful qualities such as passion, friendship,
               and elegance are associated with women. For Burke, the feudal political structure
               of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span>, both in England and France, represents a sublime political structure that inspires
               awe, admiration, and respect for a powerful patriarchal authority founded on centuries
               of political, ecclesiastical, and social tradition. The following passage from Burke’s
               <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> is typical: “We fear God; we look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments,
               with duty to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility.
               Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so
               affected; because all other feelings are false and spurious, and tend to corrupt our
               minds, to vitiate our primary morals, and make us unfit for rational liberty” (76).
               The hegemonic struggle between Jacobin and anti-Jacobin factions to define and control
               the meaning of master signifiers such as “freedom,” “nature,” “progress,” “necessity,”
               “good,” “evil,” “masculine,” “feminine,” etc., finds its aesthetic counterpart in
               the Gothic literature (“sickening trash,” as one <em>Quarterly Review</em> critic put it) produced during the apex of its popularity in the 1790s and early
               1800s.</p>
            <p>The anti-Jacobin fiction of the period emphasizes the dangers to British social stability
               when challenged by the “new philosophy” of Enlightenment progressives. Clara Reeve
               writes, for instance, in her preface to <em>Memoirs of Sir Roger de Clarendon</em> (1793): “The new philosophy of the present day avows a levelling principle, and declares
               that a state of anarchy is more beautiful than that of order and regularity. There
               is nothing more likely to convince mankind of the errors of these men, than to set
               before them examples of good government, and warnings of the mischievous consequences
               of their own principles” (xvi-xvii). Anne Thomas, in <em>Adolphus de Biron</em> (1795?) writes: “I must, however, acknowledge that we have some restless Spirits
               amongst us, who by their seditious Writings have contributed no a little to the Work
               of Destruction . . . I thank Heaven the number of such Miscreants is but small, when
               compared to the Spirit of the whole Nation” (Grenby 104). And Robert Dallas writes,
               in <em>Percival, or Nature Vindicated. A Novel</em> (1801): “Men who born to fortune are appointed by Providence to the administration
               of a certain portion of the interests of the world: they are the helmsmen of happiness;
               and if they desert the wheel, is there any wonder that the even course should be lost?”

                  that after only thirty-six issues the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> disbanded in 1798, declaring that “the SPELL of <em>Jacobin invulnerability</em> is now broken.”

                           Shelley read the work out loud to Mary on 9 October 1814, a day before Mary herself

                  fantasy, delivered through one of their favorite targets of derision—the Gothic novel.
                  From the perspective of the anti-Jacobin imaginary, nothing could be seen as more
                  threatening to the normative hetero-patriarchal circuit of regulated desire—as exemplified
                  by Verezzi and Julia—than the sexually aggressive Matilda and the violently atheistic
                  Zastrozzi, two exceptions against which the stability of traditional British social
                  hierarchy were grounded. If Matilda and Verezzi’s father signify the moral corruption
                  of the élite, then Zastrozzi, in the form of an obscene surplus, signifies the illegitimate
                  product of such corruption. And Verezzi, although unknowingly, contributes to that
                  corruption himself when he finally submits to Matilda’s seduction and forsakes his
                  love for Julia.</p>

               <p>When we consider Zastrozzi’s bricolage of contradictory Enlightenment rhetoric, his
                  murderous desire for revenge, and his illegitimacy (which signifies a generalized
                  threat to primogeniture and social hierarchy), from Verezzi’s perspective Zastrozzi
                  embodies the paranoiac image of the Jacobin monster. And Matilda, whose excessive
                  sexual degeneracy reads like a case study from Bienville’s <em>Nymphomania</em> (1775), embodies the paranoiac image of a fully pathological subject whose actions
                  are determined solely by contingent self-interest. Matilda, like her namesake in Lewis’ <em>The Monk</em> and like Victoria in Dacre’s <em>Zofloya</em>, is described by the narrator (whose complicity with the anti-Jacobin imaginary should
                  not be overlooked) in similarly demonic terms—“wily,” “perfidious,” “syren,” “ferocious,”
                  “frantic,” “delirious,” “horror-tranced,” and “wretched.” And, as Alenka Zupancic
                  observes, “what is a demon if not a fully pathological subject?”

               the dominant ideology itself. In <em>Zastrozzi</em>, the <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> of the feminine Other (Matilda) is figured as a nymphomaniac, and the <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> of the masculine Other (Zastrozzi) is figured as a bloodthirsty revolutionary. The
               paranoiac image of the Other, therefore, condenses a constellation of indistinct fears,
               threats, and desires, and functions as a defense against the breakdown of phallic
               structures of power that depend upon the stability of binary oppositions and upon
               the regulation of the metonymic movement of desire along the chain of signifiers.
               Although Shelley represents Matilda and Zastrozzi as images drawn from anti-Jacobin
               paranoiac fantasy, those images do not remain static throughout the course of the
               novel, nor are they simply caricatures of conventional Gothic villains. The only static
               characters are Verezzi and Julia. Verezzi is a MacKenzian man of feeling who finds
               himself thrust from the pleasures of sentimentality into a Gothic nightmare of violent
               sensibility and conspiratorial danger. He remains transfixed by Zastrozzi’s impenetrable
               gaze, paralyzed by fear: “. . . Verezzi stood bewildered, and unable to arrange the
               confusion of ideas which floated in his brain, and assailed his terror-struck imagination.
               He knew not what to believe—what phantom it could be that, in the shape of Zastrozzi,
               blasted his straining eye-balls— . . .” (90). Although we, as readers, eventually
               learn Zastrozzi’s identity and his reasons for pursuing Verezzi, Verezzi himself never
               does. Thus there is no meaningful interaction between the two; they exist for each
               other only as image-objects. So if we claim that <em>Zastrozzi</em> poses a thought experiment in which the subject of aristocratic privilege encounters
               in reality the monsters he has created in paranoiac fantasy, might we not also argue
               that Zastrozzi sees Verezzi only as an image of the aristocratic oppression that has
               denied him entrance into the socio-symbolic order?</p>
            <p>The conservative ideology of the narrator makes it difficult to sustain such a reversal,
               but the implication is there and points to how revolutionary and reactionary discourses
               engage each other only through the conflict between fantasmic materializations of
               their own lack. We can further unpack these relations in Lacanian terms. Verezzi misrecognizes
               Zastrozzi, mistaking him as a phallic signifier rather than as a signifier of the
               barred Other. According to Lacan, the phallus is an object that materializes the lack
               in the <em>symbolic</em> order, gives it a fascinating, powerful presence; whereas the signifier of the barred
               Other is an object that signifies this lack itself. Thus Lacan can claim that the
               phallic object is a signifier without a signified. Zastrozzi, as a fantasmic condensation
               of anti-Jacobin fear, doesn’t exist. He signifies the lack in the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> social hierarchy itself, the reminder (as a remainder) that society does not exist
               as a harmonious totality. As Zizek explains, the phallus is at once a sign of power,
               but also signifies lack: “The phallic signifier is, so to speak, an index of its own
               impossibility . . . . This logic of the phallic inversion sets in when the demonstration
               of power starts to function as a confirmation of a fundamental impotence” (<em>Sublime</em> 157). Only at the conclusion of the novel, after Verezzi has already committed suicide,
               do we as readers learn what lies behind Zastrozzi’s display of phallic power: in reality
               he is Verezzi’s illegitimate half-brother, an impotent figure in the context of the
               predominant social hierarchy.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Zastrozzi, however, sustains his phallic presence, even after being tried and sentenced
                  to death by the Inquisition: “He looked around him. His manner awed the tumultuous
                  multitude; and, in uninterrupted silence, the spectators gazed upon the unappalled
                  Zastrozzi, who, towering as a demi-god, stood in the midst” (154). Why, after learning
                  of his identity, of his illegitimate birth, and of his past murders, do the spectators
                  and council still confer upon Zastrozzi the image of sublime phallic authority? Part
                  of the answer lies, no doubt, in the mesmerizing theatricality of Zastrozzi’s performance.
                  He both fascinates and frightens those who are caught within his gaze. As a paranoiac
                  image of the Jacobin monster, we see how such sublime images are cultural productions
                  that serve a necessary role in the anti-Jacobin imaginary. To demystify the paranoiac
                  image would be to lose the very object against which a reactionary ideology defines
                  itself. The spectators, therefore, are invested in their “willing suspension of disbelief”
                  (to appropriate Coleridge’s phrase) and are not inclined to give up their investment
                  in the sublime image of the Other. For Shelley, who seeks to re-mobilize the founding
                  principles of Republican ideology, Zastrozzi functions as a “surface appearance” “draped
                  over the irrational” fears of reactionary ideology.

            <p>Matilda too is figured as a phallic object, which, not surprisingly, creates difficulties
               in her attempts to seduce Verezzi. Matilda occupies an especially dangerous position
               for Verezzi because she represents the possibility, in fantasy, of the full realization
               of the sexual relationship. She is beautiful, sexually uninhibited, culturally sophisticated,
               and presumably a woman of social standing, like his fiancée Julia. From a distance
               she engenders an alluring fascination, but approached too closely she becomes the
               monstrous Thing that threatens to annihilate his genteel subjectivity. To seduce Verezzi,
               Matilda must masquerade as his object-cause of desire, what Lacan calls the <span class="foreign">objet petit a</span>. Matilda must <em>desublimate</em> herself from a phallic object of terrifying <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> into a compelling image of socially sanctioned desire.</p>
            <p>According to Lacan's sexuation formulas, the masculine subject identifies with the
               female as the <span class="foreign">objet petit a</span>; that is, she must occupy the place of the object-cause of desire in his fantasy
               scenario, she must “fit his formula” (Zizek, <em>Plague</em> 8). As Emily Apter points out, “There is no absolute femininity beneath the veil,
               only a set of ontologically tenuous codes that normatively induct the feminine subject
               into the social practice of ‘being’ woman through mimesis and parroting” (243). There
               is no mystery concerning Matilda’s desire: “I adore you to madness—I love you to distraction.
               If you have one spark of compassion, let me not sue in vain—reject not one who feels
               it impossible to overcome the fatal, resistless passion which consumes her” (83).
               Verezzi’s response to Matilda is one of “cold esteem,” but in the following passage
               we get a glimpse of how Matilda will indeed figure herself as the object of his desire:
               <span class="quote">‘He could not love Matilda; and though he never had seen her but in the most amiable
                  light, he found it impossible to feel any sentiment towards her, save cold esteem.
                  Never had he beheld those dark shades in her character, which if developed could excite
                  nothing but horror and detestation . . . as such he pitied her: but still could he
                  not help observing a comparison between her and Julia, whose feminine delicacy shrunk
                  from the slightest suspicion, even of indecorum. Her fragile form, her mild heavenly
                  countenance, was contrasted with all the partiality of love, to the scintillating
                  eye, the commanding countenance, the bold expressive gaze, of Matilda. (84)’</span> To successfully seduce Verezzi, Matilda must appeal to the narcissistic component
               of his sexual economy. Verezzi resists Matilda for much of the novel, but as she begins
               to understand how to incite his desire, Verezzi’s image of her softens: ““Emotions
               of pity, of compassion, for one whose only fault he supposed to be love for him, conquered
               V’s softened soul” (86). And a bit later: <span class="quote">‘Still did he feel his soul irresistibly softened towards Matilda—her love for him
                  flattered his vanity; and though he could not feel reciprocal affection towards her,
                  yet her kindness in rescuing him from his former degraded situation, her altered manner
                  towards him, and her unremitting endeavours to please, to humour him in every thing,
                  called for his warmest, his sincerest gratitude. (88-89)’</span> Matilda’s “altered manner,” which “she knew well how to assume,” coupled with the
               beauty of her “symmetrical form,” finally begins to work: “By affecting to coincide
               with him in every thing—by feigning to possess that congeniality of sentiment and
               union of idea, which he thought so necessary to the existence of love, she doubted
               not soon to accomplish her purpose” (115). Matilda does indeed “accomplish her purpose,”
               but only after she has managed to substitute herself in the place formerly occupied
               by Julia, whom Verezzi now believes to have been murdered by Zastrozzi: “Oh Matilda!
               dearest, angelic Matilda! . . . I am even now unconscious what blinded me—what kept
               me from acknowledging my adoration of thee!—adoration never to be changed by circumstances—never
               effaced by time” (129). Matilda has successfully broken Verezzi’s melancholic fixation
               on the lost object of his desire and entered his fantasy frame as the <span class="foreign">object-cause</span> of his “unconscious” desire.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Throughout the course of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda undergo a metamorphic shift
                  from powerful, phallic objects of paranoiac fantasy to impotent subjects that reveal
                  a fundamental split subjectivity beneath the fascinating spectacle. Shelley’s antagonists,
                  Matilda and Zastrozzi, express a subjectivity that is far more complex than his protagonists,
                  Verezzi and Julia. The actions of Matilda and Zastrozzi can be productively read in
                  terms of Kant’s distinction between “radical” and “diabolical” evil, which he discusses
                  in <em>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone. </em>Radical evil is an ethical position in which one’s actions are determined solely by
                  pathological motives. The pathological subject <em>chooses</em> self-interest and gratification at the expense of the other. Diabolical evil characterizes
                  a position in which the subject adopts the pursuit of evil itself as a moral maxim
                  (i.e., a categorical imperative in the form of Milton’s Satanic “Evil be thou my good.”),
                  even at the expense of one’s own pathological interests, or even one’s life.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Matilda clearly is a candidate for radical evil, and Zastrozzi for diabolical evil.
               Matilda violently pursues her passions until her self-interest is at stake. After
               Matilda kills Julia, she suddenly begins to reflect upon the eternal consequences:
               “The guilty Matilda shrunk at death—she let fall the upraised dagger—her soul had
               caught a glimpse of the misery which awaits the wicked hereafter, and, in spite of
               her contempt of religion—spite of her, till now, too firm dependence on the doctrines
               of atheism, she trembled at futurity; and a voice from within, which whispers “thou
               shalt never die!” spoke daggers to Matilda’s soul” (143). Zastrozzi, however, suffers
               no such spiritual crisis, and pursues his maxim of revenge, even at the expense of
               his own life. He informs the Council: “ ‘. . . I know my doom; and, instead of horror,
               experience some degree of satisfaction at the arrival of death, since all I have to
               do on earth is completed.’ . . . Even whilst writhing under the agony of almost unsupportable
               torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s firmness failed him not; but, upon
               his soul-illumined countenance, played a smile of most disdainful scorn; and, with
               a wild, convulsive laugh of exulting revenge—he died” (156).</p>
            <p>The demonic subjects of radical and diabolical evil are, thus, consistent with the
               paranoiac image of the transgressive Other. But as Kant argues, although absolute
               freedom is impossible and we cannot purify ourselves completely from our pathological
               determinations (we are after all trapped in finite, material bodies) we can exercise
               our freedom by choosing the <em>way</em> in which we are determined. What distinguishes Shelley’s Gothic (and here we can
               see the emergence of a Romantic Gothicism), is the self-reflexivity and psychological
               dissonance that his Gothic antagonists experience. These moments are not explored
               in depth in the novel—the narrator is too anxious to propel Matilda and Zastrozzi
               into their next heinous deed—but they appear nonetheless and constitute a kind of
               textual unconscious that compels us to peer beyond the paranoiac image and consider
               Matilda and Zastrozzi as subjects rather than simply as objects of paranoiac fantasy.
               There are several moments when Matilda pauses to reflect upon her actions, and in
               these moments we recognize her as a split subject: “I almost shudder . . . at the
               sea of wickedness on which I am about to embark! But still, Verezzi—ah! for him would
               I even lose my hopes of eternal happiness. In the sweet idea of calling him mine,
               no scrupulous delicacy, no mistaken superstitious idea, shall prevent me from deserving
               him by daring acts— . . .” (79). A moment later she exclaims: “Oh, madness! Madness!”
               . . . “is it for this that I have plunged into the dark abyss of crime?—is it for
               this that I have despised the delicacy of my sex, and, braving consequences, have
               offered my love to one who despises me—who shuns me, as does the barbarous Verezzi?”
               (82). And this iconic image, in which Matilda sits perched like a gargoyle overlooking
               a sublime display of nature’s destructive energy, captures perfectly Matilda’s status
               as both fantasmic object and split subject: “Matilda sat upon a fragment of jutting
               granite, and contemplated the storm which raged around her. The portentous calm, which
               at intervals occurred amid the reverberating thunder, portentous of a more violent
               tempest, resembled the serenity which spread itself over Matilda’s mind—a serenity
               only to be succeeded by a fiercer paroxysm of passion” (119).</p>
            <p>Even Zastrozzi has moments, though few, of conscientious reflection that suggest a
               moral capacity for guilt: “Zastrozzi sat for some time immersed in heart-rending contemplations;
               but though conscience for awhile reflected his past life in images of horror, again
               was his heart steeled by fiercest vengeance . . . “ (75); and “. . . he thought of
               his past life, and his awakened conscience reflected images of horror. But again revenge
               drowned the voice of virtue—again passion obscured the light of reason, and his steeled
               soul persisted in its scheme” (68). This guilt-inducing “voice of virtue” that reflects
               “images of horror” speaks <em>through</em> and <em>for</em> Matilda and Zastrozzi. As Mladen Dolar explains, “. . . the surplus of the superego
               over the Law is precisely the surplus of the voice; the superego has a voice, the
               Law is stuck with the letter” (14). The specular doubling, fears of persecution, and
               encounters with the <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> of the Other that drive the action of Shelley’s <em>Zaztrozzi</em>, <em>St. Irvyne</em>, and <em>The Wandering Jew</em>, are early attempts to explore and understand the psychological dissonances associated
               with a failed encounter with the Other (as language, culture, ideology) and others
               (individual egos, including the subject’s own).</p>
            <p>Finally, I want to draw attention to Shelley’s most effective strategy for representing
               the subjectivization of the paranoiac image. Critics who interpret the images and
               actions of Matilda and Zastrozzi only in terms of Verezzi’s state of mind, as images
               drawn from the unconscious of his own psychological processes, miss the radical intersubjectivity
               at work among all of the characters. And those, like Whatley, who suggest that Matilda
               and Zastrozzi are the only characters who are allowed to “fulfill their desire,” we
               must ask the question: whose desire? In Lacanian terms, the “subject’s desire is always
               the desire of the Other.” That is, desire can be <em>for</em> the Other, determined <em>by </em>the Other, or a desire <em>for the Other’s desire</em>—the “Other” being either the “big Other” itself (the symbolic register of language,
               ideology, culture, etc. out of which the effect of subjectivity is precipitated) or
               other individual others with whom one interacts. The most terrifying or uncanny moments
               in Shelley’s Gothic occur when characters discover (or we as readers discover despite
               the characters’ limited knowledge of their own self-experience) that their desire
               is not their own, that their free-will is an illusion and that their actions are determined
               by the desires of the Other as they are internalized in the formations of the ego,
               ego-ideal and superego.</p>
            <p><em>Zastrozzi</em> stages the process through which the desire of the Other is internalized, transferred,
               expressed, and subverted. For example, we can briefly restate the action of the novel
               in the following terms: Zastrozzi assumes for himself the desire of his mother, which
               sets in motion his merciless schemes to destroy Verezzi. Split between the “desire
               of the m(O)ther” and the “name of the father,” Zastrozzi occupies a perverse position
               as the object-instrument of his disgraced mother’s desire for retribution: “‘Never
               shall I forgot her last commands.—My son,’ said she, ‘my Pietrino, revenge my wrongs—revenge
               them on the perjured Verezzi—revenge them on his progeny for ever’” (155). Matilda,
               in her union with Verezzi, assumes as her own the desire of Julia, and Matilda’s desire
               does not reach its object until she murders Julia. Matilda’s stated desire actually
               masks her real desire, which is to destroy her sexual and social rival: “. . . Julia
               must die, and expiate the crime of daring to rival me, with her hated blood” (79).
               “‘Julia, the hated, accursed Julia’s image, is the phantom which scares my otherwise
               certain confidence of eternal delight: could she but be hurled to destruction— . .
               .’” (131). Matilda’s phallic, destructive intensity, so well-veiled to Verezzi, finally
               reaches its apex when Matilda murders Julia in a “ferocious” confluence of desire
               and <span class="foreign">jouissance</span>: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">“Nerved anew by this futile attempt to escape her vengeance, the ferocious Matilda
                  seized Julia’s floating hair, and holding her back with fiend-like strength, stabbed
                  her in a thousand places; and, with exulting pleasure, again and again buried the
                  dagger to the hilt in her body, even after all remains of life were annihilated.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p> In this moment, Shelley’s subjectivized paranoiac image reverts back to its original,
               horrifying presence, which ultimately realizes the desire of both the narrator and
               reader as reactionary others. Reactionary desire is satisfied, even though Shelley
               had frustrated that desire by subjectivizing the paranoiac images of Zastrozzi and
               Matilda. They reassume their status as Jacobin monsters, thus confirming the obscene
               enjoyment that underlies the reactionary ethical stance. And by committing suicide,
               Verezzi, ironically, assumes as his own the desire of Zastrozzi. Thus, the actions
               of these “others” can only be understood within the larger context of the “big Other”
               (the patriarchal symbolic), from which both Zastrozzi and Matilda are excluded—Zastrozzi,
               as the illegitimate offspring of Verezzi’s father, and Matilda, whose sexual passion
               for Verezzi threatens the stability of the fully regulated sexual relationship, as
               exemplified by Verezzi and Julia. <em>Zastrozzi</em> draws attention to the inter-subjective relations that actually drive and sustain
               the paranoiac fantasy, but Shelley is also careful to maintain the tension between
               the demystification of the fantasy and its reduction to an explanatory network of
               causal relations, which would empty the Gothic of its uncanny effects and reduce it
               to a species of the philosophical novel.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Verezzi’s traumatic encounters with Zastrozzi and Matilda exemplify not only the rigidity
                  of Burkean aesthetic categories, but also the limitations of a moral psychology derived
                  from either Smithian sympathetic identification or a Benthamian utilitarian calculus
                  of pleasures and pains. As a consequence of the attempt to establish a subjective
                  position free from the artificial and corrupted determinations of culture, tradition,
                  and ecclesiastical authority, the Enlightenment <span class="foreign">philosophes</span> were faced with the difficult problem of formulating an ethics grounded in “natural
                  disposition” and confirmed by presumably universal affects such as pleasure and pain.
                  An ethics derived from sympathetic identification with the other, however, suffers
                  from the problem of what to do if identification with the other is <em>impossible</em>.

                           justify a carefully regulated form of revenge against an implacable other. Here, respect
                           for the other extends only so far as it is reflected through a narcissistic gaze founded
                           on similarity: ‘A person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to
                           insults, without attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We cannot enter into
                           his indifference and insensibility: we call his behaviour mean‑spiritedness, and are
                           as really provoked by it as by the insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enrage…</span></div>
                  </div> In other words, an ethics of sympathy, when pushed to its limits results in a narcissistic
                  reflection of one’s own values and we sympathize with those whose values fundamentally
                  reflect our own. In Verezzi’s unbearable encounters with the inscrutable gaze of Zastrozzi
                  and the threatening sexuality of Matilda, Shelley’s Gothic compels us to consider
                  a crucial question that would preoccupy him throughout his career: how does one respond
                  when sympathetic identification with the Other is impossible, when the inscrutable
                  desire of the Other presses too close and threatens the consistency of one’s subjectivity?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If the Enlightenment critical procedure is to demystify the image of the Other (nature,
                  sexual difference, power, etc.) by bringing it under the determinations of the symbolic,
                  then the Gothic strategy would be to reveal how this determined image is non-identical
                  with itself.

                  </div> The demystification of Gothic effects, as exemplified in Radcliffe for example, may
                  indeed reveal the illusions produced through epistemological error, but the price
                  to be paid for this demystification is a further mystification of the network of intersubjective
                  relations that point to another register of the Gothic, the “real” of desire, i.e.
                  the impenetrable desire of the Other and its irreducible excess, the engine which
                  drives paranoiac fantasies of conspiracy and persecution, the implications of which
                  were not lost on David Hume who, in <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>, writes:<span class="quote">‘For what is more capricious than human actions? What more inconstant than the desires
                     of man? And what creature departs more widely, not only from right reason, but from
                     his own character and disposition? An hour, a moment is sufficient to make him change
                     from one extreme to another, and overturn what cost the greatest pain and labour to
                     establish. Necessity is regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and uncertain.
                     (184)’</span> While the Gothic—in its figurative and narrative extravagance—may at first appear
                  to be an unsuitable aesthetic mode through which to ground concrete ideological critique,
                  Shelley deftly subverts the diegetic reality of the narrative in favor of a reality
                  that explores the socio-psychological dynamic that creates the dialectical tension
                  between transgressive revolutionary action and paranoiac conservative reaction.

                  </div> And perhaps most fundamentally, Shelley raises the following question: To what extent
                  are those who are excluded from or marginalized within the dominant ideology still
                  subject to its norms and prohibitions?</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In his <em>Memoirs of Shelley</em>, Thomas Love Peacock cites <em>The Cenci</em> as one of the few times Shelley “descended into the arena of reality” (73), but it
                  is in his early Gothic novels that Shelley first grounds abstract philosophical, social,
                  sexual, and ethical antagonisms within the concrete register of intersubjective relations.
                  The “ineffectual Angel” strain of criticism—the result of a complicated cultural machine

                           H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, “Shelley’s Reputation before 1960,” in Shelley’s Poetry

                  </div>—has long since been displaced by the post-structuralist Shelley who deconstructs
                  the concrete representations of diegetic reality to reveal the abstract structures
                  of language and ideology which produce the subjective effect of reality. The antagonisms
                  generated between the concrete particularity of self-experience and the abstract categories
                  through which it is mediated drives much of the productive tension in Shelley’s mature
                  work and sustains its enduring Gothic sensibility. Although similar, I do not equate
                  the post-structuralist subject with the Gothic subject, nor the post-structuralist
                  Shelley with the Gothic Shelley. The difference between the two hinges on the status
                  of the “object,” or rather, the persistence of the object; i.e, the remainder of the
                  real that resists symbolization and therefore cannot be reduced to or recuperated
                  within the socio-symbolic field—another example of the non-identity of a concept with
                  itself. These antagonisms of non-identity will continue to haunt the post-Enlightenment
                  revolutionary agency that Shelley articulates in later works such as <em>Prometheus Unbound,</em> a touchstone text that exemplifies Shelley’s attempt to transcend the antagonisms
                  he explored in his early Gothic novels and poetry and to comprehend the psychopathology
                  of power itself.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">As the novel opens we find the “wretched” Verezzi, the ostensible protagonist, “[t]orn
               from the society of all he held dear on earth, the victim of secret enemies, and exiled
               from happiness . . .” (61). Verezzi has been abducted in his sleep and then brought
               to a cave and chained to a rock by the “sublime” and “malevolent” Zastrozzi, for reasons
               we are as yet unaware. When a “scintillating flame” of lightning destroys the cavern,
               Verezzi is able to escape, but is further pursued by Zastrozzi and his co-conspirator
               Matilda, whose sexual passion for Verezzi threatens to separate him from his fiancée
               Julia, whom we meet in the flesh only much later in the novel. In collaboration with
               the “wily” Matilda, Zastrozzi sets out to murder Julia and recapture Verezzi so that
               Matilda can continue her seduction and win his heart (although, unknown to Matilda,
               Zastrozzi’s murderous intent extends ultimately to Verezzi). 
               <p class="noCount">When Zastrozzi fails to kill Julia, Matilda falsely informs Verezzi that Julia is
                  dead and continues, though unsuccessfully, to seduce Verezzi and erase the memory
                  of Julia from his distempered mind. To that end, Zastrozzi devises a plan in which
                  he feigns an attempt to murder Verezzi, at which point Matilda rushes in and shields
                  him, sustaining only minor injuries. Believing Julia to be dead and Matilda to have
                  been his saviour, Verezzi, in a “Lethean torpor” at last professes his love to Matilda
                  and consents to marriage. Soon after, Zastrozzi arranges a meeting in which Julia
                  confronts Verezzi and Matilda. Dumbfounded at the sight of Julia and overcome with
                  guilt, Verezzi commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest. Matilda then plucks
                  the blood-stained dagger from Verezzi's corpse, and in a frenzy of rage stabs the
                  innocent Julia “with exulting pleasure, again and again,” burying “the dagger to the
                  hilt in her body, even after all remains of life were annihilated” (143). </p>
               <p class="noCount">The guilty parties are eventually discovered and brought before the authorities, where
                  Zastrozzi confesses that he is actually Verezzi’s illegitimate half-brother and has
                  sought vengeance against Verezzi on behalf of his disgraced mother (possibly a prostitute)
                  who was abandoned by their father, whom he had murdered before the events of the novel
                  take place. At the conclusion of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda are sentenced to
                  execution by the Council of Ten for their murderous conspiracy. Although Matilda finally
                  repents and reconciles herself with the Catholic Church, Zastrozzi unrepentantly and
                  defiantly continues to express his “atheism” and disdain for institutional morality,
                  even at the expense of his own life: “Even whilst writhing under the agony of almost
                  insupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s firmness failed him not;
                  but, upon his soul-illumined countenance, played a smile of most disdainful scorn;
                  and, with a wild, convulsive laugh of exulting revenge—he died” (156). Vengeance and
                  transgressive sexual desires are punished, illegitimate threats to class structure
                  and established authority are eliminated, and the equilibrium of the status quo is
                  restored.</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               herself read <em>Zastrozzi</em> (see <em>Journal,</em> p. 19). See also Robert Miles’ essay in this volume on Shelley’s conspiratorial imagination.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               other. Here, respect for the other extends only so far as it is reflected through
               a narcissistic gaze founded on similarity: <span class="quote">‘A person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to insults, without
                  attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We cannot enter into his indifference
                  and insensibility: we call his behaviour mean‑spiritedness, and are as really provoked
                  by it as by the insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see any man
                  submit patiently to affronts and ill usage. They desire to see this insolence resented,
                  and resented by the person who suffers from it. They cry to him with fury to defend,
                  or to revenge himself. If his indignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud and
                  sympathize with it. It enlivens their own indignation against his enemy, whom they
                  rejoice to see him attack in turn, and are as really gratified by his revenge, provided
                  it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done to themselves. (45)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
