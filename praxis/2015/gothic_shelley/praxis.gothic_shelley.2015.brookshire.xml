                <p rend="noCount">When Shelley published <title level="m"
                    >Zastrozzi</title> in 1810, its Gothic conventions had already become a target
                    of satire in the wake of anti-Jacobin polemics against the revolutionary zeal
                    expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” (1790-91). Although Shelley was entering an
                    ideological battle that had apparently already been won by reactionary anti-Jacobin
                    forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich environment for a transgressive
                    aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution, conspiracy, and libertinism.
                    Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
                    not as a satire of the Gothic (as several prominent Shelley scholars have suggested)
                    nor a mouthpiece (in the character of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>) for his
                    own subversive philosophical commitments, but as a diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin
                    paranoiac fantasy, expressed through one of their favorite targets of derision—the
                    gothic novel.</p>

                <p>
                    <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) was Shelley’s first significant
                    publication and reflects his early enthusiasm for the Gothic and sensationalist
                    literature of the period. Both in theme and style, <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> is indebted to several of Shelley’s favorite Gothic
                    novels, particularly Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The Italian</title>
                    (1797), Matthew G. Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title> (1796), and
                    Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title> (1806). A cursory reading of
                    the novel reveals many obligatory Gothic trappings—an ominous castle, a gloomy
                    cave, a demon-like seductress (Matilda), a hero-victim entrapped by
                    circumstances beyond his control (Verezzi), a spectral villain bent on revenge
                    (Zastrozzi), and shadowy figures of established authority—all saturated with the
                    requisite dose of brooding atmospherics and sublime scenery that often reflect
                    the characters’ “distempered” emotional states. Although <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> lacks the historical scope, descriptive detail, and
                    narrative polish of Shelley’s models, the novel develops an elaborate
                    pursuit-escape narrative trajectory that is both tightly structured and unfolds
                    at an energetic pace, incorporating aspects of Gothic romance, sentimentalist
                    fiction, and the philosophical novel. (For readers unfamiliar with <title
                        level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, see the footnote for a brief synopsis of the
                        novel.)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As the novel opens we find the
                        “wretched” Verezzi, the ostensible protagonist, “[t]orn from the society of
                        all he held dear on earth, the victim of secret enemies, and exiled from
                        happiness . . .” (61). Verezzi has been abducted in his sleep and then
                        brought to a cave and chained to a rock by the “sublime” and “malevolent”
                        Zastrozzi, for reasons we are as yet unaware. When a “scintillating flame”
                        of lightning destroys the cavern, Verezzi is able to escape, but is further
                        pursued by Zastrozzi and his co-conspirator Matilda, whose sexual passion
                        for Verezzi threatens to separate him from his fiancée Julia, whom we meet
                        in the flesh only much later in the novel. In collaboration with the “wily”
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi sets out to murder Julia and recapture Verezzi so that
                        Matilda can continue her seduction and win his heart (although, unknown to
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi’s murderous intent extends ultimately to Verezzi). <p
                            rend="noCount"> When Zastrozzi fails to kill Julia, Matilda falsely
                            informs Verezzi that Julia is dead and continues, though unsuccessfully,
                            to seduce Verezzi and erase the memory of Julia from his distempered
                            mind. To that end, Zastrozzi devises a plan in which he feigns an
                            attempt to murder Verezzi, at which point Matilda rushes in and shields
                            him, sustaining only minor injuries. Believing Julia to be dead and
                            Matilda to have been his saviour, Verezzi, in a “Lethean torpor” at last
                            professes his love to Matilda and consents to marriage. Soon after,
                            Zastrozzi arranges a meeting in which Julia confronts Verezzi and
                            Matilda. Dumbfounded at the sight of Julia and overcome with guilt,
                            Verezzi commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest. Matilda then
                            plucks the blood-stained dagger from Verezzi's corpse, and in a frenzy
                            of rage stabs the innocent Julia “with exulting pleasure, again and
                            again,” burying “the dagger to the hilt in her body, even after all
                            remains of life were annihilated” (143). </p><p rend="noCount"> The
                            guilty parties are eventually discovered and brought before the
                            authorities, where Zastrozzi confesses that he is actually Verezzi’s
                            illegitimate half-brother and has sought vengeance against Verezzi on
                            behalf of his disgraced mother (possibly a prostitute) who was abandoned
                            by their father, whom he had murdered before the events of the novel
                            take place. At the conclusion of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda are
                            sentenced to execution by the Council of Ten for their murderous
                            conspiracy. Although Matilda finally repents and reconciles herself with
                            the Catholic Church, Zastrozzi unrepentantly and defiantly continues to
                            express his “atheism” and disdain for institutional morality, even at
                            the expense of his own life: “Even whilst writhing under the agony of
                            almost insupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s
                            firmness failed him not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance,
                            played a smile of most disdainful scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive
                            laugh of exulting revenge—he died” (156). Vengeance and transgressive
                            sexual desires are punished, illegitimate threats to class structure and
                            established authority are eliminated, and the equilibrium of the status
                            quo is restored.</p></note></p>
                <p>Although <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> concludes with a traditional moral
                    resolution that would placate a genteel readership, the few contemporary reviews
                    of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> were unflattering, if not vitriolic, and
                    no doubt contributed to Shelley’s lifelong acrimony towards critical responses
                    to his work in the press. The critical atmosphere of the early nineteenth
                    century towards the glut of sensationalist fiction of the period is well
                    exemplified in this passage from the following “Prospectus” that was submitted
                    in support of the <title level="j">New London Review; or Monthly Report of
                        Authors and Books</title> (1799): “Though no arrogance will be indulged in
                    this publication, whatever disturbs the public harmony, insults legal authority,
                    outrages the best regards of the heart, invalidates the radical obligations of
                    morality, attacks the vital springs of established functions of piety, or in any
                    respect clashes with the sacred forms of decency, however witty, elegant, and
                    well written, can be noticed only in terms of severe and unequivocal
                    reprehension” (qtd. in Grenby 177). </p>
                <p> In the spirit of such regulative moral criticism, the <title level="j">Critical
                        Review</title>, for example, offered these trenchant observations on
                    Shelley’s “shameless and disgusting volume”: “Zastrozzi is one of the most
                    savage and improbable demons that ever issued from a diseased brain . . . a more
                    discordant, disgusting, and despicable performance has not, we are persuaded,
                    issued from the press for some time.” The review concludes, in language used to
                    describe Shelley by future reviewers of his controversial poetry, that “We know
                    not when we have felt so much indignation as in the perusal of this execrable
                    production. The author of it cannot be too severely reprobated. Not all his
                        ‘<emph>scintillated eyes</emph>,’ his ‘<emph>battling emotions</emph>,’ his
                        ‘<emph>frigorific torpidity</emph> of despair,’ nor his ‘<emph>Lethean
                        torpor</emph>,’ with the rest of his nonsensical and stupid jargon, ought to
                    save him from infamy, and his volume from the flames” (329-31). <title level="j"
                        >The Gentleman’s Magazine</title> was less dismissive in this pithy, though
                    naive, account: “. . . by placing the scene on the Continent, the Author has
                    availed himself of characters and vices which, however useful in narratives of
                    this description, thank God, are not to be found in this country” (258). Mary
                    Shelley herself, along with Shelley’s early biographers, encapsulates a critical
                    perspective that would dominate Shelley studies well into the twentieth century:
                    “He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature, but had not fostered
                    these tastes at their genuine sources—the romances and chivalry of the middle
                    ages—but in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days.
                    Under the influence of these he, at the age of fifteen, wrote two short prose
                    romances of slender merit. The sentiments and language were exaggerated, the
                    composition imitative and poor” (I, 101-2).</p>
                <p> Although less vitriolic than the <title level="j">Critical Review</title>, many
                    Shelley scholars begin discussing Shelley’s Gothic novels and early poetry (if
                    they are discussed at all) by offering what amounts to an apology. Shelley’s
                    Gothic sensibility is thought to be an embarrassment at worst or a transitional
                    phase at best. Kenneth Neill Cameron, for example, writes that Shelley, during
                    his “votary of Romance“ period, “was genuinely interested in the mysterious and
                    the occult . . . and in his novels he was, from time to time, carried away by
                    his subject . . . but he wrote largely with his tongue in his own
                    cheek—delighting, at times, in parodying his own style—aware, as he was writing
                    the novels, of their inherent ridiculousness, but interested in a quick,
                    schoolboy fame”, and “if Shelley’s gothic novels are bad, his horror poetry
                    written in the same period is worse” (28,33). For Cameron, it is not until
                    Shelley reads Godwin (“his master”) and assumes his “social duties” that his
                    work rises to the level of serious critical attention. A. J. Hartley (following
                    Frederick Jones), argues that Shelley’s “‘taste for romances’ definitely ended
                    in November, 1810, when he ordered a copy of [Godwin’s <title level="m"
                        >Political Justice</title>] from Stockdale” (v). David Seed reads <title
                        level="m">Zastrozzi</title> as a “crude and largely unconscious exploration
                    of sexual fear” and finds the character of Zastrozzi to be “banal and a
                    stereotype” (5). Eustace Chesser, in his Freudian reading of <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> (and perhaps channeling Peacock), claims that Shelley
                    “was not a rebel without a cause—he had too many causes. He was an introvert
                    with no strong sense of reality. . . . His all too short life was a continuous
                    refusal to accept responsibility. He never completely grew up. His vision was
                    centred upon the world as he would like it to be, not on the world as it is”
                    (12). More forgiving is Frederick Frank, who reads <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> as “a dark fable of identity” (ix) that “combine[s] an
                    expert knowledge of the elaborate technology of the Gothic romance and its
                    mandatory apparatus with the future poet’s desire to arrive at a Gothic
                    aesthetic through which beauty and horror could be expressed simultaneously”
                    (ix). Frank concludes, however, that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is
                    “basically a solipsistic excursion” (x). </p>
                <p> These interpretive approaches minimize the significance of Shelley’s early
                    Gothic works in two ways: first, they treat Shelley’s Gothic sensibility as an
                    undisciplined exercise of formal mimicry in a tarnished genre that bears little
                    relevance to his mature work; and second, they treat the Gothic as a foreign
                    element that is superseded by the transcendent idealism of Shelley’s later
                    poetry. Each of these approaches drain Shelley’s Gothic of its concrete
                    historical particularity and disavow the antagonisms around which his early work
                    circulates. The young Shelley’s construction of a post-Enlightenment Gothic
                    subject produces an impasse that is not easily recuperated within the context of
                    his later works, which may productively be read as reaction-formations against
                    the consequences that such a Gothic subject precipitates. </p>
                <p> The most recent studies of Shelley’s Gothic novels, though still few, have been
                    informed by the growing interest in the complex relations between the Gothic and
                    Romanticism, and by the emergence of Gothic studies as a legitimate discipline
                    of scholarly inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example,

                    essays in this volume argue, readers of Shelley’s early Gothic works must lift
                    the painted veil of two centuries of largely dismissive criticism and revisit
                    these works with fresh eyes and an appreciation for the ways in which Shelley
                    delimits the residual “Gothic complex” of symbols in the service of articulating
                    an emergent Romantic revolutionary consciousness. In one his early essays on
                    Shelley’s Gothic novels, Jerrold Hogle shows how <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> anticipates Shelley’s mature poetry and metaphysical
                    writings, noting that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is “about the higher
                    unity of the self prohibiting its arrival with antitheses of its own making.
                    Every sequence circles back on the mind’s dark chamber where the soul chooses to
                    diffuse and battle itself and thus envelop the chamber in gloom” (85). And in
                        <title level="m">Romantic Narrative</title>, Tilottama Rajan’s post-Lacanian
                    analysis of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> reveals the “madness” at the core
                    of Shelley’s exploration of psychosis and perversion, an “irruption of the Real
                    into the Symbolic” that is “staged in the laboratory of a mental theater” (64).
                    While I agree with Hogle and Rajan that Shelley’s early Gothic works stage the
                    antagonistic, intersubjective dynamics of self and Other(s), I argue that 
                    <title level="m">Zastrozzi’s</title> significance is deepened even further by
                    considering the literary-political-historical context in which it was written.
                        <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not only establishes the “Gothic complex”
                    that Hogle so well describes, but the novel also reflects that complex of
                    symbols and images back into itself to illuminate the late eighteenth-century
                    reactionary fantasies that generate it and against which Shelley would fashion a
                    revised “republicanism” in his subsequent poetry. </p>
                <p> As Stephen Behrendt has argued, Shelley often exploits conventional forms to
                    transmit radical ideas,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephen Behrendt’s
                        “Introduction” to his edition of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                            <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (pp. 9-53). Cf. also Steven Jones’s
                            <title level="m">Shelley’s Satire</title>.</note> so it is not
                    surprising that Shelley would choose the Gothic as a vehicle through which to
                    surreptitiously express his interests. Indeed, one is tempted to read
                    Zastrozzi’s various philosophical exhortations (which Hannah More would have
                    characterized as “speculative infidelity”) in the context of Shelley’s own
                    iconoclastic positions at the time. For example, in series of letters to Hogg
                    between 1810 and 1811 Shelley writes, in language that could have been spoken by
                    Zastrozzi himself: “Oh! I burn with impatience for the moment of Xtianity's
                    dissolution, it has injured me; I swear on the altar of perjured love to revenge
                    myself on the hated cause of the effect which <emph>even now</emph> I can
                    scarcely help deploring. . . . I swear that never will I forgive Christianity!
                    it is the only point on which I allow myself to encourage revenge. . . . Oh how
                    I wish I <emph>were</emph> the Antichrist, that it were <emph>mine</emph> to
                    crush the Demon, to hurl him to his native Hell never to rise again—I expect to
                    gratify some of this insatiable feeling in Poetry” (27–35). In an extended
                    philosophical discussion with Matilda, Zastrozzi expresses the same antipathy to
                    religious orthodoxy: “Am I not convinced of the non-existence of a Deity? am I
                    not convinced that death will but render this soul more free, more unfettered?
                    Why need I then shudder at death? why need any one, whose mind has risen above
                    the shackles of prejudice, the errors of a false and injurious superstition”
                    (153).</p>
                <p> Throughout the novel, Zastrozzi argues in favor of a number of often
                    contradictory Enlightenment philosophical motifs, from the utilitarian calculus
                    of pleasures and pains to Godwinian perfectibilitarianism to mechanistic
                    determinism to, ultimately, a self-pitying strain of nihilistic fatalism:
                    “whatever procures pleasure is right”; man “was created for no other purpose but
                    to obtain happiness”; “rather than suppose that by its own innate and
                    energetical exertions, this soul must endure for ever, that no fortuitous
                    occurrences, no incidental events, can affect its happiness; but by daring
                    boldly, by striving to verge from the beaten path, whilst yet trammeled in the
                    chains of mortality, it will gain superior advantages in a future state”; “fate
                    wills us to die: and I intend to meet death, to encounter annihilation with
                    tranquility.” Yet despite his avowed atheism, Zastrozzi’s elaborate scheme for
                    revenge against Verezzi depends upon the existence of a Christian heaven and
                    hell and the immortality of the soul. Reflecting upon the murder of his father,
                    Zastrozzi laments: “But I destroyed his <emph>body</emph> alone . . . time has
                    taught me better: his son’s <emph>soul</emph> is hell-doomed to all eternity: he
                    destroyed himself; but my machinations, though unseen, effected his destruction”
                    (155). </p>
                <p> John Whatley argues that Zastrozzi is “a well-spoken and committed Atheist”
                    (203) and that Shelley’s “representatives of atheism and revolution are yet
                    ‘villains’ who through conspiracy, deceit, and violence forward social
                    disruption, but they are equally fascinating in their power to satirize and
                    undercut Church morality and to allow the fulfillment of desire” (209). A closer
                    reading, however, reveals Zastrozzi to be an equal-opportunity sophist, more
                    Hobbesian or Machiavellian than Godwinian, who appropriates into a bricolage of
                    contradictory positions whatever discourse suits his purposes. He may be
                    “well-spoken,” but he is hardly “committed” to any particular cause other than
                    revenge. And neither he nor Matilda successfully “undercut Church morality.”
                    Matilda ultimately reconciles herself to the Church and Zastrozzi is executed by
                    the Inquisition, whose absolute authority is never in doubt and remains fully
                    intact at the conclusion of the novel. On the one hand we can point to the
                    hypocritical self-interest of Matilda’s religious awakening and Zastrozzi’s
                    Satanic-like resistance against absolute authority, but on the other hand we
                    have to ask if such supposed insights are really all that subversive? From a
                    progressive standpoint, is Shelley asking us to identify with murderers who are,
                    despite their transgressive and liberating ambitions, consumed by
                    self-gratification? Is Shelley championing a Bataillean “expenditure” beyond the
                    pleasure principle that ultimately seeks to sustain prohibitions for the purpose
                    of producing the desire to transgress them? We should perhaps be inclined to
                    take Shelley at his word when he admonishes one reader of the novel against
                    confusing his own radicalism with that of his characters: “If he takes me for
                    any one whose character I have drawn in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> he is
                    mistaken quite” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 11).</p>
                <p> Such is the interpretive crux of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, caught in
                    the balance between the reactionary and revolutionary impulses of the Gothic
                    aesthetic. Revolutionary desire is always in danger of falling into what Peter
                    Starr calls a “logic of specular doubling” or “structural repetition” that
                    mirrors the oppressive mechanisms of power it seeks to displace. Starr explains,
                    “If one undertakes direct, political action . . . then the logics of specular
                    doubling and structural repetition apply. But if one refuses such action, then
                    one’s revolt will at best be hopelessly marginal, at worst a reinforcement of
                    institutionalized power” (8). For Shelley, the most vivid example of such a
                    scenario would have been the degeneration of republicanism into terror during
                    the French Revolution, where, according to Starr, revolutionaries became
                    “trapped in a dualistic, paranoid world where rivalry springs from the
                    narcissistic illusion of one’s own subjective unity” (9). In the figure of
                    Zastrozzi, Shelley demonstrates his budding appreciation for the complexities
                    and dangers of revolutionary change and the ways in which desire is inextricably
                    bound to even the most abstract of political commitments.</p>
                <p> But if Shelley’s aim is simply to diagnose the failings of Enlightenment
                    revolutionary discourse by drawing attention to the destructive desires that
                    underwrite its universalizing drive, then we might expect Shelley to adopt a
                    narrative strategy similar to that employed by Charlotte Dacre in <title
                        level="m">Zofloya</title>. The narrator of <title level="m">Zofloya</title>
                    informs us early on that to understand the transgressive desires of Victoria we
                    must elucidate, in the spirit of Enlightenment curiosity and utilitarian ethics,
                    the “causes” of her destructive behavior: “The historian who would wish his
                    lessons to sink deep into the heart, thereby essaying to render mankind virtuous
                    and more happy, must not content himself with simply detailing a series of
                    events—he must ascertain causes, and follow progressively their effects; he must
                    draw deductions from incidents as they arise, and ever revert to the actuating
                    principle” (3). Throughout the course of the novel, however, the narrator’s
                    attempts to account for Victoria’s increasingly complex desires and motivations
                    seem inadequate, almost to the point of comic absurdity. The failure to reduce
                    Victoria’s subjectivity to a network of causal determinations (for example,
                    negligent parenting), suggests that Dacre’s narration works ironically as a
                    critique of Enlightenment itself, particularly the more dogmatic strains of
                    French mechanistic materialism (La Mettrie’s <title level="m">L’Homme
                        Machine</title> and Holbach’s <title level="m">Systême de la Nature</title>,
                    for example) that reduce human relationships to a scientific model of strict
                    necessity. Shelley’s investment in materialism, however, was strengthening
                    during the period of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s composition, so he
                    was, perhaps, disinclined to adopt Dacre’s ironic stance toward Enlightenment
                    critical gestures.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813) has been thought to mark the
                        culmination of Shelley’s strict materialism, from which he would not awaken
                        from his own dogmatic slumber until the <title level="m">Alastor</title>
                        volume of 1816. Adriana Cracuin has pointed out that in spite of <title
                            level="m">Zofloya</title>’s transgressive content, Dacre herself was
                        politically conservative. So it stands to reason that she would have been
                        more inclined to critique Enlightenment doctrine than Shelley, who never
                        abandoned the revolutionary principles of the Enlightenment.</note>
                    Shelley’s narrator, too, adds a layer of ironic subtext, but from a different
                    ideological perspective. The narrator often pauses to comment upon characters
                    and events from a position of the “Church morality” that Whatley identifies,
                    which signals the narrator’s complicity with conservative ideology and, by
                    extension, with Verezzi. Zastrozzi is admonished for his “sophistry,” and his
                    inability to “contemplate the wonderful operations, the mysterious ways of
                    Providence” (102); and when Matilda prays for God’s forgiveness, the narrator
                    happily reports that “mercy, by the All-benevolent of heaven, is never refused
                    to those humbly, yet trusting in his goodness, ask it” (150). But again, this
                    does not necessarily undercut church morality because, given the exaggerated
                    evil and narcissism of Matilda and Zastrozzi, the disapprobation towards them
                    would be wholly justifiable. </p>
                <p> I argue that Shelley deftly subverts conventional ideology while at the same
                    time satisfying its moral prescriptions by splitting the diegetic reality from
                    its subversive subtext, revealing an intersubjective dynamic that complicates
                    any reading of the novel that either reduces the characters to static Gothic
                    stereotypes or that resolves the narrative action within a determinate nexus of
                    cause and effect. Because the narrative is doubly refracted through a
                    conservative lens (the narrator and Verezzi), we must resist the impulse to
                    valorize the characters of Verezzi and Julia at the expense of Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi, who are actually the far more interesting and complicated characters
                    in the novel (and like Milton’s Satan, more “ethical”). The temptation to
                    identify with Verezzi and Julia persists nonetheless, particularly when we
                    consider the similarity between the situation in which Verezzi finds himself at
                    the beginning of the novel and that of Prometheus in <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>: “Verezzi was chained to a piece of rock which remained
                    immovable. The violence of the storm was past, but the hail descended rapidly,
                    each stone of which wounded his naked limbs. Every flash of lighting, although
                    now distant, dazzled his eyes, unaccustomed as they had been to the least ray of
                    light” (64). Several critics have commented upon the similarity here between
                    Verezzi and Prometheus,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See David

                    resemblance is a lure that will prove to be superficial and misleading over the
                    course of the novel and distorts any interpretation of Shelley’s early work
                    through the retroactive gaze of his later treatment of similar themes. </p>
                <p> Reading Verezzi as a precursor to the “champion of mankind” strains credulity.
                    As much as we might empathize with his suffering, Verezzi is a passive “hero”
                    who represents unreflecting, reactionary aristocratic privilege, one of the
                    primary targets of Shelley’s subversive critique. Furthermore, Verezzi occupies
                    a space that is traditionally populated by female protagonists in Gothic novels:
                    in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, it is the <emph>male,</emph> rather than
                    a young, virtuous female, who is pursued, confined, and tormented by a sublime
                    figure of phallic power—two if we count Matilda and her predatory sexuality.
                    Throughout the course of the novel, Verezzi is coded as feminine, and the only
                    feature which signifies his masculinity is his choice of love objects. The
                    attitude towards gender and power expressed in the novel is ambiguous, subject
                    to continual destabilization as Matilda and Verezzi negotiate their gendered
                    positions in relation to one another, finally reaching a provisional, though
                    compromised, equilibrium within a common fantasy space. </p>
                <p>
                    <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s explicit representations of subversion are
                    a <emph>semblance</emph> designed to alert us to a far more subversive strategy
                    at work in the novel, one that is more historically informed than has been
                    previously recognized and that interrogates the intellectual context in which it
                    was written. By the time Shelley published <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> in
                    1810, the popularity of the Gothic genre was in decline and its conventions had
                    already become a target of satire and parody in the wake of the anti-Jacobin
                    backlash against the revolutionary zeal expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” of
                    1790-91. As M. O. Grenby argues in <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin
                        Novel</title>, “The ‘Revolution debate,’ the ‘war of ideas,’ withered away,
                    not because every champion of radical doctrine had been utterly converted by the
                    logic of the conservatives, but because few of them . . . could be found who
                    wished to defy a near unanimous and highly militant anti-Jacobinism to put
                    forward what had suddenly become dangerously unorthodox opinions” (5). The young
                    Shelley was not one to shy away from such opinions, but he was also sly enough
                    to understand that progressive principles had been perverted into monstrous
                    caricatures. </p>
                <p> The ambiguous status of the Gothic’s transgressive revolutionary potential, on
                    the one hand, and its reactionary, ameliorative impulse, on the other,
                    participates in a larger aesthetic context in which the master signifiers of the
                    Revolutionary era were points of bitter contention between those, like Edmund
                    Burke, who framed the established authority of the <foreign>ancien
                        régime</foreign> in sublime terms and the republicanism of Revolution as
                    monstrous; and those, like Paine, Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and other
                    Enlightenment progressives, who framed the Revolution in sublime terms and the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> as monstrous. Burkean aesthetic categories
                    of the sublime and beautiful reflect the predominant eighteenth-century
                    hierarchy: sublime qualities of nobility, reason, and awe are associated with
                    men; and beautiful qualities such as passion, friendship, and elegance are
                    associated with women. For Burke, the feudal political structure of the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>, both in England and France, represents a
                    sublime political structure that inspires awe, admiration, and respect for a
                    powerful patriarchal authority founded on centuries of political,
                    ecclesiastical, and social tradition. The following passage from Burke’s <title
                        level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> is typical: “We
                    fear God; we look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments, with duty
                    to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility. Why?
                    Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so
                    affected; because all other feelings are false and spurious, and tend to corrupt
                    our minds, to vitiate our primary morals, and make us unfit for rational
                    liberty” (76). The hegemonic struggle between Jacobin and anti-Jacobin factions
                    to define and control the meaning of master signifiers such as “freedom,”
                    “nature,” “progress,” “necessity,” “good,” “evil,” “masculine,” “feminine,”
                    etc., finds its aesthetic counterpart in the Gothic literature (“sickening
                    trash,” as one <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> critic put it) produced
                    during the apex of its popularity in the 1790s and early 1800s. </p>
                <p> The anti-Jacobin fiction of the period emphasizes the dangers to British social
                    stability when challenged by the “new philosophy” of Enlightenment progressives.
                    Clara Reeve writes, for instance, in her preface to <title level="m">Memoirs of
                        Sir Roger de Clarendon</title> (1793): “The new philosophy of the present
                    day avows a levelling principle, and declares that a state of anarchy is more
                    beautiful than that of order and regularity. There is nothing more likely to
                    convince mankind of the errors of these men, than to set before them examples of
                    good government, and warnings of the mischievous consequences of their own
                    principles” (xvi-xvii). Anne Thomas, in <title level="m">Adolphus de
                        Biron</title> (1795?) writes: “I must, however, acknowledge that we have
                    some restless Spirits amongst us, who by their seditious Writings have
                    contributed no a little to the Work of Destruction . . . I thank Heaven the
                    number of such Miscreants is but small, when compared to the Spirit of the whole
                    Nation” (Grenby 104). And Robert Dallas writes, in <title level="m">Percival, or
                        Nature Vindicated. A Novel</title> (1801): “Men who born to fortune are
                    appointed by Providence to the administration of a certain portion of the
                    interests of the world: they are the helmsmen of happiness; and if they desert
                    the wheel, is there any wonder that the even course should be lost?” (I, 238). </p>
                <p> Two poems in particular from <title level="j">The Anti-Jacobin Review</title>
                    (1799) effectively condense the perceived threats and vaguely generalized fear
                    of revolutionary change into a coherent image of monstrosity against which the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary could organize its desire. “Ode to Jacobinism,”<note

                    ostensibly written by “An English Jacobin,” opens with an invocation to the
                    “Daughter of Hell, insatiate power, / Destroyer of the human race, / Whose iron
                    scourge and madd’ning hour / Exalt the bad, the good debase” (1-4). Under the
                    guidance of this “Daughter of Hell,” the Jacobin sympathizer seeks to satisfy
                    “Revenge” (25) and usher forth, from behind a “sophist veil” (41), “Fire,
                    rapine, sword, and chains, and ghastly Poverty” (40) and to “taint the mind,
                    corrupt the heart” (44). The Jacobin’s ultimate motive is to “Teach us to hate
                    and revile; / Our glorious Charter’s faults to scan, / Time-sanction’d Truths
                    despise, and preach Thy Rights of Man” (48). And in “Ode to a Jacobin,”<note

                    “Unchristian Jacobin” (1) is represented as an atheist who rationalizes the
                    violence of the Terror, forgoing “Mercy” (18), “Pity” (19), and “humanity” (28)
                    to profess a “love of executions” (41) that makes one “fit for Revolutions”
                    (42). The poem concludes by admonishing the Jacobin for thinking “All
                    Constitutions bad, but those bran new” (48). Anti-Jacobin fiction and criticism
                    was so successful that after only thirty-six issues the <title level="j"

                    hierarchy and its attendant privileges. </p>
                <p> Although Shelley was entering an ideological battle that had apparently already
                    been won by reactionary forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich
                    environment for a transgressive aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution,
                    conspiracy, and libertinism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An important
                        source, for Shelley, of anti-Jacobin conspiracy fantasy associated with the
                        Revolution was Abbé Barruel’s <title level="m">Memoirs Illustrating the
                            History of Jacobinism</title> (1797). Shelley read the work out loud to
                        Mary on 9 October 1814, a day before Mary herself read <title level="m"
                            >Zastrozzi</title> (see <title level="m">Journal,</title> p. 19). See
                        also Robert Miles’ essay in this volume on Shelley’s conspiratorial
                        imagination.</note> Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title
                        level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as a satire of the Gothic itself, but as a
                    diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, delivered through one of
                    their favorite targets of derision—the Gothic novel. From the perspective of the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary, nothing could be seen as more threatening to the
                    normative hetero-patriarchal circuit of regulated desire—as exemplified by
                    Verezzi and Julia—than the sexually aggressive Matilda and the violently
                    atheistic Zastrozzi, two exceptions against which the stability of traditional
                    British social hierarchy were grounded. If Matilda and Verezzi’s father signify
                    the moral corruption of the élite, then Zastrozzi, in the form of an obscene
                    surplus, signifies the illegitimate product of such corruption. And Verezzi,
                    although unknowingly, contributes to that corruption himself when he finally
                    submits to Matilda’s seduction and forsakes his love for Julia. </p>
                <p> When we consider Zastrozzi’s bricolage of contradictory Enlightenment rhetoric,
                    his murderous desire for revenge, and his illegitimacy (which signifies a
                    generalized threat to primogeniture and social hierarchy), from Verezzi’s
                    perspective Zastrozzi embodies the paranoiac image of the Jacobin monster. And
                    Matilda, whose excessive sexual degeneracy reads like a case study from
                    Bienville’s <title level="m">Nymphomania</title> (1775), embodies the paranoiac
                    image of a fully pathological subject whose actions are determined solely by
                    contingent self-interest. Matilda, like her namesake in Lewis’ <title level="m"
                        >The Monk</title> and like Victoria in Dacre’s <title level="m"
                        >Zofloya</title>, is described by the narrator (whose complicity with the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary should not be overlooked) in similarly demonic
                    terms—“wily,” “perfidious,” “syren,” “ferocious,” “frantic,” “delirious,”
                    “horror-tranced,” and “wretched.” And, as Alenka Zupancic observes, “what is a
                    demon if not a fully pathological subject?”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Alenka Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the Real</title> for a full
                        discussion on the relation between Lacanian and Kantian ethics.</note>
                    Because Matilda and Zastrozzi are images drawn from reactionary paranoiac
                    fantasy, interpretations that identify Shelley’s own radicalism with either
                    character would actually <emph>legitimize</emph> the anti-Jacobin linkage of
                    violence to sexual liberation and progressive philosophy. This is why, from a
                    progressive standpoint, the explicit acts of transgression in the novel
                    constitute a semblance of revolutionary subversion designed to satirize
                    anti-Jacobin fears. </p>
                <p> As a “romance” of the anti-Jacobin political unconscious, <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> reveals how paranoiac images of the Other are generated
                    by antagonisms inherent to the dominant ideology itself. In <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title>, the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the feminine Other
                    (Matilda) is figured as a nymphomaniac, and the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of
                    the masculine Other (Zastrozzi) is figured as a bloodthirsty revolutionary. The
                    paranoiac image of the Other, therefore, condenses a constellation of indistinct
                    fears, threats, and desires, and functions as a defense against the breakdown of
                    phallic structures of power that depend upon the stability of binary oppositions
                    and upon the regulation of the metonymic movement of desire along the chain of
                    signifiers. Although Shelley represents Matilda and Zastrozzi as images drawn
                    from anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, those images do not remain static
                    throughout the course of the novel, nor are they simply caricatures of
                    conventional Gothic villains. The only static characters are Verezzi and Julia.
                    Verezzi is a MacKenzian man of feeling who finds himself thrust from the
                    pleasures of sentimentality into a Gothic nightmare of violent sensibility and
                    conspiratorial danger. He remains transfixed by Zastrozzi’s impenetrable gaze,
                    paralyzed by fear: “. . . Verezzi stood bewildered, and unable to arrange the
                    confusion of ideas which floated in his brain, and assailed his terror-struck
                    imagination. He knew not what to believe—what phantom it could be that, in the
                    shape of Zastrozzi, blasted his straining eye-balls— . . .” (90). Although we,
                    as readers, eventually learn Zastrozzi’s identity and his reasons for pursuing
                    Verezzi, Verezzi himself never does. Thus there is no meaningful interaction
                    between the two; they exist for each other only as image-objects. So if we claim
                    that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> poses a thought experiment in which the
                    subject of aristocratic privilege encounters in reality the monsters he has
                    created in paranoiac fantasy, might we not also argue that Zastrozzi sees
                    Verezzi only as an image of the aristocratic oppression that has denied him
                    entrance into the socio-symbolic order? </p>
                <p> The conservative ideology of the narrator makes it difficult to sustain such a
                    reversal, but the implication is there and points to how revolutionary and
                    reactionary discourses engage each other only through the conflict between
                    fantasmic materializations of their own lack. We can further unpack these
                    relations in Lacanian terms. Verezzi misrecognizes Zastrozzi, mistaking him as a
                    phallic signifier rather than as a signifier of the barred Other. According to
                    Lacan, the phallus is an object that materializes the lack in the
                        <emph>symbolic</emph> order, gives it a fascinating, powerful presence;
                    whereas the signifier of the barred Other is an object that signifies this lack
                    itself. Thus Lacan can claim that the phallic object is a signifier without a
                    signified. Zastrozzi, as a fantasmic condensation of anti-Jacobin fear, doesn’t
                    exist. He signifies the lack in the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> social
                    hierarchy itself, the reminder (as a remainder) that society does not exist as a
                    harmonious totality. As Zizek explains, the phallus is at once a sign of power,
                    but also signifies lack: “The phallic signifier is, so to speak, an index of its
                    own impossibility . . . . This logic of the phallic inversion sets in when the
                    demonstration of power starts to function as a confirmation of a fundamental
                    impotence” (<title level="m">Sublime</title> 157). Only at the conclusion of the
                    novel, after Verezzi has already committed suicide, do we as readers learn what
                    lies behind Zastrozzi’s display of phallic power: in reality he is Verezzi’s
                    illegitimate half-brother, an impotent figure in the context of the predominant
                    social hierarchy. </p>
                <p> Zastrozzi, however, sustains his phallic presence, even after being tried and
                    sentenced to death by the Inquisition: “He looked around him. His manner awed
                    the tumultuous multitude; and, in uninterrupted silence, the spectators gazed
                    upon the unappalled Zastrozzi, who, towering as a demi-god, stood in the midst”
                    (154). Why, after learning of his identity, of his illegitimate birth, and of
                    his past murders, do the spectators and council still confer upon Zastrozzi the
                    image of sublime phallic authority? Part of the answer lies, no doubt, in the
                    mesmerizing theatricality of Zastrozzi’s performance. He both fascinates and
                    frightens those who are caught within his gaze. As a paranoiac image of the
                    Jacobin monster, we see how such sublime images are cultural productions that
                    serve a necessary role in the anti-Jacobin imaginary. To demystify the paranoiac
                    image would be to lose the very object against which a reactionary ideology
                    defines itself. The spectators, therefore, are invested in their “willing
                    suspension of disbelief” (to appropriate Coleridge’s phrase) and are not
                    inclined to give up their investment in the sublime image of the Other. For
                    Shelley, who seeks to re-mobilize the founding principles of Republican
                    ideology, Zastrozzi functions as a “surface appearance” “draped over the
                    irrational” fears of reactionary ideology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See

                </p>
                <p> Matilda too is figured as a phallic object, which, not surprisingly, creates
                    difficulties in her attempts to seduce Verezzi. Matilda occupies an especially
                    dangerous position for Verezzi because she represents the possibility, in
                    fantasy, of the full realization of the sexual relationship. She is beautiful,
                    sexually uninhibited, culturally sophisticated, and presumably a woman of social
                    standing, like his fiancée Julia. From a distance she engenders an alluring
                    fascination, but approached too closely she becomes the monstrous Thing that
                    threatens to annihilate his genteel subjectivity. To seduce Verezzi, Matilda
                    must masquerade as his object-cause of desire, what Lacan calls the
                        <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>. Matilda must <emph>desublimate</emph>
                    herself from a phallic object of terrifying <foreign>jouissance</foreign> into a
                    compelling image of socially sanctioned desire. </p>
                <p> According to Lacan's sexuation formulas, the masculine subject identifies with
                    the female as the <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>; that is, she must occupy the
                    place of the object-cause of desire in his fantasy scenario, she must “fit his
                    formula” (Zizek, <title level="m">Plague</title> 8). As Emily Apter points out,
                    “There is no absolute femininity beneath the veil, only a set of ontologically
                    tenuous codes that normatively induct the feminine subject into the social
                    practice of ‘being’ woman through mimesis and parroting” (243). There is no
                    mystery concerning Matilda’s desire: “I adore you to madness—I love you to
                    distraction. If you have one spark of compassion, let me not sue in vain—reject
                    not one who feels it impossible to overcome the fatal, resistless passion which
                    consumes her” (83). Verezzi’s response to Matilda is one of “cold esteem,” but
                    in the following passage we get a glimpse of how Matilda will indeed figure
                    herself as the object of his desire: <quote> He could not love Matilda; and
                        though he never had seen her but in the most amiable light, he found it
                        impossible to feel any sentiment towards her, save cold esteem. Never had he
                        beheld those dark shades in her character, which if developed could excite
                        nothing but horror and detestation . . . as such he pitied her: but still
                        could he not help observing a comparison between her and Julia, whose
                        feminine delicacy shrunk from the slightest suspicion, even of indecorum.
                        Her fragile form, her mild heavenly countenance, was contrasted with all the
                        partiality of love, to the scintillating eye, the commanding countenance,
                        the bold expressive gaze, of Matilda. (84)</quote> To successfully seduce
                    Verezzi, Matilda must appeal to the narcissistic component of his sexual
                    economy. Verezzi resists Matilda for much of the novel, but as she begins to
                    understand how to incite his desire, Verezzi’s image of her softens: ““Emotions
                    of pity, of compassion, for one whose only fault he supposed to be love for him,
                    conquered V’s softened soul” (86). And a bit later: <quote> Still did he feel
                        his soul irresistibly softened towards Matilda—her love for him flattered
                        his vanity; and though he could not feel reciprocal affection towards her,
                        yet her kindness in rescuing him from his former degraded situation, her
                        altered manner towards him, and her unremitting endeavours to please, to
                        humour him in every thing, called for his warmest, his sincerest gratitude.
                        (88-89)</quote> Matilda’s “altered manner,” which “she knew well how to
                    assume,” coupled with the beauty of her “symmetrical form,” finally begins to
                    work: “By affecting to coincide with him in every thing—by feigning to possess
                    that congeniality of sentiment and union of idea, which he thought so necessary
                    to the existence of love, she doubted not soon to accomplish her purpose” (115).
                    Matilda does indeed “accomplish her purpose,” but only after she has managed to
                    substitute herself in the place formerly occupied by Julia, whom Verezzi now
                    believes to have been murdered by Zastrozzi: “Oh Matilda! dearest, angelic
                    Matilda! . . . I am even now unconscious what blinded me—what kept me from
                    acknowledging my adoration of thee!—adoration never to be changed by
                    circumstances—never effaced by time” (129). Matilda has successfully broken
                    Verezzi’s melancholic fixation on the lost object of his desire and entered his
                    fantasy frame as the <foreign>object-cause</foreign> of his “unconscious”
                    desire. </p>
                <p> Throughout the course of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda undergo a metamorphic
                    shift from powerful, phallic objects of paranoiac fantasy to impotent subjects
                    that reveal a fundamental split subjectivity beneath the fascinating spectacle.
                    Shelley’s antagonists, Matilda and Zastrozzi, express a subjectivity that is far
                    more complex than his protagonists, Verezzi and Julia. The actions of Matilda
                    and Zastrozzi can be productively read in terms of Kant’s distinction between
                    “radical” and “diabolical” evil, which he discusses in <title level="m">Religion
                        within the Limits of Reason Alone. </title>Radical evil is an ethical
                    position in which one’s actions are determined solely by pathological motives.
                    The pathological subject <emph>chooses</emph> self-interest and gratification at
                    the expense of the other. Diabolical evil characterizes a position in which the
                    subject adopts the pursuit of evil itself as a moral maxim (i.e., a categorical
                    imperative in the form of Milton’s Satanic “Evil be thou my good.”), even at the
                    expense of one’s own pathological interests, or even one’s life.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> See Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the
                            Real</title> and Joan Copjec, ed., <title level="m">Radical
                        Evil</title>.</note>
                </p>
                <p> Matilda clearly is a candidate for radical evil, and Zastrozzi for diabolical
                    evil. Matilda violently pursues her passions until her self-interest is at
                    stake. After Matilda kills Julia, she suddenly begins to reflect upon the
                    eternal consequences: “The guilty Matilda shrunk at death—she let fall the
                    upraised dagger—her soul had caught a glimpse of the misery which awaits the
                    wicked hereafter, and, in spite of her contempt of religion—spite of her, till
                    now, too firm dependence on the doctrines of atheism, she trembled at futurity;
                    and a voice from within, which whispers “thou shalt never die!” spoke daggers to
                    Matilda’s soul” (143). Zastrozzi, however, suffers no such spiritual crisis, and
                    pursues his maxim of revenge, even at the expense of his own life. He informs
                    the Council: “ ‘. . . I know my doom; and, instead of horror, experience some
                    degree of satisfaction at the arrival of death, since all I have to do on earth
                    is completed.’ . . . Even whilst writhing under the agony of almost
                    unsupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s firmness failed him
                    not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance, played a smile of most disdainful
                    scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive laugh of exulting revenge—he died”
                    (156).</p>
                <p> The demonic subjects of radical and diabolical evil are, thus, consistent with
                    the paranoiac image of the transgressive Other. But as Kant argues, although
                    absolute freedom is impossible and we cannot purify ourselves completely from
                    our pathological determinations (we are after all trapped in finite, material
                    bodies) we can exercise our freedom by choosing the <emph>way</emph> in which we
                    are determined. What distinguishes Shelley’s Gothic (and here we can see the
                    emergence of a Romantic Gothicism), is the self-reflexivity and psychological
                    dissonance that his Gothic antagonists experience. These moments are not
                    explored in depth in the novel—the narrator is too anxious to propel Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi into their next heinous deed—but they appear nonetheless and
                    constitute a kind of textual unconscious that compels us to peer beyond the
                    paranoiac image and consider Matilda and Zastrozzi as subjects rather than
                    simply as objects of paranoiac fantasy. There are several moments when Matilda
                    pauses to reflect upon her actions, and in these moments we recognize her as a
                    split subject: “I almost shudder . . . at the sea of wickedness on which I am
                    about to embark! But still, Verezzi—ah! for him would I even lose my hopes of
                    eternal happiness. In the sweet idea of calling him mine, no scrupulous
                    delicacy, no mistaken superstitious idea, shall prevent me from deserving him by
                    daring acts— . . .” (79). A moment later she exclaims: “Oh, madness! Madness!” .
                    . . “is it for this that I have plunged into the dark abyss of crime?—is it for
                    this that I have despised the delicacy of my sex, and, braving consequences,
                    have offered my love to one who despises me—who shuns me, as does the barbarous
                    Verezzi?” (82). And this iconic image, in which Matilda sits perched like a
                    gargoyle overlooking a sublime display of nature’s destructive energy, captures
                    perfectly Matilda’s status as both fantasmic object and split subject: “Matilda
                    sat upon a fragment of jutting granite, and contemplated the storm which raged
                    around her. The portentous calm, which at intervals occurred amid the
                    reverberating thunder, portentous of a more violent tempest, resembled the
                    serenity which spread itself over Matilda’s mind—a serenity only to be succeeded
                    by a fiercer paroxysm of passion” (119).</p>
                <p> Even Zastrozzi has moments, though few, of conscientious reflection that suggest
                    a moral capacity for guilt: “Zastrozzi sat for some time immersed in
                    heart-rending contemplations; but though conscience for awhile reflected his
                    past life in images of horror, again was his heart steeled by fiercest vengeance
                    . . . “ (75); and “. . . he thought of his past life, and his awakened
                    conscience reflected images of horror. But again revenge drowned the voice of
                    virtue—again passion obscured the light of reason, and his steeled soul
                    persisted in its scheme” (68). This guilt-inducing “voice of virtue” that
                    reflects “images of horror” speaks <emph>through</emph> and <emph>for</emph>
                    Matilda and Zastrozzi. As Mladen Dolar explains, “. . . the surplus of the
                    superego over the Law is precisely the surplus of the voice; the superego has a
                    voice, the Law is stuck with the letter” (14). The specular doubling, fears of
                    persecution, and encounters with the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the Other
                    that drive the action of Shelley’s <title level="m">Zaztrozzi</title>, <title
                        level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, and <title level="m">The Wandering
                    Jew</title>, are early attempts to explore and understand the psychological
                    dissonances associated with a failed encounter with the Other (as language,
                    culture, ideology) and others (individual egos, including the subject’s own). </p>
                <p> Finally, I want to draw attention to Shelley’s most effective strategy for
                    representing the subjectivization of the paranoiac image. Critics who interpret
                    the images and actions of Matilda and Zastrozzi only in terms of Verezzi’s state
                    of mind, as images drawn from the unconscious of his own psychological
                    processes, miss the radical intersubjectivity at work among all of the
                    characters. And those, like Whatley, who suggest that Matilda and Zastrozzi are
                    the only characters who are allowed to “fulfill their desire,” we must ask the
                    question: whose desire? In Lacanian terms, the “subject’s desire is always the
                    desire of the Other.” That is, desire can be <emph>for</emph> the Other,
                    determined <emph>by </emph>the Other, or a desire <emph>for the Other’s
                        desire</emph>—the “Other” being either the “big Other” itself (the symbolic
                    register of language, ideology, culture, etc. out of which the effect of
                    subjectivity is precipitated) or other individual others with whom one
                    interacts. The most terrifying or uncanny moments in Shelley’s Gothic occur when
                    characters discover (or we as readers discover despite the characters’ limited
                    knowledge of their own self-experience) that their desire is not their own, that
                    their free-will is an illusion and that their actions are determined by the
                    desires of the Other as they are internalized in the formations of the ego,
                    ego-ideal and superego. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> stages the process through which the desire of
                    the Other is internalized, transferred, expressed, and subverted. For example,
                    we can briefly restate the action of the novel in the following terms: Zastrozzi
                    assumes for himself the desire of his mother, which sets in motion his merciless
                    schemes to destroy Verezzi. Split between the “desire of the m(O)ther” and the
                    “name of the father,” Zastrozzi occupies a perverse position as the
                    object-instrument of his disgraced mother’s desire for retribution: “‘Never
                    shall I forgot her last commands.—My son,’ said she, ‘my Pietrino, revenge my
                    wrongs—revenge them on the perjured Verezzi—revenge them on his progeny for
                    ever’” (155). Matilda, in her union with Verezzi, assumes as her own the desire
                    of Julia, and Matilda’s desire does not reach its object until she murders
                    Julia. Matilda’s stated desire actually masks her real desire, which is to
                    destroy her sexual and social rival: “. . . Julia must die, and expiate the
                    crime of daring to rival me, with her hated blood” (79). “‘Julia, the hated,

                    confidence of eternal delight: could she but be hurled to destruction— . . .’”
                    (131). Matilda’s phallic, destructive intensity, so well-veiled to Verezzi,
                    finally reaches its apex when Matilda murders Julia in a “ferocious” confluence
                    of desire and <foreign>jouissance</foreign>: <quote>

                            vengeance, the ferocious Matilda seized Julia’s floating hair, and
                            holding her back with fiend-like strength, stabbed her in a thousand
                            places; and, with exulting pleasure, again and again buried the dagger
                            to the hilt in her body, even after all remains of life were

                        <p rend="noCount"> At last the passions of Matilda, exhausted by their own
                            violence, sank into a deadly calm: she threw the dagger violently from
                            her, and contemplated the terrific scene before her with a sullen gaze.

                    </quote> In this moment, Shelley’s subjectivized paranoiac image reverts back to
                    its original, horrifying presence, which ultimately realizes the desire of both
                    the narrator and reader as reactionary others. Reactionary desire is satisfied,
                    even though Shelley had frustrated that desire by subjectivizing the paranoiac
                    images of Zastrozzi and Matilda. They reassume their status as Jacobin monsters,
                    thus confirming the obscene enjoyment that underlies the reactionary ethical
                    stance. And by committing suicide, Verezzi, ironically, assumes as his own the
                    desire of Zastrozzi. Thus, the actions of these “others” can only be understood
                    within the larger context of the “big Other” (the patriarchal symbolic), from
                    which both Zastrozzi and Matilda are excluded—Zastrozzi, as the illegitimate
                    offspring of Verezzi’s father, and Matilda, whose sexual passion for Verezzi
                    threatens the stability of the fully regulated sexual relationship, as
                    exemplified by Verezzi and Julia. <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> draws
                    attention to the inter-subjective relations that actually drive and sustain the
                    paranoiac fantasy, but Shelley is also careful to maintain the tension between
                    the demystification of the fantasy and its reduction to an explanatory network
                    of causal relations, which would empty the Gothic of its uncanny effects and
                    reduce it to a species of the philosophical novel. </p>
                <p> Verezzi’s traumatic encounters with Zastrozzi and Matilda exemplify not only the
                    rigidity of Burkean aesthetic categories, but also the limitations of a moral
                    psychology derived from either Smithian sympathetic identification or a
                    Benthamian utilitarian calculus of pleasures and pains. As a consequence of the
                    attempt to establish a subjective position free from the artificial and
                    corrupted determinations of culture, tradition, and ecclesiastical authority,
                    the Enlightenment <foreign>philosophes</foreign> were faced with the difficult
                    problem of formulating an ethics grounded in “natural disposition” and confirmed
                    by presumably universal affects such as pleasure and pain. An ethics derived
                    from sympathetic identification with the other, however, suffers from the
                    problem of what to do if identification with the other is
                        <emph>impossible</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this curious

                        implacable other. Here, respect for the other extends only so far as it is
                        reflected through a narcissistic gaze founded on similarity: <quote> A
                            person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to
                            insults, without attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We
                            cannot enter into his indifference and insensibility: we call his
                            behaviour mean‑spiritedness, and are as really provoked by it as by the
                            insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see any man
                            submit patiently to affronts and ill usage. They desire to see this
                            insolence resented, and resented by the person who suffers from it. They
                            cry to him with fury to defend, or to revenge himself. If his
                            indignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud and sympathize with
                            it. It enlivens their own indignation against his enemy, whom they
                            rejoice to see him attack in turn, and are as really gratified by his
                            revenge, provided it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done
                            to themselves. (45)</quote></note> In other words, an ethics of
                    sympathy, when pushed to its limits results in a narcissistic reflection of
                    one’s own values and we sympathize with those whose values fundamentally reflect
                    our own. In Verezzi’s unbearable encounters with the inscrutable gaze of
                    Zastrozzi and the threatening sexuality of Matilda, Shelley’s Gothic compels us
                    to consider a crucial question that would preoccupy him throughout his career:
                    how does one respond when sympathetic identification with the Other is
                    impossible, when the inscrutable desire of the Other presses too close and
                    threatens the consistency of one’s subjectivity? </p>
                <p> If the Enlightenment critical procedure is to demystify the image of the Other
                    (nature, sexual difference, power, etc.) by bringing it under the determinations
                    of the symbolic, then the Gothic strategy would be to reveal how this determined
                    image is non-identical with itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        paradigmatic example of the non-identity between the image and its concept
                        is the creature from Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>,
                        who materializes the unaccountable gaps that haunt any totalizing concept of
                        the Enlightenment subject.</note> The demystification of Gothic effects, as
                    exemplified in Radcliffe for example, may indeed reveal the illusions produced
                    through epistemological error, but the price to be paid for this demystification
                    is a further mystification of the network of intersubjective relations that
                    point to another register of the Gothic, the “real” of desire, i.e. the
                    impenetrable desire of the Other and its irreducible excess, the engine which
                    drives paranoiac fantasies of conspiracy and persecution, the implications of
                    which were not lost on David Hume who, in <title level="m">A Treatise of Human
                        Nature</title>, writes:<quote> For what is more capricious than human
                        actions? What more inconstant than the desires of man? And what creature
                        departs more widely, not only from right reason, but from his own character
                        and disposition? An hour, a moment is sufficient to make him change from one
                        extreme to another, and overturn what cost the greatest pain and labour to
                        establish. Necessity is regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and
                        uncertain. (184)</quote> While the Gothic—in its figurative and narrative
                    extravagance—may at first appear to be an unsuitable aesthetic mode through
                    which to ground concrete ideological critique, Shelley deftly subverts the
                    diegetic reality of the narrative in favor of a reality that explores the
                    socio-psychological dynamic that creates the dialectical tension between
                    transgressive revolutionary action and paranoiac conservative reaction.<note

                    following question: To what extent are those who are excluded from or
                    marginalized within the dominant ideology still subject to its norms and
                    prohibitions?</p>
                <p> In his <title level="m">Memoirs of Shelley</title>, Thomas Love Peacock cites
                        <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as one of the few times Shelley
                    “descended into the arena of reality” (73), but it is in his early Gothic novels
                    that Shelley first grounds abstract philosophical, social, sexual, and ethical
                    antagonisms within the concrete register of intersubjective relations. The
                    “ineffectual Angel” strain of criticism—the result of a complicated cultural
                    machine starting with Mary Shelley, Hogg, and Hunt and later solidified by
                    Peacock and Arnold<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an excellent overview
                        of the evolution of Shelley’s critical reception, see Donald H. Reiman and
                        Neil Fraistat, “Shelley’s Reputation before 1960,” in <title level="m"
                            >Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> (<title level="m">SPP</title>), pp.
                        539-49.</note>—has long since been displaced by the post-structuralist
                    Shelley who deconstructs the concrete representations of diegetic reality to
                    reveal the abstract structures of language and ideology which produce the
                    subjective effect of reality. The antagonisms generated between the concrete
                    particularity of self-experience and the abstract categories through which it is
                    mediated drives much of the productive tension in Shelley’s mature work and
                    sustains its enduring Gothic sensibility. Although similar, I do not equate the
                    post-structuralist subject with the Gothic subject, nor the post-structuralist
                    Shelley with the Gothic Shelley. The difference between the two hinges on the
                    status of the “object,” or rather, the persistence of the object; i.e, the
                    remainder of the real that resists symbolization and therefore cannot be reduced
                    to or recuperated within the socio-symbolic field—another example of the
                    non-identity of a concept with itself. These antagonisms of non-identity will
                    continue to haunt the post-Enlightenment revolutionary agency that Shelley
                    articulates in later works such as <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound,</title>
                    a touchstone text that exemplifies Shelley’s attempt to transcend the
                    antagonisms he explored in his early Gothic novels and poetry and to comprehend
                    the psychopathology of power itself.</p>
