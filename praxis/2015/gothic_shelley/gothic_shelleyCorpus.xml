               <p>Given the growing interest in the relationship between “Romantic” and “Gothic”
                    writing, surprisingly little attention has been given to Percy Bysshe Shelley,
                    for whom, more than any other major Romantic, the Gothic arguably provided the
                    most powerful and lasting influence. Although Shelley claimed, in a letter to
                    William Godwin, that by 1812 he was no longer a “votary of Romance,” the Gothic
                    aesthetic saturates his early poetry and casts a gloomy shadow over even the
                    most idealistic moments in his mature work. As a budding Gothic novelist himself
                    during his teenage years, Shelley appears to have grown impatient with the
                    narrative constraints of prose fiction, choosing instead to invest his creative
                    energies in poetry while still exploring the aesthetic possibilities and
                    contradictions associated with the Gothic aesthetic. His reading habits and
                    poetic interests suggest that what he had given up was not an interest in the
                    Gothic itself but in the stock conventions of the “Old Gothic” of Walpole and
                    Radcliffe that had since become the object of satire in the early-nineteenth
                    century. According to Mary Shelley’s Journal, both Mary and Percy continued to
                    read a number of Gothic texts, which included William Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>; Charles Brockden Brown’s <title level="m">Weiland</title>, <title level="m">Ormond</title>, <title level="m">Edgar
                        Huntley</title>, and <title level="m">Arthur Merwyn</title>; Charlotte
                    Dacre’s <title level="m">Zafloya</title>; Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                        Williams </title>and <title level="m">St. Leon</title>; Caroline Lamb’s
                        <title level="m">Glenarvon</title>; Charles Maturin’s <title level="m">Fatal
                        Revenge; or the Family of Montorio</title> and <title level="m">J</title>.
                        <title level="m">Bertram</title>; Thomas Love Peacock’s <title level="m">Nightmare Abbey </title>(in which Shelley is playfully satirized in the
                    character of Scythrop); John Polidori’s <title level="m">The Vampyre</title>;
                    along with all of Matthew Lewis’s and Ann Radcliffe’s works. Shelley also
                    enjoyed the Gothic productions of Germany, which included Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>; Frederick Schiller’s <title level="m">The Robbers
                    </title>and <title level="m">The Ghost Seer</title>; and the aptly titled <title level="m">Phantasmagoriana</title>, a French translation of supernatural
                    stories that was translated into English in 1812 as <title level="m">Tales of
                        the Dead</title>. </p>
               <p> The contributors to this volume aim to explore the ways in which Shelley
                    “delimits” the Gothic, opening the symbolic potentiality of an aesthetic that is
                    always caught between its reactionary and revolutionary, reifying and
                    transformative impulses. Shelley’s early poetry and prose, including his two
                    published Gothic novels—<title level="m">Zastrozzi, a Romance </title>(1810)
                    and <title level="m">St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian</title> (1811)—and his
                    first book-length poem, <title level="m">The Wandering Jew; or The Victim of the
                        Eternal Avenger</title> (1809/10), have received scant critical attention,
                    often relegated to appendices or a “Juvenilia” section in editions of Shelley’s
                    works. The essays in this volume, however, call for an analysis that approaches
                    these works with the same theoretical rigor that his mature poetry receives and,
                    thus, to fill a gap in Shelley scholarship by establishing new readings and
                    identifying avenues for future research. We all argue, in different ways, that
                    recognizing Shelley’s Gothic sensibility is fundamental to fully appreciate his
                    struggle to mediate the Gothic antagonisms that persist in his poetry throughout
                    his career. Each essay in the volume interrogates the distinction between what
                    can be called the <title level="m">Shelleyan</title> subject of Romanticism and
                    the <title level="m">Shelleyesque</title> subject of Gothicism. Where the
                    Shelleyan gaze finds synthesis, desire, pleasure, beauty, benevolence, and
                    being; the Shelleyesque gaze finds antagonism, drive, <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, monstrosity, perversion, and lack. We resist the
                    temptation to literalize this split or to apply a rigid definition to either his
                    Gothic or Romantic works, terms that should be used provisionally. As Michael
                    Gamer reminds us in his <title level="m">Romanticism and the Gothic, </title>“at
                    the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century . . . neither
                    ‘gothic’ nor ‘romantic’ had yet taken their modern meanings” and that the Gothic
                    is rather “a discursive site crossing the genres” (2-3). As the essays in this
                    volume demonstrate, the tension between <emph>Shelleyesque</emph>-Gothic and <emph>Shelleyean</emph>-Romantic
                    aesthetic modes operate dialectically, if not antagonistically, across the
                    entirety of Shelley’s writing. </p>
               <p> Rather than an undisciplined juvenile phase of Shelley’s development (as many
                    critics have argued), the <emph>Shelleyesque</emph> haunts the
                        <emph>Shelleyan</emph> in unsettling and provocative ways. The
                    Gothic, for Shelley, thus provides an aesthetic foil against which his most
                    idealistic moments are generated. Shelley’s Gothic provides a baseline account,
                    so to speak, of his earliest attempts to articulate a mode of subjectivity that
                    recognizes rather than sublimates the political, sexual, psychological, and
                    aesthetic antagonisms produced within the social field where the combinatory
                    dynamics between subject, self, object, and other are expressed. Shelley’s
                    Gothic indexes a site of failure when imagination stutters or when the
                    aspirations of the Romantic ego are confronted with the void of subjective
                    destitution. But the Gothic also opens up the possibility of symbolic
                    transgression and transfiguration, exploiting the aesthetic machinery of the
                    Gothic tradition while radically undercutting the expectations associated with
                    that tradition. </p>
               <p> Jerrold Hogle’s essay outlines the contours of what he calls the “Gothic
                    Complex” in Shelley’s works. This complex of “interacting symbolic processes,”
                    which Hogle argues can be found from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s
                    Walpolean borrowings all the way through to <title level="m">The Triumph
                        Life</title>, serve as a “repository for unresolved conflicts among
                    contending beliefs.” Focusing on the “Shape all light” from the <title level="m">Triumph</title>, Hogle shows how this Janus-faced figure exemplifies
                    Shelley’s preoccupation with Gothic imagery that is “continuously being
                    un-shaped and re-shaped again” as Shelley himself shapes and is re-shaped by the
                    symbolic processes he employs. Ultimately, for Hogle, Shelley, the poem, and its
                    audience “cannot escape from the systems of belief” Shelley wishes to dismantle. </p>
               <p> Tilottama Rajan takes up Professor Hogle’s “Gothic Complex” and refigures it as
                    a “Gothic Matrix.” Rajan asks whether the Gothic complex “serves as a transition
                    out of a particular historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent
                    kernel of error at the heart of all idealism.” Rajan argues that the “flattened
                    out” Gothic complex that Shelley inherited becomes a matrix “interimbricated
                    with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses texts that
                    do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre.” Rajan analyzes the fluidity
                    and creative potential of this matrix by drawing on Hegel’s distinction between
                    the “symbolic” and “romantic.” For Hegel, the symbolic mode registers the
                    insufficiency of the idea to its content, whereas the romantic mode registers
                    the insufficiency of the content to its idea. The Gothic, as the symbolic
                    disfigurement of the Romantic idea, is thus a “shelter for the potentiality of
                    superstition and perversion,” which Rajan sees exemplified in the dual figure of
                    Ginotti/Nempere in Shelley’s second Gothic novel, <title level="m">St. Irvyne;
                        or, The Rosicrucian</title>. </p>
               <p> Robert Miles’s essay on <title level="m">The Cenci</title> reflects upon the
                    theoretical approaches of Hogle and Rajan and notes that “Gothic and Romantic
                    are indispensible terms for delineating a whole that is larger than either.”
                    Miles argues that the Gothic complex, or “symbolic constitution,” produces an
                    intractable deadlock in <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as: “the dead hand of
                    the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that live on in the
                    present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral antinomy that prods the
                    reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of
                    tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining historical agency; the delusive
                    glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and certainly not least, critique of
                    Burke.” Miles reads Shelley’s Introduction to the drama against itself, pointing
                    out that “to explore one’s own dark heart,” as Shelley instructs, “one would in
                    casuistical fashion need to name and identify all possible motivations for a
                    particular desire. The act of bringing them to light is also the act of bringing
                    them to horrific life.” For Miles, the difficult ethical demands of <title level="m">The Cenci</title> reveal a Shelley who is “uncompromising about
                    our inability to emancipate ourselves into free agency while drawing upon inner
                    resources.”</p>
               <p> From Christopher Bundock’s historiographic perspective, “the Gothic offers
                    Romantic and modern culture a space in which to explore but also contain—through
                    predictable, formulaic gambits—the institutional dismemberment and
                    re-articulation often glossed as secularization.” Through a wide-ranging
                    analysis that focuses on <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> and <title level="m">Adonais</title>, Bundock explores the tensions between the <title level="m">Shelleyesque</title> and the <title level="m">Shelleyean</title>
                    in relation to the persistence of the “matter” of history and of the act of
                    historicization itself. For Bundock, “unnatural, physical reanimation offers
                    form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is excluded from official
                    accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology.” The figure of the Wandering
                    Jew, excluded from Christian history, “collapses progressive history by bearing
                    trauma materially out of the past and into the future.” Similarly, in <title level="m">Adonais</title> Shelley places Keats—his death and body—in a
                    “material vision of history” that exceeds transcendence and eludes mediation,
                    where “elegiac mourning is recast and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity.” </p>
               <p> My own essay on <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> resonates with Hogle’s and
                    Rajan’s theorization of the regressive and progressive tendencies of Gothic
                    iconography for Shelley. My reading of Shelley’s first significant publication
                    places the work in the literary-historical context of the anti-Jacobin backlash
                    against the scandalous transgressions of the Gothic and the threatening
                    progressivism of republican philosophical positions. Shelley enters the fray
                    late in the game and positions <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as an
                    exercise of generic mimicry, but as an ambitious satire of the “Jacobin
                    monster.” In the character of Zastrozzi, Shelley condenses anti-Jacobin fears
                    and shows how such figures exert their control over the reactionary mind,
                    generating a plague of fantasies for the ostensible “hero” of the novel,
                    Verezzi. At the same time, Shelley also “subjectivizes” the paranoiac image of
                    the other and reveals the impotence of the individual behind the sublime mask.
                    Thus Shelley’s early use of the Gothic is a critical, though perhaps blunt,
                    instrument in the demystification of ideology. But <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> also introduces obstacles that haunt any totalizing
                    concept of the Enlightenment subject and/or Romantic ego. Zastrozzi, whether as
                    sublime figure of the anti-Jacobin paranoiac imaginary or impotent subject, is
                    still an implacable other bent on revenge, resistant to the ethics of
                    sympathetic identification, guilt, or shame. </p>
               <p> In later works such as <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>,
                    and <title level="m">Hellas</title>, Shelley confronts similar tyrannical
                    figures that echo back to Zastrozzi and the Gothic antagonism he presents to
                    emergent Romantic consciousness. Whether or not Shelley is successful in
                    mediating or transcending those antagonisms depends in large part on whether we,
                    as readers and critics of Shelley, consider his Gothic aesthetic to be limiting
                    or delimiting. It is our hope in this volume to spur further critical
                    investigations into the vexed relationship between Romanticism and the Gothic,
                    being fully aware that, as Shelley put it in <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>,
                    “much yet remains unscanned.” </p>

               <p>
               The persistent use of Gothic motifs by Shelley from his early Gothic novels
               (1810-11) all the way to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (1822) has
               only been partly explained up until now.  This essay argues that Shelley develops,
               across his career in ways especially visible in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, a "Gothic complex" of connected features that look all the way back
               to how the "Gothic Story" began in Horace Walpole's <title level="m">The Castle of
                  Otranto</title> (1764).  By developing these features as he does, Shelley is
               able to reveal with great power the underlying conflicts at his (and our) time
               between retrograde belief-systems that people still accept as dominant and true, on
               the one hand, and, on the other, progressive re-castings of those old shapes that
               can make them point to revolutionary ideologies that can change the world as his
               characters and readers perceive it.

               <p>Ever since John Murphy in 1975 traced the persistence of “Gothic” figurations from
               P.B. Shelley’s earliest works through <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, we
               have come to see, as Stephen Behrendt has said in his edition of Shelley’s <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (1811),
               “unmistakable foreshadowings” in those adolescent “romances” of his major
               achievements between 1818 and 1822 (Shelley 2002b, 12). A vital question remains,
               however: what is really <emph>most</emph> fundamentally <emph>Gothic</emph> — and
               what is most fundamentally symbolized because of that Gothicism — in what continues
               from those early efforts all the way to the unfinished <title level="m">Triumph of
                  Life</title>? Even the best explanations since Murphy of what lasts from this
               poet’s youthful recastings of Ann Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, and Charlotte Dacre do not
               ultimately answer this question, though I think they have taken us part of the way.
               Behrendt himself rightly shows that, once Shelley gets past direct imitations of
               Lewis or Dacre (as in his poem on “The Wandering Jew”), his early romances point, as
               the Gothic always has, to a “world in which traditional beliefs and values have
               eroded” but also one where the pull of those past ideologies remains (Shelley 2002b,
               20). The result in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, Behrendt concludes, is “an unwillingness to fully ‘resolve’ the
               myriad contradictions” in the Gothic rendering of their major characters, who thus
               become precursors of the powerful complexity in the Beatrice of Shelley’s Gothic play
                  <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819; Shelley 2002b, 30-31). John Whatley
               essentially agrees by pointing out how these early novels “critique . . . religious
               symbolism through [the] progressive philosophy” expressed by the most villainous
               characters as they echo Enlightenment thinkers important to Shelley, albeit within
               the frame of a traditional Gothic moralizing (Whatley 1999, 202). The consequence is
               a “struggle between opposing views” acted out through conflicts between different
               kinds of signifiers, so much so that “Zastrozzi” and the “Matilda” he serves or
               “Wolfstein” as he is tempted towards selling his soul by the Rosicrucian “Ginotti” in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvine </title>“hover in a curious, irresolvable middle state
               between [the older] motivated symbol and [the newer] atheist sign” (Whatley 1999, 205
               and 217). </p>
               <p>But is what Behrendt and Whatley reveal spawned by Shelley’s own struggles among
               attitudes as they fill the by-now extreme conventionality of the Gothic figures he
               adapts, or are such irresolutions (as these critics intimate, but only sketchily)
               bound up with the symbolic possibilities endemic to Gothic conventions? Peter Finch
               has neatly sidestepped this question by seeing the intercalated plots of <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, the Wolfstein story in a German-Gothic mode
               reminiscent of Lewis and the Eliose story in a sentimental mode that recalls
               Rousseau’s <title level="m">La Nouvelle Heloise</title>, as simply manifesting a
               “contesting pull of narratives” that Shelley will work to critique and then recombine
               in his later writing (Finch 36). Yet this argument begs the question of how much
               both sets of conventions are bound up together, not just in the works of Ann
               Radcliffe, but in the deliberate launching of the post-medieval Gothic in Horace
               Walpole’s <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> of 1764-65. The most
               provocative approach to Shelley’s Gothicism, though, has been offered by Tilottama
               Rajan. For her <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title> put in “question the cultural stereotypes in which they remain
               caught” because of their Gothic predecessors, so much so that they both “write” and
               “withdraw a transgressive narrative” at the same time (Rajan 243). That is because
               they emphasize the “floating” nature of long-overused signifiers, including their
               Gothicized character-types, and use them, especially the Ginotti of the Wolfstein
               plot also called “Nempere” in the Eloise plot, to suggest a “semantic excess” of
               inconsistent references to incompatible texts, from the very old to the current, that
               exposes “the overdetermination of social and psychic texts in which” Shelley’s early
               Gothic form of “narrative has its genesis” (Rajan 243, 245, 246). Nevertheless, the
               question remains: are these semi-transgressions almost entirely Shelley’s, given how
               emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they really creative extensions of
               what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in the conflicting tendencies
               endemic to its symbolic constitution?</p>
               <p>I want to argue for the second of these alternatives. Shelley, I believe, especially
               in the best work of his final year as it builds on the most Gothic features of his
               early fictions, exploits the symbolic possibilities, including the contradictions,
               most basic to the Gothic as a mixed and self-questioning mode. He does so to such an
               extent that it is those very dynamics that often make his final writings what they
               are, and it is the very nature of the Gothic as he first explored it that sets the
               stage for those late “triumphs” as they deal with the conflicting systems of belief
               that he kept attempting to bridge throughout his writing. Indeed, I think that
               Shelley develops a “Gothic complex” of interacting symbolic processes, based on
               elements he experiments with as early as <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and the
               poems preceding it, that is carried out quite thoroughly as late as <title level="m">The Triumph of Life </title>and consequently fulfills the potentials for
               suggestion most inherent in the Gothic features of his earliest work, ones that end
               up driving Shelley as much as he employs and transmogrifies them. </p>
               <p>Although Whatley has more recently seen such a dynamic (as I do too) in the movement
               of the “Shape all Light” recounted by Shelley’s re-creation of Rousseau (Whatley
               2003, 80-89), this Gothic complex is manifested most fully in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>, as I read it (Shelley 2002a, 483-500), when its Narrator
               describes the victims of “Life’s” captivation of them by emphasizing how much their
               methods of self-definition sadly resemble the symbolic rendering of Life itself in
               its all-conquering chariot. That parallel is most visible in the passages from <title level="m">The Triumph </title>I now cite here from the Narrator’s dream-vision,
               particularly when the “shadow” overarching each walker reappears in the “dusky hood”
               of Life’s shapeless “Shape”: <quote>

               he sees its profusion of “dim forms” as proceeding, on the one hand, from the
               draining of substance from the body that each shadow recalls and, on the other, from
               the “creative [or is it de-creative?] ray” of Life’s central “car” that really

                  </quote> I find that Shelley’s “Gothic complex” is never more active than at these
               moments and that these manifestations collectively bring forth the cruxes of his
               earlier Gothicism, their deepest symbolic roots in the Walpolean Gothic, and the
               kinds of meanings that can best be located in this kind of fiction-making, which is
               indeed both highly regressive and radically progressive at the same time.</p>
               <p> To begin with, the “shadows” of themselves projected by, yet finally controlling,
               Life’s prisoners are indeed allusions to the material simulacra given off by objects
               and people in Book IV of Lucretius’s <title level="m">De rerum natura</title> (ca. 55
               BC), also a critique of imperial Rome (Turner 281-82). But they recall just as much
               what Terry Castle has so perceptively seen in Radcliffe’s Gothic of the mid-1790s:
               the tendency in her (as well as Shelley’s) Lockean sense of perception to
               “spectralize” whatever impressions it receives, given that all perceptions are not
               objects but traces on the <foreign>tabula rasa</foreign> of our sensorium. This
               vision of “all things existing only as perceived,” an axiom used in both Shelley’s
               essay “On Life” (1819) and his <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> (1821;
               Shelley 2002a, 506 and 533), results in a Radcliffean world-view, as Castle puts it,
               based on an “absorbing faith in the fantastic” whereby every ghost-like trace — each
               overlaid by a mental interpretation of it formed out of “ideas” developed from
               memories of other such traces — turns every other person or object or landscape into
               a phantom, including externalizations interpreted (as so many are) to be mirrors of
               the self (Castle 246). Such an empirical-but-also-Gothic understanding, Shelley
               comes to see under Radcliffe’s influence among others, produces “a kind of thinking
               dominated by nostalgic mental images” whereby “phatasmic objects” seem “even more
               real at times than the material world” (Castle 247). As a result, the perceivers of
               such phantasms as self-images, for example the slaves of Life in Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, submit their thinking to spectral figures of themselves
               based on a past that is taken to be more real and permanent than it really is or was.
               Their self-images thus become in their eyes fixed definitions of their “selves” to
               which they believe they must submit, even though those “dim forms” are actually
               ghosts of what is dead (made explicit by the skeletal “old anatomies” in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>). Indeed, that extension of spectralization, as
               Rousseau’s dream presents it, means that such self-images can operate like
               “vampire-bats,” less a figure from Radcliffe and more of a nod to the gradual
               Gothicizing of the vampire-figure in the eighteen-teens by Byron and Coleridge, then
               Mary Shelley, then John Polodori’s <title level="m">The Vamypre</title> (1819; see
               Hogle 2004). Shelley’s 1822 bloodsuckers, each being a version of thought’s empire
               over itself, psychologically drain the life out of every perceiver who believes
               himself subject to them as permanent points of reference and so keeps obeying his
               former sense of his own nature. In that way, they enact the Death-in-Life that
               captivates those who have accepted the control of a master construct (“Life”) also
               “de-form[ed]” vampirically by its own “dusky hood,” the “shadow of a tomb” or “old
               anatomy” to which It, itself an antiquated perception of existence, keeps submitting
               over and over.</p>
               <p>After all, this Gothic retrospection also harkens back to Walpole’s <title level="m">Otranto, </title>beyond its own echoes of Locke, to the way the three different
               ghosts there are far more shades of shades than they are specters of bodies. As I
               have noted on other occasions (as in Hogle 2012), one <title level="m">Otranto
               </title>specter is an enlarged fragment of an effigy over a grave (almost
                  <emph>literally</emph> the “shadow of a tomb”), another is an image that walks out
               of a full-length portrait, and the third, the ghost of the Hermit of Joppa who
               intones warnings from the mouth of his fleshless skull (anticipating Shelley’s “old
               anatomies”), is a blatant re-presentation of a <foreign>dance macabre</foreign>
               skeleton from medieval painting. All of these are thoroughly floating signifiers,
               “shadows of shadows” in Rousseau’s words from Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, not surprising, it turns out, for a Protestant author (Horace
               Walpole) whose equally famous letters celebrate his own antiquarianism as a playing
               with old icons that “cannot disappoint” because there is no longer any “reason to
               quarrel with their emptiness” (Walpole 1937-83, 10: 192). In the Preface to his first
               edition of <title level="m">Otranto</title>, we should remember, where he pretends to
               be the translator of a post-Reformation manuscript that once kept alive a Catholicism
               that for him <emph>should</emph> be fading, Walpole sets up all the Catholic specters
               and machinery in his tale to be viewed as symbols “exploded now even from romances”
               and thus emptied of their old grounds of belief even as they continue to play those
               out for audiences of a later time (Walpole 1996, 6). Consequently, readers of what
               Walpole himself labeled the first new kind of “Gothic Story” in his Second Edition of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> (1996, 3) face tormented characters, often
               debating within themselves, whose beliefs make them subject to “phantoms” that are
               actually “dim forms,” yet forms which they take to be indicators of unchangeable
               reference-points in the past haunting them by drawing them back towards those
               supposed grounds, however outdated. Walpole’s own critique of the medieval Gothic
               materials in his neo-Gothic, we find, right along with his and Radliffe’s Lockean
               sense of perception, is clearly among the fundamental pretexts for Shelley’s critique
               of the way so many of us enslave ourselves to a fixed sense of life by accepting old
               symbolic orders, especially in the ways we mirror ourselves to ourselves in what are
               really the “base broods” (or symbolic constructs) of “old anatomies.”</p>
               <p>At the same time, though, the Gothic, even for Walpole, is not that simple, so
               neither is Shelley’s “Gothic complex” in <title level="m">The Triumph </title>and
               elsewhere. As much as Walpolean Gothic figures can be exposed as “floating
               signifiers” separable from their older grounds and thus able to signify newer ones,
               there is an insistent antiquity in them, much as there is in Shelley’s reenactment of
               Dantean and Petrarchan dream-visions and terza-rima verse-forms along with echoes of
               the eighteenth-century Gothic in his new <title level="m">Trionf</title>. Such a
               paradox at the very core of the Gothic indicates (in David Punter’s words), yes, a
               “fear of the violence of the past and its power over the present,” hence <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s vision of Life as echoing ancient Rome’s paradings
               of its captives, but also a “longing for many of the qualities” and secure grounds of
               belief “which that past possessed” or at least seemed to in retrospect (Punter 418).
               As Karl Marx has shown, the rise of new ideologies and modes of production struggles
               against the still-powerful draw of older beliefs and systems of exchange, and the
               Gothic is the most flagrant symbolic manifestation of that cultural contestation in
               the history of English fiction-making. The pull of “ancient romance” elements,
               “exploded” as they are, is just as strong in the neo-Gothic as the pull of the more
               “modern” ones akin to the rising middle-class novel, according to Walpole’s
               definition of “Gothic Story” in his Preface to <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s
               Second Edition (Walpole 1996, 9-11). That looking-backwards-and-forwards
               simultaneously, like the “Janus-faced Shadow” that actually drives Life’s chariot for
               Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference, which he expressed in the 1750s, for
               keeping at least a “shadow of monarchy” on an otherwise “empty chair of state,” like
               the “ghost of Banquo” in Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Macbeth</title> (Walpole
               1847, 377), rather than facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually
               made England (and even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France. It is for these
               reasons that E.J. Clery has so correctly viewed the first “Gothic Story” as setting a
               pattern by both articulating and disguising a profound “contradiction” in the culture
               of Walpole’s time, in his case “between the traditional claims of [aristocratic]
               landed property and the new claims for the [bourgeois] private family” (Clery 77).
               With its Janus-faced symbols, style, and focus on characters so internally
               conflicted, the Gothic has consequently become in the post-Renaissance West <emph>the
               </emph>fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the
               culture between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced, as the fear
               of death and dissolution are in Edmund Burke’s terror-based “Sublime” also basic to
               the Gothic tradition, yet where those unresolved quandaries are hyperbolically
               reenacted and played out in the guise of concurrently retrograde and experimental
               fiction able to be conservative and progressive all at once.</p>
               <p>Shelley’s continuation of the Gothic in his <title level="m">Triumph</title>,
               therefore, is willingly pulled towards the kind of enslavements to patterns of sin
               allegorized by Petrarch and Dante, yet it remains determined to show that their very
               Catholic patterns of God-centered allegory are based on the projections of mere
               thoughts into externalized “shadows” that have come to be interpreted as absolute
               truths and thus as tyrannizing sources of “fear” enforcing submission – all of which
               is a use of allegorical figures to attack the premises of old allegory itself,
               without leaving them behind altogether, alongside resurrections of Walpolean and
               Burkean “old anatomies” to show how such emptied-out figures can still have the
               psychological force they do. Ultimately Shelley realizes in his rendering of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> that he, his poem, and his audience cannot
               entirely escape from the systems of belief he wants to explode in it, one reason for
               the persistence of the construction of Life that drives this poem’s throngs while
               Life itself turns out to be no more than a “Shape” continuously being un-shaped and
               re-shaped again. Even the shade of Rousseau, in serving as a Virgilian truth-teller
               to Shelley’s Dantean Narrator, is unable to overcome a lingering contradiction of
               ideologies in his own beliefs only somewhat revised from those of the author of whom
               he is a sympathetic critique. As much as he blames himself for striving to arrest and
               confine the movement of the “Shape all light” in his
               dream-within-the-Narrator’s-dream, even as it keeps transfiguring itself from state
               to state, “forever sought, forever lost” (l. 431), that Shape is itself a
               retrospective Beatricean as well as a revolutionary “Asia” or “Witch of Atlas” figure
               from Shelley’s earlier poetry. Rousseau in Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>
               thus remains undecided as to how much his own submission to “Life” is his willful
               fault in the face of her transference across traces of perception <emph>or</emph> how
               much that failing results from the necessary influence of the environment in which he
               was placed while he lived: “if the spark with which heaven lit my spirit / Earth had
               with purer nutriment supplied,” he wonders in a passage <emph>not</emph> cited above
               that echoes the Wordsworth “Immortality” Ode about which Shelley was always
               conflicted, would “Corruption . . . not now thus much inherit / Of what was once
               Rousseau” and now both is and is not him simultaneously (ll. 201-04)? The struggle
               Shelley famously had with William Godwin’s view of Necessity within his early “Gothic
               sensibility” (as Donald Reiman called it in 1981) – how much is behavior determined
               by choice or by environment? — is manifestly unresolved in his final unfinished
               poem, and we now see it is the persistence of the Gothic in that very <title level="m">Triumph</title> that most conceals and reveals that irresolution, and
               many other quandaries of Shelley’s era, even as he was about to set sail into the
               Gulf of Spezia. </p>
               <p>In any case, speaking of echoes, this whole Gothic process conjoined with others is,
               in its “complex” of disparate yet interconnected elements, remarkably, if not
               completely, similar to what we often see in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, published 11-12 years earlier. Consider this
               passage taken from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, a moment so typical of the
               overwrought characterizations in this tale’s constant echoing of <title level="m">The

                     Verezzi; she gazed downwards [since he had cast himself at her feet] upon his
                     majestic and youthful figure; she looked upon his soul-illumined countenance,
                     and tenfold love assailed her softened soul. She raised him – in an oblivious
                     delirium of sudden fondness she clasped him to her bosom and, in wild and
                     hurried expressions, asserted her right to his love.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Her breast palpitated with fierce emotions; she pressed her
                     burning lips to his; most fervent, most voluptuous sensations of ecstacy
                     reveled through her bosom.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Verezzi caught the infection; in an instant of oblivion, every
                     fidelity which he had sworn to another, like a baseless cloud, dissolved away;
                     a Lethean torpor crept over his senses; he forgot Julia, or remembered her only
                     as an uncertain vision, which floated before his fancy more as an ideal being
                     of another world, which he might thereafter adore there, than as an enchanting
                     and congenial female, to whom his oaths of eternal fidelity had been given.
                     (Shelley 2002b, 139) </p>
                  </quote> While it does repeat the spectralized images
               of other beings projected and then obsessed upon by the characters of both Lewis and
               Dacre, with Radcliffe hovering in the background, this moment has the confused
               Verezzi, not knowing he is Zastrozzi’s hated half-brother, envision his long-time
               projection of the remembered “Julia” as separating from her now “uncertain” form in
               the past and receding behind the Matilda who has relentlessly pursued him, yet
               explicitly <emph>without</emph> Julia disappearing as his ultimate ideal.
                  <emph>This</emph> complex recalls the ending of Walpole’s <title level="m">Otranto</title> where Theodore, finally revealed as the Castle’s true heir,
               accepts marriage to the Isabella once pursued by the usurping Manfred but keeps
               thinking of the dead “Matilda” (here the daughter of Manfred) whom he loved devotedly
               before she died, as Verezzi thinks Julia has at this point in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>. Shelley’s early Gothic thereby replays the figural pattern of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s final sentence, in which Theodore decides “he
               could know no happiness but in the society of one [Isabella] with whom he could
               forever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul” because of
               Matilda’s irreversible absence and yet her constant looming in a remembered past that
               remains an absolute point of reference (Walpole 1996, 115), like the primal crimes
               revealed as the causes of all the specters of specters in the first neo-“Gothic
               Story.” </p>
               <p>The quintessentially Janus-faced nature of Walpole’s prototypical Gothic figure has
               undeniably been transferred from <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto </title>to
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, even to <emph>its</emph> ending where the
               title character who rejects all religious traditions also confesses the root of his
               vengeance to be the dying words of his mother (Shelley 2002b, 155). To much the same
               extent, we can now see, too, the floating signifier of Julia’s image for Verezzi,
               reinforced by Matilda’s obsession with his surface “countenance” since the start of
               Shelley’s novel, Gothically anticipates the “shadows of shadows” in the same author’s
               late <title level="m">Triumph</title> as they drift from their past referents while
               being held fixedly by their projector-observers to those very receding grounds, dead
               though they already are or, like Verezzi and Julia, are about to be. Shelley could
               not have conceived of what is really the “moment of truth” in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, the choice between accepting the drift of signifiers towards
               future redefinitions and the re-anchoring of them to dead “anatomies” from the past,
               unless there had been the tug-of-war in the Walpolean Gothic figure that he had
               thoroughly played with in his more youthful writings. He also would not have had as
               apt a symbolic mode for half-concealing and half- revealing <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>’s hesitations between free-willed choice and the pressure
               of one’s historical conditions if he had not worked with and continued to employ a
               Gothic mode <emph>designed by its nature</emph> to be a repository for unresolved
               conflicts among contending beliefs. In the <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> passage
               above, we have to admit, the text hesitates, just as <title level="m">The Triumph
               </title>will, between condemning the characters for their essentially selfish choices
               and suggesting that such choices are already made for them. After all, the same
               characters keep making the same errors again and again within the pervasive
               atmosphere of their Gothic environment. These are stances toward which they are
               driven, like the victims of Shelley’s “Life,” by what Godwin invokes in the original
               main title of his quite Gothic <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794): the
               necessary consequences of “Things As They Are.” </p>
               <p>Now we can see the fully Gothic basis of what previous interpreters have begun to
               find in Shelley’s early romances, as well as the essentials of the “Gothic complex”
               that are transferred almost intact from Walpole through the Gothic of the 1790s to
               the early Shelley and to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Myriad
               contradictions of character cannot be resolved in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
               and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as Behrendt has said, because their very
               construction is rooted in the Gothic’s <emph>at least</emph> two-directional tug of
               war between older and newer conceptions of human psychology as well as waning and
               developing economies. The equally “irresolvable middle state between the motivated
               symbol and the atheist sign” found by Whatley in Shelley’s Gothic novels stems from
               their Walpolean mix of retrogression and rebellion that makes characters and images
               both potentially floating signifiers and entities attractively anchored in past
               realities, causes, and beliefs even when those are truly dead and gone. Finch’s sense
               of the conflict between the tragically fated Gothic and the assumptions of
               sentimentalism in the plots of <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, meanwhile,
               actually stems from that novel’s acceptance of a Gothic mode that has, since its
               beginnings and <emph>not</emph> just in Radcliffe, internally combined freely-chosen
               states of feeling with fated hauntings from older assumptions, as in the ending of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> where Theodore willfully accepts a woman because
               she can help him indulge his “melancholy” over his lost true love but also because he
               cannot help himself as the destined resolver of an age-old usurpation guided, perhaps
               from heaven, towards a marriage that reunites the two families with the most
               sanctioned claims to the castle of Otranto. The quite similar depiction of unresolved
               tensions between external and internal causalities in <title level="m">Zastrozzi,</title>
                  <title level="m">St. Irvine,</title> and <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
               is made possible, after all, by the Walpolean Gothic providing unique verbal means
               specifically for configuring ideological conflicts and their nagging irresolution.
               Finally, too, what we have learned from Professor Rajan’s 1990s take on Shelley’s use
               of Gothic (apart from what she has added in this very collection) depends entirely on
               the Gothic itself being inherently a mode dominated by the uprooted, though also
               backward-looking, signifier that can refer in its incessant mobility to many
               different texts and ideologies of its own and former times – and thereby to the
               conflicting ideologies in its many pre-texts that always (in Rajan’s words)
               “overdetermine” it and make its symbols refer to a “semantic excess” of
               “indeterminate” cultural debates. This dynamic is part of the disunified “essence” of
               the Gothic in which, as Rajan has said, “reality has been replaced by hyperreality,
               and mimesis by the simulacrum” (Rajan 243). I contend that Shelley’s critiques of
               his own culture from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> to <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life </title>employ the Gothic as powerfully as they do precisely by
               bringing forward these deep tensions at the core of it. This is the “Gothic complex”
               he develops across his career so as to help his audiences realize the crossroads of
               choices they face, unless they chose to ignore them, between the most retrospective
               and destructive and the most progressive and liberating options for the ways we can
               construct Life for ourselves then, now, and in the future. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>This paper begins with the Gothic, exemplified in Shelley’s early Gothic novels
            <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as
            an overdetermined and unprocessed moment that interrupts aesthetic ideology, and
            that is problematically entwined with the Romantic in ways that help to illuminate
            the deconstructive role that the Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. More
            particularly, I approach this interimbrication through Hegel’s distinction between
            “Symbolic” and Romantic art in his <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, which
            distinguishes three modes based on art’s (in)ability fully to configure the “Idea.”
            In Symbolic art the “Idea” is still "indeterminate"; it achieves “adequate
            embodiment” in Classicism; but in the Romantic, form and content are again
            separated, because of an inadequacy in external forms that repeats and reverses the
            problems of the Symbolic. Curiously placing Classical beauty and unity in the middle
            of his dialectic, as an abandoned synthesis, Hegel oscillates between two forms of
            inadequacy that are both similar and different. For the Romantic beautiful soul
            withdraws from existing discourses, while the imagination of the Symbolic artist is
            deformed by what it cannot form. But the Romanticist thereby risks a bad infinity,
            while the Symbolic artist works on content in the here and now, even at the cost of
            trapping his work in what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy.” Given Hegel’s
            association of the Symbolic with the fantastic and monstrous but also the sublime
            (which I read here through ðiñek), we can use his category to think through
            Shelley’s use of the Gothic as a mode whose very disfigurations—and sometimes its
            conscious badness—form part of a creative negativity. The Gothic, as a stalled and
            blocked form, has been seen as a “complex.” But this makes it a vanishing mediator
            in the transition from residual to emergent societal modes. I suggest, instead, that
            it is a “matrix” for an irresolvable contention and ferment in the work of culture:
            one to which Shelley comes back again and again. In conclusion, I touch briefly on
            three of these Shelleyan returns. In <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
            Demogorgon’s clumsy overthrow of Jove is merely a parenthesis. Concessive clause.
            More complex is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, as Shelley’s autonarration of his
            unsettled relation to a poetry he conceives Romantically but Gothically dis-figures.
            Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> the Shape in the Car seems
            to punish the Idealism of the Shape all Light. But their inter-folding reconfigures
            the relation of Gothic and Romantic, as Shelley can no longer immunize “the
            splendour of unfaded beauty” against “the secrets of anatomy and corruption,” nor
            protect literature from a cultural and political debasement that, by “eat[ing] out
            the poetry” from history, actually releases a disastrous creativity.</p>

               <p> Towards the end of Shelley’s second Gothic novel <title level="m">St.Irvyne</title>
               (1811) the alchemist Ginotti is about to initiate Wolfstein into the secrets of life.
               Wolfstein is the hero of the main plot, while Ginotti is the obscure figure, the
               unstable compound, who sanctions Wolfstein’s poisoning of the bandit Cavigni to
               obtain the lovely Megalena. In the main story Ginotti functions as the Dark
               Interpreter of the increasingly dissolute Wolfstein, until the plot disposes of both
               in its Faustian “Conclusion.” The novel is also intersected by a Radcliffean subplot
               focused on Eloise, who turns out to be Wolfstein’s sister, even though she seems to
               be French while he is Bohemian. Eloise is seduced by the casuistical Nempere, rescued
               by another libertine, and marries Fitzeustace, a Peacockian parody of the Shelleyan
               Poet. This Romantic subplot fantastically escapes the Gothic main plot, by which it
               is nevertheless enveloped as Nempere turns out to be Ginotti. The result is that
               Nempere, though terminated in the subplot, is still alive in the main plot,thus
               casting doubt on whether the text has indeed disposed of the matrix figure whose
               metamorphic alias he is. And do we want to dispose of this matrix towards which the
               more obscure and elusive figure of Ginotti gestures? Or does the novel’s titular
               remembering of Godwin’s <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799), where alchemy is
               also a metonymy for schemes of sociopolitical improvement, make Ginotti a shorthand
               figure for a still undigested future transformation of “the potable waters that flow
               from death through life” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 533)? <note place="foot" resp="editors">References to <title level="m">A Defence of
                     Poetry</title> are to <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, ed.
                  Reiman and Fraistat.</note>
               </p>
               <p> Indeed this unprocessed dimension of the characters and “figures” that “rise on the
               bubble” of Gothic experimentation only to be cast off (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 248-50), is evident in the hasty algebra with which <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> ends: <quote>Ginotti is Nempere. Eloise is the sister
                  of Wolfstein. Let then the memory of these victims to hell and malice live in the
                  remembrance of those who can pity the wanderings of error; let remorse and
                  repentance expiate the offences which arise from the delusion of the passions, and
                  let endless life be sought from Him who alone can give an eternity of happiness.
                  (252)</quote> With these pious clichés Shelley throws away a project with which he
               has grown impatient. But three chapters earlier, when Ginotti promises Wolfstein the
               elixir of life, he endows this juvenile literary performance with an unexpected
               metaphysical depth. As a prelude to this promise which is never fulfilled, Ginotti
               launches into his biographia literaria.He tells how by the age of seventeen he had
               delved into the secrets of “natural philosophy” and “metaphysical calculations,”
               convincing himself of “the non-existence of a First Cause” (236-7). This
               epistemological transgression, or <foreign>acte gratuit</foreign> as André Gide might
               call it, had led him to experiment with poison, killing a youth who had offended him.
               Thereupon, having tasted death, he became despairingly nihilistic yet avid for
               eternal life. Contemplating suicide, he found himself on the edge of a gulf, facing a
               “form of most exact and superior symmetry.” The passage is worth quoting at length:
                  <quote>The phantasm advanced towards me; it seemed then, to my imagination, that
                  his figure was borne on the sweet strain of music which filled the circumambient
                  air. In a voice which was fascination itself, the being addressed me, saying,
                  `Wilt thou come with me? Wilt thou be mine?’ ... “No, no,” I unhesitatingly cried,
                  with a feeling which no language can either explain or describe. No sooner had I
                  uttered these words, than methought a sensation of deadly horror chilled my
                  sickening frame ... the beautiful being vanished; clouds, as of chaos, rolled
                  around, and from their dark masses flashed incesant meteors. ... My neck was
                  grasped firmly and, turning round in an agony of horror, I beheld a form more
                  hideous than the imagination of man is capable of portraying, whose proportions,
                  gigantic and deformed, were seemingly blackened by the inerasible traces of the
                  thunderbolts of God; yet in its hideous and detestable countenance, though
                  seemingly far different, I thought I could recognize that of the lovely vision.
                  (237)</quote>
               </p>
               <p>This passage from Shelley’s early novel strikingly anticipates
               Rousseau’s symbolic autobiography in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
               where Rousseau too is offered the elixir of life: “a chrystal glass/ Mantling with
               bright Nepenthe” (358-9). In Rousseau’s dream-vision, the Shape all light, the
               aestheticization of a revolutionary idealism that Ginotti pursues in more Sadeian and
               Nietzschean ways, becomes the deformed shape in the Car, returning us to the Gothic
               scene that opens the character “Shelley’s” dream-vision of history.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I use “Shelley” in quotation marks
                  to refer to the first-person speaker of the poem, the character Shelley, as
                  distinct from the author.</note> As in <title level="m">St Irvyne</title>, while
               the figure constructed by Romantic idealism is disfigured,<note place="foot" resp="editors">My use of this term obviously evokes de Man’s
                  “Autobiography as De-Facement” and “Shelley Disfigured” (<title level="m">The
                     Rhetoric of Romanticism</title> 67-82, 93-124). However, disfiguration is not
                  the same kind of analytic operation that deconstruction is. My use of the term
                  thus tries to restore some of the generative potential of a mutilation of figures
                  whose affect suggests the struggle or “restless fermentation” that Hegel sees in
                  the Symbolic.</note> it never quite ceases to be present in the “severe excess” of
               the enlightenment that follows: “The ghost of a forgotten form of sleep” (<title level="m">Triumph of Life</title> 424-8). While in both cases we seem to proceed
               sequentially from illusion to disillusion, both texts are better described as folding
               the Gothic and Romantic into each other. In <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, that
               is, the romance of Eloise and Fitzeustace, which itself exists only by repressing a
               traumatic Gothic kernel, is enveloped within a larger narrative of Faustian depravity
               that conceals a core of idealism disclosed and defaced in Ginotti’s vision. Likewise
               in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, “Shelley’s” dream-vision is infolded
               with Rousseau’s in a pattern of blindness and insight that confuses misprision and
               enlightenment: while Rousseau awakens from his encounter with the Shape all light to
               the nightmare of history, “Shelley” <emph>dreams</emph> this nightmare which folds
               inwards and backwards to a core of idealism at the heart of darkness.</p>
               <p> In connecting the passage from <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a more extensive discussion
                  of Shelley’s Gothic novels themselves, see Rajan, <title level="m">Romantic
                     Narrative</title> (46-74).</note> to Shelley’s last poem, I want therefore to
               suggest that it entwines the Gothic and Romantic in a way that is emblematic of the
               role Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. For in the past several years the
               Gothic has arguably replaced the greater Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for
               the field, though without the metacritical recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the
               Greater Romantic lyric. Or put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task of
               deconstructing what has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic
               ideology” (McGann; Redfield 24-7), in particular because it makes manifest, almost
               schematically, what Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past
               institutions” (II.101). The prominence of the Gothic also marks a shift from
               so-called “High” Romanticism to the popular that might superficially seem to be part
               of “cultural studies.” Yet unlike cultural studies, if the Gothic deconstructs
               Romantic ideology, it does so on the ground of literature, by exposing Romanticism to
               its own in(di)gestion of the work of the negative, rather than by demystifying it
               from the outside as a social or economic phenomenon. Thus in Shelley’s major poems
               (as also in Blake’s <title level="m">Europe</title> and <title level="m">(First) Book
                  of Urizen</title>) the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. An
               example from Shelley’s most ethereal text is the unprocessed melodrama of
               Demogorgon’s victory over Jove. But equally, for Shelley at least, the Gothic is
               never free of the Romantic, which is to say that he allows us to grasp a
               transformative potential in the violence and perversity of the Gothic that is less
               evident in more popular uses of the genre.</p>
               <p> We can approach this linkage of Romantic and Gothic through Hegel’s distinction
               between Romantic and Symbolic art: modes he opposes while conceding their profound
               connection. Hegel’s triad of Symbolic, Classical and Romantic art in his lectures on
                  <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> is particularly useful because on the one
               hand, though the post-Walpolean Gothic may not fall chronologically within the
               Oriental phase that Hegel delimits as Symbolic, Hegel’s association of the Symbolic
               with the monstrous and fantastic applies equally to the Gothic (I. 76). On the other
               hand, the Symbolic is a broader category than the Gothic, including as it does the
               sublime, which we might conventionally expect to find in the Romantic phase. As such,
               the category of the Symbolic helps to open up the Gothic philosophically beyond the
               sensationalism to which the sheer mass production of the genre at the time reduces
               it. Indeed there is a certain consistency between Hegel’s unconventional placement of
               the sublime in the Symbolic phase and my own use of the Symbolic to think through the
               (pre)Romantic genre of the Gothic. For both anachronisms register the generative
               potential of a mode whose disfigurations form part of a creative negativity.</p>
               <p> Hegel theorizes three modes based on art’s ability to fully configure the “Idea,” a
               term derived from Kant, but which is curiously unreferred in Hegel, as it is not the
               idea “of” anything and is thus a form of desire. For Kant in the <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title> “aesthetic ideas” are forms that have not quite
               found their content, while “rational ideas” are concepts (such as freedom) that have
               not achieved material form (192, 218). Thus already for Kant a certain inadequacy
               seems to be at the heart of the “Idea.” As a desire for the Idea rather than any
               specific idea, Hegel’s Idea is not unlike what Shelley defends as “poetry,” which
               often turns out to be a creativity that exceeds generic and historical containment
                  (<title level="m">Defence</title> 518). In Hegel’s sequence, which historicizes
               Kant’s analyses of the beautiful and sublime, the Symbolic, Classical and Romantic
               involve different relations between "inwardness" and its "externalization," “theme”
               and execution,” or the Idea and its "embodiment" (I.75, 79, 96, 422).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In Kant’s terms from the <title level="m">Third Critique</title> the Classical is beautiful, whereas the
                  Symbolic and Romantic are different versions of the sublime. It should be noted
                  that Hegel does not use the term “Symbolic” in the way it was used by
                  contemporaries such as Goethe, Schelling, Coleridge and others (nor in the way it
                  is used by Lacan, for whom the “symbolic order” is really an order of signs). For
                  Hegel’s contemporaries the symbol is the unification of the particular and
                  universal, whereas allegory is their separation; in effect, the symbol is a form
                  of the beautiful. For Hegel the Symbolic is one form taken by the separation of
                  particular and universal. Indeed Hegel’s inversion of the usual meaning of the
                  term is part of a complex critique—engaged with the work of Goethe and Friedrich
                  Creuzer—of the idea of art as <foreign>Darstellung</foreign> or the presencing of
                  the Idea. For elaboration of this point see Rajan, “Towards a Cultural Idealism”
                  (62-5), which also discusses the relation between Symbolic and Romantic in
                  Hegel.</note> In the Symbolic phase, which is pre-art, pre-mature, art fails to
               achieve identity with itself because of a deficiency in self-consciousness that is
               reflected in the Idea still being "indeterminate." This problem is overcome in the
               Classical, as art becomes "the adequate embodiment of the Idea" (I.76-7). But in the
               Romantic, form and content are again separated, this time because of a deficiency in
               matter that repeats and reverses the problems of the Symbolic. For while the Idea in
               the Symbolic fails to embody itself because of its own deficiency, in the Romantic
               phase the Idea is fully developed, but “can no longer find its adequate reality” in
               the “shapes” available to it in its culture (I.442). Thus the Romantic “reverts, even
               if in a higher way, to that difference and opposition of the two sides which in
               symbolic art remained unconquered” (I.79). </p>
               <p> The “critical history of Poetry” in which Shelley finds the “defence” of his Idea
               “betrayed” (528) likewise contains both Romantic and Symbolic versions of this
               inadequacy. Thus on the one hand poetry is constrained by “distorted notions” that
               result in even poets such as Dante and Milton walking “through eternity” “enveloped”
               in the “mask and mantle of prejudice” (526). On the other hand poetry is also figured
               in the quintessentially Romantic images of a “fading coal” (531) or a “lightning
               which has yet found no conductor” (528). On one level the <title level="m">Defence</title> presses towards a Romantic <foreign>telos</foreign> that disavows
               the Symbolic matrix of the history in which it finds itself embedded. Yet the very
               contradiction between the images of the fading coal and the lightning, in the first
               of which the idea is fully developed while in the second it is yet to come, marks the
               tenuousness of the Romantic category. </p>
               <p> Act IV of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, or the scene where Asia grasps
               Panthea’s dreams by reading her “written soul” in her eyes (II.i.110) are examples of
               a Romanticism that presses beyond mediation. By contrast, the Symbolic is associated
               with the monstrous or fantastic, and disfigures its too hasty hypostasis of the Idea
               through what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.76): a description we can extend to the Gothic. Thus in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> Nempere de-forms rather than embodies Ginotti
               . For his part, Ginotti is himself the inchoate materialization of a juvenile and
               indeterminate Idea. Like Demogorgon, who is nothing if not Symbolic, this Idea has
               neither “form nor outline” (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> II.iv.6). It
               is an unstable compound in which the Nietzschean “death of God” in the materialism of
               the <foreign>philosophes</foreign> makes possible social and thought experiments
               whose association with libertinism and perversion figures their underlying
               ideological contradictions. </p>
               <p> Ginotti is a “figure” that materializes at the threshold between fear and desire.
               Opposing “figure” to “discourse” Lyotard describes three levels of figuration that
               are more and more removed from any kind of clear formulation: the image-figure, which
               is visible but already blurred; the form-figure, which can be “perceived” but not
               “seen” and is a schema that underlies the visible; and finally the matrix figure,
               which is neither “visible” nor “readable,” and which is “difference itself” (277-8).
               Ginotti is this form-figure or schema that gestures towards the matrix described by
               Lyotard, which Wolfstein and Nempere, as stereotyped image-figures, disfigure through
               their “bad and untrue definiteness” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.74). Yet
               if the Gothic is “bad” literature, Shelley’s explicit association of the genre in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> with the <foreign>philosophes</foreign>
               (236-7), gives its distortions a Symbolic potential: one that Hegel recognizes when
               he describes how in the crudity of the Symbolic, “the Idea . . . persists
                  <emph>sublime</emph> above all this multiplicity of shapes which do not correspond
               with it” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> 77).</p>
               <p> Returning to Hegel, what is notable in his dialectic is the place of the Classical,
               as a synthesis oddly displaced to the middle. For the Classical, as the "unity of the
               artist's subjective activity with his work,” “achieves what true art is in its
               essential nature” (I.427, 431). Yet Hegel is dissatisfied with this completion, as
               the Classical is superseded by the Romantic, which reverts to the difference of Idea
               and shape in the Symbolic, as if it is really inadequacy which is the essence of art.
               We sense Hegel’s disappointment with the Classical when he says that the Classical
               artist adequately embodies the Idea only because he receives his content “cut and
               dried” from “national faith and myth,” leaving him free to work on the formal and
               rhetorical shaping of this content (I.439). By contrast, form and content in the
               Symbolic have a more integral relationship: Symbolic art senses "the inadequacy of
               its . . . shapes” and yet can do nothing but distort these shapes, thus "positing
               it[self] as the inherently deficient, something to be superseded" (I.318-19). Yet the
               Symbolic, as a mode in which the "Idea . . . does violence" to "natural shapes," also
               “stretches them unnaturally" in order to "<emph>elevate their phenomenal appearance
                  to the Idea</emph>" (I.76; italics mine). There is thus something sublime in its
               deformations that distinguishes it both from Classical complacency and from the
               ineffectually angelic claims of the Romantic.</p>
               <p> Hence Hegel’s strategic location of the sublime in the Symbolic rather than Romantic
               phase. For there are two kinds of Symbolic art: the “positive” art of India and
               Persia and the “negative” art of the sublime (I.364). In a section of the third
               Critique that Hegel cites, Kant argues that the physical presentation of the sublime
               (as in a raging ocean) is merely “horrible,” because it fails to understand the
               sublime as an “invisible meaning devoid of shape” that has no adequate objective
               correlative in phenomena (Hegel, Aesthetics I.363-4). Hence Kant prefers the dynamic
               sublime to a merely mathematical sublime limited to <foreign>res extensa</foreign>.
               Hegel’s criticism of Symbolic forms such as the grotesque that involve a hyperactive
               visual surface has its origin in these comments by Kant, and is generated by a
               philosophical argument against visibility as the premature foreclosure of negativity.
               The Symbolic, then, is by no means simple. It is the site of a difference between an
               Idea falsely posited in a determinate image-figure like Nempere, or Zastrozzi whose
               gigantic stature makes him mathematically sublime, and the more invisible matrix to
               which this character gestures.</p>
               <p> At the same time this matrix is by no means to be identified with the
                  <emph>transcendental</emph> Idea of the Kantian sublime. It is not just that Kant
               still assumes that “the Thing-in-itself, ” or we might say Idea, “exists as something
               positively given beyond the field of representation,” whereas for Hegel the “basic
               dialectical moment of the Sublime” consists in “the notion that the Idea is reached
               through purely negative presentation – that the very inadequacy of the phenomenality
               to the Thing is the only appropriate way to present it” (Žižek, <title level="m">Sublime Object</title> 205). Kant, as Žižek says, also refused to confront the
               monstrous (<title level="m">Plague of Fantasies</title> 280-1).Thus on the one hand,
               in the wake of the Kantian sublime, Hegel’s location of the sublime in the Symbolic
               associates even the more positive forms of the Symbolic such as the Gothic with
               projects of Reason and freedom. Hence Ginotti’s excursus on materialism (236-8) and
               Zastrozzi’s defiant embrace of an atheism that rises “above the shackles of prejudice
               . . . and injurious superstition” (153). But on the other hand the Kantian sublime
               involves a missed encounter of these projects of Pure Reason with a core of darkness
               that we necessarily confront in characters like Ginotti.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Comparing Godwin with Kant, David Collings

               freedom.</p>
               <p> Yet the Symbolic artist, “toss[ing] about in a thousand forms” and adapting “to the
               meaning sought the shapes that ever remain alien,” does possess a freedom denied to
               the Classical artist, even if this freedom is entwined with necessity (I.438-9).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For elaboration of this point see
                  Rajan, “Difficult Freedom: Hegel’s Symbolic Art and Schelling’s Historiography in
                     <title level="m">Ages of the World</title> (1815).”</note> For in Symbolic art
               “the spirit . . . shapes itself out of its own resources” (I.362). Its “restless
               fermentation” is the “labour” of the negative, wherein consciousness is still
               “producing its content and making it clear to itself,” rather than resting in ideas
               “already determined for imagination as settled” (I.438-9). Similarly, to adapt
               Shelley in <title level="m">A Defence</title>, the “distorted notions of invisible
               things” in the Gothic are the “mask and the mantle” that conceal a certain “poetry”
               (526). But this very distortion makes aesthetic form the site of a perpetually vital
               struggle between dominant, residual and emergent ideologies: one that calls for a
               symptomatic reading of what Jameson calls “the form of content” and “the content of
               form” (<title level="m">Political Unconscious</title> 99). Other essays in this
               volume also locate in the Gothic a “matrix” that continues to trouble Shelley’s work.
               But the question is whether this matrix, even if it recurs in Shelley’s work, is a
               kind of “vanishing mediator” that serves as a transition out of a particular
               historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent kernel of error at the heart
               of all idealism. And the further question is whether “error,” the word with which
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> concludes (252), simply means “mistake” or
               whether it is, in a pathological and twisted way, also creative.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Thus Stanley Corngold distinguishes between

               </p>
               <p> In Jerrold Hogle’s essay in this volume this question remains unanswered, or is
               perhaps answered in the form of a “both/and” rather than an “either/or.” In Hogle’s
               previous work, which has been seminal in opening up the seriousness of the genre, the
               post-Walpolean Gothic is the expression of a particular cultural moment that is riven
               by underlying contradictions. Or as he puts it here, it has been “<emph>the</emph>
               fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the culture
               between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced.” But insofar as
               Hogle places these irresolutions within a historical development that in fact does
               resolve them—from feudal to capitalist, Catholic to Protestant, or symbol to
               sign—the Gothic then becomes what Jameson calls a “vanishing mediator.” For Jameson,
               writing on Max Weber, the vanishing mediator is the catalyst that disappears in the
               transition from the residual to the emergent. But if Shelley inherits a “Gothic
               complex” “almost intact” from Walpole and the 1790s Gothic, and if Shelley’s Gothic
               novels are in this sense derivative, does the Gothic “complex” in becoming a “matrix”
               reconstitute the Gothic as the permanent expression of an irresolvable contention and
               ferment in the work of culture, for which Hegel’s Symbolic also provides a name? And
               is this emergence of the Gothic as not simply a complex but also a matrix what
               happens between Shelley’s early Gothic novels and <title level="m">The Triumph of
                  Life</title>? My answer would be in the affirmative. Indeed it is because the
               Gothic becomes a matrix, and not just a complex flattened out by its containment
               within a genre that is its “form-figure,” that the Gothic has become so
               interimbricated with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses
               texts that do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre: texts such as Blake’s

               <p> For on the one hand, as Hogle argues, Gothic figures are transitional insofar as
               they are “‘floating signifiers’ separable from their older grounds and thus able to
               signify newer ones.” As a result the “figures ever new” of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> (248), “the material simulacra given off by objects and
               people in Lucretius” (and Baudrillard), are the sedimented traces of past ideologies
               which they render “spectral.” The Gothic mode thus becomes an epistemology for
               diagnosing how the present continues to be haunted by the ghosts or residues of “old
               symbolic orders,” and in this way is part of the work of ideological progress. But on
               the other hand it is precisely this progress that is put in question when Shelley, as
               described by Hogle, recognizes the claims of the old as well as the new:<note place="foot" resp="editors">Shelley’s interest in Charles I,
                  on whom he wrote a fragmentary play, is also relevant here.</note> hence the
               functioning of these figures not just as “signs” but more archaically as “symbols.” I
               would go farther and suggest that the force of these symbols is not just critical—a
               sense that the new must be mediated through the old if anarchy is not to result<note place="foot" resp="editors">I take this to be the gist of
                  Hogle’s comment, in his essay here, that the “looking-backwards-and-forwards
                  simultaneously, like the ‘Janus-faced shadow’ that actually drives Life’s chariot
                  for Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference . . . for keeping at least a
                  ‘shadow of monarchy’ on an ‘otherwise empty chair of state,’ . . . rather than
                  facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually made England (and
                  even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France.” </note>—but also creative. The
               “emptied-out figures” of the procession, Gothicized as “vampire bats” (484), retain,
               in their very decay, a kind of creativity. Thus in the enthusiasm of the procession,
               which includes Plato as well as Caesar and Constantine, “something not yet made good
               pushes its essence forward,” as Habermas says of the utopianism of Ernst Bloch (71).
               This (de)constructive creativity is implicit in the differend between “Shelley” and
               Rousseau over the “figures” cast onto and cast off by the Car of Life. “Shelley”
               disdains to “worship” these idols that fashion projects onto “the world’s false and
               fragile glass.” But Rousseau, even as he acknowledges the relentless consumption of
               the old by the new, insists that the “vitally metaphoric” process of history goes on
               as a mixture of idealism and idolatry: “Figures ever new / Rise on the bubble, paint
               them how you may” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512; <title level="m">Triumph</title> 243-51).</p>
               <p> Put differently, the cultural work of the Gothic is not limited to the
               demystification of past systems of belief. As Deborah White argues, in the spirit of
               Adorno and Horkheimer’s critique of “enlightenment,” the Romantics’ attitude to
               “superstition” is tied up with the issue of imagination. This is to say not only that
               modernity is itself built on superstitious foundations, but also, as a correlative,
               that literature “cannot surrender the resources of illusion” even if it
               thereby becomes a form of superstition (12, 51). Hence a certain persistence of
               idolatry in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> that resists both “Shelley’s”
               disdain for life, and what White calls the “Enlightenment’s quasi-materialist vision
               of history,” evident in the poem’s relentless serialization of its failed “figures”
               (12). Hence also the way the rationalization of the supernatural in Gothic novels is
               set up <emph>not</emph> to work: a procedure that Shelley strategically if
               impatiently repeats in the emptiness of the formulae that conclude <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>. For the Gothic is in fact a shelter for the potentiality of
               superstition and perversion, for the “gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the
               present” (Shelley, <title level="m">Defence</title> 535). </p>
               <p> This restless fermentation of the Idea as superstition is what Hegel tries to access
               through the Symbolic. For the Symbolic is the form taken by what Žižek calls the
               “sublime object of ideology”: as a form of fantasy rather than Coleridgean
               imagination, it projects an Idea but, through its bad and untrue determinacy, allows
               for a “traversal” of the fantasm (<title level="m">Plague</title> 7-11, 97). Of
               course in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hegel dismisses the Symbolic as crude and
               pagan. He prefers the Romantic because its dissonance of matter and spirit is
               Christian and accords with criteria of beauty. Shelley expresses the same historical
               complacency when he claims that the “poetry” of “Chivalry and Christianity . . .
               erase[s]” the “deform[ities]” of earlier social formations (<title level="m">Defence</title> 518). But the Romantic for Hegel is an alibi for revisiting the
               Symbolic; hence their distinction in terms of a reversed relation in the two between
               the Idea and its embodiment keeps collapsing. </p>
               <p> In the Symbolic, as we will recall, the Idea itself is said to be inadequate, while
               in the Romantic the Idea is complete in itself but external forms are inadequate for
               its purposes. But if the Symbolic warps the forms it takes, is this not because they
               are inadequate, or as Shelley says,because its “distorted notions of invisible
               things” are “the mask and mantle” in which poetry “walk[s] through eternity enveloped
               and disguised” (526)? And if the Romantic cannot find adequate forms, is this not
               because its Idea too is undeveloped? And finally if art needs an “external medium for
               its expression,” is not the Romantic also defective in resisting an “adequate union
               with the external” (Hegel, <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.81)? At issue here
               is the very criterion of “adequacy,” since as Hegel also says "the specific shape
               which every content of the Idea gives” itself “is always adequate to that content”
               (I.300), which means that Symbolic forms too are organic and purposive
               dis-integrations of their content. Unable to resolve these tensions in his idea of
               art, Hegel finally announces the “end of art” (I.602). But rather than conclude that
               there is no future for art, we should see this “end,” as the ex-termination of a term
               exhausted in its current conception. For in conjunction with the forms of art that
               have emerged in the <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, the end of art can also
               serve as a deconstruction that allows us to imagine new configurations of the
               aesthetic.</p>
               <p> But as we think such models, we must also attend to the difference between the
               Symbolic and Romantic. Pinnacled dim in the intense inane, the Romantic artist is the
               beautiful soul whose bad faith Hegel criticizes in the <title level="m">Phenomenology
                  of Spirit</title> (406-7). He is superior to the Symbolic artist because he
               withdraws from existing discourses into the clarity of a free resistance, while the
               latter is at the mercy of contemporary material, his imagination deformed by what it
               cannot form. On the other hand, this withdrawal into Spirit is a form of bad
               infinity. By contrast the Symbolic artist does not refuse mediation, but works on
               content at the material site of forms. This positing and consequently positivity,
               which Hegel also criticizes, often results in a "bad and untrue determinacy" which
               closes off the dissonance of “Idea and shape” (I.76-7). Thus Ginotti,as the schema
               for an Idea with neither “form nor outline,” is given an untrue determinacy by his
               avatar Wolfstein and by his own role in the narrative: a role constricted by the form
               Shelley had available to him, namely Faustian melodrama. And Zastrozzi too, the
               eponymous hero of Shelley’s previous Gothic novel, is conventionalized by the way his
               author has been interpellated into the model of revenge tragedy. Nor is the Gothic as
               a genre unaware of the force of institution, what Jean-Paul Sartre calls the
               “practico-inert,” or the matter in which past praxis is stuck by a “reifying
               sociality” (67, 318). It is this automatized sociality that leads Verezzi to prefer
               Julia to Matilda, even though the Narrator concedes that what he prefers is Julia’s
               “image” (116). Interestingly, the Narrator goes so far as to note “a comparison
               between [Matilda] and Julia” (84); and hence in the next novel, <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, the lovely Megalena quickly deteriorates from being a Julia to
               being a Matilda. Indeed the Gothic insistently marks its conventionalism, its
               badness, as a way of breaking the moulds into which it is forced.</p>
               <p> For Shelley such deformations of “poetry” occur in “periods of the decay of social
               life,” such as the one he describes after the Restoration, when “vice,” “weakness,”
               and “obscenity” take over (<title level="m">Defence</title> 520-1): an account that
               applies equally to the depraved world of Italy and Bohemia in the Gothic novels.
               Symbolic art is just as frequently limited by its bad determinacy as it is expanded
               by an indeterminacy that allows for the development of the idea which Ginotti’s
               dream-vision gestures towards. Yet such determinacy is what Jameson calls a “symbolic
               resolution”: a temporary overriding of contradictions, without which negativity could
               not be invested in the work of history (<title level="m">Political
                  Unconscious</title> 77-80). And it is only through this investment that art
               remains responsible to the cultural unconscious, or to what is left out in its
               attempt to classically domicile the Idea or romantically defer it into the infinite
               future. We see this investment in history in Shelley’s novels. Indeed in <title level="m">The Defence</title> Shelley’s description of the decayed history he
               despises is strikingly Gothic. The “obscenity” of the Restoration, he says, “is a
               monster for which the corruption of society for ever brings forth new food, which it
               devours in secret” (521). And yet this supposed monster recalls the earlier
               description of poetry as “replenishing” imagination “with thoughts of ever new
               delight . . . which form new interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food”
               (517).</p>
               <p>In short, Hegel lets us think a dialectic that circulates imagination between its
               premature hypostasis in the Symbolic, and withdraws it as “spirit” from the concepts
               that limit it so as to think it once more. In its disfiguration of the Romantic Idea
               the Gothic is thus part of the work of the negative, whether as a transitional
               negation of Romanticism’s tendency to settle into aesthetic ideology, or as an
               untransformed potentiality aware of its traumatic core. Conceived on this model, the
                  <emph>work</emph> of art is not form or hypostasis, but “configuration,” “the work
               on form, the deformation of form” as much as its “formation” (Carroll 29, 39). As
               such, even in its positivity it requires what Žižek calls an “anamorphic” reading,
               able to release the underlying negativity of its bad and untrue clichés. In “Kantian
               terms,” as Žižek puts it, such a reading would allow “us to discern an apparently
               positive object as a ‘negative magnitude,’” to see even a character such as Nempere
               or Zastrozzi as the “‘mere positivization of a void’” (<title level="m">Plague</title> 97).</p>
               <p> In conclusion let me then sketch three versions of the relation between the Romantic
               and its Gothic disfiguration that attempt to deal with the return of the moment of
               Symbolic blockage staged in Shelley’s early Gothic novels: a return more fully
               detailed in other essays in this volume. In <title level="m">Prometheus</title> the
               Gothic is no more than a concessive clause. Shelley grants the Romanticism of an Idea
               that cannot be embodied in existing forms when Prometheus and Asia retire to a cave
               after their marriage, to dwell “Like human babes in their brief innocence”
               (II.iii.33). At the same time the means used to end the Jovian age in the present are
               crudely Gothic. For if Demogorgon is a metaphysical principle or Idea “devoid of
               shape” (Hegel <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.363), in order to act in time he
               becomes Jove’s son. The bad and untrue determinacy of this positing of the negative
               is then reflected in the brutality with which he overthrows Jove: a violence at odds
               with the Promethean reign of peace. Hence Shelley, who as Asia has insisted on
               converting Demogorgon’s cryptic words into a project of Reason and freedom, admits
               that Jove may rise again, offering a variety of “spells” to deal with him (IV.562-9),
               which are no more than what Kant would call rational ideas.</p>
               <p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> Shelley manages to
               segregate the Romantic from its Gothic disfiguration. In fact the Gothicism of Jove’s
               downfall reduces to a cliché the unreadable matrix that the play approaches in the
               figure of Demogorgon. More tangled is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, which
               conflates the Gothic and Romantic. In the opening, the Narrator invokes the Muse of
               the Greater Romantic Lyric, only to speak of himself as a “desperate Alchymist” who
               has made his “bed / In charnels and coffins” (23-5). At the end, having failed to
               make the Poet credible, he ends with a disconnected outburst on the elixir of life
               and the Wandering Jew, describing himself as a “dark magician . . . raking the
               cinders of a crucible” (682-4), and appealing to “Medea’s wondrous alchemy” (672).
               This Gothic self-representation is matched by the Narrator’s lurid figure of the
               Poet, whose “divinest lineaments” are “Worn by the senseless wind” (704-5), as if he
               foresees the body of the Poet, whose grave was “ a pyramid / Of mouldering leaves”
               decaying, his skin and bones blown round and literally caught on the thorns of life
               (53-4). And yet the Poet is also referred to Romantically as a “surpassing Spirit”
               (714), a beautiful soul whose inwardness transcends materiality.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Alastor</title> is Shelley’s autonarration of his unsettled
               relationship to “poetry” as “subjective poetry,” which Browning in his essay on
               Shelley describes as the “<emph>Ideas</emph> of Plato, seeds of creation, lying
               burningly on the Divine Hand” (63-7). Yet the “frail” figure of the Poet (<title level="m">Alastor</title> 687) cannot bear this Romanticization, which has become
               part of the practico-inert. Indeed the Poet seems disconnected from the “image” of
               him that the Narrator constructs (661). For the depopulated global landscape through
               which he moves, the perilous journey he takes in his drunken boat, and the tattered
               scenery of a Nature that Shelley cannot put into a Wordsworthian frame, all point to
               a more modern conception of poetry as sifting through the waste land of culture that
               would emerge later with Rimbaud, Nerval and Baudelaire. <title level="m">Alastor</title> is thus hysterically split between the Romantic “spirit” of
               poetry, and its de-jection into the Gothic as a “peculiar cultural space into which
               the horrors generated by early modern cultural changes . . . can be ‘thrown under’”
               or abjected, as Jerrold Hogle puts it (178): cast off but also cast into a future
               “crucible” whose void “for ever craves fresh food” (<title level="m">Alastor</title>
               683; <title level="m">Defence</title> 517).</p>
               <p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Alastor</title> the Gothic is more a defacement of
               the Romantic than it is the creative matrix suggested by the word “crucible” (624).
               Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life </title>Shelley’s Gothicism shows
               itself first in the defacement of Rousseau, whom “Shelley” initially encounters in
               the vegetable form of an “old root which grew / To strange distortion” (182-3), and
               then in the disfiguration of the Shape all light, the figure for the dawn of a new
               revolutionary era. It would be easy to see the Shape in the Car as punishing the
               idealism of the Romantic shape, and the poem as demystifying <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound,</title> where Asia, after her missed encounter with the
               Symbolic matrix of the play in the Cave of Demogorgon, romantically bounds off the
               Chariot of the Hour driven by the spirit with a “dreadful countenance” from the one
               guided by a spirit with the “dove-like eyes of hope” (II.iv.142-62). Returning to
               this scene of the chariots through the Car of Life, Shelley’s last poem unleashes a
               different hour in which the two perspectives on the second coming of the
               world-historical spirit can no longer be separated. Nevertheless the ensuing
               dis-integration releases an energy as powerful as the beauty of the Shape was
               lethargic, for the “crew” dance “like atomies . . . / Within a sunbeam” (444-6),
               while Rousseau “plunge[s]” into the future (467) with a blindness that is the very
               condition for the deconstructive creativity thrown off and around the Car in whose
               disaster he urges “Shelley” to participate as “actor or victim” rather than
               “spectator” (305-6). Shelley describes this “restless fermentation” of “Life” in
               terms of a Symbolic pre-maturity when he compares the Car to “the young moon,” which
               bears “As the herald of its coming . . . / The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim
               form / Bends in dark aether from her infant’s chair” (79-85). In this Gothic
               unfolding of the beautiful simile of the moon, history becomes a “process without a
                  <foreign>telos</foreign> or a subject” (Althusser 91-8). For the dead mother
               shrouds a chair that may be empty, since the lines refer only to the infant’s chair.
               Moreover, she bends “from,” not over, the chair, as if brought down by this second
               coming of an infant power whose advent is or was expected, but whom we do not
               see.</p>
               <p> Yet it is notable how simile follows simile, or how one simulation enfolds another,
               such that “veil after veil [is] undrawn” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 528),
               without any adequate embodiment of a phenomenon that has neither “form nor outline.”
               For like the “sun’s image” reflected in a well, which is then brought into focus and
               perceived as the “shape all light” (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 345-52), the
               young moon contains another figure: the dead mother bending from her infant’s chair.
               This composite simile is then displaced by a further likeness, as the slouching
               mother becomes “the dusky hood and double cape” shrouding a shape that is now
               unnaturally old rather than young: “as one whom years deform” (87-90). “Figures ever
               new” are cast off in the cinematography of the poem (248), which commingles the
               beautiful, the sublime, and the repellent. “Shelley” wants to arrange these figures
               to distinguish various phases of the procession: the Car at the centre, and in front
               the leaders, while an anonymous crowd brings up the rear (101, 131-8). Because the
               core experience for him is the Shape’s disenchantment, “Shelley” also wants to level
               the difference between those who lead and those who follow, dismissing “All but the
               sacred few” as a “deluded crew” (128, 184). He asks himself why “all” is “here amiss”
               and does not hear the irony when a voice answers “Life!” (178-80).</p>
               <p> But the scene is in fact a moving army of differences, metaphors and metonymies. At
               the end the poem is taken over by Bosch-like scenes of “vampire bats” and “vultures”
               sitting on the tiaras of “pontiffs” (484-505), what Shelley in the <title level="m">Defence</title> describes as the “utter anarchy and darkness” that sometimes
               threaten to engulf poetry (523). But since the manuscript of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> omits quotation marks, we cannot know if this segment
               marks Rousseau’s renunciation of his idealism, or is spoken by the Thel-like
                  “Shelley.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript
                  does not contain quotation marks, which were added by Mary Shelley so as to create
                  a reading text, and retained by Donald H. Reiman with slight alterations that
                  often have unscrutinized consequences. Thus we do not always know whether to
                  attribute particular lines to Rousseau or “Shelley,” or where the breaks between
                  the lines of the two speakers occur. On this subject see Rajan, <title level="m">The Supplement of Reading</title> (332-35, 346-48). As regards the infernal
                  vision with which the poem ends, Reiman attributes everything after l. 300 to
                  Rousseau. But one could argue that “Shelley” again becomes the speaker after l.
                  469 (the description of Dante) or after l. 480.</note> Moreover, just as the
               leaders include figures as different as Plato and Caesar, so too the ribald crowd is
               metamorphically imaged through bats and apes, but also “elves / Danc[ing] in a
               thousand unimagined shapes” (490-1). Indeed this last segment is prefaced by a
               reference to Dante and described as “a wonder worthy of his rhyme” (469-80), though
               what follows is hardly wondrous in any conventional sense. The scene, in other words,
               is one of degeneration and entropy, yet harbours a strange vitality. Its logic is not
               Dante’s serial logic of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, but combines all three “in
               the chaos of a cyclic poem” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512), whose “rotary
               motion” is figured in the wheel of the Car and the cyclic form of the poem itself,
               which returns upon and into itself through its folding of figure within figure. In
               this chaos, Shelley can no longer insulate “the form and the splendour of unfaded
               beauty” from “the secrets of anatomy and corruption” (531), nor protect literature
               from a cultural and political debasement that “eats out the poetry” from history so
               as to rethink both poetry and history as a void that forever craves fresh food (515,
               517). Instead he lets down his ladder “into the foul rag and bone shop of the heart”
               (Yeats 391-2), finding the crucible of a disastrous creativity in this space into
               which the horrors of early modern culture have been cast off.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was ‘totalizing’; it explained
                        everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of agency that could
                        effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the Gothic necessary for Shelley?
                        Part of our answer lies in the fact that Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial
                        points. At the heart of the post-Walpolian Gothic’s ‘symbolic constitution’ lies the ‘dead
                        hand of the past’, a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the present, but
                        holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious circles of
                        transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the generations. As we shall
                        see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the crux that motivates <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. But by the
                        time Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had been made to its
                        symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his purposes. These changes were
                        instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <title level="m">Der Geisterseher</title> (1789; translated as the Ghost-seer,
                        1795) and William Godwin in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794).</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic was to provide a narrative form for
                        representing the threat of conspiracy, whether revolutionary or Counter-Reformational. </p>
               <p rend="noCount">It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he refers to the
                        “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions” he is just one of many radicals
                        responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic constitution and chivalry, the legal and social
                        customs he celebrates as the ties that bind the English present.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in the late 1810s)
                        come together in <title level="m">The Cenci</title>: </p>
               <p rend="noCount">As a work of abstracted Gothic, <title level="m">The Cenci</title> explores the problematic nature of modern systems
                        of power by drawing upon the symbolic constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller
                        and post-Godwin. In the preface to <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Shelley references the key elements of the
                        Gothic’s symbolic constitution that will concern him: the dead hand of the past; the baleful
                        influence of Gothic institutions that live on in the present; the tendency of this influence
                        to leave us living in vicious circles of abuse; a moral antinomy that prods the reader into
                        analytical action as a way of rising above such circles; the self-defeating nature of
                        conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of
                        regaining historical agency; the delusive glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and
                        certainly not least, critique of Burke. After noting these key Gothic elements, Shelley’s
                        thought takes a surprising turn. Rather than freeing us ‘self-anatomy’ is shown to lead to
                        more Gothic entrapment. <title level="m">The Cenci</title> suggests that the way to lighten the “Gothic and
                        unintelligible burden of past institutions” is through the austere prescriptions of the
                        categorical imperative. </p>
               <p rend="noCount">In effect Shelley is telling us that he has moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding
                        of conspiracy (the sublimity of the secret societies) to a more abstraction proposition in
                        which counterproductive conspiracy (any literal endeavour) is compared unfavourably with a
                        conspiracy to make the reader think.</p>

                     <title level="m">The Cenci</title> is one the few undisputed masterpieces of
                        British Gothic/Romantic drama. The awkward “Gothic/Romantic” is unavoidable.
                        One might call <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Gothic, but the locution
                        begs the qualification provided by Tilottoma Rajan: “Thus in Shelley’s major
                        poems the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. . . . But
                        equally. . . the Gothic is never free of the Romantic, which is to say that
                        Shelley allows us to grasp a transformative potential in the violence and
                        perversity of the Gothic that is less evident in more popular uses of the
                        genre” (para 4). As a belated work of meta-Gothic <title level="m">The
                            Cenci</title> is at an abstracted distance from a popular form that was,
                        by 1819, already undergoing its first revival after a twenty-year slump. As
                        Jerrold Hogle argues in <title level="m">Shelley’s Process</title>, <title level="m">The Cenci</title> is a complex meditation on a spirit of
                        tyranny Shelley experienced as all-pervasive (95). Until about twenty years
                        ago the honorific for this spirit of aesthetic adventure was “Romantic,”
                        whereas “Gothic” served as the abject shadow-term for non-penetrative pulp
                        fiction. But as Rajan further observes, matters are now much different:
                            <quote>For in the past several years the Gothic has arguably replaced
                            the greater Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for the field, though
                            without the metacritical recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the lyric. Or
                            put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task of deconstructing what
                            has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic ideology,”
                            in particular because it makes manifest, almost schematically, what
                            Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past
                            institutions.” (para 4)</quote> Shelley’s ambition in <title level="m">The Cenci</title> to help lift the “unintelligible burden of past
                        institutions” is precisely why we now say <title level="m">The Cenci</title>
                        is Gothic. </p>
                  <p> However, the matter is not a simple one of substituted terms, so that we use
                        “Gothic” where we used to use “Romantic,” or “Romantick” where we formerly
                        employed “Gothic.” Still less is it one of accepting the terms as synonyms
                        describing phenomena (such as the simultaneous architectural and poetic
                        revivals) unaccountably separated at birth. Rather it is to follow Jerome
                        McGann in acknowledging the necessity of articulating the twin impulses of
                        the period, one towards a Romantic idealization that obscures history’s
                        ruined forms and a countervailing Gothic revelation of their gloomy
                            persistence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Jerome McGann, <title level="m">Romantic Ideology: A Critical
                                Investigation</title> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
                            1983).</note> This is the point I understand Rajan to be making: that we
                        cannot grasp the aesthetic energies of the period without acknowledging a
                        ceaseless dialectical play within them. Gothic and Romantic are
                        indispensable and interchangeable terms for delineating a whole that is
                        larger than either. </p>
                  <p> But to understand how this works we also have to answer Hogle’s vital
                        question: “what is really <emph>most </emph>fundamentally
                            <emph>Gothic—</emph>and what is most fundamentally symbolized because of
                        that Gothicism—in what continues from” Shelley’s Gothic juvenilia “all the
                        way to the unfinished <title level="m">Triumph of Life</title>?” (para 1),
                        including, obviously, <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. If literary Gothic
                        is a kind of narrative language, what does it enable Shelley to say that
                        cannot be said in any other fashion? Why was the Gothic necessary? And why
                        so central? If we are to understand <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as a
                        Gothic/Romantic work, where Gothic and Romantic voices are both in play, we
                        need to understand precisely what was Gothic about it, in the sense Hogle
                        means when he asks the question of Shelley’s sui generis syntheses (their
                        characteristic “overdetermination of social and psychic texts,” as Rajan
                        puts it): “are these semi-transgressions almost entirely Shelley’s, given
                        how emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they really creative
                        extensions of what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in the
                        conflicting tendencies endemic to its symbolic constitution?” (para 2).</p>
                  <p> I agree with Hogle that the answer to his question is irrefutably the
                        latter. Despite the popularity of the Gothic in recent years criticism of
                            <title level="m">The Cenci</title> has been strangely resistant to the
                        Gothic strain that runs through the play. Outside the contributors to this
                        volume, examples of sustained discussion of Shelley’s Gothicism are hard to
                        come by.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The relative
                            scarcity of criticism on Shelley and the Gothic is explored by David
                            Brookshire in <title level="m">Percy Bysshe Shelley and the
                                Gothic</title> (Unpublished PhD Thesis, U. of Maryland, 2009). John
                            V. Murphy, <title level="m">The Dark Angel: Gothic Elements in Shelley’s
                                Works</title> (Cranbury, New Jersey: Associated University Presses,
                            1975), is an early exploration of the subject but largely focuses on
                            generic features. Another exception would be Dale Townshend, <title level="m">The Orders of Gothic: Foucault, Lacan, and the Subject of
                                Gothic Writing&#x2028;1764–1820</title> (New York: AMS Press, 2007),
                            which focuses on <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as an anatomy of an
                            extreme form of the “Gothic father.”</note> This is a very strange
                        omission, not least because, as my fellow contributors all stress, Shelley
                        begins, and ends, as a Gothic writer, starting with the ultra-Gothic works
                            <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.

                  <p> For the generation coming to maturity in the aftermath of the French
                        Revolution, few developments possessed the irresistible glamour of the
                        secret societies allegedly plotting European-wide revolution. De Quincey’s
                        retrospective essay on secret societies eloquently expresses the attraction:
                            <quote>The very image, unveiling itself by unsteady glimpses, of men
                            linked by brotherly love and perfect confidence, meeting in secret
                            chambers, at the noontide of night, to shelter, by muffling, with their
                            own persons interposed, and at their own risk, some solitary lamp of
                            truth—sheltering it from the carelessness of the world, and its stormy
                            ignorance; <emph>that</emph> would soon have blown it out—sheltering it
                            from the hatred of the world; <emph>that</emph> would soon have made war
                            upon its life—all this was superhumanly sublime. The fear of those men
                            was sublime; the courage was sublime; the stealthy, thief-like means
                            were sublime; the audacious end—viz., to change the kingdoms of
                            earth—was sublime. (244)</quote> For De Quincey, as much as for Peacock
                        mocking the immature Scythrop, the operative word for the illuminati was,
                        indeed, “sublime.” The more incredible the stories—the more they tested
                        belief, shattering the mind’s tidy categories—the better: “Tertullian's
                        profession of believing things, not in spite of not being impossible, but
                        simply because they were impossible, is not the extravagance that most
                        people suppose it” (239-40). As a very young man De Quincey believed in
                        Barruel’s and Robison’s paranoid fantasies precisely because they seemed
                        impossible to credit. They were sublime, because outlandish. </p>
                  <p>De Quincey’s essay probes the reasons why, as a young man, he so deeply
                        wanted to believe in masonic conspiracy, which, as an adult, he now realizes
                        was an “extensive monument to elaborate humbug” (255). The essay starts with
                        a humorous account of the extended debate he developed with his governess,
                        who was morally certain Augustin Barruel was correct, and that they were all
                        hourly menaced by conspirators who even now were hatching their plots, and
                        his pre-adolescent self, who would have ardently agreed, for very different
                        reasons, save for the gnawing presence of his rational mind, which insisted
                        on stumbling over the improbability. Peacock catches the attraction for the
                        young Shelley in his description of Scythrop, who had “become troubled with
                        the <emph>passion for reforming the world</emph>” (362), so much so that he
                        “built many castles in the air, and peopled them with secret tribunals, and
                        bands of illuminati” and slept with <title level="m">Horrid
                            Mysteries</title> “under his pillow” (363). One of the <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> “horrid” novels, <title level="m">Horrid
                            Mysteries</title> features, in scintillating detail, the machinations of
                        the illuminati with their torch-lit crypts, cells of conspirators, and
                        revolutionary maidens willing to do anything to advance the cause. Scythrop
                        (like the young Shelley and De Quincey) dreams gothic thoughts of the
                        Schiller kind, just as Catherine Morland dreams hers through Radcliffe.</p>
                  <p> Reading Barruel was formative for the young Shelley in two regards. It was
                        here that he first encountered, methodically laid out in four stuffed
                        volumes, tantalizing extracts from the greatest hits of the radical
                        enlightenment—the atheistical horrors of Voltaire, the spine-tingling
                        materialism of Spinoza, the rousing promise of Rousseau’s general will—and
                        it was here that he encountered a sublime conspiracy, where, with De
                        Quincey, his overwhelming response was a fervent prayer to the Deity begging
                        Him/Her to make Barruel’s phantasies come true.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Walter Edwin Peck, Shelley and the

                        Shelley, that he started his own at school to extirpate the “Gothic”—that is
                        to say, feudal—practice of “fagging” (Memoir 241).</p>
                  <p> As regards Shelley’s creative extensions of the “conflicting tendencies”
                        endemic to the “symbolic constitution of post-Walpolean Gothic,” two crucial
                        points emerge from this material. The first relates to the “mentalité” or
                        “imaginary” of radical members of Shelley’s generation. While Shelley’s
                        generation might subscribe to the notion of a progressive “spirit of the
                        age,” they understood it to be one—and this was how Hazlitt himself saw
                        it—continuously buffeted by the headwinds of a spirit of tyranny that was as
                        all pervasive as it was systematic. The period did indeed appear to be an
                        age of conspiracy, although the conspiracy that mattered—or rather, the
                        truly effective conspiracy that shaped lives—was the one emanating from the
                        government side, from the “system of terror” administered through Pitt’s spy
                        networks, to the gagging acts, suspension of habeas corpus, and other
                        repressive measures taken by the central authorities, in a concerted effort
                        to subvert the ancient liberties—and natural rights—of the British populace.
                        The illuminati, alas, might be fiction, but the police state, with its press
                        in the grip of the “paranoid style of politics,” was not. “Obsessed with the
                        threat of revolution, users of the paranoid style—conspiracy theorists by
                        definition—ascribe to their enemies the ability to effect large-scale social
                        and political change” (para 2). So Kim Wheatley on the reviewing culture
                        that targeted the Hunts, Keats, Shelley, and other suspicious personages.
                        Quoting Richard Hofstadter, she notes that for the “paranoid rhetorician,
                        ‘History is a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost
                        transcendent power’” (para 29). As Orrin Wang comments in his introduction
                        to the volume in which Wheatley’s essay appears, “the rhetoric and
                        epistemology of conspiratorial thought also acted in varying, emphatic ways
                        upon the imaginary of the second generation Romantics” (para 4). Shelley may
                        have awoken from the self-incurred immaturity of believing in a secret,
                        Europe-wide brotherhood bent on sublime ends, but it was only to a deeper
                        appreciation of the systems of tyranny that gripped contemporary life.</p>
                  <p> For those in the grip of the paranoid style, “the Illuminati were
                        responsible for both the American and French Revolutions. At such a point
                        conspiracy absorbed all other narratives, becoming the totalizing motor
                        behind history itself” (Wang, para 3). For those opposed to the paranoid
                        style, the key issue was producing “a more complex historical causality”
                        than simple conspiracy (Wang, para 5). Thus the lead article of the first
                        issue of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>, written by Francis
                        Jeffrey himself, which reviews Joseph Mournier’s memoir of his time as a

                        work as utter fantasy, on the grounds that he was there, and there wasn’t a
                        Freemason to be seen, no matter how many beds one might lift, let alone a
                        German member of the illuminati. In his review Jeffrey advances economic and

                        plan.</p>
                  <p> According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was “totalizing”; it
                        explained everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of
                        agency that could effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the
                        Gothic necessary for Shelley? Part of our answer lies in the fact that
                        Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial points. At the heart of the
                        post-Walpolian Gothic’s “symbolic constitution” lies the “dead hand of the
                        past,” a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the present,
                        but holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious
                        circles of transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the
                        generations. As we shall see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the
                        crux that motivates <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. But by the time
                        Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had been made
                        to its symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his
                        purposes. These changes were instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <title level="m">Der Geisterseher</title> (1789; translated as the <title level="m">Ghost-seer</title>, 1795) and Willian Godwin in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794).</p>
                  <p>Schiller’s <title level="m">Ghost-seer</title> is the first work of
                        conspiracy fiction in the Western literary tradition. A young German prince
                        from a Protestant principality with a “love of the marvellous” falls under
                        the spell of the mysterious “Armenian” while visiting Venice during
                        carnival. The Armenian has a habit of popping up at unexpected moments
                        whispering hints to the Prince respecting forms of immanent danger,
                        including a séance arranged by the “Sicilian,” an obvious reference to Count
                        Cagliostro, magus, friend of mankind, and secret agent of the Illuminati
                        ever since he passed through Ingolstadt following his expulsion from St.
                        Petersburg for plotting revolution with the Swedish freemasons.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For the details of

                        Armenian that he eventually comes to repose all his trust in him, suspending
                        his critical faculties in the process. The Armenian, we eventually learn, is
                        an agent of the Inquisition (the same Inquisition that was later to arrest,
                        torture, and imprison Cagliostro). The exposure of the Sicilian was the
                        first step in an elaborate sting designed to turn the impressionable Prince
                        away from Protestantism, back to Catholicism, as a last ditch effort of the
                        Counter-Enlightenment. Schiller’s novel was immensely influential. Besides

                        Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic was to provide a narrative
                        form for representing the threat of conspiracy, whether revolutionary or
                        Counter-Reformational. </p>
                  <p> It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he
                        refers to the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions” he is
                        just one of many radicals responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic
                        constitution and chivalry, the legal and social customs he celebrates as the
                        ties that bind the English present. For Wollstonecraft in <title level="m">The Rights of Man</title> “Gothic” serves as a synonym for “feudal,” a
                        note she sounds whenever she touches upon Burke’s idealisations of social
                        and legal traditions; for Thomas Christie the <title level="m">Reflections</title>’ “tuneful periods” entomb a “deformed Gothic idol”;
                        while for Thelwall Burke’s constitution is a Gothic customary, a mental

                  <p> In <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> the task of demystification
                        follows a severe logic. The present system of tyranny is indeed all
                        pervasive. No point, then, in railing against chivalry (loaded as it is with
                        its Burkean freight). Godwin shows the totalizing system in action, down to
                        the institutional forms of conspiracy Falkland is able to bring to bear upon
                        the errant individual, and from which there is no escape, as Caleb
                        discovers. Instead the task of puzzling the contradictions, and so breaking
                        free from the immaturity of customary thought, is left to the reader. </p>
                  <p> All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in
                        the late 1810s) come together in <title level="m">The Cenci</title>: the
                        dead hand of the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that
                        live on in the present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral
                        antinomy that prods the reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief
                        in the totalizing power of tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining
                        historical agency; the delusive glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and
                        certainly not least, critique of Burke. To this mix Shelley adds, I believe,
                        the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant. </p>

                        reason why conspiracy theories flourished during the period. Conspiracy
                        theories wax when the public sphere wanes. In the aftermath of the French

                        think, and many to act” Peacock mordantly notes the way the followers of
                        Weishaupt replicate the very power structure they look to supplant. The line
                        references a key issue that led to the breakdown of the public sphere—the
                        demonizing of universal (male) suffrage—while drawing its principle lesson:
                        to fight fire with fire is self-defeating for the obvious reason that it
                        simply replicates the problem. Whatever solution is needed to the present
                        discontent, it is not more conspiracy. </p>
                  <p> As a work of abstracted Gothic, <title level="m">The Cenci</title> explores
                        the problematic nature of modern systems of power by drawing upon the
                        symbolic constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller and
                        post-Godwin. As is to be expected of such a belated, self-conscious work,
                        much of the meaning is placed before us on the surface, is indeed collected
                        for us in the preface: <quote>The Cenci Palace is of great extent; and
                            though in part modernized, there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of
                            feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes
                            which are the subject of this tragedy. (para 9)</quote> The phrasing
                        echoes one of the great cliché’s of the period, Blackstone’s metaphor
                        comparing English law to “an old Gothic castle, erected in the days of
                        chivalry, but fitted up for a modern inhabitant” (124). Shelley flips the
                        image, emphasizing, not the modern convenience, but the Gothic structure’s
                        feudal remnants. Shelley’s anti-Burkean phrasing emphasizes the past as a
                        negative force, one drawing us back into the feudal pile’s vast and gloomy
                        reaches. The phrasing does two things: it calls to mind the notion that the
                        nation lives on in a Gothic house (horrifyingly so for Thelwall; reassuring
                        for Burke) and it sets in motion the play’s dominant metaphor, the somewhat
                        trite comment that the human heart is a dark, treacherous place.</p>
                  <p>The preface’s other de rigeur note is the acknowledgement that the horrors
                        passing before us do so in a Catholic country: <quote>Religion coexists, as
                            it were, in the mind of an Italian Catholic, with a faith in that of
                            which all men have the most certain knowledge. It is interwoven with the
                            whole fabric of life. It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence,
                            blind admiration; not a rule for moral conduct. (para 5)</quote> One
                        might dismiss this as stock Gothicism, as a reminder that truly diabolical
                        acts were to be found almost exclusively among the Catholic nations (as
                        Catherine Morland reluctantly concedes). So stock, in fact, that most
                        critics pass over the remark in silence, as if embarrassed by it as an
                        otiose reminder of Shelley’s predictable anti-Catholicism. In fact it is an
                        attempt to articulate one of Shelley’s key concerns. Just as Beatrice Cenci
                        lived and thought amidst a set of “background”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For my use of “background” here
                            see Charles Taylor, <title level="m">A Secular Age</title> (Cambridge,
                            MA: Harvard University Press, 2007), 13-14.</note> understandings that
                        formed the “whole fabric of life,” a fabric beyond her powers of
                        comprehension, alienation, and self-reflexive scrutiny, so do we live and
                        think amongst our own enveloping fabric. Beatrice’s attempts at
                        self-analysis and self-knowledge end in abject failure, precisely because
                        she is fully enmeshed in the background understanding of her culture, in its
                        enveloping, and constitutive, systems of power (her mind-forged manacles, as
                        Blake would style them). She has no coin of vantage that would allow her to
                        step outside. The point Shelley is driving at, is that the modern reader,
                        whether Catholic, Protestant or atheist, also lacks a place where they can
                        stand outside their culture and take in the landscape. Shelley argues that
                        the task of stepping outside is not hopeless, just strenuous. </p>
                  <p>Shelley’s statement of the play’s lesson appears to be a mere bromide:
                            <quote>The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the
                            drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and
                            antipathies, the knowledge of itself; in proportion to the possession of
                            which knowledge, every human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and
                            kind. (para 4)</quote> This sounds like trite codswollop. It is. We are
                        meant to catch the broad irony, especially in the closing phrase. And that
                        is because the lesson of the play is to be found on either side of this
                        sentence. The key binary is the one closing Shelley’s statement on
                        Catholicism: “It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind
                        admiration; not a rule for moral conduct.” The sources of right action are
                        not to be found within religious belief, within our background
                        understanding. The sources Shelley urges are more abstract and demanding.
                        They emerge from the telling of the tale: <quote>Such a story, if told so as
                            to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it,

                            interests, passions, and opinions, acting upon and with each other, yet
                            all <emph>conspiring</emph> to one tremendous end, would be as a light

                        play conspire to murder Cenci; at the same time the representation of their
                        feelings is a conspiracy to shake up the reader (the sneaky work, one might
                        say, of an unacknowledged legislator). In effect Shelley is telling us that
                        he has moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding of conspiracy (the
                        sublimity of the secret societies) to a more abstract proposition in which
                        counterproductive conspiracy (any literal endeavour) is compared
                        unfavourably with a conspiracy to make the reader think. A representation of
                        the conflicting feelings mobilized by a moral antinomy will subtly immerse
                        the reader in the same murky quarters of the human heart as those traversed
                        by the conspirators. Only then can a process of moral and psychological
                        discovery begin. </p>
                  <p> Shelley’s statement of the process does indeed sound strenuous: <quote>It is
                            in the restless and anatomising casuistry with which men seek the
                            justification of Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs
                            justification; it is in the superstitious horror with which they
                            contemplate alike her wrongs, and their revenge, that the dramatic
                            character of what she did and suffered, consists. (para 4)</quote> More
                        recent critics of the play see this statement as the key to Shelley’s
                        intentions. Shelley presents us with a moral antinomy from which there is no
                        easy egress. We feel at once that Beatrice was both justified and wrong in
                        taking her revenge. Through our sympathetic engagement with the
                        representations of her predicament—and the rights and wrongs of the actions
                        taken—we finally come to know our own dark heart, and our own inner
                        caverns.</p>
                  <p> That seems to be the drift of Shelley’s preface, and, indeed, of the play’s
                        argument. However, I believe this inference to be mistaken. The clues to
                        this misreading lie in the words “casuistry,” “anatomising,” and
                        “superstitious.” In contemplating Beatrice’s “wrongs and their revenge” the
                        reader initially reacts with “superstitious horror.” Whatever Shelley has in
                        mind for the reader, it surely involves more than terrified stupefaction.
                        Presumably it involves some kind of critical introspection through our
                        sympathetic engagement with the moral antinomy of Beatrice’s revenge,
                        perhaps into our own dark heart. However, as Mary Fin points out in her
                        analysis of the play, “casuistry” held a particular, negative, valence for
                        Shelley. She persuasively quotes De Quincey as someone likely to have had an
                        understanding of casuistry similar to Shelley’s (indeed, De Quincey may be
                        recalling Shelley’s preface and play). The problem with casuistry was that
                        it</p>
                  <quote>held aloft a torch for exploring guilty recesses of human life which it
                        is far better for us all to leave in their original darkness. Crimes that
                        were often all but imaginary, extravagancies [sic] of erring passion that
                        would never have been known as possibilities to the young and the innocent,

                            <quote>The Roman Catholic casuists of the middle ages did so by drawing
                            on Aristotle's categories. Accordingly, they asked, where, when, why,
                            how, by what means, to whom, or by whom the action in question is to be
                            done or avoided... The idea was that complete answers to these questions
                            would contain all of the features of the action, of which the morally
                            relevant ones would be a subset. (2.3 para 2)</quote> Casuistry proceeds
                        from cases, not theories. In any particular case the casuist begins by
                        comparing the case in hand with an existing stock of settled, therefore
                        paradigm, cases, in order to determine if there is a moral principle that
                        would inform the present instance. But in order to determine if there was an
                        applicable rule one would need to canvass the action in all its lights and
                        possibilities. Hence De Quincey’s complaint: the priest might review a moral
                        issue occasioned by a young person’s desire, but in such exhausting detail,
                        involving hitherto undreamt of permutations, that the young person in
                        question would find his or her mind subtly polluted by the moral quest as he
                        or she contemplated possible sins for the first time. At the bottom of De
                        Quincey’s complaint is the unspoken fear that the act of naming has a
                        talismanic power. To explore one’s own dark heart, one would in casuistical
                        fashion need to name and identify a desire in all its permutations. The act
                        of bringing them to light is also the act of bringing them to horrific life.
                        Named, they flicker, and become real. The fear is not materially different
                        from the one Matthew Lewis appeals to when he cautions mothers not to let
                        their daughters read the Bible lest their minds be polluted by its racy
                        subject matter. </p>
                  <p> The notion is directly canvassed in the play. Orsino, in a soliloquy, lets
                        us in on his conspiracy to seduce Beatrice. “From the devices of my love,”
                        he tells us, he shall form a net from “which she shall not escape.” Yet he

                     </quote> As good post-Freudians our reflex is to read “anatomize” positively
                        as a virtual synonym for therapeutic psycho-analysis. In fact Shelley is
                        using anatomizing as a modifier for casuistry, specifying, in the process, a
                        particularly pernicious kind. Orsino’s repetition of the figure later in the
                        play makes this clear:<quote>

                           <l>That ’tis a trick of this same family </l>

                     </quote> The “self-anatomy” referred to by Orsino operates much
                        like De Quincey’s casuistry: “Crimes that were often all but imaginary . . .
                        that would never have been known as possibilities . . . were thus published
                        in their most odious details.” The main difference is that in <title level="m">The Cenci</title> desires are no sooner “published” or named
                        than they are acted. To drag them from the heart’s gothic caverns is to
                        succumb to them. If Beatrice has the trick, the master is Cenci, the
                        monstrous, malevolent patriarch whose oaths have a magical performative
                        power, beginning on himself. As Orsino notes, Cenci fell first through
                        self-anatomy. Not only does the act of cursing announce new desires and
                        abominations to him but the act of utterance itself seems to bring them
                        about—or so Cenci believes, when the malediction on his absent sons is
                        immediately rewarded with news of the deaths he devoutly wishes. <quote>

                     </quote> As Camillo notes, Cenci commands this power because the
                        Pope “holds it of most dangerous example / In aught to weaken the paternal
                        power, / Being, as ’twere, the shadow of his own” (2.2.54-6). The talismanic
                        power of words to translate utterance into reality extends to planted
                        thoughts. Giacomo complains that his father coined <quote>

                                Falsehoods are planted, take root, flower. Cenci exults that he
                                    will do the same to his youngest son, Barnardo, through
                                    memory:

                        dramatic irony. Cenci taxes his wife Lucretia with conspiracy:<quote>

                  <p> The Gothic’s symbolic constitution once again illuminates the drift of

                     </quote> As Eve Kososvky Sedgwick and Edgar Allan Poe both knew,
                        live burial was the Gothic’s master trope (the dead hand of the past being
                        just another way of entombing the living). At the root of the trope is a
                        perverse boundary between self and other: where one wants one (to keep
                        invasive entities out) there isn’t one, and where one emphatically doesn’t
                        want a boundary (say, between you and life above ground) there is. The
                        principle extends to language, which can be a source of both ingress (deadly
                        thoughts you can’t keep out), and blockage (vital thoughts you can’t
                        convey). In a moment of high camp, Cenci threatens his wife with a
                        theatrical version of live burial: being immured in a ruined Gothic pile
                        guarded by ruffians utterly immune to the pleadings of speech or body. The
                        trope recurs throughout the play. Cenci will shroud his daughter in an
                        impenetrable mist of infamy while Beatrice complains of being so shrouded,
                        or sepulchured. When it comes to the moment of self-polluting anatomy, when
                        the conspirators first conspire, their faces are alternatively an open book
                        others can read, or mirrors shining the viewer back upon himself.</p>
                  <p>One might think of this strand of Shelley’s imagery, from the Preface on, as
                        a crypt. Cenci’s victims are encrypted, as it were, buried alive or
                        sepulchured inside the perverted “mentalité” Cenci represents, incarnates,
                        and spreads; while the crypts or caverns of the mind disgorge poisonous
                        mists. Self-anatomy simply speeds the process, taking characters down to a
                        place from where none return. Most critics of <title level="m">The
                            Cenci</title> note at some point that the play seems to end,
                        disappointingly, with the simple truth of the vicious circle entrapping both
                        Cenci and the conspirators; that in conspiring against Cenci’s undoubted
                        evil, the conspirators, but especially Beatrice, replicate the evil
                        incarnate in the paternal principle.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For examples, see Stuart M. Sperry, “The Ethical

                  <p> The thread of his thought is to be found in the Jacobin Gothic carefully
                        unspooled in the play. The source for Jacobin Gothic was Burke’s project
                        (and this was how Archibald Alison understood matters in retrospect<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Archibald Alison,

                        feudalism. Like other Jacobin-Gothic writers, Shelley tilts at Burke. In the
                        final analysis the problem with casuistry was that it was based on case law;
                        it stands to morality as English common law does to jurisprudence. It is
                        based in practical reason, and is anti-theoretical in its stance. Casuistry
                        works—or worked—in the context of a settled society with established norms
                        of moral thought. “If we lack the kind of broad consensus on a set of
                        paradigm cases on which the Renaissance Catholic or Talmudic casuists could
                        draw, our casuistic efforts will necessarily be more controversial and
                        tentative than theirs . . .” (Richardson, 2.3 para. 5). As moralists as
                        diverse as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor have stressed, modernity is
                        what it is because all such bases for consensus evaporated in the course of
                        the Enlightenment. As Taylor puts it, we live in a mental universe where
                        there are competing and incommensurable frameworks and “hypergoods.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also Alasdair

                        order of the day. To rely upon “case law” is simply to replicate the

                        fabric of life—of a particular social interest. Faced with moral antinomies
                        our reflex prejudices, even if expressive of our morals and manners—in other
                        words, even in the best case Burke presents—can only replicate the
                        system.</p>
                  <p> We need to put the matter like this in order to grasp the radical nature of
                        Shelley’s thought. It begins with his response to Burke who was, for
                        Jacobins, the high priest of case law, the English common law, the unwritten
                        constitution, and the inherited stock of wisdom bound up in manners. As a
                        moralist, Burke was a casuist. In <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Shelley
                        is a militant Kantian. Burke offered “adoration, faith, submission,
                        penitence, blind admiration”—slavishness, according to his Jacobin
                        critics—not rules for moral conduct. In the Gothic world Shelley
                        depicts—which is clearly also our world—live burial is all pervasive, like
                        conspiracy. Or to change the register, and once again draw upon Hogle, our
                        present is uniformly distorted by the dark powers of transference. Damaged
                        by the system, we project that damage onto others, in infinite series. In
                        the current system, self-anatomy is casuistrical, because uninstructed by
                        theory, by abstract, universalizable, rules of conduct. Insofar as the
                        reader is caught up “in the restless and anatomising casuistry” of
                        justifying Beatrice’s action he/she is caught up in the very gestalt that is
                        the problem. No amount of anatomizing will solve it. By the same token
                        introspection—visiting our own caverns of the heart—is a fallacious route to
                        enlightenment. Nothing good comes of those Gothic spaces. </p>
                  <p> As Shelley’s best critics note, his thought is dialectical. No single work
                        encapsulates his thought. To read <title level="m">The Cenci</title>
                        correctly, one must counterbalance it with <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound.</title> In Rajan’s terms, we must be alert to the complex
                        dialogue between the Gothic and Romantic Shelley. In <title level="m">The
                            Cenci</title>, Gothic Shelley is at his most militant. As an abstracted
                        work of Gothic, it is explicitly darker—and more radical—than the work of
                        any other contemporary writer, for no other writer of the period is so
                        uncompromising about our inability to emancipate ourselves into free agency
                        while drawing upon inner resources unaided by the austere, Kantian, rules of
                        conduct floating free of casuistry, case law, or manners. Unaided by theory
                        our attempts at visiting our inner caverns will only replicate the horror
                        show. Imagining agency begins with the recognition of the need of impersonal
                        theory at the level of ethics. Self-knowledge is likely to be as effective
                        for us as it is for Orsino.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>When Shelley published <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> in 1810, its Gothic conventions had already become a target
                    of satire in the wake of anti-Jacobin polemics against the revolutionary zeal
                    expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” (1790-91). Although Shelley was entering an
                    ideological battle that had apparently already been won by reactionary anti-Jacobin
                    forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich environment for a transgressive
                    aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution, conspiracy, and libertinism.
                    Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
                    not as a satire of the Gothic (as several prominent Shelley scholars have suggested)
                    nor a mouthpiece (in the character of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>) for his
                    own subversive philosophical commitments, but as a diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin
                    paranoiac fantasy, expressed through one of their favorite targets of derision—the
                    gothic novel.</p>

               <p>
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) was Shelley’s first significant
                    publication and reflects his early enthusiasm for the Gothic and sensationalist
                    literature of the period. Both in theme and style, <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is indebted to several of Shelley’s favorite Gothic
                    novels, particularly Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The Italian</title>
                    (1797), Matthew G. Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title> (1796), and
                    Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title> (1806). A cursory reading of
                    the novel reveals many obligatory Gothic trappings—an ominous castle, a gloomy
                    cave, a demon-like seductress (Matilda), a hero-victim entrapped by
                    circumstances beyond his control (Verezzi), a spectral villain bent on revenge
                    (Zastrozzi), and shadowy figures of established authority—all saturated with the
                    requisite dose of brooding atmospherics and sublime scenery that often reflect
                    the characters’ “distempered” emotional states. Although <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> lacks the historical scope, descriptive detail, and
                    narrative polish of Shelley’s models, the novel develops an elaborate
                    pursuit-escape narrative trajectory that is both tightly structured and unfolds
                    at an energetic pace, incorporating aspects of Gothic romance, sentimentalist
                    fiction, and the philosophical novel. (For readers unfamiliar with <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, see the footnote for a brief synopsis of the
                        novel.)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As the novel opens we find the
                        “wretched” Verezzi, the ostensible protagonist, “[t]orn from the society of
                        all he held dear on earth, the victim of secret enemies, and exiled from
                        happiness . . .” (61). Verezzi has been abducted in his sleep and then
                        brought to a cave and chained to a rock by the “sublime” and “malevolent”
                        Zastrozzi, for reasons we are as yet unaware. When a “scintillating flame”
                        of lightning destroys the cavern, Verezzi is able to escape, but is further
                        pursued by Zastrozzi and his co-conspirator Matilda, whose sexual passion
                        for Verezzi threatens to separate him from his fiancée Julia, whom we meet
                        in the flesh only much later in the novel. In collaboration with the “wily”
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi sets out to murder Julia and recapture Verezzi so that
                        Matilda can continue her seduction and win his heart (although, unknown to
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi’s murderous intent extends ultimately to Verezzi). <p rend="noCount"> When Zastrozzi fails to kill Julia, Matilda falsely
                            informs Verezzi that Julia is dead and continues, though unsuccessfully,
                            to seduce Verezzi and erase the memory of Julia from his distempered
                            mind. To that end, Zastrozzi devises a plan in which he feigns an
                            attempt to murder Verezzi, at which point Matilda rushes in and shields
                            him, sustaining only minor injuries. Believing Julia to be dead and
                            Matilda to have been his saviour, Verezzi, in a “Lethean torpor” at last
                            professes his love to Matilda and consents to marriage. Soon after,
                            Zastrozzi arranges a meeting in which Julia confronts Verezzi and
                            Matilda. Dumbfounded at the sight of Julia and overcome with guilt,
                            Verezzi commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest. Matilda then
                            plucks the blood-stained dagger from Verezzi's corpse, and in a frenzy
                            of rage stabs the innocent Julia “with exulting pleasure, again and
                            again,” burying “the dagger to the hilt in her body, even after all
                            remains of life were annihilated” (143). </p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> The
                            guilty parties are eventually discovered and brought before the
                            authorities, where Zastrozzi confesses that he is actually Verezzi’s
                            illegitimate half-brother and has sought vengeance against Verezzi on
                            behalf of his disgraced mother (possibly a prostitute) who was abandoned
                            by their father, whom he had murdered before the events of the novel
                            take place. At the conclusion of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda are
                            sentenced to execution by the Council of Ten for their murderous
                            conspiracy. Although Matilda finally repents and reconciles herself with
                            the Catholic Church, Zastrozzi unrepentantly and defiantly continues to
                            express his “atheism” and disdain for institutional morality, even at
                            the expense of his own life: “Even whilst writhing under the agony of
                            almost insupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s
                            firmness failed him not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance,
                            played a smile of most disdainful scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive
                            laugh of exulting revenge—he died” (156). Vengeance and transgressive
                            sexual desires are punished, illegitimate threats to class structure and
                            established authority are eliminated, and the equilibrium of the status
                            quo is restored.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Although <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> concludes with a traditional moral
                    resolution that would placate a genteel readership, the few contemporary reviews
                    of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> were unflattering, if not vitriolic, and
                    no doubt contributed to Shelley’s lifelong acrimony towards critical responses
                    to his work in the press. The critical atmosphere of the early nineteenth
                    century towards the glut of sensationalist fiction of the period is well
                    exemplified in this passage from the following “Prospectus” that was submitted
                    in support of the <title level="j">New London Review; or Monthly Report of
                        Authors and Books</title> (1799): “Though no arrogance will be indulged in
                    this publication, whatever disturbs the public harmony, insults legal authority,
                    outrages the best regards of the heart, invalidates the radical obligations of
                    morality, attacks the vital springs of established functions of piety, or in any
                    respect clashes with the sacred forms of decency, however witty, elegant, and
                    well written, can be noticed only in terms of severe and unequivocal
                    reprehension” (qtd. in Grenby 177). </p>
               <p> In the spirit of such regulative moral criticism, the <title level="j">Critical
                        Review</title>, for example, offered these trenchant observations on
                    Shelley’s “shameless and disgusting volume”: “Zastrozzi is one of the most
                    savage and improbable demons that ever issued from a diseased brain . . . a more
                    discordant, disgusting, and despicable performance has not, we are persuaded,
                    issued from the press for some time.” The review concludes, in language used to
                    describe Shelley by future reviewers of his controversial poetry, that “We know
                    not when we have felt so much indignation as in the perusal of this execrable
                    production. The author of it cannot be too severely reprobated. Not all his
                        ‘<emph>scintillated eyes</emph>,’ his ‘<emph>battling emotions</emph>,’ his
                        ‘<emph>frigorific torpidity</emph> of despair,’ nor his ‘<emph>Lethean
                        torpor</emph>,’ with the rest of his nonsensical and stupid jargon, ought to
                    save him from infamy, and his volume from the flames” (329-31). <title level="j">The Gentleman’s Magazine</title> was less dismissive in this pithy, though
                    naive, account: “. . . by placing the scene on the Continent, the Author has
                    availed himself of characters and vices which, however useful in narratives of
                    this description, thank God, are not to be found in this country” (258). Mary
                    Shelley herself, along with Shelley’s early biographers, encapsulates a critical
                    perspective that would dominate Shelley studies well into the twentieth century:
                    “He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature, but had not fostered
                    these tastes at their genuine sources—the romances and chivalry of the middle
                    ages—but in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days.
                    Under the influence of these he, at the age of fifteen, wrote two short prose
                    romances of slender merit. The sentiments and language were exaggerated, the
                    composition imitative and poor” (I, 101-2).</p>
               <p> Although less vitriolic than the <title level="j">Critical Review</title>, many
                    Shelley scholars begin discussing Shelley’s Gothic novels and early poetry (if
                    they are discussed at all) by offering what amounts to an apology. Shelley’s
                    Gothic sensibility is thought to be an embarrassment at worst or a transitional
                    phase at best. Kenneth Neill Cameron, for example, writes that Shelley, during
                    his “votary of Romance“ period, “was genuinely interested in the mysterious and
                    the occult . . . and in his novels he was, from time to time, carried away by
                    his subject . . . but he wrote largely with his tongue in his own
                    cheek—delighting, at times, in parodying his own style—aware, as he was writing
                    the novels, of their inherent ridiculousness, but interested in a quick,
                    schoolboy fame”, and “if Shelley’s gothic novels are bad, his horror poetry
                    written in the same period is worse” (28,33). For Cameron, it is not until
                    Shelley reads Godwin (“his master”) and assumes his “social duties” that his
                    work rises to the level of serious critical attention. A. J. Hartley (following
                    Frederick Jones), argues that Shelley’s “‘taste for romances’ definitely ended
                    in November, 1810, when he ordered a copy of [Godwin’s <title level="m">Political Justice</title>] from Stockdale” (v). David Seed reads <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> as a “crude and largely unconscious exploration
                    of sexual fear” and finds the character of Zastrozzi to be “banal and a
                    stereotype” (5). Eustace Chesser, in his Freudian reading of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (and perhaps channeling Peacock), claims that Shelley
                    “was not a rebel without a cause—he had too many causes. He was an introvert
                    with no strong sense of reality. . . . His all too short life was a continuous
                    refusal to accept responsibility. He never completely grew up. His vision was
                    centred upon the world as he would like it to be, not on the world as it is”
                    (12). More forgiving is Frederick Frank, who reads <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> as “a dark fable of identity” (ix) that “combine[s] an
                    expert knowledge of the elaborate technology of the Gothic romance and its
                    mandatory apparatus with the future poet’s desire to arrive at a Gothic
                    aesthetic through which beauty and horror could be expressed simultaneously”
                    (ix). Frank concludes, however, that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is
                    “basically a solipsistic excursion” (x). </p>
               <p> These interpretive approaches minimize the significance of Shelley’s early
                    Gothic works in two ways: first, they treat Shelley’s Gothic sensibility as an
                    undisciplined exercise of formal mimicry in a tarnished genre that bears little
                    relevance to his mature work; and second, they treat the Gothic as a foreign
                    element that is superseded by the transcendent idealism of Shelley’s later
                    poetry. Each of these approaches drain Shelley’s Gothic of its concrete
                    historical particularity and disavow the antagonisms around which his early work
                    circulates. The young Shelley’s construction of a post-Enlightenment Gothic
                    subject produces an impasse that is not easily recuperated within the context of
                    his later works, which may productively be read as reaction-formations against
                    the consequences that such a Gothic subject precipitates. </p>
               <p> The most recent studies of Shelley’s Gothic novels, though still few, have been
                    informed by the growing interest in the complex relations between the Gothic and
                    Romanticism, and by the emergence of Gothic studies as a legitimate discipline
                    of scholarly inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example,

                  </note> As the
                    essays in this volume argue, readers of Shelley’s early Gothic works must lift
                    the painted veil of two centuries of largely dismissive criticism and revisit
                    these works with fresh eyes and an appreciation for the ways in which Shelley
                    delimits the residual “Gothic complex” of symbols in the service of articulating
                    an emergent Romantic revolutionary consciousness. In one his early essays on
                    Shelley’s Gothic novels, Jerrold Hogle shows how <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> anticipates Shelley’s mature poetry and metaphysical
                    writings, noting that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is “about the higher
                    unity of the self prohibiting its arrival with antitheses of its own making.
                    Every sequence circles back on the mind’s dark chamber where the soul chooses to
                    diffuse and battle itself and thus envelop the chamber in gloom” (85). And in
                        <title level="m">Romantic Narrative</title>, Tilottama Rajan’s post-Lacanian
                    analysis of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> reveals the “madness” at the core
                    of Shelley’s exploration of psychosis and perversion, an “irruption of the Real
                    into the Symbolic” that is “staged in the laboratory of a mental theater” (64).
                    While I agree with Hogle and Rajan that Shelley’s early Gothic works stage the
                    antagonistic, intersubjective dynamics of self and Other(s), I argue that 
                    <title level="m">Zastrozzi’s</title> significance is deepened even further by
                    considering the literary-political-historical context in which it was written.
                        <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not only establishes the “Gothic complex”
                    that Hogle so well describes, but the novel also reflects that complex of
                    symbols and images back into itself to illuminate the late eighteenth-century
                    reactionary fantasies that generate it and against which Shelley would fashion a
                    revised “republicanism” in his subsequent poetry. </p>
               <p> As Stephen Behrendt has argued, Shelley often exploits conventional forms to
                    transmit radical ideas,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephen Behrendt’s
                        “Introduction” to his edition of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                            <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (pp. 9-53). Cf. also Steven Jones’s
                            <title level="m">Shelley’s Satire</title>.</note> so it is not
                    surprising that Shelley would choose the Gothic as a vehicle through which to
                    surreptitiously express his interests. Indeed, one is tempted to read
                    Zastrozzi’s various philosophical exhortations (which Hannah More would have
                    characterized as “speculative infidelity”) in the context of Shelley’s own
                    iconoclastic positions at the time. For example, in series of letters to Hogg
                    between 1810 and 1811 Shelley writes, in language that could have been spoken by
                    Zastrozzi himself: “Oh! I burn with impatience for the moment of Xtianity's
                    dissolution, it has injured me; I swear on the altar of perjured love to revenge
                    myself on the hated cause of the effect which <emph>even now</emph> I can
                    scarcely help deploring. . . . I swear that never will I forgive Christianity!
                    it is the only point on which I allow myself to encourage revenge. . . . Oh how
                    I wish I <emph>were</emph> the Antichrist, that it were <emph>mine</emph> to
                    crush the Demon, to hurl him to his native Hell never to rise again—I expect to
                    gratify some of this insatiable feeling in Poetry” (27–35). In an extended
                    philosophical discussion with Matilda, Zastrozzi expresses the same antipathy to
                    religious orthodoxy: “Am I not convinced of the non-existence of a Deity? am I
                    not convinced that death will but render this soul more free, more unfettered?
                    Why need I then shudder at death? why need any one, whose mind has risen above
                    the shackles of prejudice, the errors of a false and injurious superstition”
                    (153).</p>
               <p> Throughout the novel, Zastrozzi argues in favor of a number of often
                    contradictory Enlightenment philosophical motifs, from the utilitarian calculus
                    of pleasures and pains to Godwinian perfectibilitarianism to mechanistic
                    determinism to, ultimately, a self-pitying strain of nihilistic fatalism:
                    “whatever procures pleasure is right”; man “was created for no other purpose but
                    to obtain happiness”; “rather than suppose that by its own innate and
                    energetical exertions, this soul must endure for ever, that no fortuitous
                    occurrences, no incidental events, can affect its happiness; but by daring
                    boldly, by striving to verge from the beaten path, whilst yet trammeled in the
                    chains of mortality, it will gain superior advantages in a future state”; “fate
                    wills us to die: and I intend to meet death, to encounter annihilation with
                    tranquility.” Yet despite his avowed atheism, Zastrozzi’s elaborate scheme for
                    revenge against Verezzi depends upon the existence of a Christian heaven and
                    hell and the immortality of the soul. Reflecting upon the murder of his father,
                    Zastrozzi laments: “But I destroyed his <emph>body</emph> alone . . . time has
                    taught me better: his son’s <emph>soul</emph> is hell-doomed to all eternity: he
                    destroyed himself; but my machinations, though unseen, effected his destruction”
                    (155). </p>
               <p> John Whatley argues that Zastrozzi is “a well-spoken and committed Atheist”
                    (203) and that Shelley’s “representatives of atheism and revolution are yet
                    ‘villains’ who through conspiracy, deceit, and violence forward social
                    disruption, but they are equally fascinating in their power to satirize and
                    undercut Church morality and to allow the fulfillment of desire” (209). A closer
                    reading, however, reveals Zastrozzi to be an equal-opportunity sophist, more
                    Hobbesian or Machiavellian than Godwinian, who appropriates into a bricolage of
                    contradictory positions whatever discourse suits his purposes. He may be
                    “well-spoken,” but he is hardly “committed” to any particular cause other than
                    revenge. And neither he nor Matilda successfully “undercut Church morality.”
                    Matilda ultimately reconciles herself to the Church and Zastrozzi is executed by
                    the Inquisition, whose absolute authority is never in doubt and remains fully
                    intact at the conclusion of the novel. On the one hand we can point to the
                    hypocritical self-interest of Matilda’s religious awakening and Zastrozzi’s
                    Satanic-like resistance against absolute authority, but on the other hand we
                    have to ask if such supposed insights are really all that subversive? From a
                    progressive standpoint, is Shelley asking us to identify with murderers who are,
                    despite their transgressive and liberating ambitions, consumed by
                    self-gratification? Is Shelley championing a Bataillean “expenditure” beyond the
                    pleasure principle that ultimately seeks to sustain prohibitions for the purpose
                    of producing the desire to transgress them? We should perhaps be inclined to
                    take Shelley at his word when he admonishes one reader of the novel against
                    confusing his own radicalism with that of his characters: “If he takes me for
                    any one whose character I have drawn in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> he is
                    mistaken quite” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 11).</p>
               <p> Such is the interpretive crux of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, caught in
                    the balance between the reactionary and revolutionary impulses of the Gothic
                    aesthetic. Revolutionary desire is always in danger of falling into what Peter
                    Starr calls a “logic of specular doubling” or “structural repetition” that
                    mirrors the oppressive mechanisms of power it seeks to displace. Starr explains,
                    “If one undertakes direct, political action . . . then the logics of specular
                    doubling and structural repetition apply. But if one refuses such action, then
                    one’s revolt will at best be hopelessly marginal, at worst a reinforcement of
                    institutionalized power” (8). For Shelley, the most vivid example of such a
                    scenario would have been the degeneration of republicanism into terror during
                    the French Revolution, where, according to Starr, revolutionaries became
                    “trapped in a dualistic, paranoid world where rivalry springs from the
                    narcissistic illusion of one’s own subjective unity” (9). In the figure of
                    Zastrozzi, Shelley demonstrates his budding appreciation for the complexities
                    and dangers of revolutionary change and the ways in which desire is inextricably
                    bound to even the most abstract of political commitments.</p>
               <p> But if Shelley’s aim is simply to diagnose the failings of Enlightenment
                    revolutionary discourse by drawing attention to the destructive desires that
                    underwrite its universalizing drive, then we might expect Shelley to adopt a
                    narrative strategy similar to that employed by Charlotte Dacre in <title level="m">Zofloya</title>. The narrator of <title level="m">Zofloya</title>
                    informs us early on that to understand the transgressive desires of Victoria we
                    must elucidate, in the spirit of Enlightenment curiosity and utilitarian ethics,
                    the “causes” of her destructive behavior: “The historian who would wish his
                    lessons to sink deep into the heart, thereby essaying to render mankind virtuous
                    and more happy, must not content himself with simply detailing a series of
                    events—he must ascertain causes, and follow progressively their effects; he must
                    draw deductions from incidents as they arise, and ever revert to the actuating
                    principle” (3). Throughout the course of the novel, however, the narrator’s
                    attempts to account for Victoria’s increasingly complex desires and motivations
                    seem inadequate, almost to the point of comic absurdity. The failure to reduce
                    Victoria’s subjectivity to a network of causal determinations (for example,
                    negligent parenting), suggests that Dacre’s narration works ironically as a
                    critique of Enlightenment itself, particularly the more dogmatic strains of
                    French mechanistic materialism (La Mettrie’s <title level="m">L’Homme
                        Machine</title> and Holbach’s <title level="m">Systême de la Nature</title>,
                    for example) that reduce human relationships to a scientific model of strict
                    necessity. Shelley’s investment in materialism, however, was strengthening
                    during the period of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s composition, so he
                    was, perhaps, disinclined to adopt Dacre’s ironic stance toward Enlightenment
                    critical gestures.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813) has been thought to mark the
                        culmination of Shelley’s strict materialism, from which he would not awaken
                        from his own dogmatic slumber until the <title level="m">Alastor</title>
                        volume of 1816. Adriana Cracuin has pointed out that in spite of <title level="m">Zofloya</title>’s transgressive content, Dacre herself was
                        politically conservative. So it stands to reason that she would have been
                        more inclined to critique Enlightenment doctrine than Shelley, who never
                        abandoned the revolutionary principles of the Enlightenment.</note>
                    Shelley’s narrator, too, adds a layer of ironic subtext, but from a different
                    ideological perspective. The narrator often pauses to comment upon characters
                    and events from a position of the “Church morality” that Whatley identifies,
                    which signals the narrator’s complicity with conservative ideology and, by
                    extension, with Verezzi. Zastrozzi is admonished for his “sophistry,” and his
                    inability to “contemplate the wonderful operations, the mysterious ways of
                    Providence” (102); and when Matilda prays for God’s forgiveness, the narrator
                    happily reports that “mercy, by the All-benevolent of heaven, is never refused
                    to those humbly, yet trusting in his goodness, ask it” (150). But again, this
                    does not necessarily undercut church morality because, given the exaggerated
                    evil and narcissism of Matilda and Zastrozzi, the disapprobation towards them
                    would be wholly justifiable. </p>
               <p> I argue that Shelley deftly subverts conventional ideology while at the same
                    time satisfying its moral prescriptions by splitting the diegetic reality from
                    its subversive subtext, revealing an intersubjective dynamic that complicates
                    any reading of the novel that either reduces the characters to static Gothic
                    stereotypes or that resolves the narrative action within a determinate nexus of
                    cause and effect. Because the narrative is doubly refracted through a
                    conservative lens (the narrator and Verezzi), we must resist the impulse to
                    valorize the characters of Verezzi and Julia at the expense of Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi, who are actually the far more interesting and complicated characters
                    in the novel (and like Milton’s Satan, more “ethical”). The temptation to
                    identify with Verezzi and Julia persists nonetheless, particularly when we
                    consider the similarity between the situation in which Verezzi finds himself at
                    the beginning of the novel and that of Prometheus in <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>: “Verezzi was chained to a piece of rock which remained
                    immovable. The violence of the storm was past, but the hail descended rapidly,
                    each stone of which wounded his naked limbs. Every flash of lighting, although
                    now distant, dazzled his eyes, unaccustomed as they had been to the least ray of
                    light” (64). Several critics have commented upon the similarity here between
                    Verezzi and Prometheus,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See David

                        “Foreword” to his edition of Shelley’s novels (viii).</note> but the
                    resemblance is a lure that will prove to be superficial and misleading over the
                    course of the novel and distorts any interpretation of Shelley’s early work
                    through the retroactive gaze of his later treatment of similar themes. </p>
               <p> Reading Verezzi as a precursor to the “champion of mankind” strains credulity.
                    As much as we might empathize with his suffering, Verezzi is a passive “hero”
                    who represents unreflecting, reactionary aristocratic privilege, one of the
                    primary targets of Shelley’s subversive critique. Furthermore, Verezzi occupies
                    a space that is traditionally populated by female protagonists in Gothic novels:
                    in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, it is the <emph>male,</emph> rather than
                    a young, virtuous female, who is pursued, confined, and tormented by a sublime
                    figure of phallic power—two if we count Matilda and her predatory sexuality.
                    Throughout the course of the novel, Verezzi is coded as feminine, and the only
                    feature which signifies his masculinity is his choice of love objects. The
                    attitude towards gender and power expressed in the novel is ambiguous, subject
                    to continual destabilization as Matilda and Verezzi negotiate their gendered
                    positions in relation to one another, finally reaching a provisional, though
                    compromised, equilibrium within a common fantasy space. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s explicit representations of subversion are
                    a <emph>semblance</emph> designed to alert us to a far more subversive strategy
                    at work in the novel, one that is more historically informed than has been
                    previously recognized and that interrogates the intellectual context in which it
                    was written. By the time Shelley published <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> in
                    1810, the popularity of the Gothic genre was in decline and its conventions had
                    already become a target of satire and parody in the wake of the anti-Jacobin
                    backlash against the revolutionary zeal expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” of
                    1790-91. As M. O. Grenby argues in <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin
                        Novel</title>, “The ‘Revolution debate,’ the ‘war of ideas,’ withered away,
                    not because every champion of radical doctrine had been utterly converted by the
                    logic of the conservatives, but because few of them . . . could be found who
                    wished to defy a near unanimous and highly militant anti-Jacobinism to put
                    forward what had suddenly become dangerously unorthodox opinions” (5). The young
                    Shelley was not one to shy away from such opinions, but he was also sly enough
                    to understand that progressive principles had been perverted into monstrous
                    caricatures. </p>
               <p> The ambiguous status of the Gothic’s transgressive revolutionary potential, on
                    the one hand, and its reactionary, ameliorative impulse, on the other,
                    participates in a larger aesthetic context in which the master signifiers of the
                    Revolutionary era were points of bitter contention between those, like Edmund
                    Burke, who framed the established authority of the <foreign>ancien
                        régime</foreign> in sublime terms and the republicanism of Revolution as
                    monstrous; and those, like Paine, Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and other
                    Enlightenment progressives, who framed the Revolution in sublime terms and the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> as monstrous. Burkean aesthetic categories
                    of the sublime and beautiful reflect the predominant eighteenth-century
                    hierarchy: sublime qualities of nobility, reason, and awe are associated with
                    men; and beautiful qualities such as passion, friendship, and elegance are
                    associated with women. For Burke, the feudal political structure of the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>, both in England and France, represents a
                    sublime political structure that inspires awe, admiration, and respect for a
                    powerful patriarchal authority founded on centuries of political,
                    ecclesiastical, and social tradition. The following passage from Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> is typical: “We
                    fear God; we look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments, with duty
                    to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility. Why?
                    Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so
                    affected; because all other feelings are false and spurious, and tend to corrupt
                    our minds, to vitiate our primary morals, and make us unfit for rational
                    liberty” (76). The hegemonic struggle between Jacobin and anti-Jacobin factions
                    to define and control the meaning of master signifiers such as “freedom,”
                    “nature,” “progress,” “necessity,” “good,” “evil,” “masculine,” “feminine,”
                    etc., finds its aesthetic counterpart in the Gothic literature (“sickening
                    trash,” as one <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> critic put it) produced
                    during the apex of its popularity in the 1790s and early 1800s. </p>
               <p> The anti-Jacobin fiction of the period emphasizes the dangers to British social
                    stability when challenged by the “new philosophy” of Enlightenment progressives.
                    Clara Reeve writes, for instance, in her preface to <title level="m">Memoirs of
                        Sir Roger de Clarendon</title> (1793): “The new philosophy of the present
                    day avows a levelling principle, and declares that a state of anarchy is more
                    beautiful than that of order and regularity. There is nothing more likely to
                    convince mankind of the errors of these men, than to set before them examples of
                    good government, and warnings of the mischievous consequences of their own
                    principles” (xvi-xvii). Anne Thomas, in <title level="m">Adolphus de
                        Biron</title> (1795?) writes: “I must, however, acknowledge that we have
                    some restless Spirits amongst us, who by their seditious Writings have
                    contributed no a little to the Work of Destruction . . . I thank Heaven the
                    number of such Miscreants is but small, when compared to the Spirit of the whole
                    Nation” (Grenby 104). And Robert Dallas writes, in <title level="m">Percival, or
                        Nature Vindicated. A Novel</title> (1801): “Men who born to fortune are
                    appointed by Providence to the administration of a certain portion of the
                    interests of the world: they are the helmsmen of happiness; and if they desert
                    the wheel, is there any wonder that the even course should be lost?” (I, 238). </p>
               <p> Two poems in particular from <title level="j">The Anti-Jacobin Review</title>
                    (1799) effectively condense the perceived threats and vaguely generalized fear
                    of revolutionary change into a coherent image of monstrosity against which the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary could organize its desire. “Ode to Jacobinism,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</title>, pp. 94-96.</note>
                    ostensibly written by “An English Jacobin,” opens with an invocation to the
                    “Daughter of Hell, insatiate power, / Destroyer of the human race, / Whose iron
                    scourge and madd’ning hour / Exalt the bad, the good debase” (1-4). Under the
                    guidance of this “Daughter of Hell,” the Jacobin sympathizer seeks to satisfy
                    “Revenge” (25) and usher forth, from behind a “sophist veil” (41), “Fire,
                    rapine, sword, and chains, and ghastly Poverty” (40) and to “taint the mind,
                    corrupt the heart” (44). The Jacobin’s ultimate motive is to “Teach us to hate
                    and revile; / Our glorious Charter’s faults to scan, / Time-sanction’d Truths
                    despise, and preach Thy Rights of Man” (48). And in “Ode to a Jacobin,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <emph>ibid</emph>., pp. 211-13.</note> a more satirical piece, the
                    “Unchristian Jacobin” (1) is represented as an atheist who rationalizes the
                    violence of the Terror, forgoing “Mercy” (18), “Pity” (19), and “humanity” (28)
                    to profess a “love of executions” (41) that makes one “fit for Revolutions”
                    (42). The poem concludes by admonishing the Jacobin for thinking “All
                    Constitutions bad, but those bran new” (48). Anti-Jacobin fiction and criticism
                    was so successful that after only thirty-six issues the <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin Review</title> disbanded in 1798, declaring that “the SPELL of
                        <emph>Jacobin invulnerability</emph> is now broken.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Jonathan Wordsworth’s “Introduction” to <title level="m">Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</title> for more details about the history
                        of the periodical and its contributors.</note> Conservative discourse had
                    successfully linked progressive philosophies with violence, establishing the
                        <emph>image</emph> of a <emph>necessary</emph> connection in place of a
                    complex constellation of contingent historical determinations. It had also
                    appropriated the rhetoric of Enlightenment to “naturalize” the socio-economic
                    hierarchy and its attendant privileges. </p>
               <p> Although Shelley was entering an ideological battle that had apparently already
                    been won by reactionary forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich
                    environment for a transgressive aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution,
                    conspiracy, and libertinism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An important
                        source, for Shelley, of anti-Jacobin conspiracy fantasy associated with the
                        Revolution was Abbé Barruel’s <title level="m">Memoirs Illustrating the
                            History of Jacobinism</title> (1797). Shelley read the work out loud to
                        Mary on 9 October 1814, a day before Mary herself read <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (see <title level="m">Journal,</title> p. 19). See
                        also Robert Miles’ essay in this volume on Shelley’s conspiratorial
                        imagination.</note> Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as a satire of the Gothic itself, but as a
                    diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, delivered through one of
                    their favorite targets of derision—the Gothic novel. From the perspective of the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary, nothing could be seen as more threatening to the
                    normative hetero-patriarchal circuit of regulated desire—as exemplified by
                    Verezzi and Julia—than the sexually aggressive Matilda and the violently
                    atheistic Zastrozzi, two exceptions against which the stability of traditional
                    British social hierarchy were grounded. If Matilda and Verezzi’s father signify
                    the moral corruption of the élite, then Zastrozzi, in the form of an obscene
                    surplus, signifies the illegitimate product of such corruption. And Verezzi,
                    although unknowingly, contributes to that corruption himself when he finally
                    submits to Matilda’s seduction and forsakes his love for Julia. </p>
               <p> When we consider Zastrozzi’s bricolage of contradictory Enlightenment rhetoric,
                    his murderous desire for revenge, and his illegitimacy (which signifies a
                    generalized threat to primogeniture and social hierarchy), from Verezzi’s
                    perspective Zastrozzi embodies the paranoiac image of the Jacobin monster. And
                    Matilda, whose excessive sexual degeneracy reads like a case study from
                    Bienville’s <title level="m">Nymphomania</title> (1775), embodies the paranoiac
                    image of a fully pathological subject whose actions are determined solely by
                    contingent self-interest. Matilda, like her namesake in Lewis’ <title level="m">The Monk</title> and like Victoria in Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title>, is described by the narrator (whose complicity with the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary should not be overlooked) in similarly demonic
                    terms—“wily,” “perfidious,” “syren,” “ferocious,” “frantic,” “delirious,”
                    “horror-tranced,” and “wretched.” And, as Alenka Zupancic observes, “what is a
                    demon if not a fully pathological subject?”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Alenka Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the Real</title> for a full
                        discussion on the relation between Lacanian and Kantian ethics.</note>
                    Because Matilda and Zastrozzi are images drawn from reactionary paranoiac
                    fantasy, interpretations that identify Shelley’s own radicalism with either
                    character would actually <emph>legitimize</emph> the anti-Jacobin linkage of
                    violence to sexual liberation and progressive philosophy. This is why, from a
                    progressive standpoint, the explicit acts of transgression in the novel
                    constitute a semblance of revolutionary subversion designed to satirize
                    anti-Jacobin fears. </p>
               <p> As a “romance” of the anti-Jacobin political unconscious, <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> reveals how paranoiac images of the Other are generated
                    by antagonisms inherent to the dominant ideology itself. In <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the feminine Other
                    (Matilda) is figured as a nymphomaniac, and the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of
                    the masculine Other (Zastrozzi) is figured as a bloodthirsty revolutionary. The
                    paranoiac image of the Other, therefore, condenses a constellation of indistinct
                    fears, threats, and desires, and functions as a defense against the breakdown of
                    phallic structures of power that depend upon the stability of binary oppositions
                    and upon the regulation of the metonymic movement of desire along the chain of
                    signifiers. Although Shelley represents Matilda and Zastrozzi as images drawn
                    from anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, those images do not remain static
                    throughout the course of the novel, nor are they simply caricatures of
                    conventional Gothic villains. The only static characters are Verezzi and Julia.
                    Verezzi is a MacKenzian man of feeling who finds himself thrust from the
                    pleasures of sentimentality into a Gothic nightmare of violent sensibility and
                    conspiratorial danger. He remains transfixed by Zastrozzi’s impenetrable gaze,
                    paralyzed by fear: “. . . Verezzi stood bewildered, and unable to arrange the
                    confusion of ideas which floated in his brain, and assailed his terror-struck
                    imagination. He knew not what to believe—what phantom it could be that, in the
                    shape of Zastrozzi, blasted his straining eye-balls— . . .” (90). Although we,
                    as readers, eventually learn Zastrozzi’s identity and his reasons for pursuing
                    Verezzi, Verezzi himself never does. Thus there is no meaningful interaction
                    between the two; they exist for each other only as image-objects. So if we claim
                    that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> poses a thought experiment in which the
                    subject of aristocratic privilege encounters in reality the monsters he has
                    created in paranoiac fantasy, might we not also argue that Zastrozzi sees
                    Verezzi only as an image of the aristocratic oppression that has denied him
                    entrance into the socio-symbolic order? </p>
               <p> The conservative ideology of the narrator makes it difficult to sustain such a
                    reversal, but the implication is there and points to how revolutionary and
                    reactionary discourses engage each other only through the conflict between
                    fantasmic materializations of their own lack. We can further unpack these
                    relations in Lacanian terms. Verezzi misrecognizes Zastrozzi, mistaking him as a
                    phallic signifier rather than as a signifier of the barred Other. According to
                    Lacan, the phallus is an object that materializes the lack in the
                        <emph>symbolic</emph> order, gives it a fascinating, powerful presence;
                    whereas the signifier of the barred Other is an object that signifies this lack
                    itself. Thus Lacan can claim that the phallic object is a signifier without a
                    signified. Zastrozzi, as a fantasmic condensation of anti-Jacobin fear, doesn’t
                    exist. He signifies the lack in the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> social
                    hierarchy itself, the reminder (as a remainder) that society does not exist as a
                    harmonious totality. As Zizek explains, the phallus is at once a sign of power,
                    but also signifies lack: “The phallic signifier is, so to speak, an index of its
                    own impossibility . . . . This logic of the phallic inversion sets in when the
                    demonstration of power starts to function as a confirmation of a fundamental
                    impotence” (<title level="m">Sublime</title> 157). Only at the conclusion of the
                    novel, after Verezzi has already committed suicide, do we as readers learn what
                    lies behind Zastrozzi’s display of phallic power: in reality he is Verezzi’s
                    illegitimate half-brother, an impotent figure in the context of the predominant
                    social hierarchy. </p>
               <p> Zastrozzi, however, sustains his phallic presence, even after being tried and
                    sentenced to death by the Inquisition: “He looked around him. His manner awed
                    the tumultuous multitude; and, in uninterrupted silence, the spectators gazed
                    upon the unappalled Zastrozzi, who, towering as a demi-god, stood in the midst”
                    (154). Why, after learning of his identity, of his illegitimate birth, and of
                    his past murders, do the spectators and council still confer upon Zastrozzi the
                    image of sublime phallic authority? Part of the answer lies, no doubt, in the
                    mesmerizing theatricality of Zastrozzi’s performance. He both fascinates and
                    frightens those who are caught within his gaze. As a paranoiac image of the
                    Jacobin monster, we see how such sublime images are cultural productions that
                    serve a necessary role in the anti-Jacobin imaginary. To demystify the paranoiac
                    image would be to lose the very object against which a reactionary ideology
                    defines itself. The spectators, therefore, are invested in their “willing
                    suspension of disbelief” (to appropriate Coleridge’s phrase) and are not
                    inclined to give up their investment in the sublime image of the Other. For
                    Shelley, who seeks to re-mobilize the founding principles of Republican
                    ideology, Zastrozzi functions as a “surface appearance” “draped over the
                    irrational” fears of reactionary ideology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See

               <p> Matilda too is figured as a phallic object, which, not surprisingly, creates
                    difficulties in her attempts to seduce Verezzi. Matilda occupies an especially
                    dangerous position for Verezzi because she represents the possibility, in
                    fantasy, of the full realization of the sexual relationship. She is beautiful,
                    sexually uninhibited, culturally sophisticated, and presumably a woman of social
                    standing, like his fiancée Julia. From a distance she engenders an alluring
                    fascination, but approached too closely she becomes the monstrous Thing that
                    threatens to annihilate his genteel subjectivity. To seduce Verezzi, Matilda
                    must masquerade as his object-cause of desire, what Lacan calls the
                        <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>. Matilda must <emph>desublimate</emph>
                    herself from a phallic object of terrifying <foreign>jouissance</foreign> into a
                    compelling image of socially sanctioned desire. </p>
               <p> According to Lacan's sexuation formulas, the masculine subject identifies with
                    the female as the <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>; that is, she must occupy the
                    place of the object-cause of desire in his fantasy scenario, she must “fit his
                    formula” (Zizek, <title level="m">Plague</title> 8). As Emily Apter points out,
                    “There is no absolute femininity beneath the veil, only a set of ontologically
                    tenuous codes that normatively induct the feminine subject into the social
                    practice of ‘being’ woman through mimesis and parroting” (243). There is no
                    mystery concerning Matilda’s desire: “I adore you to madness—I love you to
                    distraction. If you have one spark of compassion, let me not sue in vain—reject
                    not one who feels it impossible to overcome the fatal, resistless passion which
                    consumes her” (83). Verezzi’s response to Matilda is one of “cold esteem,” but
                    in the following passage we get a glimpse of how Matilda will indeed figure
                    herself as the object of his desire: <quote> He could not love Matilda; and
                        though he never had seen her but in the most amiable light, he found it
                        impossible to feel any sentiment towards her, save cold esteem. Never had he
                        beheld those dark shades in her character, which if developed could excite
                        nothing but horror and detestation . . . as such he pitied her: but still
                        could he not help observing a comparison between her and Julia, whose
                        feminine delicacy shrunk from the slightest suspicion, even of indecorum.
                        Her fragile form, her mild heavenly countenance, was contrasted with all the
                        partiality of love, to the scintillating eye, the commanding countenance,
                        the bold expressive gaze, of Matilda. (84)</quote> To successfully seduce
                    Verezzi, Matilda must appeal to the narcissistic component of his sexual
                    economy. Verezzi resists Matilda for much of the novel, but as she begins to
                    understand how to incite his desire, Verezzi’s image of her softens: ““Emotions
                    of pity, of compassion, for one whose only fault he supposed to be love for him,
                    conquered V’s softened soul” (86). And a bit later: <quote> Still did he feel
                        his soul irresistibly softened towards Matilda—her love for him flattered
                        his vanity; and though he could not feel reciprocal affection towards her,
                        yet her kindness in rescuing him from his former degraded situation, her
                        altered manner towards him, and her unremitting endeavours to please, to
                        humour him in every thing, called for his warmest, his sincerest gratitude.
                        (88-89)</quote> Matilda’s “altered manner,” which “she knew well how to
                    assume,” coupled with the beauty of her “symmetrical form,” finally begins to
                    work: “By affecting to coincide with him in every thing—by feigning to possess
                    that congeniality of sentiment and union of idea, which he thought so necessary
                    to the existence of love, she doubted not soon to accomplish her purpose” (115).
                    Matilda does indeed “accomplish her purpose,” but only after she has managed to
                    substitute herself in the place formerly occupied by Julia, whom Verezzi now
                    believes to have been murdered by Zastrozzi: “Oh Matilda! dearest, angelic
                    Matilda! . . . I am even now unconscious what blinded me—what kept me from
                    acknowledging my adoration of thee!—adoration never to be changed by
                    circumstances—never effaced by time” (129). Matilda has successfully broken
                    Verezzi’s melancholic fixation on the lost object of his desire and entered his
                    fantasy frame as the <foreign>object-cause</foreign> of his “unconscious”
                    desire. </p>
               <p> Throughout the course of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda undergo a metamorphic
                    shift from powerful, phallic objects of paranoiac fantasy to impotent subjects
                    that reveal a fundamental split subjectivity beneath the fascinating spectacle.
                    Shelley’s antagonists, Matilda and Zastrozzi, express a subjectivity that is far
                    more complex than his protagonists, Verezzi and Julia. The actions of Matilda
                    and Zastrozzi can be productively read in terms of Kant’s distinction between
                    “radical” and “diabolical” evil, which he discusses in <title level="m">Religion
                        within the Limits of Reason Alone. </title>Radical evil is an ethical
                    position in which one’s actions are determined solely by pathological motives.
                    The pathological subject <emph>chooses</emph> self-interest and gratification at
                    the expense of the other. Diabolical evil characterizes a position in which the
                    subject adopts the pursuit of evil itself as a moral maxim (i.e., a categorical
                    imperative in the form of Milton’s Satanic “Evil be thou my good.”), even at the
                    expense of one’s own pathological interests, or even one’s life.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the
                            Real</title> and Joan Copjec, ed., <title level="m">Radical
                        Evil</title>.</note>
               </p>
               <p> Matilda clearly is a candidate for radical evil, and Zastrozzi for diabolical
                    evil. Matilda violently pursues her passions until her self-interest is at
                    stake. After Matilda kills Julia, she suddenly begins to reflect upon the
                    eternal consequences: “The guilty Matilda shrunk at death—she let fall the
                    upraised dagger—her soul had caught a glimpse of the misery which awaits the
                    wicked hereafter, and, in spite of her contempt of religion—spite of her, till
                    now, too firm dependence on the doctrines of atheism, she trembled at futurity;
                    and a voice from within, which whispers “thou shalt never die!” spoke daggers to
                    Matilda’s soul” (143). Zastrozzi, however, suffers no such spiritual crisis, and
                    pursues his maxim of revenge, even at the expense of his own life. He informs
                    the Council: “ ‘. . . I know my doom; and, instead of horror, experience some
                    degree of satisfaction at the arrival of death, since all I have to do on earth
                    is completed.’ . . . Even whilst writhing under the agony of almost
                    unsupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s firmness failed him
                    not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance, played a smile of most disdainful
                    scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive laugh of exulting revenge—he died”
                    (156).</p>
               <p> The demonic subjects of radical and diabolical evil are, thus, consistent with
                    the paranoiac image of the transgressive Other. But as Kant argues, although
                    absolute freedom is impossible and we cannot purify ourselves completely from
                    our pathological determinations (we are after all trapped in finite, material
                    bodies) we can exercise our freedom by choosing the <emph>way</emph> in which we
                    are determined. What distinguishes Shelley’s Gothic (and here we can see the
                    emergence of a Romantic Gothicism), is the self-reflexivity and psychological
                    dissonance that his Gothic antagonists experience. These moments are not
                    explored in depth in the novel—the narrator is too anxious to propel Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi into their next heinous deed—but they appear nonetheless and
                    constitute a kind of textual unconscious that compels us to peer beyond the
                    paranoiac image and consider Matilda and Zastrozzi as subjects rather than
                    simply as objects of paranoiac fantasy. There are several moments when Matilda
                    pauses to reflect upon her actions, and in these moments we recognize her as a
                    split subject: “I almost shudder . . . at the sea of wickedness on which I am
                    about to embark! But still, Verezzi—ah! for him would I even lose my hopes of
                    eternal happiness. In the sweet idea of calling him mine, no scrupulous
                    delicacy, no mistaken superstitious idea, shall prevent me from deserving him by
                    daring acts— . . .” (79). A moment later she exclaims: “Oh, madness! Madness!” .
                    . . “is it for this that I have plunged into the dark abyss of crime?—is it for
                    this that I have despised the delicacy of my sex, and, braving consequences,
                    have offered my love to one who despises me—who shuns me, as does the barbarous
                    Verezzi?” (82). And this iconic image, in which Matilda sits perched like a
                    gargoyle overlooking a sublime display of nature’s destructive energy, captures
                    perfectly Matilda’s status as both fantasmic object and split subject: “Matilda
                    sat upon a fragment of jutting granite, and contemplated the storm which raged
                    around her. The portentous calm, which at intervals occurred amid the
                    reverberating thunder, portentous of a more violent tempest, resembled the
                    serenity which spread itself over Matilda’s mind—a serenity only to be succeeded
                    by a fiercer paroxysm of passion” (119).</p>
               <p> Even Zastrozzi has moments, though few, of conscientious reflection that suggest
                    a moral capacity for guilt: “Zastrozzi sat for some time immersed in
                    heart-rending contemplations; but though conscience for awhile reflected his
                    past life in images of horror, again was his heart steeled by fiercest vengeance
                    . . . “ (75); and “. . . he thought of his past life, and his awakened
                    conscience reflected images of horror. But again revenge drowned the voice of
                    virtue—again passion obscured the light of reason, and his steeled soul
                    persisted in its scheme” (68). This guilt-inducing “voice of virtue” that
                    reflects “images of horror” speaks <emph>through</emph> and <emph>for</emph>
                    Matilda and Zastrozzi. As Mladen Dolar explains, “. . . the surplus of the
                    superego over the Law is precisely the surplus of the voice; the superego has a
                    voice, the Law is stuck with the letter” (14). The specular doubling, fears of
                    persecution, and encounters with the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the Other
                    that drive the action of Shelley’s <title level="m">Zaztrozzi</title>, <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, and <title level="m">The Wandering
                    Jew</title>, are early attempts to explore and understand the psychological
                    dissonances associated with a failed encounter with the Other (as language,
                    culture, ideology) and others (individual egos, including the subject’s own). </p>
               <p> Finally, I want to draw attention to Shelley’s most effective strategy for
                    representing the subjectivization of the paranoiac image. Critics who interpret
                    the images and actions of Matilda and Zastrozzi only in terms of Verezzi’s state
                    of mind, as images drawn from the unconscious of his own psychological
                    processes, miss the radical intersubjectivity at work among all of the
                    characters. And those, like Whatley, who suggest that Matilda and Zastrozzi are
                    the only characters who are allowed to “fulfill their desire,” we must ask the
                    question: whose desire? In Lacanian terms, the “subject’s desire is always the
                    desire of the Other.” That is, desire can be <emph>for</emph> the Other,
                    determined <emph>by </emph>the Other, or a desire <emph>for the Other’s
                        desire</emph>—the “Other” being either the “big Other” itself (the symbolic
                    register of language, ideology, culture, etc. out of which the effect of
                    subjectivity is precipitated) or other individual others with whom one
                    interacts. The most terrifying or uncanny moments in Shelley’s Gothic occur when
                    characters discover (or we as readers discover despite the characters’ limited
                    knowledge of their own self-experience) that their desire is not their own, that
                    their free-will is an illusion and that their actions are determined by the
                    desires of the Other as they are internalized in the formations of the ego,
                    ego-ideal and superego. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> stages the process through which the desire of
                    the Other is internalized, transferred, expressed, and subverted. For example,
                    we can briefly restate the action of the novel in the following terms: Zastrozzi
                    assumes for himself the desire of his mother, which sets in motion his merciless
                    schemes to destroy Verezzi. Split between the “desire of the m(O)ther” and the
                    “name of the father,” Zastrozzi occupies a perverse position as the
                    object-instrument of his disgraced mother’s desire for retribution: “‘Never
                    shall I forgot her last commands.—My son,’ said she, ‘my Pietrino, revenge my
                    wrongs—revenge them on the perjured Verezzi—revenge them on his progeny for
                    ever’” (155). Matilda, in her union with Verezzi, assumes as her own the desire
                    of Julia, and Matilda’s desire does not reach its object until she murders
                    Julia. Matilda’s stated desire actually masks her real desire, which is to
                    destroy her sexual and social rival: “. . . Julia must die, and expiate the
                    crime of daring to rival me, with her hated blood” (79). “‘Julia, the hated,
                    accursed Julia’s image, is the phantom which scares my otherwise certain
                    confidence of eternal delight: could she but be hurled to destruction— . . .’”
                    (131). Matilda’s phallic, destructive intensity, so well-veiled to Verezzi,
                    finally reaches its apex when Matilda murders Julia in a “ferocious” confluence
                    of desire and <foreign>jouissance</foreign>: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “Nerved anew by this futile attempt to escape her
                            vengeance, the ferocious Matilda seized Julia’s floating hair, and
                            holding her back with fiend-like strength, stabbed her in a thousand
                            places; and, with exulting pleasure, again and again buried the dagger
                            to the hilt in her body, even after all remains of life were
                            annihilated.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> At last the passions of Matilda, exhausted by their own
                            violence, sank into a deadly calm: she threw the dagger violently from
                            her, and contemplated the terrific scene before her with a sullen gaze.
                            (143) </p>
                  </quote> In this moment, Shelley’s subjectivized paranoiac image reverts back to
                    its original, horrifying presence, which ultimately realizes the desire of both
                    the narrator and reader as reactionary others. Reactionary desire is satisfied,
                    even though Shelley had frustrated that desire by subjectivizing the paranoiac
                    images of Zastrozzi and Matilda. They reassume their status as Jacobin monsters,
                    thus confirming the obscene enjoyment that underlies the reactionary ethical
                    stance. And by committing suicide, Verezzi, ironically, assumes as his own the
                    desire of Zastrozzi. Thus, the actions of these “others” can only be understood
                    within the larger context of the “big Other” (the patriarchal symbolic), from
                    which both Zastrozzi and Matilda are excluded—Zastrozzi, as the illegitimate
                    offspring of Verezzi’s father, and Matilda, whose sexual passion for Verezzi
                    threatens the stability of the fully regulated sexual relationship, as
                    exemplified by Verezzi and Julia. <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> draws
                    attention to the inter-subjective relations that actually drive and sustain the
                    paranoiac fantasy, but Shelley is also careful to maintain the tension between
                    the demystification of the fantasy and its reduction to an explanatory network
                    of causal relations, which would empty the Gothic of its uncanny effects and
                    reduce it to a species of the philosophical novel. </p>
               <p> Verezzi’s traumatic encounters with Zastrozzi and Matilda exemplify not only the
                    rigidity of Burkean aesthetic categories, but also the limitations of a moral
                    psychology derived from either Smithian sympathetic identification or a
                    Benthamian utilitarian calculus of pleasures and pains. As a consequence of the
                    attempt to establish a subjective position free from the artificial and
                    corrupted determinations of culture, tradition, and ecclesiastical authority,
                    the Enlightenment <foreign>philosophes</foreign> were faced with the difficult
                    problem of formulating an ethics grounded in “natural disposition” and confirmed
                    by presumably universal affects such as pleasure and pain. An ethics derived
                    from sympathetic identification with the other, however, suffers from the
                    problem of what to do if identification with the other is
                        <emph>impossible</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this curious
                        passage from <title level="m">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</title>, Adam
                        Smith appears to justify a carefully regulated form of revenge against an
                        implacable other. Here, respect for the other extends only so far as it is
                        reflected through a narcissistic gaze founded on similarity: <quote> A
                            person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to
                            insults, without attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We
                            cannot enter into his indifference and insensibility: we call his
                            behaviour mean‑spiritedness, and are as really provoked by it as by the
                            insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see any man
                            submit patiently to affronts and ill usage. They desire to see this
                            insolence resented, and resented by the person who suffers from it. They
                            cry to him with fury to defend, or to revenge himself. If his
                            indignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud and sympathize with
                            it. It enlivens their own indignation against his enemy, whom they
                            rejoice to see him attack in turn, and are as really gratified by his
                            revenge, provided it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done
                            to themselves. (45)</quote>
                  </note> In other words, an ethics of
                    sympathy, when pushed to its limits results in a narcissistic reflection of
                    one’s own values and we sympathize with those whose values fundamentally reflect
                    our own. In Verezzi’s unbearable encounters with the inscrutable gaze of
                    Zastrozzi and the threatening sexuality of Matilda, Shelley’s Gothic compels us
                    to consider a crucial question that would preoccupy him throughout his career:
                    how does one respond when sympathetic identification with the Other is
                    impossible, when the inscrutable desire of the Other presses too close and
                    threatens the consistency of one’s subjectivity? </p>
               <p> If the Enlightenment critical procedure is to demystify the image of the Other
                    (nature, sexual difference, power, etc.) by bringing it under the determinations
                    of the symbolic, then the Gothic strategy would be to reveal how this determined
                    image is non-identical with itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        paradigmatic example of the non-identity between the image and its concept
                        is the creature from Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>,
                        who materializes the unaccountable gaps that haunt any totalizing concept of
                        the Enlightenment subject.</note> The demystification of Gothic effects, as
                    exemplified in Radcliffe for example, may indeed reveal the illusions produced
                    through epistemological error, but the price to be paid for this demystification
                    is a further mystification of the network of intersubjective relations that
                    point to another register of the Gothic, the “real” of desire, i.e. the
                    impenetrable desire of the Other and its irreducible excess, the engine which
                    drives paranoiac fantasies of conspiracy and persecution, the implications of
                    which were not lost on David Hume who, in <title level="m">A Treatise of Human
                        Nature</title>, writes:<quote> For what is more capricious than human
                        actions? What more inconstant than the desires of man? And what creature
                        departs more widely, not only from right reason, but from his own character
                        and disposition? An hour, a moment is sufficient to make him change from one
                        extreme to another, and overturn what cost the greatest pain and labour to
                        establish. Necessity is regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and
                        uncertain. (184)</quote> While the Gothic—in its figurative and narrative
                    extravagance—may at first appear to be an unsuitable aesthetic mode through
                    which to ground concrete ideological critique, Shelley deftly subverts the
                    diegetic reality of the narrative in favor of a reality that explores the
                    socio-psychological dynamic that creates the dialectical tension between
                    transgressive revolutionary action and paranoiac conservative reaction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Or, in Lacanian terms, between “reality,” as it
                        is supported through fantasy, and the “real,” which resists
                        symbolization.</note> And perhaps most fundamentally, Shelley raises the
                    following question: To what extent are those who are excluded from or
                    marginalized within the dominant ideology still subject to its norms and
                    prohibitions?</p>
               <p> In his <title level="m">Memoirs of Shelley</title>, Thomas Love Peacock cites
                        <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as one of the few times Shelley
                    “descended into the arena of reality” (73), but it is in his early Gothic novels
                    that Shelley first grounds abstract philosophical, social, sexual, and ethical
                    antagonisms within the concrete register of intersubjective relations. The
                    “ineffectual Angel” strain of criticism—the result of a complicated cultural
                    machine starting with Mary Shelley, Hogg, and Hunt and later solidified by
                    Peacock and Arnold<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an excellent overview
                        of the evolution of Shelley’s critical reception, see Donald H. Reiman and
                        Neil Fraistat, “Shelley’s Reputation before 1960,” in <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> (<title level="m">SPP</title>), pp.
                        539-49.</note>—has long since been displaced by the post-structuralist
                    Shelley who deconstructs the concrete representations of diegetic reality to
                    reveal the abstract structures of language and ideology which produce the
                    subjective effect of reality. The antagonisms generated between the concrete
                    particularity of self-experience and the abstract categories through which it is
                    mediated drives much of the productive tension in Shelley’s mature work and
                    sustains its enduring Gothic sensibility. Although similar, I do not equate the
                    post-structuralist subject with the Gothic subject, nor the post-structuralist
                    Shelley with the Gothic Shelley. The difference between the two hinges on the
                    status of the “object,” or rather, the persistence of the object; i.e, the
                    remainder of the real that resists symbolization and therefore cannot be reduced
                    to or recuperated within the socio-symbolic field—another example of the
                    non-identity of a concept with itself. These antagonisms of non-identity will
                    continue to haunt the post-Enlightenment revolutionary agency that Shelley
                    articulates in later works such as <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound,</title>
                    a touchstone text that exemplifies Shelley’s attempt to transcend the
                    antagonisms he explored in his early Gothic novels and poetry and to comprehend
                    the psychopathology of power itself.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p>Building on Jerrold E. Hogle's thinking about Gothic historiography
               and Julia Lupton's analysis of Renaissance hagiography, this paper explores the
               Gothic as a reliquary of sorts where rejected and outdated forms of historical
               consciousness persist beyond the moment of their ostensible viability. Shelley's
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title> (1821) and <title level="m">The Wandering
                  Jew</title> (1810), I argue, demonstrate how historical thought itself is haunted
               by elements that cannot enter into history proper. In the oscillation between Keats’s
               preservation as celebrity and the <title level="m">Wandering Jew</title>’s violent
               exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality that
               irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy—one mode of Gothic
               hagiography—supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by what was
               called in the 18th century “the philosophy of history,” remains a theodicy that finds
               in elegy a poetic correlate to hagiography: in this model, all loss, violence, or
               suffering is read as a kind of felix culpa with elegy providing aesthetic
               compensation for trauma. Shelley, however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics
               in <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the text unveils a materiality that falls
               outside ideal afterlife. This failed translation of the body gains its own corpus, so
               to speak, in the <title level="m">Wandering Jew</title>. Shelley’s Wandering Jew
               suffers the discipline—in every sense of that word—of official historiography.
               Bypassing both the Church and the graveyard, the Jew exists as a counter-narrative to
               Christian and secular progressivism—for the “secular” is but the uncanny reiteration
               of Christianity, the continuation of Christian history in the form of its ostensible
               elimination. Living his afterlife perpetually wounded, the Jew collapses progressive
               history by bearing trauma materially out of the past and into the future. But
               Shelley’s Gothic, historical thought does not stop there. Rather, in shifting between
               the figuration of history as ideal (canonical) and as Real (traumatic), Adonais
               gestures, further, toward history's materialization: an action of historicization
               that cannot be fully rationalized by either kind of narrative figuration, or even
               contained between the poles of figuration and disfiguration. While it is indeed
               uncanny that the past should live on—as a negativity—into a future its suppression
               ostensibly renders possible, the root of this relation lies even deeper, in the
               tissue of historicization itself: historicism, in its various narrative forms, aims
               not to sensitize but to insulate consciousness from the “matter” of history.</p>

               <p>“It is well known,” Robin Sowerby notes, “that the use of the term 'Gothic' to
               describe the literary phenomenon that began in the later eighteenth century has
               little, if anything, to do with the people from whom it is derived” (15). This is an
               obvious and yet strange pronouncement. For how can a term be “derived” from a source
               though have “little, if anything” to do with that same source? Sowerby is not wrong,
               though: a curious historical fissure divides the Gothic as an identifiable artistic
               mode popularized in the late eighteenth century from the mysterious tribes appearing
               on the fringes of the Roman Empire in the third century—tribes that would invade and
               overthrow that Empire. And yet, if “little, if anything” bridges these iterations of
               the Gothic, it is the tenuousness and also tenacity of the <emph>imagined</emph>
               derivation that demands investigation. After all, questions of historical reference,
               of nostalgia, and of the nostalgia of reference have been, as Jerrold E. Hogle
               argues, hallmarks of the neo-Gothic. Understood as a “locus of abjection”
               (“Counterfeit” 296), the Gothic is populated not strictly by misrepresentations, as
               this term implies an anterior and reliable presence, authority, or being that could
               be properly re-presented or even, decisively, presented. Rather, and especially in
               its Walpolean form, one encounters in the Gothic “spectres of counterfeits”
               (“Counterfeit” 293), such as the vampiric self-images Hogle identifies in Shelley's
                  <title level="m">Triumph of Life </title>“to which [Life's slaves] believe they
               must submit, even though those 'dim forms' are actually ghosts of what is dead.” In
               other words, just as Gothic tropes might “serve, on the one hand, as partially empty
               and nostalgic recollections of older fixed statuses [...] and, on the other, as
               announcements of statuses that were really <emph>recoined</emph> from older signs of
               them” (“Counterfeit” 298), so the historical orientation of the Gothic is both
               Epimethian and Promethean: intensely (re)productive though suspended, at once, by
               inherent displacement. The eighteenth-century neo-Gothic thus claims affiliation not
               directly with Classical or medieval history but with “the Renaissance counterfeit of
               the medieval” (“Counterfeit” 298), extending the Gothic into the future through an
               aesthetic and historical hauntology, wherein, like Derrida's revenant, the Gothic's
               historical originality is its unoriginality. </p>
               <p> From an historiographic perspective, the Gothic offers Romantic and modern culture a
               space in which to explore but also contain—through predictable, formulaic gambits—the
               institutional dismemberment and re-articulation often glossed as secularization.
               Originally referencing the expropriation of Church property (Blumenburg 20),
               secularization constitutes a broader historical and narrative pattern that reads
               modernity's reorganization of knowledge as a Frankenstein's Creature composed, so to
               speak, from the corpses of the saints. It is, in other words, a theory of history and
               a mode of historiography wherein modernity represents not the end of spirituality but
               rather the monstrous extension of a religious vitality that has been severed from
               transcendental guarantees: the Holy Ghost becomes Matthew Lewis' bleeding nun. In
               fact secularization's deeply Gothic ambivalence—for it crafts the future from a heap
               of broken icons—is at the heart of Romanticism's attempt to discipline the
                  <foreign>“frühen Neuzeit” </foreign>(Koselleck 5), the sudden temporalization of
               history, that emerges in Romanticism's recognition that it is, in James Chandler's
               words, “the age of the spirit of the age—that is, the period when the normative
               status of the period becomes a central and self-conscious aspect of historical
               reflection” (78). The recourse to historiography as a response to a new sense of
               temporal discontinuity motivates, as a compensation, the rise of the philosophy of
               history, itself a kind of aesthetic ideology. Beginning as early as Voltaire but
               reaching its apex in the work of J.G. Herder and G.W.F. Hegel, the philosophy of
               history, rather than merely recording events, takes up the active figuration of
               history according to a rational principle that promises not merely accuracy but
               truth. This attempt at recuperating history as philosophy through hermeneutics stems,
               in other words, from the anxious realization that while the “past may be determining,
               [...] it is also determined, the object of a continuous interpretive activity by
               which we refigure the meaning of our historical position and the possibilities
               available to us. [As such,] [i]f history is a narrative, it is also a
               counter-narrative of what is as yet unrealized in the countless failed or suppressed
               projects of the past” (Collings 41). Without the guarantee of something like Herder's
                  <foreign>Humanität</foreign> or Hegel's cunning of reason that can frame all
               events—either productive or ostensibly counter-productive—as part of a rational
               theodicy, what is to prevent the counter-narrative impulse from unmasking progress as
               what Walter Benjamin identified as catastrophe heaped on catastrophe? </p>
               <p> In the Romantic turn to history, the Gothic becomes the archive where such
               counter-narratives are incarcerated but also incarnated, that is, repressed and yet
               given substantial, bodily form. As Friedrich Schlegel notes, history becomes the
               discourse best suited to articulate the Romantic thinking of individuality
               systematically and of systematicity as organic individuality: “is it possible,” he
               asks, “to characterize anything but individuals? Isn't whatever can't be multiplied
               after a certain given point just as much a historical entity as something that can no
               longer be divided? Aren't all systems individuals just as all individuals are systems
               at least in embryo and tendency? Isn't every real entity historical? Aren’t there
               individuals who contain within themselves whole systems of individuals?” (51).
               Indeed, for Schlegel, “[t]here is no self-knowledge except historical self-knowledge”
               (107). The Gothic is this historical knowledge’s dark double—is the alterity that
               forms the dialectical ground of “individuality.” As an historical term that
               references its displacement in and of history, the Gothic performs an historical
               pseudo-figuration that parallels but suspends the basically Christian narrative of
               increasing freedom that Hegel, for instance, calls rational history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Karl Löwith's <title level="m">The Meaning of History: The Theological Implications of the

                  articulation of the relationship between the eighteenth-century philosophy of
                  history and theodicy. See also Hans Blumenberg's critique of Löwith in the first

               </p>
               <p> The parodic relationship between the Gothic and Christianity in aesthetic terms
               offers a model for the perverse relationship between Gothic and eschatological
               historiography. Just as the Gothic mode mortifies then inhabits the ruined Roman
               Catholic Church, expropriating not only its buildings, writings, and artworks
               but—more abstractly—its hierarchies, mysteries, and Spirit, so too does it reoccupy
               hagiography as the method for imagining how events become specifically historical.
               This is not to say that the Gothic is merely anti-Catholic, although this is a
               well-articulated strain in some of the most celebrated exponents of the mode. Rather,
               the Gothic functions as a reliquary for those practices, concepts, and histories that
               seem to be eclipsed by cultural revolutions, for systems persisting beyond the moment
               of their historical viability. Echoing and also extending Julia Lupton's argument
               that “Biblical typology represents [in the Renaissance] one of the foundational
               principles of modern periodization per se” (Lupton 23), the Gothic can be read as a
               gathering point for the negated shapes of historical consciousness, for the types
               that are displaced by their anti-types. Erich Auerbach argues that typological
               signs—like the lives in its biographical counterpart, hagiography—do not completely
               lose their historical validity or meaning when freighted with supplementary meaning.
               In the typological conversion of the Hebrew Bible into an Old Testament, the latter
               text does not, for instance, lose its status as God's word. Hence, when Moses'
               liberation of the Jews from Egyptian captivity and the subsequent forty years of
               wandering is recast as Christ's forty-day temptation in the wilderness (Matthew
               4:1-11), the Mosaic story retains historical and mythical significance in its own
               terms even as it becomes a prophetic sign; while such an event can be read,
               retroactively, as a prelude or <foreign>figura</foreign> nevertheless “it remains an
               event, does not become a mere sign” (Auerbach 196). In this way history begins to
               fold over itself, becoming a tissue of non-identical narratives wherein the negated
               past remains annoyingly active and insistent. </p>
               <p> In Shelley's work we see a double displacement of this sort: Judaism is imperfectly
               absorbed by Christianity and Catholicism is imperfectly absorbed by a modernizing
               Protestantism. Shelley's Gothic reflects this overdetermination of historical forms
               by juxtaposing, overlapping, and blending together these different narratives of
               spirit that, from the perspective of a modern progressivism, ought not to come into
               contact. Given, for instance, the Protestant shift toward a personal relationship
               with Jesus Christ where he takes on the role of sole mediator between human
               sinfulness and redemption, one tends to associate Catholicism with border appeals to
               saintly intercession, to the possibility of conversation between Christians on earth
               and saints and angels in heaven. Yet as early as Henry VIII’s 1536 “Articles devised
               by the Kynges highnes maiestie” where he asserts Christ’s singular, salvational role,
               Protestant thought also praises and promotes worship of the saints. While opinion
               remained divided through the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries, James E.
               Wellington points out that “veneration of the saints and desire for their
               intercession are by no means the exclusive province of Roman Catholic worship” (189).
               Similarly, Christopher Hill notes that from the perspective of radical Protestant,
               apocalyptic thought “the conversion of the Jews and ‘the gathering of the Gentiles’
               were necessary before the millennium could arrive” (22). This condition leads to a
               conflicted kind of Judeophilia in times of intensified millenarianism—like, for
               instance, the late eighteenth century. Protestant apocalypticism promotes Judaism
               only because Judaism’s total cancellation occasions Christian transcendence. Indeed,
               the emergence of the millenarian “London Society for Promoting Christianity among the
               Jews” in 1808 locates this essentially perverse relationship between anti- and
               philo-Semitism within the purview of the neo-Gothic. In fact, Shelley's own atheism
               rehearses this pattern of uncanny repudiation, where one rejected or negated
               formulation of spirit lives on, disguised within the reoccupying idea. In his diary
               Shelley reflects on his conversation with Byron and Lewis: <quote>We talk of ghosts;
                  neither Lord Byron nor Monk G. Lewis seem to believe in them, and they both agree,
                  in the very face of reason, that none could believe in ghosts without also
                  believing in God. I do not think that all the persons who profess to discredit
                  those visitations really do discredit them, or if they do in the daylight, are not
                  admonished by the approach of loneliness and midnight to think more respectfully
                  of the world of shadows. (in Dowden 2.37–38)</quote> In his turn to the Gothic,
               Shelley—thanks to an atheism that, like secularization, fragments and reorganizes
               rather than eliminates the ghosts of Spirit—repeats “a religious hysteria,” the roots
               of which “can most accurately be located in the uncanny sectarian doubleness at the
               heart of Christianity itself, that is, in the conflict between Protestantism and
               Catholicism” (Hoeveler 27) and, even more radically, in Christianity's impossible
               elimination of Judaism. </p>
               <p> This context helps to understand the uncanny affiliation between Judaism and
               Catholicism in Shelley and begins to expose the place of the uncanny in the texture
               of Judeo-Christian history, where the past is never really past, never perfectly
               determined or exhausted. Just as secularization's fragmentation and reorganization of
               the sacred means, ironically, that theism functions all the more forcefully at the
               level of civil society—that the dispersal of religious institutions creates a mobile
               theism that circulates, on the commodity model, more widely and more freely than
               ever—so Walpole's attraction to the past on the basis of its supposed “emptiness”
               promotes, against his claim that “the dead have lost their power of deceiving,” the
               wide cultural and literary recirculation of modernity's prehistory (10.192). In
               Shelley, this recirculation of church property begins, innocently enough, as
               elegy—specifically, his elegy for John Keats. Yet, at the height of its recuperative
               effort, Shelley’s text discloses a materiality outside of recuperative figuration. In
               fact, this materiality goes beyond the indivisible remainders of history left over by
               typology and hagiography. Such materiality had been given tentative shape earlier in
               Shelley’s work as the Wandering Jew—one such haunting form of the past. And in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, the wounded body of the Jew—the figure for the undead
               rather than the immortal—returns to interrupt the elegy by repossessing Keats’ corpse
               and suggesting that Christian and specifically Catholic forms of figuration are
               coextensive with a repressed history of disfiguration. Yet, ultimately, history
               cannot be reduced to a simple opposition between symbolization and defacement.
               Rather, the intensification of this opposition gestures toward a more radical moment
               of pre-historical materiality, to an event that can only be implied beyond the types
               and anti-types of historical representation. </p>
               <p> In the oscillation between Keats’ preservation as celebrity and the Wandering Jew’s
               violent exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality that
               irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy, one mode of Gothic
               hagiography, supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by the
               philosophy of history, remains a theodicy that finds in elegy a poetic correlate to
               hagiography: in this model, all loss, violence, or suffering is read as a kind of
                  <foreign>felix culpa</foreign> with elegy providing, like hagiography, aesthetic
               compensation for trauma. Shelley, however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics
               in <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the text unveils a materiality that falls
               outside ideal afterlife. This failed translation of the body gains its own corpus, so
               to speak, in the Wandering Jew. Like C.R. Maturin’s Melmoth, Shelley’s Wandering Jew
               suffers the discipline, in every sense of that word, of official historiography.
               Bypassing both the Church and the charnel house of history, the Jew exists as a
               counter-narrative to Christian and secular progressivism—for the “secular” is but the
               uncanny reiteration of Christianity, the continuation of Christian history in the
               form of its ostensible elimination. Living his afterlife perpetually wounded, the Jew
               collapses progressive history by bearing trauma materially out of the past and into
               the future. But Shelley’s historical thought does not stop there. Rather, in shifting
               between the figuration of history as ideal (canonical) and as Real (traumatic),
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title> gestures, also, toward history's materialization,
               the action of historicization that cannot be fully rationalized by either kind of
               narrative figuration or even contained between the poles of figuration and
               disfiguration. While it is indeed uncanny that the past should live on—as a
               negativity—into a future its suppression ostensibly renders possible, the root of
               this relation lies even deeper, in the tissue of historicization itself: historicism,
               in its various narrative forms, aims not to sensitize but to insulate consciousness
               from the matter of history.</p>
               <p> According to Earl Wasserman, the remarkable aesthetic coherence of Shelley's <title level="m">Adonais </title>“illumine[s] death” (175) by “translating Keats’
               biography into a complex that is primarily conceptual” (278), thereby rendering both
               the work and, effectively, Keats entirely available to consciousness. Through
               Shelley’s “gentle breath” (173), Keats’ corpse is revived as “Adonais,” the composite
               figure of the Greek Adonis and the Hebrew Adonai (Wasserman 279-80). As with the
               Christian martyrs there is here an irony, identified by James Heffernan, that
               “Shelley’s celebration of Keats,” his “visionary transformation of the pastoral
               dreamer into a Miltonic genius,” nevertheless “required a poet weak enough to have
               been killed by the words of a reviewer so that he might be resurrected by the words
               of Shelley” (303). Indeed, Shelley repurposes Keats’ own Grecian urn: through his
               careful incorporation of elements from Keats’ poetry—nightingales and basil pots,
               among other things—Shelley rewrites Keats’ symbol of poetry as the “lucid urn of
               starry dew” in which “quick Dreams,” disconsolate, “Washed [Keats’] light limbs as if
               embalming them” (91,73, 92). True to the promise of his Platonic epigraph to give
               “New splendour to the dead,” Shelley’s poetic lucidity preserves Adonais, “like a
               star” (494), among “The splendours of the firmament of time” (388)—the latter a line
               Michael O'Neill identifies as containing “an image for the canon” (52). Shelley,
               then, is strangely complicit with the murder that then enables him to re-present
               Keats poetically and historically. </p>
               <p> As Joel Faflak notes, “the most overlooked and yet obvious Gothic feature of the
               text is the rotting corpse of Adonais at the centre of its
                  <foreign>mise-en-scene</foreign>. One misses the corpse because of its
               obviousness, like Lacan's purloined letter, except in this case the object itself is
               uncanny” (n. Pag). But Shelley's text not only conceals Keats’ remains at the heart
               of its aestheticizing activity; the poetry, in addition, infuses life as such with
               creeping mortification. Figured as an awakening, Keats, as Adonais, takes life with
               him into the nether-realm, rendering corporeal existence into perpetual decomposition
               such that death becomes the only state of authentic being: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Adonais' exultation is for his mourners—and Shelley’s readers—their
                  <foreign>katabasis</foreign>. The “abandoned Earth” (368), the seat of organic
               life, becomes, echoing Calderóne's play, a dream, whereas the grave, through hope’s
               interment, becomes, as in Blake’s <title level="m">Book of Thel</title>, disturbingly
                  animated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Calderón de la
                  Barca, <title level="m">Life is a Dream </title>(1629-35). In his letters, Shelley
                  notes on several occasions that, in the months leading up to his composition of
                     <title level="m">Adonais</title>, he is rapidly consuming the works of
                  Calderón, calling him, in a letter to Peacock in August, 1819, “a kind of
                  Shakespeare” (2.115). In a footnote to his draft of <title level="m">Adonais</title> Shelley names Calderón among an expanded pantheon of literary
                  greats (O'Neill 52).</note> If death reigns over life, Adonais feeds on death’s
               (im)mortality: “He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he;/ Mourn not for
               Adonais” (361-2). </p>
               <p> Part of death’s attractiveness in <title level="m">Adonais</title> stems from
               Shelley’s uncanny, pre-emptive commingling of aesthetic pleasure with Keats’
               gravesite. In a letter to Peacock in December, 1818, Shelley describes the Protestant
               cemetery in Rome—the future gravesite not only of Keats but, only a few months later,
               young William Shelley and, ultimately, Percy himself—as “the most beautiful &amp;
               solemn cemetery” he had ever encountered: <quote>To see the sun shining on its bright
                  grass fresh when we visited it with the autumnal dews, &amp; hear the whispering
                  of the wind among the leaves of the trees which have overgrown the tomb of
                  Cestius, &amp; the coil which is stirring in the sunwarm earth &amp; to mark the
                  tombs mostly of women &amp; young people who were buried there, one might, if one
                  were to die, desire the sleep they seem to sleep. Such is the human mind &amp; so
                  it peoples with its wishes vacancy &amp; oblivion. (60)</quote> Months later,
               Shelley recalls the atmosphere of this excursion, describing Keats in Death’s “pale
               court” reclining “as if in dewy sleep” (56, 61). Read proleptically, Shelley’s letter
               diagnoses <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the product of an inversion of life and
               death that confuses metaphysical comfort with depression. At first glance, Shelley
               seems to enjoy imagining himself included among the spirits in this lovely garden and
               appears to sanction the imaginative fecundity that helps the mind overcome “vacancy
               &amp; oblivion.” This reversal, however, where thought and life appear to be
               activated after death, is suspended by a series of qualifications. The desire named
               is, for instance, bracketed not once by twice by hypothetical turns of phrase—“one
                  <emph>might</emph>, <emph>if</emph> one were to die...” Such rhetorical hedging
               casts its shadow across the ostensible desire for the “sleep they seem to sleep.” For
               what precisely is the object of desire here? Does the stress in the penultimate line
               fall on “sleep” or “seem”? Does Shelley find attractive “seeming sleep” taken as
               peaceful death or “seeming sleep” taken as secret (re)animation? Even the final line
               is reversible: while it appears that “vacancy &amp; oblivion” name the setting that
               is populated by the mind’s lively “wishes,” Shelley’s awkward syntax allows one to
               read “vacancy &amp; oblivion” <emph>as</emph> the “wishes” themselves. </p>
               <p> The complex relationships in <title level="m">Adonais</title> among desire, death,
               and afterlife can be clarified by looking at how Shelley appropriates existing
               historical aesthetics. In <title level="m">The Afterlife of the Saints</title>, Julia
               Lupton describes the complex symbolic economy of Christian hagiography in terms that
               prove germane to a reading of Romantic elegy broadly and Shelley's text specifically.
               Hagiography—literally, “sacred writing”—translates death into sainthood, offering the
               martyr a symbolic afterlife in the official calendars and canons of the Church. This
               system rehearses typological and figural hermeneutic practices that can be traced
               back at least as far as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas—practices that
               attempt to redeem Christianity’s Classical and Hebrew past by figuring that past,
               retroactively, as the anticipation of the New Testament’s fulfilment. Christian
               biography, then, is related to a form of mortification as the very mechanism of
               symbolization and historical legitimation. </p>
               <p>For Lupton, Christian historiography is based on the symbolic structure of martyrdom
               dramatized in exemplary fashion by Christ: his crucifixion and burial marks the
               negative moment in the transition from the flesh to the spirit, man to God, pagan to
               Christian history, Old to New Testament. That is, hagiography illustrates the
               perverse relationship between symbolization and violence, where the mundane and
               ephemeral gains historical and indeed spiritual promotion through sublime
               dismemberment. Hence, martyrdom becomes a kind of trope, something that mediates
               between the past and “the <foreign>Nachleben der Antike</foreign>” (Lupton 5), just
               as hagiography, at the level of subjective biography, mediates between anonymity and
               sainthood. Crucially, in each case this formula acts as a way to recuperate
               negation—to put death to work, dialectically. For, if the martyr is always finally
               decapitated, this “loss of the head is not simply one dismemberment among others in a
               potentially infinite metonymic chain, but rather a symbolic recomposition of bodily
               fragments into a subjectivity gathered up by its very cancellation” (Lupton 53). </p>
               <p> Shelley’s inversion of life and death in <title level="m">Adonais</title>
               complicates this final, decisive stroke—a stroke that would accomplish Keats’
               cultural and aesthetic recomposition. It is not merely that Keats joins Chatterton,
               Sidney, and Lucan, “and many more, whose names on Earth are dark/ But whose
               transmitted effluence cannot die” (406-7). For, the kind of beneficent illumination
               these figures cast merely stains the insane purity Shelley attributes to his fallen
               Hyperion: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> It is as if his very living on as a martyr—as a tragic, historical
               figure—would, for Shelley, hamper Keats’ transcendence. Rather than fusing him into
               the dome of glass, then, Shelley's text presents figuration—mere phenomenalization as
               giving cognizable form to images—as denigration: “stained” glass, indeed.
               Anticipating the paradoxical “shape all light” in the <title level="m">Triumph of
                  Life</title>, the apex of elegiac recuperation outstrips all aesthetic or
               intellectual comprehension, such that perfect redemption must coincide with
               imagination’s self-cancellation. The shattered dome thus gestures toward a
               transcendence that exceeds the comprehension of afterlife in reverential terms, which
               is perhaps why the text can describe the speaker’s “ensanguined brow,” in an
               irreverent pairing, as one “Which was like Cain’s or Christ’s” (305, 306). <title level="m">Adonais</title>, then, aspires—or perhaps “expires”—to an existence
               neither entirely corporeal nor entirely spiritual. But, then, what is afterlife? </p>
               <p>If hagiography is the rhetorical archetype of the kind of historical and subjective
               recuperation continuous with secular, “enlightened” historiography, what is the
               significance of the conflicting, Gothic obsession with the undead? Unnatural,
               physical reanimation offers form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is
               excluded from official accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology. Whether the
               vampire, Frankenstein’s Creature, or the Wandering Jew, such monsters live on
               perpetually but only because they are <emph>denied</emph> complete entry into
               prevailing symbolic systems, whether legal, moral, political or, ultimately,
               historical. Ironically, the absence of the final, deadly stroke that crystallizes and
               illuminates the saints’ en-graving in the official canon of the Church generates a
               wounded, Byronic exile who similarly lives beyond death but does so in terrifyingly
               physical, organic terms.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                     <title level="m">Life: Organic Form and Romanticism</title>, Denise Gigante
                  notes that “once life came to be seen [in Romanticism] as power, monstrosity came
                  to represent life’s relentless fecundity and ‘the monstrous’ a mode of
                  uncontainable vitality” (6).</note> As the extension of but also counterpoint to
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ formal coherence, the text gestures toward a
               form of monstrous afterlife that recurs often in Shelley’s work as the Wandering
               Jew.</p>
               <p> The Wandering Jew appears across a wide range of Shelley’s works. According to the
               Medieval folkloric tradition, the Wandering Jew is cursed to roam the earth until the
               Second Coming for denying Jesus respite during the Passion. Echoing the story of
               Cain, God marks the Jew on the face. This disfigured figure thus plays a complex role
               in Shelley’s thinking on history, writing, and afterlife. For if the Jew’s body bears
               God’s wounding mark then he becomes in effect the sign of God—something like Blake’s
               “Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression” (<title level="m">Milton</title>
               49.15). Shelley’s Jew, forced—in Mathew Arnold’s germane phrase—to wander “between
               two worlds, one dead,/ The other powerless to be born,” seems literally to embody the
               meeting point between the mundane and the sacred, the letter and the spirit. In other
               words, he stands in a position similar to the Christian martyr. Yet, since he is
               denied corporeal finitude he is denied entry into hagiography’s symbolizing system,
               the same system that produces authorized history. In the final analysis, the Jew
               “marks” the irreconcilable distance between the “two worlds of life and death”
                  (<title level="m">Prometheus </title>1.195) because he is, strictly speaking,
               denied access to <emph>both</emph>. </p>
               <p> While the Jew’s life is exactly coextensive with Christian history, he lives as a
               counterhistory to the ideology of progress and even as a countertrope to the logic of
               Christian hermeneutic and typological synthesis. For he reveals in his own flesh, to
               adapt Benjamin’s famous phrase, that “there is no document of civilization which is
               not at the same time a document of barbarism” (<title level="m">Illuminations
               </title>256); through the Jew, Shelley finds a powerful emblem for the tyranny,
               violence, and regression within ostensible progress. In fact, in <title level="m">The
                  Wandering Jew</title>, the protagonist, Paulo, is unable to narrate his own story:
               while he represents the quilting point between autobiography and universal history,
               the Jew, here, suffers from a remarkable narrative aphasia. If the Wandering Jew is
               supposed literally to embody divine writing, if his wandering is a performance of
                  <emph>meta-phora</emph> incarnate, he, at the same time, walks toward the
               indefinite future “to-come” intimated also in Shelley's lyrical drama, <title level="m">Hellas</title>. Despite the attempt to make metaphor suddenly literal
               through the Jew’s body, the endlessness of his wandering generates a halting,
               episodic, and fractured autobiography. </p>
               <p>For instance, Paulo initially makes claims for a superior kind of vision,
               characteristic of conventional expectations concerning the prophetic “seers” with
               which he is aligned: <quote>

                  </quote> This power—echoed in similar language by Ahasuerus in <title level="m">Hellas</title>—is suspended, however, by Paulo’s difficulty in facing his own
               history when he attempts to narrate his life to Rosa and his only friend, Victorio: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> This is an acute instantiation of what Paul de Man has called
               autobiography as defacement. Paulo cannot articulate his own history because that
               history is literally the history of his own defacement, which means in a figurative
               and reflexive register the history of his <emph>exclusion from</emph> available forms
               of symbolic and narrative coherence. Biography, autobiography, and even elegy of the
               sort attempted in <title level="m">Adonais</title> would only misrepresent the Jew’s
               relationship to history since narrative organization—with the implicit divisions into
               beginning, middle, and end—precisely cannot apply to the cursed peripatetic.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> dramatizes these two different
               relationships to historical figuration in a moment Blake would call a “minute
               particular.” Early in the poem, Paulo rescues a young novice, named Rosa, from a
               convent in Padua. The text suggests that Rosa is about to be punished by a brutal
               Abbess for indiscretions that remain, for the reader, obscure. The language and
               imagery in the scene suggests, in fact, that we are on the verge of witnessing human
               sacrifice. Rosa, “fainting” (1.147), is borne to “the fatal shrine” (1.183) by a
               group of nuns amidst a crowd whose “confused and open clamors” (1.176) suggest strong
               though impotent opposition to the proceedings. Given her name, it is additionally
               unfortunate that “The roses from [Rosa’s] cheek are fled/ But there the lily reigns
               instead” (1.148-149) and that she should be carried over a path of “fresh roses
               strew[n] upon the ground” (1.163). Paulo, observing the scene, witnesses Rosa’s
               sudden dash for the doors and, quickly navigating the crowd, manages to intercept her
               and carry her off just as she loses consciousness. In escaping from the Abbess, Rosa
               does more than simply preserve her corporeal life, though. More importantly, she
               flees from a site where the light of the Absolute is, literally, mediated by saints
               printed on the windows. She seems, in other words, to have lost any possibility of
               saintly promotion and concomitant historical legitimacy. And yet, describing the
               gloomy atmosphere inside the church, the speaker notices how the stain-glass windows,
               the “saint-cipher’d panes” (1.91), seem to distort the light they also transmit.
               These windows “tinged the pillars with varied stains” (1.93), anticipating the
               description, later, of Paulo’s own eye, his “chilling gaze” that “shot a lurid gleam
               of light” (1.240, 1.242). This stained and lurid light counterpoints the glorious
               illumination of the image of the saint in the window, suggesting that the distance
               between Paulo, whose “burning fillet blazed with blood” (2.204), and saintly
               incandescence might be read not as the failure of spiritual promotion but as life’s
               rescue from Catholicism’s cult of death—a Gothic caricature of Catholic extravagance
               familiar from Radcliffe and Lewis, among others. </p>
               <p>Paulo’s exclusion from various symbolic systems that translate finitude into
               spiritual afterlife through precise violence emerges in this episode in terms of how
               light is, on one hand, illuminating while, on the other, distorting. This casts the
               claims to historical and moral legitimacy made by the Church into shadow. For as the
               scene of near sacrifice suggests, the symbolic economy of hagiography, if
               instrumentalized, looks very much like a regression to precisely those pagan
               practices Judaism and Christianity alike aim to transcend. Such claims will, however,
               always be difficult to make if mundane life is entirely subordinated to
               afterlife—whether spiritual, aesthetic, historical, or some combination of the three.
               Indeed, Shelley exposes the persistence of this subordination by erasing Rosa from
               history through a kind of anti-hagiography. When Rosa chooses to flee from sacrifice
               and join company with Paulo, she forfeits participation both in Christian
               transcendence and official history. Shelley makes this clear through a dramatic
               caesura in the Fourth Canto of his poem. Rosa accidentally takes a fatal dose of
               poison. Shelley, however, does not narrate this moment with the kind of close detail
               characteristic of popular Christian hagiographic compendiums, like Jacobus de
               Voragine’s <title level="m">The Golden Legend</title>. There is, rather, a sudden
               disconnect in the poem, as the speaker turns his attention to the calm summer night
               and then sings, allusively, about decaying flowers. In other words, Rosa’s exile by
               proxy means that, in representational terms, her death is incorporated into—or
               perhaps “incarcerated by”—a different metaphorical code. While her death cannot enter
               into the Church’s official history, it is written on or as nature, as if Classical
               myth displaces Christian transcendence—as if death, like the Wandering Jew’s
               monstrous life, remains disturbingly corporeal and present. </p>
               <p>In a sense, then, Paulo and Rosa return the concept of hagiography to its
               specifically Hebrew application as a description of the twelve books that form the
               final third of the Hebrew Bible. Many of the texts in this section are reclassified
               as “historical books” in the Christian redistribution of the Hebrew Bible into an Old
               Testament. By returning “sacred writing” to mundane history through his physical
               scaring that subtlety re-codes hagiography, Shelley’s Wandering Jew suspends
               Christian transcendence and apocalyptic historiography. With the opacity of a life
               resistant to the “redemption” of symbolization, Paulo’s history preemptively
               collapses Shelley’s key simile in <title level="m">Adonais</title>: if “Life,”

                  <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> then suggests that such a conception of
               life and death is, in fact, a product of the peculiar optics of the Christian Church.
               The illumination of life in this image suggests that <emph>living</emph> and

               materiality that seems to have been veiled by its elegiac illumination. Moving from
               the image of the fractured dome backward in the text of <title level="m">Adonais</title>, there is evidence that this collapse is imminent, as Shelley's
               lucidity frequently verges on translucence, turning instances of possible
               revelation—not through privation but, rather, their intensification—into sites of
               blindness. </p>

               offers emotional, sensual, or intellectual recompense. And yet, that pleasure betrays
               the sorrow of elegy. As such, Shelley presents “Pleasure, blind with tears, led by
               the gleam/ Of her own dying smile instead of eyes” (114-15). Loath to acknowledge the
               vampiric economy wherein elegy, “like flowers that mock the corse beneath” (17),
               translates grief into beauty, pleasure’s personification becomes vaguely Oedipal and
               attempts to circumvent its own activity through self-blinding. Pleasure’s attraction
               to Adonais and, reflexively, its contribution to the poem’s composition, is
               intensified only through its simultaneous limitation. “Led” on by a “<title level="m">dying</title> smile,” Pleasure’s pursuit (of herself) follows only as closely as
               the <emph>fading</emph> of that same pleasure will permit, will extended only
               according to an economy of diminishing returns. </p>
               <p> Not only does the text’s vision tend toward blindness but it gestures toward a more
               radical negativity, one outside the opposition of the visible and invisible. This is
               clearest where the poem approaches not merely invisibility but the unconscious.
               Consciousness, the power of intellectual enlightenment, interrupts radical
               transcendence by reducing the blinding brightness of the Eternal to the conditional
               terms of the understanding. Hence, consciousness becomes most acute and sensitive to
               “his mute voice” (27) as it approaches the abyss of unthought. <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Shelley's thought and language here short-circuits. At first,
               “Nought we know, dies” seems to say “nothing we know can die,” that, once elevated to
               the life of the mind, the passing world escapes death, effectively extending the
               sentiment from the immediately preceding lines where poetry “chang'd to fragrance”
               the “leprous corpse” (175, 172). But Shelley hesitates. The comma between “know” and
               “dies” interrupts any simple continuity between terms, as if Shelley approaches but
               then withdraws from thought and art's claims to ideal and sensuous preservation. The
               whole passage, in fact, checks itself, the speaker inhaling while the dead body
               “Exhales itself in flowers” (173). For the positivity implied within the rhetorical
               question—that, no, “that alone which knows” <emph>will</emph> fend off destruction—is
               extremely tenuous. The speaker seems, in short, to lose confidence in his own
               reassuring arguments in the very process of making those arguments. Read in light of
               the subsequent lines, it becomes possible, ultimately, nearly to invert the apparent
               meaning of “nought we know, dies,” to gloss it as “we can know nothing but that which
               dies.” This reading reorients the passage in ways that reveals continuity with the
               recognition, by the stanza’s end, that the mind that understands this sad fact of
               epistemology dies too. Yet, the mind does not <emph>comprehend</emph> its eventual
               loss of comprehension so much as intuit, as thought’s doppelganger, a negativity that
               is coextensive with consciousness. As if reflecting on the subtle powers of the
               fading coal of the mind in creation, human thought can be grasped only by a
               consciousness in the process of extinguishing itself. The mind can only know death if
               understanding is already, in that apprehension, dying, fading. For only a finite mind
               could be capable of understanding the pain of finitude. God could only know death and
               the grief of loss through human frailty—which is precisely why He had to create the
               world and then populate it with imperfect beings. Weakness, then, is strangely
               coextensive with <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ aesthetic figuration. Keats is not
               fully recuperated but only temporarily revived in order to replay the process of
               losing, in order to dissipate the image the text is always on the verge of shaping. </p>
               <p> R.F. Leavis famously objects that in Shelley's poetry “there is nothing to be
               grasped [...]—no object offered for contemplation, no realized presence to persuade
               or move us by what it is” (210). For Leavis, reading “Ode to the West Wind,” this
               disagreeable instability is a result of Shelley's shifting, impatient imagery. <title level="m">Adonais</title> has a similar effect but for different reasons: it is
               not the imagery but the apprehending consciousness itself that begins to lose its
               moorings. Destroying the coloured dome in what looks like an act of fanaticism means
               cancelling all figuration and consciousness, eliminating all categories of thought
               and rejecting the mediation necessary for knowledge. It is as if the senses and the
               understanding have become impediments rather than aids to perception—or rather, that
               perception itself is a diminishment of the surpassing brilliance that can only be
               indicated by its hostility to the mind. This eliminates both hagiographic sublation
               and monstrous protraction as ways of understanding history's (de)formation. Like a
               candle lost in the daylight, these historiographical models become inadequate not for
               any internal shortcomings but because understanding as such has, strangely, become a
               barrier to adequate expression: something about Keats exceeds both the figuration and
               disfiguration of his historical afterlife. So while the Jew offers a precedent for
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ own unwriting of aesthetic history, even this
               figure cannot symbolize the sheer givenness of history as event or happening. </p>
               <p> In the instant of aesthetic and cognitive collapse, before elegiac mourning is
               recast and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity, Shelley's <title level="m">Adonais</title> comes close to a material vision of history, that is, an
               apprehension of history as an activity that always exceeds its (dis)figuration.
               History in Shelley is not reducible to either narrative or counter-narrative, as it
               also includes the <emph>act</emph> of historicizing. As what enables but eludes
               mediation, this action cannot be understood by the histories it frames, nor can it be
               confused with history “in itself” as something objectively present. Instead, material
               history would be history severed from any narrative form, a sheer happening that is,
               at root, senseless—like a death, a gift, or even the gift of death. In this precise
               context, it is the gift of Keats’ death that is a donation, something purely given,
               and coded in the overdetermined proper name: Adonis, Adonai, <foreign>á
                  donner</foreign>. This happening eludes Shelley's narrative containment—something
               begun from the instant Shelley mythologizes Keats' death as murder. Yet, the text's
               interruption of its own figures of understanding—light, consciousness—suggests that
               this gift's madness mars the poem's formal beauty. Just as one might respond to
               Leavis that the slippage among images in Shelley's “Ode” successfully performs the
               urgency and turbulence of the air—that to provide consciousness with an
                  <emph>object</emph> would be to miss the point—so the collapse of the coloured
               dome hints at a power that cannot be rendered completely intelligible even in art. </p>
               <p> The matter of historical materiality here has to be taken in Judith Butler's sense
               as a process of “mattering” or coming into existence. The materiality of history is
               how history matters; materialization is the senseless action anterior to the meaning
               ascribed to that action by one historical paradigm or another. Shelley's late drama,
                  <title level="m">Hellas</title>, suggests one way in which such mattering makes an
               impression before disappearing into concepts of the understanding. The play abandons
               its organization to the unpredictable events immediately contemporary to Shelley,
               namely, the Greek revolt that erupts in March, 1821, against Turkish occupation. The
               action is framed as three scenes, book-ended and separated by visionary interludes,
               wherein Mahmud, the Turkish ruler residing in Constantinople, hosts various
               messengers who bring him news concerning the Turkish response to the Greek uprising.
               Shelley, however, does not simply borrow this Aeschylean technique as a plot formula;
               for Shelley, too, awaits updates, adjusting his text in response to the contingencies
               of the Rebellion in a display of what he calls, in the Preface, “newspaper erudition”
               (429). In other words, this text hovers over the moment of historical
               materialization, the moment of conversion or encoding where the senselessness of the
               unpredictable happening—something that precedes understanding—is made sensible, is
               made available for “proper history.” So, whereas “the strategies of historicism [...]
               evade the problematic and programming of inscription,” Shelley's text nevertheless
               manages to indicate the action “which precedes and partakes of the very mnemotechnic
               site of archival politics out of which the categories of politics, the human, and the
               aesthetic appear organized” (Cohen xi). </p>
               <p> Like consciousness itself, historical representation seems always and instantly to
               appropriate materiality, turning gifts—the sheer givenness of events—into deficits
               that have to be paid for through narrative explanation. This is also the danger in
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>—that Keats may become a mere trope, that
               something as uncountable as (his) death might be put to work in the interest of
               Shelley's own vendettas against English bards and Scotch reviewers. Indeed, it is a
               danger inherent to the elegy as such, though often restricted to an affective
               complication rather than taken in broader historical, representational terms. “Where
               there is leisure for fiction, there is little grief” (1.163), remarks Samuel Johnson
               in reference to Milton's <title level="m">Lycidas</title>; the elegy, as an effort to
               mourn loss, appropriates and then aims to eliminate sadness—or at least anaesthetize
               consciousness temporarily. As Gregory Nagy describes, elegy is founded on a
               conflicting gesture: “despite its claim to be a form of men's lament, elegy can
               simultaneously make a counter-claim: that it is also an antidote for the grief and
               suffering of lament” (39). And yet the elegy is often, as in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, reflexive enough to question its own status as antidote. Indeed,
               the kind of Gothic counter-narratives to Christian history that traverse Shelley's
                  <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> can be identified precisely within Shelley's elegy,
               suggesting that the Gothic organizes the negativity of elegiac self-reflexivity. For
               the aforementioned “ensanguin'd brow / Which was like Cain's or Christ's” (305-6)
               describes Shelley's self-figuration in the poem, identifying the voice of elegiac
               lament with none other than the Wandering Jew. In uttering elegy in the Gothic
               tongue, <title level="m">Adonais </title>sharpens the contradiction between the forms
               of historical afterlife developed within each genre. One consequence of this is that
               the text becomes increasingly aware that death remains misapprehended in
                  <emph>both</emph> genres—not for any fault of the genres but because death, the
               material event par excellence, is necessarily misapprehend <emph>by</emph> proper
               understanding.</p>
               <p> In an almost masochistic effort to expose its own internal conflicts, <title level="m">Adonais</title> repeatedly attempts to treat death as an attribute. This
               treatment is necessary in order to preserve the consoling though suicidal desire to
               “hasten thither” and “No more let Life divide what Death can join together” (476-7).
               Such confusion is also behind the ostensibly comforting notion that what is beyond
               all deterioration—“from the contagion of the world's slow stain/ He is secure”
               (356-7)—is precisely that which is already deteriorated, just as “the past are all
               that cannot pass away” (432). Existence, however, is not an attribute; it is, rather,
               substantial, fundamental. Unlike quantities, qualities, modalities, relations or
               other modifications of being, existence's removal would negate the subject as such.
               In other words, death cannot join together nor can it preserve in any conventional
               sense, since <emph>what</emph> it would join together or preserve loses, at death,
               its being. “What Adonais is, why fear we to become?” (459). Such a line of thought is
               possible only if death, as non-being, has been confused with a way of being. For what
               the poem, in its relentless self-effacement of understanding, perception, and
               beautiful figuration, insists on is that what Keats <emph>is</emph> is, precisely,
                  <emph>not</emph>. In fact, the first line of Shelley's elegy, “I weep for
               Adonais—he is dead!”—itself a kind of paraphrase of the genre—is deeply misleading,
               metaphysically speaking: death is the “state of being” in which one ceases to be in
               any state whatever, such that the verb “to be” becomes entirely hypothetical. At the
               moment of its most assertive declarations, of its most compelling presentation of
               objects, the poem is thus suspended by an implicit “as if.”</p>
               <p> Shelley seems to sense this conflict. For while it is a common enough—indeed,
               inevitable—error to think of death as a way of being, he stresses this error by
               characterizing death explicitly as an excrescence and stressing the hypothetical
               nature of this construction: “Now thou art dead, as if it were a part / Of thee, my
               Adonais!” (231-2). Death here has been added—though tentatively, as a kind of
               experiment—to a name that somehow persists beyond the logic of being and nothingness,
               as if Keats, as Adonais, is even more substantial, as if he is what he was, and now
               he is that <emph>and more</emph>—that is, dead. In this the text offers an
               alternative reading of Shelley's conclusion of <title level="m">Prometheus
                  Unbound</title>: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> In the context of the Prometheian Age, Shelley’s conception of hope
               suggests irrepressible vitality and optimism, that out of not only the loss of
               concrete objects but its own negation hope can manage to perpetuate and even
               strengthen itself. In <title level="m">Adonais</title>, however, hope becomes a trap.
               “Keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink/ When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd
               thee to the brink,” warns the speaker (422-3). Just as the rhythm of power’s
               diminishment across the text of <title level="m">Adonais</title> makes possible a
               kind of affective and historiographical synchronization, one where loss is registered
               through the repetition of losing rather than the production of an image—effectively,
               the recuperation of loss as another form—so is <title level="m">Adonais</title> aware
               of the sentimentalism it, as elegy, participates in. Given this awareness, the
               persistence rather than dissolution of the sentimental means that the text performs
               itself as sentimental—that is, like Walepole’s Gothic, Shelley’s text wears its own
               genre like a mask and then advertises this dissimulation. Such a performance is not
               exactly ironic but interested in producing a specific trajectory of consciousness:
               where <title level="m">Prometheus</title> (re)produces hope, <title level="m">Adonais</title> (re)produces the wreck. Keats's death is the thing Shelley
               contemplates and it is precisely hope, positivity and production, that he is aware
               his elegy must, in some way, keep its distance from. The Gothic interruption of
               luminous figuration and its subtle indication of a materiality that is deeply
               historical and yet outside historiography is not, therefore, pessimistic. Rather,
               when Shelley displaces sentimentality through a reflexive performance of the
               sentimental he also frees Keats, in part, from his figuration as the naive poet—that
               is, he frees him from his characterization as the lost object that, as Schiller
               argues, gives the sentimental shape of thought its nostalgic impulse. Keats has
               become death, has his being as dead, and exists as the inexistent. With an insane
               fidelity to the gift of death, Shelley would break his mind and his poem in the
               effort to say this logical impasse, to make splendid the impossibility of this gift's
               perfect return as art, knowledge, pleasure, or even history. </p>
