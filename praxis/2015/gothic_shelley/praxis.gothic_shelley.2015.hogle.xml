               The persistent use of Gothic motifs by Shelley from his early Gothic novels
               (1810-11) all the way to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (1822) has
               only been partly explained up until now.  This essay argues that Shelley develops,
               across his career in ways especially visible in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, a "Gothic complex" of connected features that look all the way back
               to how the "Gothic Story" began in Horace Walpole's <title level="m">The Castle of
                  Otranto</title> (1764).  By developing these features as he does, Shelley is
               able to reveal with great power the underlying conflicts at his (and our) time
               between retrograde belief-systems that people still accept as dominant and true, on
               the one hand, and, on the other, progressive re-castings of those old shapes that
               can make them point to revolutionary ideologies that can change the world as his
               characters and readers perceive it.

            <p>Ever since John Murphy in 1975 traced the persistence of “Gothic” figurations from
               P.B. Shelley’s earliest works through <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, we
               have come to see, as Stephen Behrendt has said in his edition of Shelley’s <title
                  level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (1811),
               “unmistakable foreshadowings” in those adolescent “romances” of his major
               achievements between 1818 and 1822 (Shelley 2002b, 12). A vital question remains,
               however: what is really <emph>most</emph> fundamentally <emph>Gothic</emph> — and
               what is most fundamentally symbolized because of that Gothicism — in what continues
               from those early efforts all the way to the unfinished <title level="m">Triumph of
                  Life</title>? Even the best explanations since Murphy of what lasts from this
               poet’s youthful recastings of Ann Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, and Charlotte Dacre do not
               ultimately answer this question, though I think they have taken us part of the way.
               Behrendt himself rightly shows that, once Shelley gets past direct imitations of
               Lewis or Dacre (as in his poem on “The Wandering Jew”), his early romances point, as
               the Gothic always has, to a “world in which traditional beliefs and values have
               eroded” but also one where the pull of those past ideologies remains (Shelley 2002b,
               20). The result in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, Behrendt concludes, is “an unwillingness to fully ‘resolve’ the
               myriad contradictions” in the Gothic rendering of their major characters, who thus
               become precursors of the powerful complexity in the Beatrice of Shelley’s Gothic play
                  <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819; Shelley 2002b, 30-31). John Whatley
               essentially agrees by pointing out how these early novels “critique . . . religious
               symbolism through [the] progressive philosophy” expressed by the most villainous
               characters as they echo Enlightenment thinkers important to Shelley, albeit within
               the frame of a traditional Gothic moralizing (Whatley 1999, 202). The consequence is
               a “struggle between opposing views” acted out through conflicts between different
               kinds of signifiers, so much so that “Zastrozzi” and the “Matilda” he serves or
               “Wolfstein” as he is tempted towards selling his soul by the Rosicrucian “Ginotti” in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvine </title>“hover in a curious, irresolvable middle state
               between [the older] motivated symbol and [the newer] atheist sign” (Whatley 1999, 205
               and 217). </p>
            <p>But is what Behrendt and Whatley reveal spawned by Shelley’s own struggles among
               attitudes as they fill the by-now extreme conventionality of the Gothic figures he
               adapts, or are such irresolutions (as these critics intimate, but only sketchily)
               bound up with the symbolic possibilities endemic to Gothic conventions? Peter Finch
               has neatly sidestepped this question by seeing the intercalated plots of <title
                  level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, the Wolfstein story in a German-Gothic mode
               reminiscent of Lewis and the Eliose story in a sentimental mode that recalls
               Rousseau’s <title level="m">La Nouvelle Heloise</title>, as simply manifesting a
               “contesting pull of narratives” that Shelley will work to critique and then recombine
               in his later writing (Finch 36). Yet this argument begs the question of how much
               both sets of conventions are bound up together, not just in the works of Ann
               Radcliffe, but in the deliberate launching of the post-medieval Gothic in Horace
               Walpole’s <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> of 1764-65. The most
               provocative approach to Shelley’s Gothicism, though, has been offered by Tilottama
               Rajan. For her <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title> put in “question the cultural stereotypes in which they remain
               caught” because of their Gothic predecessors, so much so that they both “write” and
               “withdraw a transgressive narrative” at the same time (Rajan 243). That is because
               they emphasize the “floating” nature of long-overused signifiers, including their
               Gothicized character-types, and use them, especially the Ginotti of the Wolfstein
               plot also called “Nempere” in the Eloise plot, to suggest a “semantic excess” of
               inconsistent references to incompatible texts, from the very old to the current, that
               exposes “the overdetermination of social and psychic texts in which” Shelley’s early
               Gothic form of “narrative has its genesis” (Rajan 243, 245, 246). Nevertheless, the
               question remains: are these semi-transgressions almost entirely Shelley’s, given how
               emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they really creative extensions of
               what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in the conflicting tendencies
               endemic to its symbolic constitution?</p>
            <p>I want to argue for the second of these alternatives. Shelley, I believe, especially
               in the best work of his final year as it builds on the most Gothic features of his
               early fictions, exploits the symbolic possibilities, including the contradictions,
               most basic to the Gothic as a mixed and self-questioning mode. He does so to such an
               extent that it is those very dynamics that often make his final writings what they
               are, and it is the very nature of the Gothic as he first explored it that sets the
               stage for those late “triumphs” as they deal with the conflicting systems of belief
               that he kept attempting to bridge throughout his writing. Indeed, I think that
               Shelley develops a “Gothic complex” of interacting symbolic processes, based on
               elements he experiments with as early as <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and the
               poems preceding it, that is carried out quite thoroughly as late as <title level="m"
                  >The Triumph of Life </title>and consequently fulfills the potentials for
               suggestion most inherent in the Gothic features of his earliest work, ones that end
               up driving Shelley as much as he employs and transmogrifies them. </p>
            <p>Although Whatley has more recently seen such a dynamic (as I do too) in the movement
               of the “Shape all Light” recounted by Shelley’s re-creation of Rousseau (Whatley
               2003, 80-89), this Gothic complex is manifested most fully in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>, as I read it (Shelley 2002a, 483-500), when its Narrator
               describes the victims of “Life’s” captivation of them by emphasizing how much their
               methods of self-definition sadly resemble the symbolic rendering of Life itself in
               its all-conquering chariot. That parallel is most visible in the passages from <title
                  level="m">The Triumph </title>I now cite here from the Narrator’s dream-vision,
               particularly when the “shadow” overarching each walker reappears in the “dusky hood”
               of Life’s shapeless “Shape”: <quote><lg>

               he sees its profusion of “dim forms” as proceeding, on the one hand, from the
               draining of substance from the body that each shadow recalls and, on the other, from
               the “creative [or is it de-creative?] ray” of Life’s central “car” that really

               </quote> I find that Shelley’s “Gothic complex” is never more active than at these
               moments and that these manifestations collectively bring forth the cruxes of his
               earlier Gothicism, their deepest symbolic roots in the Walpolean Gothic, and the
               kinds of meanings that can best be located in this kind of fiction-making, which is
               indeed both highly regressive and radically progressive at the same time.</p>
            <p> To begin with, the “shadows” of themselves projected by, yet finally controlling,
               Life’s prisoners are indeed allusions to the material simulacra given off by objects
               and people in Book IV of Lucretius’s <title level="m">De rerum natura</title> (ca. 55
               BC), also a critique of imperial Rome (Turner 281-82). But they recall just as much
               what Terry Castle has so perceptively seen in Radcliffe’s Gothic of the mid-1790s:
               the tendency in her (as well as Shelley’s) Lockean sense of perception to
               “spectralize” whatever impressions it receives, given that all perceptions are not
               objects but traces on the <foreign>tabula rasa</foreign> of our sensorium. This
               vision of “all things existing only as perceived,” an axiom used in both Shelley’s
               essay “On Life” (1819) and his <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> (1821;
               Shelley 2002a, 506 and 533), results in a Radcliffean world-view, as Castle puts it,
               based on an “absorbing faith in the fantastic” whereby every ghost-like trace — each
               overlaid by a mental interpretation of it formed out of “ideas” developed from
               memories of other such traces — turns every other person or object or landscape into
               a phantom, including externalizations interpreted (as so many are) to be mirrors of
               the self (Castle 246). Such an empirical-but-also-Gothic understanding, Shelley
               comes to see under Radcliffe’s influence among others, produces “a kind of thinking
               dominated by nostalgic mental images” whereby “phatasmic objects” seem “even more
               real at times than the material world” (Castle 247). As a result, the perceivers of
               such phantasms as self-images, for example the slaves of Life in Shelley’s <title
                  level="m">Triumph</title>, submit their thinking to spectral figures of themselves
               based on a past that is taken to be more real and permanent than it really is or was.
               Their self-images thus become in their eyes fixed definitions of their “selves” to
               which they believe they must submit, even though those “dim forms” are actually
               ghosts of what is dead (made explicit by the skeletal “old anatomies” in <title
                  level="m">The Triumph</title>). Indeed, that extension of spectralization, as
               Rousseau’s dream presents it, means that such self-images can operate like
               “vampire-bats,” less a figure from Radcliffe and more of a nod to the gradual
               Gothicizing of the vampire-figure in the eighteen-teens by Byron and Coleridge, then
               Mary Shelley, then John Polodori’s <title level="m">The Vamypre</title> (1819; see
               Hogle 2004). Shelley’s 1822 bloodsuckers, each being a version of thought’s empire
               over itself, psychologically drain the life out of every perceiver who believes
               himself subject to them as permanent points of reference and so keeps obeying his
               former sense of his own nature. In that way, they enact the Death-in-Life that
               captivates those who have accepted the control of a master construct (“Life”) also
               “de-form[ed]” vampirically by its own “dusky hood,” the “shadow of a tomb” or “old
               anatomy” to which It, itself an antiquated perception of existence, keeps submitting
               over and over.</p>
            <p>After all, this Gothic retrospection also harkens back to Walpole’s <title level="m"
                  >Otranto, </title>beyond its own echoes of Locke, to the way the three different
               ghosts there are far more shades of shades than they are specters of bodies. As I
               have noted on other occasions (as in Hogle 2012), one <title level="m">Otranto
               </title>specter is an enlarged fragment of an effigy over a grave (almost
                  <emph>literally</emph> the “shadow of a tomb”), another is an image that walks out
               of a full-length portrait, and the third, the ghost of the Hermit of Joppa who
               intones warnings from the mouth of his fleshless skull (anticipating Shelley’s “old
               anatomies”), is a blatant re-presentation of a <foreign>dance macabre</foreign>
               skeleton from medieval painting. All of these are thoroughly floating signifiers,
               “shadows of shadows” in Rousseau’s words from Shelley’s <title level="m"
                  >Triumph</title>, not surprising, it turns out, for a Protestant author (Horace
               Walpole) whose equally famous letters celebrate his own antiquarianism as a playing
               with old icons that “cannot disappoint” because there is no longer any “reason to
               quarrel with their emptiness” (Walpole 1937-83, 10: 192). In the Preface to his first
               edition of <title level="m">Otranto</title>, we should remember, where he pretends to
               be the translator of a post-Reformation manuscript that once kept alive a Catholicism
               that for him <emph>should</emph> be fading, Walpole sets up all the Catholic specters
               and machinery in his tale to be viewed as symbols “exploded now even from romances”
               and thus emptied of their old grounds of belief even as they continue to play those
               out for audiences of a later time (Walpole 1996, 6). Consequently, readers of what
               Walpole himself labeled the first new kind of “Gothic Story” in his Second Edition of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> (1996, 3) face tormented characters, often
               debating within themselves, whose beliefs make them subject to “phantoms” that are
               actually “dim forms,” yet forms which they take to be indicators of unchangeable
               reference-points in the past haunting them by drawing them back towards those
               supposed grounds, however outdated. Walpole’s own critique of the medieval Gothic
               materials in his neo-Gothic, we find, right along with his and Radliffe’s Lockean
               sense of perception, is clearly among the fundamental pretexts for Shelley’s critique
               of the way so many of us enslave ourselves to a fixed sense of life by accepting old
               symbolic orders, especially in the ways we mirror ourselves to ourselves in what are
               really the “base broods” (or symbolic constructs) of “old anatomies.”</p>
            <p>At the same time, though, the Gothic, even for Walpole, is not that simple, so
               neither is Shelley’s “Gothic complex” in <title level="m">The Triumph </title>and
               elsewhere. As much as Walpolean Gothic figures can be exposed as “floating
               signifiers” separable from their older grounds and thus able to signify newer ones,
               there is an insistent antiquity in them, much as there is in Shelley’s reenactment of
               Dantean and Petrarchan dream-visions and terza-rima verse-forms along with echoes of
               the eighteenth-century Gothic in his new <title level="m">Trionf</title>. Such a
               paradox at the very core of the Gothic indicates (in David Punter’s words), yes, a
               “fear of the violence of the past and its power over the present,” hence <title
                  level="m">The Triumph</title>’s vision of Life as echoing ancient Rome’s paradings
               of its captives, but also a “longing for many of the qualities” and secure grounds of
               belief “which that past possessed” or at least seemed to in retrospect (Punter 418).
               As Karl Marx has shown, the rise of new ideologies and modes of production struggles
               against the still-powerful draw of older beliefs and systems of exchange, and the
               Gothic is the most flagrant symbolic manifestation of that cultural contestation in
               the history of English fiction-making. The pull of “ancient romance” elements,
               “exploded” as they are, is just as strong in the neo-Gothic as the pull of the more
               “modern” ones akin to the rising middle-class novel, according to Walpole’s
               definition of “Gothic Story” in his Preface to <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s
               Second Edition (Walpole 1996, 9-11). That looking-backwards-and-forwards
               simultaneously, like the “Janus-faced Shadow” that actually drives Life’s chariot for
               Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference, which he expressed in the 1750s, for
               keeping at least a “shadow of monarchy” on an otherwise “empty chair of state,” like
               the “ghost of Banquo” in Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Macbeth</title> (Walpole
               1847, 377), rather than facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually
               made England (and even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France. It is for these
               reasons that E.J. Clery has so correctly viewed the first “Gothic Story” as setting a
               pattern by both articulating and disguising a profound “contradiction” in the culture
               of Walpole’s time, in his case “between the traditional claims of [aristocratic]
               landed property and the new claims for the [bourgeois] private family” (Clery 77).
               With its Janus-faced symbols, style, and focus on characters so internally
               conflicted, the Gothic has consequently become in the post-Renaissance West <emph>the
               </emph>fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the
               culture between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced, as the fear
               of death and dissolution are in Edmund Burke’s terror-based “Sublime” also basic to
               the Gothic tradition, yet where those unresolved quandaries are hyperbolically
               reenacted and played out in the guise of concurrently retrograde and experimental
               fiction able to be conservative and progressive all at once.</p>
            <p>Shelley’s continuation of the Gothic in his <title level="m">Triumph</title>,
               therefore, is willingly pulled towards the kind of enslavements to patterns of sin
               allegorized by Petrarch and Dante, yet it remains determined to show that their very
               Catholic patterns of God-centered allegory are based on the projections of mere
               thoughts into externalized “shadows” that have come to be interpreted as absolute
               truths and thus as tyrannizing sources of “fear” enforcing submission – all of which
               is a use of allegorical figures to attack the premises of old allegory itself,
               without leaving them behind altogether, alongside resurrections of Walpolean and
               Burkean “old anatomies” to show how such emptied-out figures can still have the
               psychological force they do. Ultimately Shelley realizes in his rendering of <title
                  level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> that he, his poem, and his audience cannot
               entirely escape from the systems of belief he wants to explode in it, one reason for
               the persistence of the construction of Life that drives this poem’s throngs while
               Life itself turns out to be no more than a “Shape” continuously being un-shaped and
               re-shaped again. Even the shade of Rousseau, in serving as a Virgilian truth-teller
               to Shelley’s Dantean Narrator, is unable to overcome a lingering contradiction of
               ideologies in his own beliefs only somewhat revised from those of the author of whom
               he is a sympathetic critique. As much as he blames himself for striving to arrest and
               confine the movement of the “Shape all light” in his
               dream-within-the-Narrator’s-dream, even as it keeps transfiguring itself from state
               to state, “forever sought, forever lost” (l. 431), that Shape is itself a
               retrospective Beatricean as well as a revolutionary “Asia” or “Witch of Atlas” figure
               from Shelley’s earlier poetry. Rousseau in Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>
               thus remains undecided as to how much his own submission to “Life” is his willful
               fault in the face of her transference across traces of perception <emph>or</emph> how
               much that failing results from the necessary influence of the environment in which he
               was placed while he lived: “if the spark with which heaven lit my spirit / Earth had
               with purer nutriment supplied,” he wonders in a passage <emph>not</emph> cited above
               that echoes the Wordsworth “Immortality” Ode about which Shelley was always
               conflicted, would “Corruption . . . not now thus much inherit / Of what was once
               Rousseau” and now both is and is not him simultaneously (ll. 201-04)? The struggle
               Shelley famously had with William Godwin’s view of Necessity within his early “Gothic
               sensibility” (as Donald Reiman called it in 1981) – how much is behavior determined
               by choice or by environment? — is manifestly unresolved in his final unfinished
               poem, and we now see it is the persistence of the Gothic in that very <title
                  level="m">Triumph</title> that most conceals and reveals that irresolution, and
               many other quandaries of Shelley’s era, even as he was about to set sail into the
               Gulf of Spezia. </p>
            <p>In any case, speaking of echoes, this whole Gothic process conjoined with others is,
               in its “complex” of disparate yet interconnected elements, remarkably, if not
               completely, similar to what we often see in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, published 11-12 years earlier. Consider this
               passage taken from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, a moment so typical of the
               overwrought characterizations in this tale’s constant echoing of <title level="m">The
                  Monk</title> and <title level="m">Zofloya</title> that it could have come from
               almost any chapter, though is here excerpted from near the end: <quote><p

                     Verezzi; she gazed downwards [since he had cast himself at her feet] upon his

                     and tenfold love assailed her softened soul. She raised him – in an oblivious
                     delirium of sudden fondness she clasped him to her bosom and, in wild and
                     hurried expressions, asserted her right to his love.</p>

                     as an uncertain vision, which floated before his fancy more as an ideal being
                     of another world, which he might thereafter adore there, than as an enchanting
                     and congenial female, to whom his oaths of eternal fidelity had been given.

               of other beings projected and then obsessed upon by the characters of both Lewis and
               Dacre, with Radcliffe hovering in the background, this moment has the confused
               Verezzi, not knowing he is Zastrozzi’s hated half-brother, envision his long-time
               projection of the remembered “Julia” as separating from her now “uncertain” form in
               the past and receding behind the Matilda who has relentlessly pursued him, yet
               explicitly <emph>without</emph> Julia disappearing as his ultimate ideal.
                  <emph>This</emph> complex recalls the ending of Walpole’s <title level="m"
                  >Otranto</title> where Theodore, finally revealed as the Castle’s true heir,
               accepts marriage to the Isabella once pursued by the usurping Manfred but keeps
               thinking of the dead “Matilda” (here the daughter of Manfred) whom he loved devotedly
               before she died, as Verezzi thinks Julia has at this point in <title level="m"
                  >Zastrozzi</title>. Shelley’s early Gothic thereby replays the figural pattern of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s final sentence, in which Theodore decides “he
               could know no happiness but in the society of one [Isabella] with whom he could
               forever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul” because of
               Matilda’s irreversible absence and yet her constant looming in a remembered past that
               remains an absolute point of reference (Walpole 1996, 115), like the primal crimes
               revealed as the causes of all the specters of specters in the first neo-“Gothic
               Story.” </p>
            <p>The quintessentially Janus-faced nature of Walpole’s prototypical Gothic figure has
               undeniably been transferred from <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto </title>to
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, even to <emph>its</emph> ending where the
               title character who rejects all religious traditions also confesses the root of his
               vengeance to be the dying words of his mother (Shelley 2002b, 155). To much the same
               extent, we can now see, too, the floating signifier of Julia’s image for Verezzi,
               reinforced by Matilda’s obsession with his surface “countenance” since the start of
               Shelley’s novel, Gothically anticipates the “shadows of shadows” in the same author’s
               late <title level="m">Triumph</title> as they drift from their past referents while
               being held fixedly by their projector-observers to those very receding grounds, dead
               though they already are or, like Verezzi and Julia, are about to be. Shelley could
               not have conceived of what is really the “moment of truth” in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, the choice between accepting the drift of signifiers towards
               future redefinitions and the re-anchoring of them to dead “anatomies” from the past,
               unless there had been the tug-of-war in the Walpolean Gothic figure that he had
               thoroughly played with in his more youthful writings. He also would not have had as
               apt a symbolic mode for half-concealing and half- revealing <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>’s hesitations between free-willed choice and the pressure
               of one’s historical conditions if he had not worked with and continued to employ a
               Gothic mode <emph>designed by its nature</emph> to be a repository for unresolved
               conflicts among contending beliefs. In the <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> passage
               above, we have to admit, the text hesitates, just as <title level="m">The Triumph
               </title>will, between condemning the characters for their essentially selfish choices
               and suggesting that such choices are already made for them. After all, the same
               characters keep making the same errors again and again within the pervasive
               atmosphere of their Gothic environment. These are stances toward which they are
               driven, like the victims of Shelley’s “Life,” by what Godwin invokes in the original
               main title of his quite Gothic <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794): the
               necessary consequences of “Things As They Are.” </p>
            <p>Now we can see the fully Gothic basis of what previous interpreters have begun to
               find in Shelley’s early romances, as well as the essentials of the “Gothic complex”
               that are transferred almost intact from Walpole through the Gothic of the 1790s to
               the early Shelley and to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Myriad
               contradictions of character cannot be resolved in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
               and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as Behrendt has said, because their very
               construction is rooted in the Gothic’s <emph>at least</emph> two-directional tug of
               war between older and newer conceptions of human psychology as well as waning and
               developing economies. The equally “irresolvable middle state between the motivated
               symbol and the atheist sign” found by Whatley in Shelley’s Gothic novels stems from
               their Walpolean mix of retrogression and rebellion that makes characters and images
               both potentially floating signifiers and entities attractively anchored in past
               realities, causes, and beliefs even when those are truly dead and gone. Finch’s sense
               of the conflict between the tragically fated Gothic and the assumptions of
               sentimentalism in the plots of <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, meanwhile,
               actually stems from that novel’s acceptance of a Gothic mode that has, since its
               beginnings and <emph>not</emph> just in Radcliffe, internally combined freely-chosen
               states of feeling with fated hauntings from older assumptions, as in the ending of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> where Theodore willfully accepts a woman because
               she can help him indulge his “melancholy” over his lost true love but also because he
               cannot help himself as the destined resolver of an age-old usurpation guided, perhaps
               from heaven, towards a marriage that reunites the two families with the most
               sanctioned claims to the castle of Otranto. The quite similar depiction of unresolved
               tensions between external and internal causalities in <title level="m"
                  >Zastrozzi,</title>
               <title level="m">St. Irvine,</title> and <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
               is made possible, after all, by the Walpolean Gothic providing unique verbal means
               specifically for configuring ideological conflicts and their nagging irresolution.
               Finally, too, what we have learned from Professor Rajan’s 1990s take on Shelley’s use
               of Gothic (apart from what she has added in this very collection) depends entirely on
               the Gothic itself being inherently a mode dominated by the uprooted, though also
               backward-looking, signifier that can refer in its incessant mobility to many
               different texts and ideologies of its own and former times – and thereby to the
               conflicting ideologies in its many pre-texts that always (in Rajan’s words)
               “overdetermine” it and make its symbols refer to a “semantic excess” of
               “indeterminate” cultural debates. This dynamic is part of the disunified “essence” of
               the Gothic in which, as Rajan has said, “reality has been replaced by hyperreality,
               and mimesis by the simulacrum” (Rajan 243). I contend that Shelley’s critiques of
               his own culture from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> to <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life </title>employ the Gothic as powerfully as they do precisely by
               bringing forward these deep tensions at the core of it. This is the “Gothic complex”
               he develops across his career so as to help his audiences realize the crossroads of
               choices they face, unless they chose to ignore them, between the most retrospective
               and destructive and the most progressive and liberating options for the ways we can
               construct Life for ourselves then, now, and in the future. </p>
