         <div type="abstract"><p rend="noCount">This paper begins with the Gothic, exemplified in Shelley’s early Gothic novels
            <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as
            an overdetermined and unprocessed moment that interrupts aesthetic ideology, and
            that is problematically entwined with the Romantic in ways that help to illuminate
            the deconstructive role that the Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. More
            particularly, I approach this interimbrication through Hegel’s distinction between
            “Symbolic” and Romantic art in his <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, which
            distinguishes three modes based on art’s (in)ability fully to configure the “Idea.”
            In Symbolic art the “Idea” is still "indeterminate"; it achieves “adequate
            embodiment” in Classicism; but in the Romantic, form and content are again
            separated, because of an inadequacy in external forms that repeats and reverses the
            problems of the Symbolic. Curiously placing Classical beauty and unity in the middle
            of his dialectic, as an abandoned synthesis, Hegel oscillates between two forms of
            inadequacy that are both similar and different. For the Romantic beautiful soul
            withdraws from existing discourses, while the imagination of the Symbolic artist is
            deformed by what it cannot form. But the Romanticist thereby risks a bad infinity,
            while the Symbolic artist works on content in the here and now, even at the cost of
            trapping his work in what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy.” Given Hegel’s
            association of the Symbolic with the fantastic and monstrous but also the sublime
            (which I read here through ðiñek), we can use his category to think through
            Shelley’s use of the Gothic as a mode whose very disfigurations—and sometimes its
            conscious badness—form part of a creative negativity. The Gothic, as a stalled and
            blocked form, has been seen as a “complex.” But this makes it a vanishing mediator
            in the transition from residual to emergent societal modes. I suggest, instead, that
            it is a “matrix” for an irresolvable contention and ferment in the work of culture:
            one to which Shelley comes back again and again. In conclusion, I touch briefly on
            three of these Shelleyan returns. In <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
            Demogorgon’s clumsy overthrow of Jove is merely a parenthesis. Concessive clause.
            More complex is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, as Shelley’s autonarration of his
            unsettled relation to a poetry he conceives Romantically but Gothically dis-figures.
            Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> the Shape in the Car seems
            to punish the Idealism of the Shape all Light. But their inter-folding reconfigures
            the relation of Gothic and Romantic, as Shelley can no longer immunize “the
            splendour of unfaded beauty” against “the secrets of anatomy and corruption,” nor
            protect literature from a cultural and political debasement that, by “eat[ing] out
            the poetry” from history, actually releases a disastrous creativity.</p></div>

            <p> Towards the end of Shelley’s second Gothic novel <title level="m">St.Irvyne</title>
               (1811) the alchemist Ginotti is about to initiate Wolfstein into the secrets of life.
               Wolfstein is the hero of the main plot, while Ginotti is the obscure figure, the
               unstable compound, who sanctions Wolfstein’s poisoning of the bandit Cavigni to
               obtain the lovely Megalena. In the main story Ginotti functions as the Dark
               Interpreter of the increasingly dissolute Wolfstein, until the plot disposes of both
               in its Faustian “Conclusion.” The novel is also intersected by a Radcliffean subplot
               focused on Eloise, who turns out to be Wolfstein’s sister, even though she seems to
               be French while he is Bohemian. Eloise is seduced by the casuistical Nempere, rescued
               by another libertine, and marries Fitzeustace, a Peacockian parody of the Shelleyan
               Poet. This Romantic subplot fantastically escapes the Gothic main plot, by which it
               is nevertheless enveloped as Nempere turns out to be Ginotti. The result is that
               Nempere, though terminated in the subplot, is still alive in the main plot,thus
               casting doubt on whether the text has indeed disposed of the matrix figure whose
               metamorphic alias he is. And do we want to dispose of this matrix towards which the
               more obscure and elusive figure of Ginotti gestures? Or does the novel’s titular
               remembering of Godwin’s <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799), where alchemy is
               also a metonymy for schemes of sociopolitical improvement, make Ginotti a shorthand
               figure for a still undigested future transformation of “the potable waters that flow
               from death through life” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 533)? <note xml:id="ftn1"

            <p> Indeed this unprocessed dimension of the characters and “figures” that “rise on the
               bubble” of Gothic experimentation only to be cast off (<title level="m"
                  >Triumph</title> 248-50), is evident in the hasty algebra with which <title
                  level="m">St. Irvyne</title> ends: <quote>Ginotti is Nempere. Eloise is the sister
                  of Wolfstein. Let then the memory of these victims to hell and malice live in the
                  remembrance of those who can pity the wanderings of error; let remorse and
                  repentance expiate the offences which arise from the delusion of the passions, and
                  let endless life be sought from Him who alone can give an eternity of happiness.
                  (252)</quote> With these pious clichés Shelley throws away a project with which he
               has grown impatient. But three chapters earlier, when Ginotti promises Wolfstein the
               elixir of life, he endows this juvenile literary performance with an unexpected
               metaphysical depth. As a prelude to this promise which is never fulfilled, Ginotti
               launches into his biographia literaria.He tells how by the age of seventeen he had
               delved into the secrets of “natural philosophy” and “metaphysical calculations,”
               convincing himself of “the non-existence of a First Cause” (236-7). This
               epistemological transgression, or <foreign>acte gratuit</foreign> as André Gide might
               call it, had led him to experiment with poison, killing a youth who had offended him.
               Thereupon, having tasted death, he became despairingly nihilistic yet avid for
               eternal life. Contemplating suicide, he found himself on the edge of a gulf, facing a
               “form of most exact and superior symmetry.” The passage is worth quoting at length:
                  <quote>The phantasm advanced towards me; it seemed then, to my imagination, that
                  his figure was borne on the sweet strain of music which filled the circumambient
                  air. In a voice which was fascination itself, the being addressed me, saying,
                  `Wilt thou come with me? Wilt thou be mine?’ ... “No, no,” I unhesitatingly cried,
                  with a feeling which no language can either explain or describe. No sooner had I
                  uttered these words, than methought a sensation of deadly horror chilled my
                  sickening frame ... the beautiful being vanished; clouds, as of chaos, rolled
                  around, and from their dark masses flashed incesant meteors. ... My neck was
                  grasped firmly and, turning round in an agony of horror, I beheld a form more
                  hideous than the imagination of man is capable of portraying, whose proportions,
                  gigantic and deformed, were seemingly blackened by the inerasible traces of the
                  thunderbolts of God; yet in its hideous and detestable countenance, though
                  seemingly far different, I thought I could recognize that of the lovely vision.
                  (237)</quote></p> 
            <p>This passage from Shelley’s early novel strikingly anticipates
               Rousseau’s symbolic autobiography in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
               where Rousseau too is offered the elixir of life: “a chrystal glass/ Mantling with
               bright Nepenthe” (358-9). In Rousseau’s dream-vision, the Shape all light, the
               aestheticization of a revolutionary idealism that Ginotti pursues in more Sadeian and
               Nietzschean ways, becomes the deformed shape in the Car, returning us to the Gothic
               scene that opens the character “Shelley’s” dream-vision of history.<note
                  xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">I use “Shelley” in quotation marks
                  to refer to the first-person speaker of the poem, the character Shelley, as

               the figure constructed by Romantic idealism is disfigured,<note xml:id="ftn3"

                     Rhetoric of Romanticism</title> 67-82, 93-124). However, disfiguration is not
                  the same kind of analytic operation that deconstruction is. My use of the term
                  thus tries to restore some of the generative potential of a mutilation of figures
                  whose affect suggests the struggle or “restless fermentation” that Hegel sees in
                  the Symbolic.</note> it never quite ceases to be present in the “severe excess” of
               the enlightenment that follows: “The ghost of a forgotten form of sleep” (<title
                  level="m">Triumph of Life</title> 424-8). While in both cases we seem to proceed
               sequentially from illusion to disillusion, both texts are better described as folding
               the Gothic and Romantic into each other. In <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, that
               is, the romance of Eloise and Fitzeustace, which itself exists only by repressing a
               traumatic Gothic kernel, is enveloped within a larger narrative of Faustian depravity
               that conceals a core of idealism disclosed and defaced in Ginotti’s vision. Likewise
               in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, “Shelley’s” dream-vision is infolded
               with Rousseau’s in a pattern of blindness and insight that confuses misprision and
               enlightenment: while Rousseau awakens from his encounter with the Shape all light to
               the nightmare of history, “Shelley” <emph>dreams</emph> this nightmare which folds
               inwards and backwards to a core of idealism at the heart of darkness.</p>
            <p> In connecting the passage from <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>
               <note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">For a more extensive discussion
                  of Shelley’s Gothic novels themselves, see Rajan, <title level="m">Romantic
                     Narrative</title> (46-74).</note> to Shelley’s last poem, I want therefore to
               suggest that it entwines the Gothic and Romantic in a way that is emblematic of the
               role Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. For in the past several years the
               Gothic has arguably replaced the greater Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for
               the field, though without the metacritical recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the
               Greater Romantic lyric. Or put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task of
               deconstructing what has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic
               ideology” (McGann; Redfield 24-7), in particular because it makes manifest, almost
               schematically, what Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past
               institutions” (II.101). The prominence of the Gothic also marks a shift from
               so-called “High” Romanticism to the popular that might superficially seem to be part
               of “cultural studies.” Yet unlike cultural studies, if the Gothic deconstructs
               Romantic ideology, it does so on the ground of literature, by exposing Romanticism to
               its own in(di)gestion of the work of the negative, rather than by demystifying it
               from the outside as a social or economic phenomenon. Thus in Shelley’s major poems
               (as also in Blake’s <title level="m">Europe</title> and <title level="m">(First) Book
                  of Urizen</title>) the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. An
               example from Shelley’s most ethereal text is the unprocessed melodrama of
               Demogorgon’s victory over Jove. But equally, for Shelley at least, the Gothic is
               never free of the Romantic, which is to say that he allows us to grasp a
               transformative potential in the violence and perversity of the Gothic that is less
               evident in more popular uses of the genre.</p>
            <p> We can approach this linkage of Romantic and Gothic through Hegel’s distinction
               between Romantic and Symbolic art: modes he opposes while conceding their profound
               connection. Hegel’s triad of Symbolic, Classical and Romantic art in his lectures on
                  <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> is particularly useful because on the one
               hand, though the post-Walpolean Gothic may not fall chronologically within the
               Oriental phase that Hegel delimits as Symbolic, Hegel’s association of the Symbolic
               with the monstrous and fantastic applies equally to the Gothic (I. 76). On the other
               hand, the Symbolic is a broader category than the Gothic, including as it does the
               sublime, which we might conventionally expect to find in the Romantic phase. As such,
               the category of the Symbolic helps to open up the Gothic philosophically beyond the
               sensationalism to which the sheer mass production of the genre at the time reduces
               it. Indeed there is a certain consistency between Hegel’s unconventional placement of
               the sublime in the Symbolic phase and my own use of the Symbolic to think through the
               (pre)Romantic genre of the Gothic. For both anachronisms register the generative
               potential of a mode whose disfigurations form part of a creative negativity.</p>
            <p> Hegel theorizes three modes based on art’s ability to fully configure the “Idea,” a
               term derived from Kant, but which is curiously unreferred in Hegel, as it is not the
               idea “of” anything and is thus a form of desire. For Kant in the <title level="m"
                  >Critique of Judgment</title> “aesthetic ideas” are forms that have not quite
               found their content, while “rational ideas” are concepts (such as freedom) that have
               not achieved material form (192, 218). Thus already for Kant a certain inadequacy
               seems to be at the heart of the “Idea.” As a desire for the Idea rather than any
               specific idea, Hegel’s Idea is not unlike what Shelley defends as “poetry,” which
               often turns out to be a creativity that exceeds generic and historical containment
                  (<title level="m">Defence</title> 518). In Hegel’s sequence, which historicizes
               Kant’s analyses of the beautiful and sublime, the Symbolic, Classical and Romantic
               involve different relations between "inwardness" and its "externalization," “theme”
               and execution,” or the Idea and its "embodiment" (I.75, 79, 96, 422).<note
                  xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">In Kant’s terms from the <title
                     level="m">Third Critique</title> the Classical is beautiful, whereas the
                  Symbolic and Romantic are different versions of the sublime. It should be noted
                  that Hegel does not use the term “Symbolic” in the way it was used by
                  contemporaries such as Goethe, Schelling, Coleridge and others (nor in the way it
                  is used by Lacan, for whom the “symbolic order” is really an order of signs). For
                  Hegel’s contemporaries the symbol is the unification of the particular and
                  universal, whereas allegory is their separation; in effect, the symbol is a form
                  of the beautiful. For Hegel the Symbolic is one form taken by the separation of
                  particular and universal. Indeed Hegel’s inversion of the usual meaning of the
                  term is part of a complex critique—engaged with the work of Goethe and Friedrich
                  Creuzer—of the idea of art as <foreign>Darstellung</foreign> or the presencing of
                  the Idea. For elaboration of this point see Rajan, “Towards a Cultural Idealism”
                  (62-5), which also discusses the relation between Symbolic and Romantic in
                  Hegel.</note> In the Symbolic phase, which is pre-art, pre-mature, art fails to
               achieve identity with itself because of a deficiency in self-consciousness that is
               reflected in the Idea still being "indeterminate." This problem is overcome in the
               Classical, as art becomes "the adequate embodiment of the Idea" (I.76-7). But in the
               Romantic, form and content are again separated, this time because of a deficiency in
               matter that repeats and reverses the problems of the Symbolic. For while the Idea in
               the Symbolic fails to embody itself because of its own deficiency, in the Romantic
               phase the Idea is fully developed, but “can no longer find its adequate reality” in
               the “shapes” available to it in its culture (I.442). Thus the Romantic “reverts, even
               if in a higher way, to that difference and opposition of the two sides which in
               symbolic art remained unconquered” (I.79). </p>
            <p> The “critical history of Poetry” in which Shelley finds the “defence” of his Idea
               “betrayed” (528) likewise contains both Romantic and Symbolic versions of this
               inadequacy. Thus on the one hand poetry is constrained by “distorted notions” that
               result in even poets such as Dante and Milton walking “through eternity” “enveloped”
               in the “mask and mantle of prejudice” (526). On the other hand poetry is also figured
               in the quintessentially Romantic images of a “fading coal” (531) or a “lightning
               which has yet found no conductor” (528). On one level the <title level="m"
                  >Defence</title> presses towards a Romantic <foreign>telos</foreign> that disavows
               the Symbolic matrix of the history in which it finds itself embedded. Yet the very
               contradiction between the images of the fading coal and the lightning, in the first
               of which the idea is fully developed while in the second it is yet to come, marks the
               tenuousness of the Romantic category. </p>
            <p> Act IV of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, or the scene where Asia grasps
               Panthea’s dreams by reading her “written soul” in her eyes (II.i.110) are examples of
               a Romanticism that presses beyond mediation. By contrast, the Symbolic is associated
               with the monstrous or fantastic, and disfigures its too hasty hypostasis of the Idea
               through what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy” (<title level="m"
                  >Aesthetics</title> I.76): a description we can extend to the Gothic. Thus in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> Nempere de-forms rather than embodies Ginotti
               . For his part, Ginotti is himself the inchoate materialization of a juvenile and
               indeterminate Idea. Like Demogorgon, who is nothing if not Symbolic, this Idea has
               neither “form nor outline” (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> II.iv.6). It
               is an unstable compound in which the Nietzschean “death of God” in the materialism of
               the <foreign>philosophes</foreign> makes possible social and thought experiments
               whose association with libertinism and perversion figures their underlying
               ideological contradictions. </p>
            <p> Ginotti is a “figure” that materializes at the threshold between fear and desire.
               Opposing “figure” to “discourse” Lyotard describes three levels of figuration that
               are more and more removed from any kind of clear formulation: the image-figure, which
               is visible but already blurred; the form-figure, which can be “perceived” but not
               “seen” and is a schema that underlies the visible; and finally the matrix figure,
               which is neither “visible” nor “readable,” and which is “difference itself” (277-8).
               Ginotti is this form-figure or schema that gestures towards the matrix described by
               Lyotard, which Wolfstein and Nempere, as stereotyped image-figures, disfigure through
               their “bad and untrue definiteness” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.74). Yet
               if the Gothic is “bad” literature, Shelley’s explicit association of the genre in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> with the <foreign>philosophes</foreign>
               (236-7), gives its distortions a Symbolic potential: one that Hegel recognizes when
               he describes how in the crudity of the Symbolic, “the Idea . . . persists
                  <emph>sublime</emph> above all this multiplicity of shapes which do not correspond
               with it” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> 77).</p>
            <p> Returning to Hegel, what is notable in his dialectic is the place of the Classical,
               as a synthesis oddly displaced to the middle. For the Classical, as the "unity of the
               artist's subjective activity with his work,” “achieves what true art is in its
               essential nature” (I.427, 431). Yet Hegel is dissatisfied with this completion, as
               the Classical is superseded by the Romantic, which reverts to the difference of Idea
               and shape in the Symbolic, as if it is really inadequacy which is the essence of art.
               We sense Hegel’s disappointment with the Classical when he says that the Classical
               artist adequately embodies the Idea only because he receives his content “cut and
               dried” from “national faith and myth,” leaving him free to work on the formal and
               rhetorical shaping of this content (I.439). By contrast, form and content in the
               Symbolic have a more integral relationship: Symbolic art senses "the inadequacy of
               its . . . shapes” and yet can do nothing but distort these shapes, thus "positing
               it[self] as the inherently deficient, something to be superseded" (I.318-19). Yet the
               Symbolic, as a mode in which the "Idea . . . does violence" to "natural shapes," also
               “stretches them unnaturally" in order to "<emph>elevate their phenomenal appearance
                  to the Idea</emph>" (I.76; italics mine). There is thus something sublime in its
               deformations that distinguishes it both from Classical complacency and from the
               ineffectually angelic claims of the Romantic.</p>
            <p> Hence Hegel’s strategic location of the sublime in the Symbolic rather than Romantic
               phase. For there are two kinds of Symbolic art: the “positive” art of India and
               Persia and the “negative” art of the sublime (I.364). In a section of the third
               Critique that Hegel cites, Kant argues that the physical presentation of the sublime
               (as in a raging ocean) is merely “horrible,” because it fails to understand the
               sublime as an “invisible meaning devoid of shape” that has no adequate objective
               correlative in phenomena (Hegel, Aesthetics I.363-4). Hence Kant prefers the dynamic
               sublime to a merely mathematical sublime limited to <foreign>res extensa</foreign>.
               Hegel’s criticism of Symbolic forms such as the grotesque that involve a hyperactive
               visual surface has its origin in these comments by Kant, and is generated by a
               philosophical argument against visibility as the premature foreclosure of negativity.
               The Symbolic, then, is by no means simple. It is the site of a difference between an
               Idea falsely posited in a determinate image-figure like Nempere, or Zastrozzi whose
               gigantic stature makes him mathematically sublime, and the more invisible matrix to
               which this character gestures.</p>
            <p> At the same time this matrix is by no means to be identified with the
                  <emph>transcendental</emph> Idea of the Kantian sublime. It is not just that Kant
               still assumes that “the Thing-in-itself, ” or we might say Idea, “exists as something
               positively given beyond the field of representation,” whereas for Hegel the “basic
               dialectical moment of the Sublime” consists in “the notion that the Idea is reached
               through purely negative presentation – that the very inadequacy of the phenomenality
               to the Thing is the only appropriate way to present it” (Žižek, <title level="m"
                  >Sublime Object</title> 205). Kant, as Žižek says, also refused to confront the
               monstrous (<title level="m">Plague of Fantasies</title> 280-1).Thus on the one hand,
               in the wake of the Kantian sublime, Hegel’s location of the sublime in the Symbolic
               associates even the more positive forms of the Symbolic such as the Gothic with
               projects of Reason and freedom. Hence Ginotti’s excursus on materialism (236-8) and
               Zastrozzi’s defiant embrace of an atheism that rises “above the shackles of prejudice
               . . . and injurious superstition” (153). But on the other hand the Kantian sublime
               involves a missed encounter of these projects of Pure Reason with a core of darkness
               that we necessarily confront in characters like Ginotti.<note xml:id="ftn6"

               freedom.</p>
            <p> Yet the Symbolic artist, “toss[ing] about in a thousand forms” and adapting “to the
               meaning sought the shapes that ever remain alien,” does possess a freedom denied to
               the Classical artist, even if this freedom is entwined with necessity (I.438-9).<note
                  xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">For elaboration of this point see
                  Rajan, “Difficult Freedom: Hegel’s Symbolic Art and Schelling’s Historiography in
                     <title level="m">Ages of the World</title> (1815).”</note> For in Symbolic art
               “the spirit . . . shapes itself out of its own resources” (I.362). Its “restless
               fermentation” is the “labour” of the negative, wherein consciousness is still
               “producing its content and making it clear to itself,” rather than resting in ideas
               “already determined for imagination as settled” (I.438-9). Similarly, to adapt
               Shelley in <title level="m">A Defence</title>, the “distorted notions of invisible
               things” in the Gothic are the “mask and the mantle” that conceal a certain “poetry”
               (526). But this very distortion makes aesthetic form the site of a perpetually vital
               struggle between dominant, residual and emergent ideologies: one that calls for a
               symptomatic reading of what Jameson calls “the form of content” and “the content of
               form” (<title level="m">Political Unconscious</title> 99). Other essays in this
               volume also locate in the Gothic a “matrix” that continues to trouble Shelley’s work.
               But the question is whether this matrix, even if it recurs in Shelley’s work, is a
               kind of “vanishing mediator” that serves as a transition out of a particular
               historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent kernel of error at the heart
               of all idealism. And the further question is whether “error,” the word with which
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> concludes (252), simply means “mistake” or
               whether it is, in a pathological and twisted way, also creative.<note xml:id="ftn8"

                  mistakes, which are simply wrong, and error: “the skew of error implies a truth”
                  (92).</note></p>
            <p> In Jerrold Hogle’s essay in this volume this question remains unanswered, or is
               perhaps answered in the form of a “both/and” rather than an “either/or.” In Hogle’s
               previous work, which has been seminal in opening up the seriousness of the genre, the
               post-Walpolean Gothic is the expression of a particular cultural moment that is riven
               by underlying contradictions. Or as he puts it here, it has been “<emph>the</emph>
               fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the culture
               between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced.” But insofar as
               Hogle places these irresolutions within a historical development that in fact does
               resolve them—from feudal to capitalist, Catholic to Protestant, or symbol to
               sign—the Gothic then becomes what Jameson calls a “vanishing mediator.” For Jameson,
               writing on Max Weber, the vanishing mediator is the catalyst that disappears in the
               transition from the residual to the emergent. But if Shelley inherits a “Gothic
               complex” “almost intact” from Walpole and the 1790s Gothic, and if Shelley’s Gothic
               novels are in this sense derivative, does the Gothic “complex” in becoming a “matrix”
               reconstitute the Gothic as the permanent expression of an irresolvable contention and
               ferment in the work of culture, for which Hegel’s Symbolic also provides a name? And
               is this emergence of the Gothic as not simply a complex but also a matrix what
               happens between Shelley’s early Gothic novels and <title level="m">The Triumph of
                  Life</title>? My answer would be in the affirmative. Indeed it is because the
               Gothic becomes a matrix, and not just a complex flattened out by its containment
               within a genre that is its “form-figure,” that the Gothic has become so
               interimbricated with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses
               texts that do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre: texts such as Blake’s
               Lambeth books, Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and <title level="m"
                  >Fleetwood</title>, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Mathilda</title>, and Byron’s
                  <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, and even <title level="m">Adonais</title> as
               discussed by Christopher Bundock in this volume.</p>
            <p> For on the one hand, as Hogle argues, Gothic figures are transitional insofar as
               they are “‘floating signifiers’ separable from their older grounds and thus able to
               signify newer ones.” As a result the “figures ever new” of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> (248), “the material simulacra given off by objects and
               people in Lucretius” (and Baudrillard), are the sedimented traces of past ideologies
               which they render “spectral.” The Gothic mode thus becomes an epistemology for
               diagnosing how the present continues to be haunted by the ghosts or residues of “old
               symbolic orders,” and in this way is part of the work of ideological progress. But on
               the other hand it is precisely this progress that is put in question when Shelley, as
               described by Hogle, recognizes the claims of the old as well as the new:<note
                  xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">Shelley’s interest in Charles I,
                  on whom he wrote a fragmentary play, is also relevant here.</note> hence the
               functioning of these figures not just as “signs” but more archaically as “symbols.” I
               would go farther and suggest that the force of these symbols is not just critical—a
               sense that the new must be mediated through the old if anarchy is not to result<note
                  xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" resp="editors" n="10">I take this to be the gist of
                  Hogle’s comment, in his essay here, that the “looking-backwards-and-forwards
                  simultaneously, like the ‘Janus-faced shadow’ that actually drives Life’s chariot
                  for Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference . . . for keeping at least a
                  ‘shadow of monarchy’ on an ‘otherwise empty chair of state,’ . . . rather than
                  facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually made England (and
                  even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France.” </note>—but also creative. The
               “emptied-out figures” of the procession, Gothicized as “vampire bats” (484), retain,
               in their very decay, a kind of creativity. Thus in the enthusiasm of the procession,
               which includes Plato as well as Caesar and Constantine, “something not yet made good
               pushes its essence forward,” as Habermas says of the utopianism of Ernst Bloch (71).
               This (de)constructive creativity is implicit in the differend between “Shelley” and
               Rousseau over the “figures” cast onto and cast off by the Car of Life. “Shelley”
               disdains to “worship” these idols that fashion projects onto “the world’s false and
               fragile glass.” But Rousseau, even as he acknowledges the relentless consumption of
               the old by the new, insists that the “vitally metaphoric” process of history goes on
               as a mixture of idealism and idolatry: “Figures ever new / Rise on the bubble, paint
               them how you may” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512; <title level="m"
                  >Triumph</title> 243-51).</p>
            <p> Put differently, the cultural work of the Gothic is not limited to the
               demystification of past systems of belief. As Deborah White argues, in the spirit of
               Adorno and Horkheimer’s critique of “enlightenment,” the Romantics’ attitude to
               “superstition” is tied up with the issue of imagination. This is to say not only that
               modernity is itself built on superstitious foundations, but also, as a correlative,
               that literature “cannot surrender the resources of illusion” even if it
               thereby becomes a form of superstition (12, 51). Hence a certain persistence of
               idolatry in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> that resists both “Shelley’s”
               disdain for life, and what White calls the “Enlightenment’s quasi-materialist vision
               of history,” evident in the poem’s relentless serialization of its failed “figures”
               (12). Hence also the way the rationalization of the supernatural in Gothic novels is
               set up <emph>not</emph> to work: a procedure that Shelley strategically if
               impatiently repeats in the emptiness of the formulae that conclude <title level="m"
                  >St. Irvyne</title>. For the Gothic is in fact a shelter for the potentiality of
               superstition and perversion, for the “gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the
               present” (Shelley, <title level="m">Defence</title> 535). </p>
            <p> This restless fermentation of the Idea as superstition is what Hegel tries to access
               through the Symbolic. For the Symbolic is the form taken by what Žižek calls the
               “sublime object of ideology”: as a form of fantasy rather than Coleridgean
               imagination, it projects an Idea but, through its bad and untrue determinacy, allows
               for a “traversal” of the fantasm (<title level="m">Plague</title> 7-11, 97). Of
               course in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hegel dismisses the Symbolic as crude and
               pagan. He prefers the Romantic because its dissonance of matter and spirit is
               Christian and accords with criteria of beauty. Shelley expresses the same historical
               complacency when he claims that the “poetry” of “Chivalry and Christianity . . .
               erase[s]” the “deform[ities]” of earlier social formations (<title level="m"
                  >Defence</title> 518). But the Romantic for Hegel is an alibi for revisiting the
               Symbolic; hence their distinction in terms of a reversed relation in the two between
               the Idea and its embodiment keeps collapsing. </p>
            <p> In the Symbolic, as we will recall, the Idea itself is said to be inadequate, while
               in the Romantic the Idea is complete in itself but external forms are inadequate for
               its purposes. But if the Symbolic warps the forms it takes, is this not because they
               are inadequate, or as Shelley says,because its “distorted notions of invisible
               things” are “the mask and mantle” in which poetry “walk[s] through eternity enveloped
               and disguised” (526)? And if the Romantic cannot find adequate forms, is this not
               because its Idea too is undeveloped? And finally if art needs an “external medium for
               its expression,” is not the Romantic also defective in resisting an “adequate union
               with the external” (Hegel, <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.81)? At issue here
               is the very criterion of “adequacy,” since as Hegel also says "the specific shape
               which every content of the Idea gives” itself “is always adequate to that content”
               (I.300), which means that Symbolic forms too are organic and purposive
               dis-integrations of their content. Unable to resolve these tensions in his idea of
               art, Hegel finally announces the “end of art” (I.602). But rather than conclude that
               there is no future for art, we should see this “end,” as the ex-termination of a term
               exhausted in its current conception. For in conjunction with the forms of art that
               have emerged in the <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, the end of art can also
               serve as a deconstruction that allows us to imagine new configurations of the
               aesthetic.</p>
            <p> But as we think such models, we must also attend to the difference between the
               Symbolic and Romantic. Pinnacled dim in the intense inane, the Romantic artist is the
               beautiful soul whose bad faith Hegel criticizes in the <title level="m">Phenomenology
                  of Spirit</title> (406-7). He is superior to the Symbolic artist because he
               withdraws from existing discourses into the clarity of a free resistance, while the
               latter is at the mercy of contemporary material, his imagination deformed by what it
               cannot form. On the other hand, this withdrawal into Spirit is a form of bad
               infinity. By contrast the Symbolic artist does not refuse mediation, but works on
               content at the material site of forms. This positing and consequently positivity,
               which Hegel also criticizes, often results in a "bad and untrue determinacy" which
               closes off the dissonance of “Idea and shape” (I.76-7). Thus Ginotti,as the schema
               for an Idea with neither “form nor outline,” is given an untrue determinacy by his
               avatar Wolfstein and by his own role in the narrative: a role constricted by the form
               Shelley had available to him, namely Faustian melodrama. And Zastrozzi too, the
               eponymous hero of Shelley’s previous Gothic novel, is conventionalized by the way his
               author has been interpellated into the model of revenge tragedy. Nor is the Gothic as
               a genre unaware of the force of institution, what Jean-Paul Sartre calls the
               “practico-inert,” or the matter in which past praxis is stuck by a “reifying
               sociality” (67, 318). It is this automatized sociality that leads Verezzi to prefer
               Julia to Matilda, even though the Narrator concedes that what he prefers is Julia’s
               “image” (116). Interestingly, the Narrator goes so far as to note “a comparison
               between [Matilda] and Julia” (84); and hence in the next novel, <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, the lovely Megalena quickly deteriorates from being a Julia to
               being a Matilda. Indeed the Gothic insistently marks its conventionalism, its
               badness, as a way of breaking the moulds into which it is forced.</p>
            <p> For Shelley such deformations of “poetry” occur in “periods of the decay of social
               life,” such as the one he describes after the Restoration, when “vice,” “weakness,”
               and “obscenity” take over (<title level="m">Defence</title> 520-1): an account that
               applies equally to the depraved world of Italy and Bohemia in the Gothic novels.
               Symbolic art is just as frequently limited by its bad determinacy as it is expanded
               by an indeterminacy that allows for the development of the idea which Ginotti’s
               dream-vision gestures towards. Yet such determinacy is what Jameson calls a “symbolic
               resolution”: a temporary overriding of contradictions, without which negativity could
               not be invested in the work of history (<title level="m">Political
                  Unconscious</title> 77-80). And it is only through this investment that art
               remains responsible to the cultural unconscious, or to what is left out in its
               attempt to classically domicile the Idea or romantically defer it into the infinite
               future. We see this investment in history in Shelley’s novels. Indeed in <title
                  level="m">The Defence</title> Shelley’s description of the decayed history he
               despises is strikingly Gothic. The “obscenity” of the Restoration, he says, “is a
               monster for which the corruption of society for ever brings forth new food, which it
               devours in secret” (521). And yet this supposed monster recalls the earlier
               description of poetry as “replenishing” imagination “with thoughts of ever new
               delight . . . which form new interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food”
               (517).</p>
            <p>In short, Hegel lets us think a dialectic that circulates imagination between its
               premature hypostasis in the Symbolic, and withdraws it as “spirit” from the concepts
               that limit it so as to think it once more. In its disfiguration of the Romantic Idea
               the Gothic is thus part of the work of the negative, whether as a transitional
               negation of Romanticism’s tendency to settle into aesthetic ideology, or as an
               untransformed potentiality aware of its traumatic core. Conceived on this model, the
                  <emph>work</emph> of art is not form or hypostasis, but “configuration,” “the work
               on form, the deformation of form” as much as its “formation” (Carroll 29, 39). As
               such, even in its positivity it requires what Žižek calls an “anamorphic” reading,
               able to release the underlying negativity of its bad and untrue clichés. In “Kantian
               terms,” as Žižek puts it, such a reading would allow “us to discern an apparently
               positive object as a ‘negative magnitude,’” to see even a character such as Nempere
               or Zastrozzi as the “‘mere positivization of a void’” (<title level="m"
                  >Plague</title> 97).</p>
            <p> In conclusion let me then sketch three versions of the relation between the Romantic
               and its Gothic disfiguration that attempt to deal with the return of the moment of
               Symbolic blockage staged in Shelley’s early Gothic novels: a return more fully
               detailed in other essays in this volume. In <title level="m">Prometheus</title> the
               Gothic is no more than a concessive clause. Shelley grants the Romanticism of an Idea
               that cannot be embodied in existing forms when Prometheus and Asia retire to a cave
               after their marriage, to dwell “Like human babes in their brief innocence”
               (II.iii.33). At the same time the means used to end the Jovian age in the present are
               crudely Gothic. For if Demogorgon is a metaphysical principle or Idea “devoid of
               shape” (Hegel <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.363), in order to act in time he
               becomes Jove’s son. The bad and untrue determinacy of this positing of the negative
               is then reflected in the brutality with which he overthrows Jove: a violence at odds
               with the Promethean reign of peace. Hence Shelley, who as Asia has insisted on
               converting Demogorgon’s cryptic words into a project of Reason and freedom, admits
               that Jove may rise again, offering a variety of “spells” to deal with him (IV.562-9),
               which are no more than what Kant would call rational ideas.</p>
            <p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> Shelley manages to
               segregate the Romantic from its Gothic disfiguration. In fact the Gothicism of Jove’s
               downfall reduces to a cliché the unreadable matrix that the play approaches in the
               figure of Demogorgon. More tangled is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, which
               conflates the Gothic and Romantic. In the opening, the Narrator invokes the Muse of
               the Greater Romantic Lyric, only to speak of himself as a “desperate Alchymist” who
               has made his “bed / In charnels and coffins” (23-5). At the end, having failed to
               make the Poet credible, he ends with a disconnected outburst on the elixir of life
               and the Wandering Jew, describing himself as a “dark magician . . . raking the
               cinders of a crucible” (682-4), and appealing to “Medea’s wondrous alchemy” (672).
               This Gothic self-representation is matched by the Narrator’s lurid figure of the
               Poet, whose “divinest lineaments” are “Worn by the senseless wind” (704-5), as if he
               foresees the body of the Poet, whose grave was “ a pyramid / Of mouldering leaves”
               decaying, his skin and bones blown round and literally caught on the thorns of life
               (53-4). And yet the Poet is also referred to Romantically as a “surpassing Spirit”
               (714), a beautiful soul whose inwardness transcends materiality.</p>
            <p>
               <title level="m">Alastor</title> is Shelley’s autonarration of his unsettled
               relationship to “poetry” as “subjective poetry,” which Browning in his essay on
               Shelley describes as the “<emph>Ideas</emph> of Plato, seeds of creation, lying
               burningly on the Divine Hand” (63-7). Yet the “frail” figure of the Poet (<title
                  level="m">Alastor</title> 687) cannot bear this Romanticization, which has become
               part of the practico-inert. Indeed the Poet seems disconnected from the “image” of
               him that the Narrator constructs (661). For the depopulated global landscape through
               which he moves, the perilous journey he takes in his drunken boat, and the tattered
               scenery of a Nature that Shelley cannot put into a Wordsworthian frame, all point to
               a more modern conception of poetry as sifting through the waste land of culture that
               would emerge later with Rimbaud, Nerval and Baudelaire. <title level="m"
                  >Alastor</title> is thus hysterically split between the Romantic “spirit” of
               poetry, and its de-jection into the Gothic as a “peculiar cultural space into which
               the horrors generated by early modern cultural changes . . . can be ‘thrown under’”
               or abjected, as Jerrold Hogle puts it (178): cast off but also cast into a future
               “crucible” whose void “for ever craves fresh food” (<title level="m">Alastor</title>
               683; <title level="m">Defence</title> 517).</p>
            <p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Alastor</title> the Gothic is more a defacement of
               the Romantic than it is the creative matrix suggested by the word “crucible” (624).
               Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life </title>Shelley’s Gothicism shows
               itself first in the defacement of Rousseau, whom “Shelley” initially encounters in
               the vegetable form of an “old root which grew / To strange distortion” (182-3), and
               then in the disfiguration of the Shape all light, the figure for the dawn of a new
               revolutionary era. It would be easy to see the Shape in the Car as punishing the
               idealism of the Romantic shape, and the poem as demystifying <title level="m"
                  >Prometheus Unbound,</title> where Asia, after her missed encounter with the
               Symbolic matrix of the play in the Cave of Demogorgon, romantically bounds off the
               Chariot of the Hour driven by the spirit with a “dreadful countenance” from the one
               guided by a spirit with the “dove-like eyes of hope” (II.iv.142-62). Returning to
               this scene of the chariots through the Car of Life, Shelley’s last poem unleashes a
               different hour in which the two perspectives on the second coming of the
               world-historical spirit can no longer be separated. Nevertheless the ensuing
               dis-integration releases an energy as powerful as the beauty of the Shape was
               lethargic, for the “crew” dance “like atomies . . . / Within a sunbeam” (444-6),
               while Rousseau “plunge[s]” into the future (467) with a blindness that is the very
               condition for the deconstructive creativity thrown off and around the Car in whose
               disaster he urges “Shelley” to participate as “actor or victim” rather than
               “spectator” (305-6). Shelley describes this “restless fermentation” of “Life” in
               terms of a Symbolic pre-maturity when he compares the Car to “the young moon,” which
               bears “As the herald of its coming . . . / The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim
               form / Bends in dark aether from her infant’s chair” (79-85). In this Gothic
               unfolding of the beautiful simile of the moon, history becomes a “process without a
                  <foreign>telos</foreign> or a subject” (Althusser 91-8). For the dead mother
               shrouds a chair that may be empty, since the lines refer only to the infant’s chair.
               Moreover, she bends “from,” not over, the chair, as if brought down by this second
               coming of an infant power whose advent is or was expected, but whom we do not
               see.</p>
            <p> Yet it is notable how simile follows simile, or how one simulation enfolds another,
               such that “veil after veil [is] undrawn” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 528),
               without any adequate embodiment of a phenomenon that has neither “form nor outline.”
               For like the “sun’s image” reflected in a well, which is then brought into focus and
               perceived as the “shape all light” (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 345-52), the
               young moon contains another figure: the dead mother bending from her infant’s chair.
               This composite simile is then displaced by a further likeness, as the slouching
               mother becomes “the dusky hood and double cape” shrouding a shape that is now
               unnaturally old rather than young: “as one whom years deform” (87-90). “Figures ever
               new” are cast off in the cinematography of the poem (248), which commingles the
               beautiful, the sublime, and the repellent. “Shelley” wants to arrange these figures
               to distinguish various phases of the procession: the Car at the centre, and in front
               the leaders, while an anonymous crowd brings up the rear (101, 131-8). Because the
               core experience for him is the Shape’s disenchantment, “Shelley” also wants to level
               the difference between those who lead and those who follow, dismissing “All but the
               sacred few” as a “deluded crew” (128, 184). He asks himself why “all” is “here amiss”
               and does not hear the irony when a voice answers “Life!” (178-80).</p>
            <p> But the scene is in fact a moving army of differences, metaphors and metonymies. At
               the end the poem is taken over by Bosch-like scenes of “vampire bats” and “vultures”
               sitting on the tiaras of “pontiffs” (484-505), what Shelley in the <title level="m"
                  >Defence</title> describes as the “utter anarchy and darkness” that sometimes
               threaten to engulf poetry (523). But since the manuscript of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> omits quotation marks, we cannot know if this segment
               marks Rousseau’s renunciation of his idealism, or is spoken by the Thel-like
                  “Shelley.”<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">The manuscript
                  does not contain quotation marks, which were added by Mary Shelley so as to create
                  a reading text, and retained by Donald H. Reiman with slight alterations that
                  often have unscrutinized consequences. Thus we do not always know whether to
                  attribute particular lines to Rousseau or “Shelley,” or where the breaks between
                  the lines of the two speakers occur. On this subject see Rajan, <title level="m"
                     >The Supplement of Reading</title> (332-35, 346-48). As regards the infernal
                  vision with which the poem ends, Reiman attributes everything after l. 300 to
                  Rousseau. But one could argue that “Shelley” again becomes the speaker after l.
                  469 (the description of Dante) or after l. 480.</note> Moreover, just as the
               leaders include figures as different as Plato and Caesar, so too the ribald crowd is
               metamorphically imaged through bats and apes, but also “elves / Danc[ing] in a
               thousand unimagined shapes” (490-1). Indeed this last segment is prefaced by a
               reference to Dante and described as “a wonder worthy of his rhyme” (469-80), though
               what follows is hardly wondrous in any conventional sense. The scene, in other words,
               is one of degeneration and entropy, yet harbours a strange vitality. Its logic is not
               Dante’s serial logic of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, but combines all three “in
               the chaos of a cyclic poem” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512), whose “rotary
               motion” is figured in the wheel of the Car and the cyclic form of the poem itself,
               which returns upon and into itself through its folding of figure within figure. In
               this chaos, Shelley can no longer insulate “the form and the splendour of unfaded
               beauty” from “the secrets of anatomy and corruption” (531), nor protect literature
               from a cultural and political debasement that “eats out the poetry” from history so
               as to rethink both poetry and history as a void that forever craves fresh food (515,
               517). Instead he lets down his ladder “into the foul rag and bone shop of the heart”
               (Yeats 391-2), finding the crucible of a disastrous creativity in this space into
               which the horrors of early modern culture have been cast off.</p>
