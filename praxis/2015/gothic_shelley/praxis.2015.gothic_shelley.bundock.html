            <p>Building on Jerrold E. Hogle's thinking about Gothic historiography and Julia Lupton's
               analysis of Renaissance hagiography, this paper explores the Gothic as a reliquary
               of sorts where rejected and outdated forms of historical consciousness persist beyond
               the moment of their ostensible viability. Shelley's <em>Adonais</em> (1821) and <em>The Wandering Jew</em> (1810), I argue, demonstrate how historical thought itself is haunted by elements
               that cannot enter into history proper. In the oscillation between Keats’s preservation
               as celebrity and the <em>Wandering Jew</em>’s violent exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality
               that irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy—one mode of
               Gothic hagiography—supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by what
               was called in the 18th century “the philosophy of history,” remains a theodicy that
               finds in elegy a poetic correlate to hagiography: in this model, all loss, violence,
               or suffering is read as a kind of felix culpa with elegy providing aesthetic compensation
               for trauma. Shelley, however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics in <em>Adonais</em> as the text unveils a materiality that falls outside ideal afterlife. This failed
               translation of the body gains its own corpus, so to speak, in the <em>Wandering Jew</em>. Shelley’s Wandering Jew suffers the discipline—in every sense of that word—of official
               historiography. Bypassing both the Church and the graveyard, the Jew exists as a counter-narrative
               to Christian and secular progressivism—for the “secular” is but the uncanny reiteration
               of Christianity, the continuation of Christian history in the form of its ostensible
               elimination. Living his afterlife perpetually wounded, the Jew collapses progressive
               history by bearing trauma materially out of the past and into the future. But Shelley’s
               Gothic, historical thought does not stop there. Rather, in shifting between the figuration
               of history as ideal (canonical) and as Real (traumatic), Adonais gestures, further,
               toward history's materialization: an action of historicization that cannot be fully
               rationalized by either kind of narrative figuration, or even contained between the
               poles of figuration and disfiguration. While it is indeed uncanny that the past should
               live on—as a negativity—into a future its suppression ostensibly renders possible,
               the root of this relation lies even deeper, in the tissue of historicization itself:
               historicism, in its various narrative forms, aims not to sensitize but to insulate
               consciousness from the “matter” of history.</p>

            </header><br/><p>“It is well known,” Robin Sowerby notes, “that the use of the term 'Gothic' to describe
               the literary phenomenon that began in the later eighteenth century has little, if
               anything, to do with the people from whom it is derived” (15). This is an obvious
               and yet strange pronouncement. For how can a term be “derived” from a source though
               have “little, if anything” to do with that same source? Sowerby is not wrong, though:
               a curious historical fissure divides the Gothic as an identifiable artistic mode popularized
               in the late eighteenth century from the mysterious tribes appearing on the fringes
               of the Roman Empire in the third century—tribes that would invade and overthrow that
               Empire. And yet, if “little, if anything” bridges these iterations of the Gothic,
               it is the tenuousness and also tenacity of the <em>imagined</em> derivation that demands investigation. After all, questions of historical reference,
               of nostalgia, and of the nostalgia of reference have been, as Jerrold E. Hogle argues,
               hallmarks of the neo-Gothic. Understood as a “locus of abjection” (“Counterfeit” 296),
               the Gothic is populated not strictly by misrepresentations, as this term implies an
               anterior and reliable presence, authority, or being that could be properly re-presented
               or even, decisively, presented. Rather, and especially in its Walpolean form, one
               encounters in the Gothic “spectres of counterfeits” (“Counterfeit” 293), such as the
               vampiric self-images Hogle identifies in Shelley's <em>Triumph of Life </em>“to which [Life's slaves] believe they must submit, even though those 'dim forms'
               are actually ghosts of what is dead.” In other words, just as Gothic tropes might
               “serve, on the one hand, as partially empty and nostalgic recollections of older fixed
               statuses [...] and, on the other, as announcements of statuses that were really <em>recoined</em> from older signs of them” (“Counterfeit” 298), so the historical orientation of the
               Gothic is both Epimethian and Promethean: intensely (re)productive though suspended,
               at once, by inherent displacement. The eighteenth-century neo-Gothic thus claims affiliation
               not directly with Classical or medieval history but with “the Renaissance counterfeit
               of the medieval” (“Counterfeit” 298), extending the Gothic into the future through
               an aesthetic and historical hauntology, wherein, like Derrida's revenant, the Gothic's
               historical originality is its unoriginality.</p>
            <p>From an historiographic perspective, the Gothic offers Romantic and modern culture
               a space in which to explore but also contain—through predictable, formulaic gambits—the
               institutional dismemberment and re-articulation often glossed as secularization. Originally
               referencing the expropriation of Church property (Blumenburg 20), secularization constitutes
               a broader historical and narrative pattern that reads modernity's reorganization of
               knowledge as a Frankenstein's Creature composed, so to speak, from the corpses of
               the saints. It is, in other words, a theory of history and a mode of historiography
               wherein modernity represents not the end of spirituality but rather the monstrous
               extension of a religious vitality that has been severed from transcendental guarantees:
               the Holy Ghost becomes Matthew Lewis' bleeding nun. In fact secularization's deeply
               Gothic ambivalence—for it crafts the future from a heap of broken icons—is at the
               heart of Romanticism's attempt to discipline the <span class="foreign">“frühen Neuzeit” </span>(Koselleck 5), the sudden temporalization of history, that emerges in Romanticism's
               recognition that it is, in James Chandler's words, “the age of the spirit of the age—that
               is, the period when the normative status of the period becomes a central and self-conscious
               aspect of historical reflection” (78). The recourse to historiography as a response
               to a new sense of temporal discontinuity motivates, as a compensation, the rise of
               the philosophy of history, itself a kind of aesthetic ideology. Beginning as early
               as Voltaire but reaching its apex in the work of J.G. Herder and G.W.F. Hegel, the
               philosophy of history, rather than merely recording events, takes up the active figuration
               of history according to a rational principle that promises not merely accuracy but
               truth. This attempt at recuperating history as philosophy through hermeneutics stems,
               in other words, from the anxious realization that while the “past may be determining,
               [...] it is also determined, the object of a continuous interpretive activity by which
               we refigure the meaning of our historical position and the possibilities available
               to us. [As such,] [i]f history is a narrative, it is also a counter-narrative of what
               is as yet unrealized in the countless failed or suppressed projects of the past” (Collings
               41). Without the guarantee of something like Herder's <span class="foreign">Humanität</span> or Hegel's cunning of reason that can frame all events—either productive or ostensibly
               counter-productive—as part of a rational theodicy, what is to prevent the counter-narrative
               impulse from unmasking progress as what Walter Benjamin identified as catastrophe
               heaped on catastrophe?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the Romantic turn to history, the Gothic becomes the archive where such counter-narratives
                  are incarcerated but also incarnated, that is, repressed and yet given substantial,
                  bodily form. As Friedrich Schlegel notes, history becomes the discourse best suited
                  to articulate the Romantic thinking of individuality systematically and of systematicity
                  as organic individuality: “is it possible,” he asks, “to characterize anything but
                  individuals? Isn't whatever can't be multiplied after a certain given point just as
                  much a historical entity as something that can no longer be divided? Aren't all systems
                  individuals just as all individuals are systems at least in embryo and tendency? Isn't
                  every real entity historical? Aren’t there individuals who contain within themselves
                  whole systems of individuals?” (51). Indeed, for Schlegel, “[t]here is no self-knowledge
                  except historical self-knowledge” (107). The Gothic is this historical knowledge’s
                  dark double—is the alterity that forms the dialectical ground of “individuality.”
                  As an historical term that references its displacement in and of history, the Gothic
                  performs an historical pseudo-figuration that parallels but suspends the basically
                  Christian narrative of increasing freedom that Hegel, for instance, calls rational
                  history.

            <p>The parodic relationship between the Gothic and Christianity in aesthetic terms offers
               a model for the perverse relationship between Gothic and eschatological historiography.
               Just as the Gothic mode mortifies then inhabits the ruined Roman Catholic Church,
               expropriating not only its buildings, writings, and artworks but—more abstractly—its
               hierarchies, mysteries, and Spirit, so too does it reoccupy hagiography as the method
               for imagining how events become specifically historical. This is not to say that the
               Gothic is merely anti-Catholic, although this is a well-articulated strain in some
               of the most celebrated exponents of the mode. Rather, the Gothic functions as a reliquary
               for those practices, concepts, and histories that seem to be eclipsed by cultural
               revolutions, for systems persisting beyond the moment of their historical viability.
               Echoing and also extending Julia Lupton's argument that “Biblical typology represents
               [in the Renaissance] one of the foundational principles of modern periodization per
               se” (Lupton 23), the Gothic can be read as a gathering point for the negated shapes
               of historical consciousness, for the types that are displaced by their anti-types.
               Erich Auerbach argues that typological signs—like the lives in its biographical counterpart,
               hagiography—do not completely lose their historical validity or meaning when freighted
               with supplementary meaning. In the typological conversion of the Hebrew Bible into
               an Old Testament, the latter text does not, for instance, lose its status as God's
               word. Hence, when Moses' liberation of the Jews from Egyptian captivity and the subsequent
               forty years of wandering is recast as Christ's forty-day temptation in the wilderness
               (Matthew 4:1-11), the Mosaic story retains historical and mythical significance in
               its own terms even as it becomes a prophetic sign; while such an event can be read,
               retroactively, as a prelude or <span class="foreign">figura</span> nevertheless “it remains an event, does not become a mere sign” (Auerbach 196). In
               this way history begins to fold over itself, becoming a tissue of non-identical narratives
               wherein the negated past remains annoyingly active and insistent.</p>
            <p>In Shelley's work we see a double displacement of this sort: Judaism is imperfectly
               absorbed by Christianity and Catholicism is imperfectly absorbed by a modernizing
               Protestantism. Shelley's Gothic reflects this overdetermination of historical forms
               by juxtaposing, overlapping, and blending together these different narratives of spirit
               that, from the perspective of a modern progressivism, ought not to come into contact.
               Given, for instance, the Protestant shift toward a personal relationship with Jesus
               Christ where he takes on the role of sole mediator between human sinfulness and redemption,
               one tends to associate Catholicism with border appeals to saintly intercession, to
               the possibility of conversation between Christians on earth and saints and angels
               in heaven. Yet as early as Henry VIII’s 1536 “Articles devised by the Kynges highnes
               maiestie” where he asserts Christ’s singular, salvational role, Protestant thought
               also praises and promotes worship of the saints. While opinion remained divided through
               the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries, James E. Wellington points out that “veneration
               of the saints and desire for their intercession are by no means the exclusive province
               of Roman Catholic worship” (189). Similarly, Christopher Hill notes that from the
               perspective of radical Protestant, apocalyptic thought “the conversion of the Jews
               and ‘the gathering of the Gentiles’ were necessary before the millennium could arrive”
               (22). This condition leads to a conflicted kind of Judeophilia in times of intensified
               millenarianism—like, for instance, the late eighteenth century. Protestant apocalypticism
               promotes Judaism only because Judaism’s total cancellation occasions Christian transcendence.
               Indeed, the emergence of the millenarian “London Society for Promoting Christianity
               among the Jews” in 1808 locates this essentially perverse relationship between anti-
               and philo-Semitism within the purview of the neo-Gothic. In fact, Shelley's own atheism
               rehearses this pattern of uncanny repudiation, where one rejected or negated formulation
               of spirit lives on, disguised within the reoccupying idea. In his diary Shelley reflects
               on his conversation with Byron and Lewis: <span class="quote">‘We talk of ghosts; neither Lord Byron nor Monk G. Lewis seem to believe in them,
                  and they both agree, in the very face of reason, that none could believe in ghosts
                  without also believing in God. I do not think that all the persons who profess to
                  discredit those visitations really do discredit them, or if they do in the daylight,
                  are not admonished by the approach of loneliness and midnight to think more respectfully
                  of the world of shadows. (in Dowden 2.37–38)’</span> In his turn to the Gothic, Shelley—thanks to an atheism that, like secularization,
               fragments and reorganizes rather than eliminates the ghosts of Spirit—repeats “a religious
               hysteria,” the roots of which “can most accurately be located in the uncanny sectarian
               doubleness at the heart of Christianity itself, that is, in the conflict between Protestantism
               and Catholicism” (Hoeveler 27) and, even more radically, in Christianity's impossible
               elimination of Judaism.</p>
            <p>This context helps to understand the uncanny affiliation between Judaism and Catholicism
               in Shelley and begins to expose the place of the uncanny in the texture of Judeo-Christian
               history, where the past is never really past, never perfectly determined or exhausted.
               Just as secularization's fragmentation and reorganization of the sacred means, ironically,
               that theism functions all the more forcefully at the level of civil society—that the
               dispersal of religious institutions creates a mobile theism that circulates, on the
               commodity model, more widely and more freely than ever—so Walpole's attraction to
               the past on the basis of its supposed “emptiness” promotes, against his claim that
               “the dead have lost their power of deceiving,” the wide cultural and literary recirculation
               of modernity's prehistory (10.192). In Shelley, this recirculation of church property
               begins, innocently enough, as elegy—specifically, his elegy for John Keats. Yet, at
               the height of its recuperative effort, Shelley’s text discloses a materiality outside
               of recuperative figuration. In fact, this materiality goes beyond the indivisible
               remainders of history left over by typology and hagiography. Such materiality had
               been given tentative shape earlier in Shelley’s work as the Wandering Jew—one such
               haunting form of the past. And in <em>Adonais</em>, the wounded body of the Jew—the figure for the undead rather than the immortal—returns
               to interrupt the elegy by repossessing Keats’ corpse and suggesting that Christian
               and specifically Catholic forms of figuration are coextensive with a repressed history
               of disfiguration. Yet, ultimately, history cannot be reduced to a simple opposition
               between symbolization and defacement. Rather, the intensification of this opposition
               gestures toward a more radical moment of pre-historical materiality, to an event that
               can only be implied beyond the types and anti-types of historical representation.</p>
            <p>In the oscillation between Keats’ preservation as celebrity and the Wandering Jew’s
               violent exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality that
               irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy, one mode of Gothic
               hagiography, supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by the philosophy
               of history, remains a theodicy that finds in elegy a poetic correlate to hagiography:
               in this model, all loss, violence, or suffering is read as a kind of <span class="foreign">felix culpa</span> with elegy providing, like hagiography, aesthetic compensation for trauma. Shelley,
               however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics in <em>Adonais</em> as the text unveils a materiality that falls outside ideal afterlife. This failed
               translation of the body gains its own corpus, so to speak, in the Wandering Jew. Like
               C.R. Maturin’s Melmoth, Shelley’s Wandering Jew suffers the discipline, in every sense
               of that word, of official historiography. Bypassing both the Church and the charnel
               house of history, the Jew exists as a counter-narrative to Christian and secular progressivism—for
               the “secular” is but the uncanny reiteration of Christianity, the continuation of
               Christian history in the form of its ostensible elimination. Living his afterlife
               perpetually wounded, the Jew collapses progressive history by bearing trauma materially
               out of the past and into the future. But Shelley’s historical thought does not stop
               there. Rather, in shifting between the figuration of history as ideal (canonical)
               and as Real (traumatic), <em>Adonais</em> gestures, also, toward history's materialization, the action of historicization that
               cannot be fully rationalized by either kind of narrative figuration or even contained
               between the poles of figuration and disfiguration. While it is indeed uncanny that
               the past should live on—as a negativity—into a future its suppression ostensibly renders
               possible, the root of this relation lies even deeper, in the tissue of historicization
               itself: historicism, in its various narrative forms, aims not to sensitize but to
               insulate consciousness from the matter of history.</p>
            <p>According to Earl Wasserman, the remarkable aesthetic coherence of Shelley's <em>Adonais </em>“illumine[s] death” (175) by “translating Keats’ biography into a complex that is
               primarily conceptual” (278), thereby rendering both the work and, effectively, Keats
               entirely available to consciousness. Through Shelley’s “gentle breath” (173), Keats’
               corpse is revived as “Adonais,” the composite figure of the Greek Adonis and the Hebrew
               Adonai (Wasserman 279-80). As with the Christian martyrs there is here an irony, identified
               by James Heffernan, that “Shelley’s celebration of Keats,” his “visionary transformation
               of the pastoral dreamer into a Miltonic genius,” nevertheless “required a poet weak
               enough to have been killed by the words of a reviewer so that he might be resurrected
               by the words of Shelley” (303). Indeed, Shelley repurposes Keats’ own Grecian urn:
               through his careful incorporation of elements from Keats’ poetry—nightingales and
               basil pots, among other things—Shelley rewrites Keats’ symbol of poetry as the “lucid
               urn of starry dew” in which “quick Dreams,” disconsolate, “Washed [Keats’] light limbs
               as if embalming them” (91,73, 92). True to the promise of his Platonic epigraph to
               give “New splendour to the dead,” Shelley’s poetic lucidity preserves Adonais, “like
               a star” (494), among “The splendours of the firmament of time” (388)—the latter a
               line Michael O'Neill identifies as containing “an image for the canon” (52). Shelley,
               then, is strangely complicit with the murder that then enables him to re-present Keats
               poetically and historically.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Joel Faflak notes, “the most overlooked and yet obvious Gothic feature of the text
                  is the rotting corpse of Adonais at the centre of its <span class="foreign">mise-en-scene</span>. One misses the corpse because of its obviousness, like Lacan's purloined letter,
                  except in this case the object itself is uncanny” (n. Pag). But Shelley's text not
                  only conceals Keats’ remains at the heart of its aestheticizing activity; the poetry,
                  in addition, infuses life as such with creeping mortification. Figured as an awakening,
                  Keats, as Adonais, takes life with him into the nether-realm, rendering corporeal
                  existence into perpetual decomposition such that death becomes the only state of authentic
                  being:

                  play, a dream, whereas the grave, through hope’s interment, becomes, as in Blake’s <em>Book of Thel</em>, disturbingly animated.

                           on several occasions that, in the months leading up to his composition of Adonais,
                           he is rapidly consuming the works of Calderón, calling him, in a letter to Peacock
                           in August, 1819, “a kind of Shakespeare” (2.115). In a footnote to his draft of Adonais
                           Shelley names Calderón among an expanded pantheon of literary greats (O'Neill 52).</span></div>
                  </div> If death reigns over life, Adonais feeds on death’s (im)mortality: “He lives, he wakes—'tis

            </div>
            <p>Part of death’s attractiveness in <em>Adonais</em> stems from Shelley’s uncanny, pre-emptive commingling of aesthetic pleasure with
               Keats’ gravesite. In a letter to Peacock in December, 1818, Shelley describes the
               Protestant cemetery in Rome—the future gravesite not only of Keats but, only a few
               months later, young William Shelley and, ultimately, Percy himself—as “the most beautiful
               &amp; solemn cemetery” he had ever encountered: <span class="quote">‘To see the sun shining on its bright grass fresh when we visited it with the autumnal
                  dews, &amp; hear the whispering of the wind among the leaves of the trees which have overgrown
                  the tomb of Cestius, &amp; the coil which is stirring in the sunwarm earth &amp; to mark the
                  tombs mostly of women &amp; young people who were buried there, one might, if one were
                  to die, desire the sleep they seem to sleep. Such is the human mind &amp; so it peoples
                  with its wishes vacancy &amp; oblivion. (60)’</span> Months later, Shelley recalls the atmosphere of this excursion, describing Keats
               in Death’s “pale court” reclining “as if in dewy sleep” (56, 61). Read proleptically,
               Shelley’s letter diagnoses <em>Adonais</em> as the product of an inversion of life and death that confuses metaphysical comfort
               with depression. At first glance, Shelley seems to enjoy imagining himself included
               among the spirits in this lovely garden and appears to sanction the imaginative fecundity
               that helps the mind overcome “vacancy &amp; oblivion.” This reversal, however, where thought
               and life appear to be activated after death, is suspended by a series of qualifications.
               The desire named is, for instance, bracketed not once by twice by hypothetical turns
               of phrase—“one <em>might</em>, <em>if</em> one were to die...” Such rhetorical hedging casts its shadow across the ostensible
               desire for the “sleep they seem to sleep.” For what precisely is the object of desire
               here? Does the stress in the penultimate line fall on “sleep” or “seem”? Does Shelley
               find attractive “seeming sleep” taken as peaceful death or “seeming sleep” taken as
               secret (re)animation? Even the final line is reversible: while it appears that “vacancy
               &amp; oblivion” name the setting that is populated by the mind’s lively “wishes,” Shelley’s
               awkward syntax allows one to read “vacancy &amp; oblivion” <em>as</em> the “wishes” themselves.</p>
            <p>The complex relationships in <em>Adonais</em> among desire, death, and afterlife can be clarified by looking at how Shelley appropriates
               existing historical aesthetics. In <em>The Afterlife of the Saints</em>, Julia Lupton describes the complex symbolic economy of Christian hagiography in
               terms that prove germane to a reading of Romantic elegy broadly and Shelley's text
               specifically. Hagiography—literally, “sacred writing”—translates death into sainthood,
               offering the martyr a symbolic afterlife in the official calendars and canons of the
               Church. This system rehearses typological and figural hermeneutic practices that can
               be traced back at least as far as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas—practices
               that attempt to redeem Christianity’s Classical and Hebrew past by figuring that past,
               retroactively, as the anticipation of the New Testament’s fulfilment. Christian biography,
               then, is related to a form of mortification as the very mechanism of symbolization
               and historical legitimation.</p>
            <p>For Lupton, Christian historiography is based on the symbolic structure of martyrdom
               dramatized in exemplary fashion by Christ: his crucifixion and burial marks the negative
               moment in the transition from the flesh to the spirit, man to God, pagan to Christian
               history, Old to New Testament. That is, hagiography illustrates the perverse relationship
               between symbolization and violence, where the mundane and ephemeral gains historical
               and indeed spiritual promotion through sublime dismemberment. Hence, martyrdom becomes
               a kind of trope, something that mediates between the past and “the <span class="foreign">Nachleben der Antike</span>” (Lupton 5), just as hagiography, at the level of subjective biography, mediates
               between anonymity and sainthood. Crucially, in each case this formula acts as a way
               to recuperate negation—to put death to work, dialectically. For, if the martyr is
               always finally decapitated, this “loss of the head is not simply one dismemberment
               among others in a potentially infinite metonymic chain, but rather a symbolic recomposition
               of bodily fragments into a subjectivity gathered up by its very cancellation” (Lupton
               53).</p>
            <p>Shelley’s inversion of life and death in <em>Adonais</em> complicates this final, decisive stroke—a stroke that would accomplish Keats’ cultural
               and aesthetic recomposition. It is not merely that Keats joins Chatterton, Sidney,
               and Lucan, “and many more, whose names on Earth are dark/ But whose transmitted effluence
               cannot die” (406-7). For, the kind of beneficent illumination these figures cast merely
               stains the insane purity Shelley attributes to his fallen Hyperion: </p>

            <p> It is as if his very living on as a martyr—as a tragic, historical figure—would,
               for Shelley, hamper Keats’ transcendence. Rather than fusing him into the dome of
               glass, then, Shelley's text presents figuration—mere phenomenalization as giving cognizable
               form to images—as denigration: “stained” glass, indeed. Anticipating the paradoxical
               “shape all light” in the <em>Triumph of Life</em>, the apex of elegiac recuperation outstrips all aesthetic or intellectual comprehension,
               such that perfect redemption must coincide with imagination’s self-cancellation. The
               shattered dome thus gestures toward a transcendence that exceeds the comprehension
               of afterlife in reverential terms, which is perhaps why the text can describe the
               speaker’s “ensanguined brow,” in an irreverent pairing, as one “Which was like Cain’s
               or Christ’s” (305, 306). <em>Adonais</em>, then, aspires—or perhaps “expires”—to an existence neither entirely corporeal nor
               entirely spiritual. But, then, what is afterlife?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If hagiography is the rhetorical archetype of the kind of historical and subjective
                  recuperation continuous with secular, “enlightened” historiography, what is the significance
                  of the conflicting, Gothic obsession with the undead? Unnatural, physical reanimation
                  offers form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is excluded from official
                  accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology. Whether the vampire, Frankenstein’s
                  Creature, or the Wandering Jew, such monsters live on perpetually but only because
                  they are <em>denied</em> complete entry into prevailing symbolic systems, whether legal, moral, political or,
                  ultimately, historical. Ironically, the absence of the final, deadly stroke that crystallizes
                  and illuminates the saints’ en-graving in the official canon of the Church generates
                  a wounded, Byronic exile who similarly lives beyond death but does so in terrifyingly
                  physical, organic terms.

                  </div> As the extension of but also counterpoint to <em>Adonais</em>’ formal coherence, the text gestures toward a form of monstrous afterlife that recurs

            </div>
            <p>The Wandering Jew appears across a wide range of Shelley’s works. According to the
               Medieval folkloric tradition, the Wandering Jew is cursed to roam the earth until
               the Second Coming for denying Jesus respite during the Passion. Echoing the story
               of Cain, God marks the Jew on the face. This disfigured figure thus plays a complex
               role in Shelley’s thinking on history, writing, and afterlife. For if the Jew’s body
               bears God’s wounding mark then he becomes in effect the sign of God—something like
               Blake’s “Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression” (<em>Milton</em> 49.15). Shelley’s Jew, forced—in Mathew Arnold’s germane phrase—to wander “between
               two worlds, one dead,/ The other powerless to be born,” seems literally to embody
               the meeting point between the mundane and the sacred, the letter and the spirit. In
               other words, he stands in a position similar to the Christian martyr. Yet, since he
               is denied corporeal finitude he is denied entry into hagiography’s symbolizing system,
               the same system that produces authorized history. In the final analysis, the Jew “marks”
               the irreconcilable distance between the “two worlds of life and death” (<em>Prometheus </em>1.195) because he is, strictly speaking, denied access to <em>both</em>.</p>
            <p>While the Jew’s life is exactly coextensive with Christian history, he lives as a
               counterhistory to the ideology of progress and even as a countertrope to the logic
               of Christian hermeneutic and typological synthesis. For he reveals in his own flesh,
               to adapt Benjamin’s famous phrase, that “there is no document of civilization which
               is not at the same time a document of barbarism” (<em>Illuminations </em>256); through the Jew, Shelley finds a powerful emblem for the tyranny, violence,
               and regression within ostensible progress. In fact, in <em>The Wandering Jew</em>, the protagonist, Paulo, is unable to narrate his own story: while he represents
               the quilting point between autobiography and universal history, the Jew, here, suffers
               from a remarkable narrative aphasia. If the Wandering Jew is supposed literally to
               embody divine writing, if his wandering is a performance of <em>meta-phora</em> incarnate, he, at the same time, walks toward the indefinite future “to-come” intimated
               also in Shelley's lyrical drama, <em>Hellas</em>. Despite the attempt to make metaphor suddenly literal through the Jew’s body, the
               endlessness of his wandering generates a halting, episodic, and fractured autobiography.</p>
            <p>For instance, Paulo initially makes claims for a superior kind of vision, characteristic
               of conventional expectations concerning the prophetic “seers” with which he is aligned:

            <p> This power—echoed in similar language by Ahasuerus in <em>Hellas</em>—is suspended, however, by Paulo’s difficulty in facing his own history when he attempts

            <p> This is an acute instantiation of what Paul de Man has called autobiography as defacement.
               Paulo cannot articulate his own history because that history is literally the history
               of his own defacement, which means in a figurative and reflexive register the history
               of his <em>exclusion from</em> available forms of symbolic and narrative coherence. Biography, autobiography, and
               even elegy of the sort attempted in <em>Adonais</em> would only misrepresent the Jew’s relationship to history since narrative organization—with
               the implicit divisions into beginning, middle, and end—precisely cannot apply to the
               cursed peripatetic.</p>
            <p><em>The Wandering Jew</em> dramatizes these two different relationships to historical figuration in a moment
               Blake would call a “minute particular.” Early in the poem, Paulo rescues a young novice,
               named Rosa, from a convent in Padua. The text suggests that Rosa is about to be punished
               by a brutal Abbess for indiscretions that remain, for the reader, obscure. The language
               and imagery in the scene suggests, in fact, that we are on the verge of witnessing
               human sacrifice. Rosa, “fainting” (1.147), is borne to “the fatal shrine” (1.183)
               by a group of nuns amidst a crowd whose “confused and open clamors” (1.176) suggest
               strong though impotent opposition to the proceedings. Given her name, it is additionally
               unfortunate that “The roses from [Rosa’s] cheek are fled/ But there the lily reigns
               instead” (1.148-149) and that she should be carried over a path of “fresh roses strew[n]
               upon the ground” (1.163). Paulo, observing the scene, witnesses Rosa’s sudden dash
               for the doors and, quickly navigating the crowd, manages to intercept her and carry
               her off just as she loses consciousness. In escaping from the Abbess, Rosa does more
               than simply preserve her corporeal life, though. More importantly, she flees from
               a site where the light of the Absolute is, literally, mediated by saints printed on
               the windows. She seems, in other words, to have lost any possibility of saintly promotion
               and concomitant historical legitimacy. And yet, describing the gloomy atmosphere inside
               the church, the speaker notices how the stain-glass windows, the “saint-cipher’d panes”
               (1.91), seem to distort the light they also transmit. These windows “tinged the pillars
               with varied stains” (1.93), anticipating the description, later, of Paulo’s own eye,
               his “chilling gaze” that “shot a lurid gleam of light” (1.240, 1.242). This stained
               and lurid light counterpoints the glorious illumination of the image of the saint
               in the window, suggesting that the distance between Paulo, whose “burning fillet blazed
               with blood” (2.204), and saintly incandescence might be read not as the failure of
               spiritual promotion but as life’s rescue from Catholicism’s cult of death—a Gothic
               caricature of Catholic extravagance familiar from Radcliffe and Lewis, among others.</p>
            <p>Paulo’s exclusion from various symbolic systems that translate finitude into spiritual
               afterlife through precise violence emerges in this episode in terms of how light is,
               on one hand, illuminating while, on the other, distorting. This casts the claims to
               historical and moral legitimacy made by the Church into shadow. For as the scene of
               near sacrifice suggests, the symbolic economy of hagiography, if instrumentalized,
               looks very much like a regression to precisely those pagan practices Judaism and Christianity
               alike aim to transcend. Such claims will, however, always be difficult to make if
               mundane life is entirely subordinated to afterlife—whether spiritual, aesthetic, historical,
               or some combination of the three. Indeed, Shelley exposes the persistence of this
               subordination by erasing Rosa from history through a kind of anti-hagiography. When
               Rosa chooses to flee from sacrifice and join company with Paulo, she forfeits participation
               both in Christian transcendence and official history. Shelley makes this clear through
               a dramatic caesura in the Fourth Canto of his poem. Rosa accidentally takes a fatal
               dose of poison. Shelley, however, does not narrate this moment with the kind of close
               detail characteristic of popular Christian hagiographic compendiums, like Jacobus
               de Voragine’s <em>The Golden Legend</em>. There is, rather, a sudden disconnect in the poem, as the speaker turns his attention
               to the calm summer night and then sings, allusively, about decaying flowers. In other
               words, Rosa’s exile by proxy means that, in representational terms, her death is incorporated
               into—or perhaps “incarcerated by”—a different metaphorical code. While her death cannot
               enter into the Church’s official history, it is written on or as nature, as if Classical
               myth displaces Christian transcendence—as if death, like the Wandering Jew’s monstrous
               life, remains disturbingly corporeal and present.</p>
            <p>In a sense, then, Paulo and Rosa return the concept of hagiography to its specifically
               Hebrew application as a description of the twelve books that form the final third
               of the Hebrew Bible. Many of the texts in this section are reclassified as “historical
               books” in the Christian redistribution of the Hebrew Bible into an Old Testament.
               By returning “sacred writing” to mundane history through his physical scaring that
               subtlety re-codes hagiography, Shelley’s Wandering Jew suspends Christian transcendence
               and apocalyptic historiography. With the opacity of a life resistant to the “redemption”
               of symbolization, Paulo’s history preemptively collapses Shelley’s key simile in <em>Adonais</em>: if “Life,” figured as </p>

            <p> <em>The Wandering Jew</em> then suggests that such a conception of life and death is, in fact, a product of
               the peculiar optics of the Christian Church. The illumination of life in this image
               suggests that <em>living</em> and sanctified <em>afterlife</em> uncannily overlap. The murder that, in <em>The Wandering Jew</em>, Rosa could escape has, in <em>Adonais</em>, already taken place: the rites have been performed and the oblation made. And yet,
               <em>Adonais</em> opens a way to the materiality that seems to have been veiled by its elegiac illumination.
               Moving from the image of the fractured dome backward in the text of <em>Adonais</em>, there is evidence that this collapse is imminent, as Shelley's lucidity frequently
               verges on translucence, turning instances of possible revelation—not through privation
               but, rather, their intensification—into sites of blindness.</p>

            <p> motivates the beautiful, harmonious shape the text of <em>Adonais</em> takes. Poetry, even in its most melancholy instances, offers emotional, sensual,
               or intellectual recompense. And yet, that pleasure betrays the sorrow of elegy. As
               such, Shelley presents “Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam/ Of her own dying
               smile instead of eyes” (114-15). Loath to acknowledge the vampiric economy wherein
               elegy, “like flowers that mock the corse beneath” (17), translates grief into beauty,
               pleasure’s personification becomes vaguely Oedipal and attempts to circumvent its
               own activity through self-blinding. Pleasure’s attraction to Adonais and, reflexively,
               its contribution to the poem’s composition, is intensified only through its simultaneous
               limitation. “Led” on by a “<em>dying</em> smile,” Pleasure’s pursuit (of herself) follows only as closely as the <em>fading</em> of that same pleasure will permit, will extended only according to an economy of
               diminishing returns.</p>
            <p>Not only does the text’s vision tend toward blindness but it gestures toward a more
               radical negativity, one outside the opposition of the visible and invisible. This
               is clearest where the poem approaches not merely invisibility but the unconscious.
               Consciousness, the power of intellectual enlightenment, interrupts radical transcendence
               by reducing the blinding brightness of the Eternal to the conditional terms of the
               understanding. Hence, consciousness becomes most acute and sensitive to “his mute
               voice” (27) as it approaches the abyss of unthought. </p>

            <p> Shelley's thought and language here short-circuits. At first, “Nought we know, dies”
               seems to say “nothing we know can die,” that, once elevated to the life of the mind,
               the passing world escapes death, effectively extending the sentiment from the immediately
               preceding lines where poetry “chang'd to fragrance” the “leprous corpse” (175, 172).
               But Shelley hesitates. The comma between “know” and “dies” interrupts any simple continuity
               between terms, as if Shelley approaches but then withdraws from thought and art's
               claims to ideal and sensuous preservation. The whole passage, in fact, checks itself,
               the speaker inhaling while the dead body “Exhales itself in flowers” (173). For the
               positivity implied within the rhetorical question—that, no, “that alone which knows”
               <em>will</em> fend off destruction—is extremely tenuous. The speaker seems, in short, to lose confidence
               in his own reassuring arguments in the very process of making those arguments. Read
               in light of the subsequent lines, it becomes possible, ultimately, nearly to invert
               the apparent meaning of “nought we know, dies,” to gloss it as “we can know nothing
               but that which dies.” This reading reorients the passage in ways that reveals continuity
               with the recognition, by the stanza’s end, that the mind that understands this sad
               fact of epistemology dies too. Yet, the mind does not <em>comprehend</em> its eventual loss of comprehension so much as intuit, as thought’s doppelganger,
               a negativity that is coextensive with consciousness. As if reflecting on the subtle
               powers of the fading coal of the mind in creation, human thought can be grasped only
               by a consciousness in the process of extinguishing itself. The mind can only know
               death if understanding is already, in that apprehension, dying, fading. For only a
               finite mind could be capable of understanding the pain of finitude. God could only
               know death and the grief of loss through human frailty—which is precisely why He had
               to create the world and then populate it with imperfect beings. Weakness, then, is
               strangely coextensive with <em>Adonais</em>’ aesthetic figuration. Keats is not fully recuperated but only temporarily revived
               in order to replay the process of losing, in order to dissipate the image the text
               is always on the verge of shaping.</p>
            <p>R.F. Leavis famously objects that in Shelley's poetry “there is nothing to be grasped
               [...]—no object offered for contemplation, no realized presence to persuade or move
               us by what it is” (210). For Leavis, reading “Ode to the West Wind,” this disagreeable
               instability is a result of Shelley's shifting, impatient imagery. <em>Adonais</em> has a similar effect but for different reasons: it is not the imagery but the apprehending
               consciousness itself that begins to lose its moorings. Destroying the coloured dome
               in what looks like an act of fanaticism means cancelling all figuration and consciousness,
               eliminating all categories of thought and rejecting the mediation necessary for knowledge.
               It is as if the senses and the understanding have become impediments rather than aids
               to perception—or rather, that perception itself is a diminishment of the surpassing
               brilliance that can only be indicated by its hostility to the mind. This eliminates
               both hagiographic sublation and monstrous protraction as ways of understanding history's
               (de)formation. Like a candle lost in the daylight, these historiographical models
               become inadequate not for any internal shortcomings but because understanding as such
               has, strangely, become a barrier to adequate expression: something about Keats exceeds
               both the figuration and disfiguration of his historical afterlife. So while the Jew
               offers a precedent for <em>Adonais</em>’ own unwriting of aesthetic history, even this figure cannot symbolize the sheer
               givenness of history as event or happening.</p>
            <p>In the instant of aesthetic and cognitive collapse, before elegiac mourning is recast
               and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity, Shelley's <em>Adonais</em> comes close to a material vision of history, that is, an apprehension of history
               as an activity that always exceeds its (dis)figuration. History in Shelley is not
               reducible to either narrative or counter-narrative, as it also includes the <em>act</em> of historicizing. As what enables but eludes mediation, this action cannot be understood
               by the histories it frames, nor can it be confused with history “in itself” as something
               objectively present. Instead, material history would be history severed from any narrative
               form, a sheer happening that is, at root, senseless—like a death, a gift, or even
               the gift of death. In this precise context, it is the gift of Keats’ death that is
               a donation, something purely given, and coded in the overdetermined proper name: Adonis,
               Adonai, <span class="foreign">á donner</span>. This happening eludes Shelley's narrative containment—something begun from the instant
               Shelley mythologizes Keats' death as murder. Yet, the text's interruption of its own
               figures of understanding—light, consciousness—suggests that this gift's madness mars
               the poem's formal beauty. Just as one might respond to Leavis that the slippage among
               images in Shelley's “Ode” successfully performs the urgency and turbulence of the
               air—that to provide consciousness with an <em>object</em> would be to miss the point—so the collapse of the coloured dome hints at a power
               that cannot be rendered completely intelligible even in art.</p>
            <p>The matter of historical materiality here has to be taken in Judith Butler's sense
               as a process of “mattering” or coming into existence. The materiality of history is
               how history matters; materialization is the senseless action anterior to the meaning
               ascribed to that action by one historical paradigm or another. Shelley's late drama,
               <em>Hellas</em>, suggests one way in which such mattering makes an impression before disappearing
               into concepts of the understanding. The play abandons its organization to the unpredictable
               events immediately contemporary to Shelley, namely, the Greek revolt that erupts in
               March, 1821, against Turkish occupation. The action is framed as three scenes, book-ended
               and separated by visionary interludes, wherein Mahmud, the Turkish ruler residing
               in Constantinople, hosts various messengers who bring him news concerning the Turkish
               response to the Greek uprising. Shelley, however, does not simply borrow this Aeschylean
               technique as a plot formula; for Shelley, too, awaits updates, adjusting his text
               in response to the contingencies of the Rebellion in a display of what he calls, in
               the Preface, “newspaper erudition” (429). In other words, this text hovers over the
               moment of historical materialization, the moment of conversion or encoding where the
               senselessness of the unpredictable happening—something that precedes understanding—is
               made sensible, is made available for “proper history.” So, whereas “the strategies
               of historicism [...] evade the problematic and programming of inscription,” Shelley's
               text nevertheless manages to indicate the action “which precedes and partakes of the
               very mnemotechnic site of archival politics out of which the categories of politics,
               the human, and the aesthetic appear organized” (Cohen xi).</p>
            <p>Like consciousness itself, historical representation seems always and instantly to
               appropriate materiality, turning gifts—the sheer givenness of events—into deficits
               that have to be paid for through narrative explanation. This is also the danger in
               <em>Adonais</em>—that Keats may become a mere trope, that something as uncountable as (his) death
               might be put to work in the interest of Shelley's own vendettas against English bards
               and Scotch reviewers. Indeed, it is a danger inherent to the elegy as such, though
               often restricted to an affective complication rather than taken in broader historical,
               representational terms. “Where there is leisure for fiction, there is little grief”
               (1.163), remarks Samuel Johnson in reference to Milton's <em>Lycidas</em>; the elegy, as an effort to mourn loss, appropriates and then aims to eliminate sadness—or
               at least anaesthetize consciousness temporarily. As Gregory Nagy describes, elegy
               is founded on a conflicting gesture: “despite its claim to be a form of men's lament,
               elegy can simultaneously make a counter-claim: that it is also an antidote for the
               grief and suffering of lament” (39). And yet the elegy is often, as in <em>Adonais</em>, reflexive enough to question its own status as antidote. Indeed, the kind of Gothic
               counter-narratives to Christian history that traverse Shelley's <span class="foreign">oeuvre</span> can be identified precisely within Shelley's elegy, suggesting that the Gothic organizes
               the negativity of elegiac self-reflexivity. For the aforementioned “ensanguin'd brow
               / Which was like Cain's or Christ's” (305-6) describes Shelley's self-figuration in
               the poem, identifying the voice of elegiac lament with none other than the Wandering
               Jew. In uttering elegy in the Gothic tongue, <em>Adonais </em>sharpens the contradiction between the forms of historical afterlife developed within
               each genre. One consequence of this is that the text becomes increasingly aware that
               death remains misapprehended in <em>both</em> genres—not for any fault of the genres but because death, the material event par
               excellence, is necessarily misapprehend <em>by</em> proper understanding.</p>
            <p>In an almost masochistic effort to expose its own internal conflicts, <em>Adonais</em> repeatedly attempts to treat death as an attribute. This treatment is necessary in
               order to preserve the consoling though suicidal desire to “hasten thither” and “No
               more let Life divide what Death can join together” (476-7). Such confusion is also
               behind the ostensibly comforting notion that what is beyond all deterioration—“from
               the contagion of the world's slow stain/ He is secure” (356-7)—is precisely that which
               is already deteriorated, just as “the past are all that cannot pass away” (432). Existence,
               however, is not an attribute; it is, rather, substantial, fundamental. Unlike quantities,
               qualities, modalities, relations or other modifications of being, existence's removal
               would negate the subject as such. In other words, death cannot join together nor can
               it preserve in any conventional sense, since <em>what</em> it would join together or preserve loses, at death, its being. “What Adonais is,
               why fear we to become?” (459). Such a line of thought is possible only if death, as
               non-being, has been confused with a way of being. For what the poem, in its relentless
               self-effacement of understanding, perception, and beautiful figuration, insists on
               is that what Keats <em>is</em> is, precisely, <em>not</em>. In fact, the first line of Shelley's elegy, “I weep for Adonais—he is dead!”—itself
               a kind of paraphrase of the genre—is deeply misleading, metaphysically speaking: death
               is the “state of being” in which one ceases to be in any state whatever, such that
               the verb “to be” becomes entirely hypothetical. At the moment of its most assertive
               declarations, of its most compelling presentation of objects, the poem is thus suspended
               by an implicit “as if.”</p>
            <p>Shelley seems to sense this conflict. For while it is a common enough—indeed, inevitable—error
               to think of death as a way of being, he stresses this error by characterizing death
               explicitly as an excrescence and stressing the hypothetical nature of this construction:
               “Now thou art dead, as if it were a part / Of thee, my Adonais!” (231-2). Death here
               has been added—though tentatively, as a kind of experiment—to a name that somehow
               persists beyond the logic of being and nothingness, as if Keats, as Adonais, is even
               more substantial, as if he is what he was, and now he is that <em>and more</em>—that is, dead. In this the text offers an alternative reading of Shelley's conclusion
               of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: </p>

            <p> In the context of the Prometheian Age, Shelley’s conception of hope suggests irrepressible
               vitality and optimism, that out of not only the loss of concrete objects but its own
               negation hope can manage to perpetuate and even strengthen itself. In <em>Adonais</em>, however, hope becomes a trap. “Keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink/ When
               hope has kindled hope, and lur'd thee to the brink,” warns the speaker (422-3). Just
               as the rhythm of power’s diminishment across the text of <em>Adonais</em> makes possible a kind of affective and historiographical synchronization, one where
               loss is registered through the repetition of losing rather than the production of
               an image—effectively, the recuperation of loss as another form—so is <em>Adonais</em> aware of the sentimentalism it, as elegy, participates in. Given this awareness,
               the persistence rather than dissolution of the sentimental means that the text performs
               itself as sentimental—that is, like Walepole’s Gothic, Shelley’s text wears its own
               genre like a mask and then advertises this dissimulation. Such a performance is not
               exactly ironic but interested in producing a specific trajectory of consciousness:
               where <em>Prometheus</em> (re)produces hope, <em>Adonais</em> (re)produces the wreck. Keats's death is the thing Shelley contemplates and it is
               precisely hope, positivity and production, that he is aware his elegy must, in some
               way, keep its distance from. The Gothic interruption of luminous figuration and its
               subtle indication of a materiality that is deeply historical and yet outside historiography
               is not, therefore, pessimistic. Rather, when Shelley displaces sentimentality through
               a reflexive performance of the sentimental he also frees Keats, in part, from his
               figuration as the naive poet—that is, he frees him from his characterization as the
               lost object that, as Schiller argues, gives the sentimental shape of thought its nostalgic
               impulse. Keats has become death, has his being as dead, and exists as the inexistent.
               With an insane fidelity to the gift of death, Shelley would break his mind and his
               poem in the effort to say this logical impasse, to make splendid the impossibility
               of this gift's perfect return as art, knowledge, pleasure, or even history.</p>
