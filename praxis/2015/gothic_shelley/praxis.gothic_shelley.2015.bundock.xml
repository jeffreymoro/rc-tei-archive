            <p rend="noCount">Building on Jerrold E. Hogle's thinking about Gothic historiography
               and Julia Lupton's analysis of Renaissance hagiography, this paper explores the
               Gothic as a reliquary of sorts where rejected and outdated forms of historical
               consciousness persist beyond the moment of their ostensible viability. Shelley's
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title> (1821) and <title level="m">The Wandering
                  Jew</title> (1810), I argue, demonstrate how historical thought itself is haunted
               by elements that cannot enter into history proper. In the oscillation between Keats’s
               preservation as celebrity and the <title level="m">Wandering Jew</title>’s violent
               exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality that
               irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy—one mode of Gothic
               hagiography—supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by what was
               called in the 18th century “the philosophy of history,” remains a theodicy that finds
               in elegy a poetic correlate to hagiography: in this model, all loss, violence, or
               suffering is read as a kind of felix culpa with elegy providing aesthetic
               compensation for trauma. Shelley, however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics
               in <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the text unveils a materiality that falls
               outside ideal afterlife. This failed translation of the body gains its own corpus, so
               to speak, in the <title level="m">Wandering Jew</title>. Shelley’s Wandering Jew
               suffers the discipline—in every sense of that word—of official historiography.
               Bypassing both the Church and the graveyard, the Jew exists as a counter-narrative to
               Christian and secular progressivism—for the “secular” is but the uncanny reiteration
               of Christianity, the continuation of Christian history in the form of its ostensible
               elimination. Living his afterlife perpetually wounded, the Jew collapses progressive
               history by bearing trauma materially out of the past and into the future. But
               Shelley’s Gothic, historical thought does not stop there. Rather, in shifting between
               the figuration of history as ideal (canonical) and as Real (traumatic), Adonais
               gestures, further, toward history's materialization: an action of historicization
               that cannot be fully rationalized by either kind of narrative figuration, or even
               contained between the poles of figuration and disfiguration. While it is indeed
               uncanny that the past should live on—as a negativity—into a future its suppression
               ostensibly renders possible, the root of this relation lies even deeper, in the
               tissue of historicization itself: historicism, in its various narrative forms, aims
               not to sensitize but to insulate consciousness from the “matter” of history.</p>

            <p>“It is well known,” Robin Sowerby notes, “that the use of the term 'Gothic' to
               describe the literary phenomenon that began in the later eighteenth century has
               little, if anything, to do with the people from whom it is derived” (15). This is an
               obvious and yet strange pronouncement. For how can a term be “derived” from a source
               though have “little, if anything” to do with that same source? Sowerby is not wrong,
               though: a curious historical fissure divides the Gothic as an identifiable artistic
               mode popularized in the late eighteenth century from the mysterious tribes appearing
               on the fringes of the Roman Empire in the third century—tribes that would invade and
               overthrow that Empire. And yet, if “little, if anything” bridges these iterations of
               the Gothic, it is the tenuousness and also tenacity of the <emph>imagined</emph>
               derivation that demands investigation. After all, questions of historical reference,
               of nostalgia, and of the nostalgia of reference have been, as Jerrold E. Hogle
               argues, hallmarks of the neo-Gothic. Understood as a “locus of abjection”
               (“Counterfeit” 296), the Gothic is populated not strictly by misrepresentations, as
               this term implies an anterior and reliable presence, authority, or being that could
               be properly re-presented or even, decisively, presented. Rather, and especially in
               its Walpolean form, one encounters in the Gothic “spectres of counterfeits”
               (“Counterfeit” 293), such as the vampiric self-images Hogle identifies in Shelley's
                  <title level="m">Triumph of Life </title>“to which [Life's slaves] believe they
               must submit, even though those 'dim forms' are actually ghosts of what is dead.” In
               other words, just as Gothic tropes might “serve, on the one hand, as partially empty
               and nostalgic recollections of older fixed statuses [...] and, on the other, as
               announcements of statuses that were really <emph>recoined</emph> from older signs of
               them” (“Counterfeit” 298), so the historical orientation of the Gothic is both
               Epimethian and Promethean: intensely (re)productive though suspended, at once, by
               inherent displacement. The eighteenth-century neo-Gothic thus claims affiliation not
               directly with Classical or medieval history but with “the Renaissance counterfeit of
               the medieval” (“Counterfeit” 298), extending the Gothic into the future through an
               aesthetic and historical hauntology, wherein, like Derrida's revenant, the Gothic's
               historical originality is its unoriginality. </p>
            <p> From an historiographic perspective, the Gothic offers Romantic and modern culture a
               space in which to explore but also contain—through predictable, formulaic gambits—the
               institutional dismemberment and re-articulation often glossed as secularization.
               Originally referencing the expropriation of Church property (Blumenburg 20),
               secularization constitutes a broader historical and narrative pattern that reads
               modernity's reorganization of knowledge as a Frankenstein's Creature composed, so to
               speak, from the corpses of the saints. It is, in other words, a theory of history and
               a mode of historiography wherein modernity represents not the end of spirituality but
               rather the monstrous extension of a religious vitality that has been severed from
               transcendental guarantees: the Holy Ghost becomes Matthew Lewis' bleeding nun. In
               fact secularization's deeply Gothic ambivalence—for it crafts the future from a heap
               of broken icons—is at the heart of Romanticism's attempt to discipline the
                  <foreign>“frühen Neuzeit” </foreign>(Koselleck 5), the sudden temporalization of
               history, that emerges in Romanticism's recognition that it is, in James Chandler's
               words, “the age of the spirit of the age—that is, the period when the normative
               status of the period becomes a central and self-conscious aspect of historical
               reflection” (78). The recourse to historiography as a response to a new sense of
               temporal discontinuity motivates, as a compensation, the rise of the philosophy of
               history, itself a kind of aesthetic ideology. Beginning as early as Voltaire but
               reaching its apex in the work of J.G. Herder and G.W.F. Hegel, the philosophy of
               history, rather than merely recording events, takes up the active figuration of
               history according to a rational principle that promises not merely accuracy but
               truth. This attempt at recuperating history as philosophy through hermeneutics stems,
               in other words, from the anxious realization that while the “past may be determining,
               [...] it is also determined, the object of a continuous interpretive activity by
               which we refigure the meaning of our historical position and the possibilities
               available to us. [As such,] [i]f history is a narrative, it is also a
               counter-narrative of what is as yet unrealized in the countless failed or suppressed
               projects of the past” (Collings 41). Without the guarantee of something like Herder's
                  <foreign>Humanität</foreign> or Hegel's cunning of reason that can frame all
               events—either productive or ostensibly counter-productive—as part of a rational
               theodicy, what is to prevent the counter-narrative impulse from unmasking progress as
               what Walter Benjamin identified as catastrophe heaped on catastrophe? </p>
            <p> In the Romantic turn to history, the Gothic becomes the archive where such
               counter-narratives are incarcerated but also incarnated, that is, repressed and yet
               given substantial, bodily form. As Friedrich Schlegel notes, history becomes the
               discourse best suited to articulate the Romantic thinking of individuality
               systematically and of systematicity as organic individuality: “is it possible,” he
               asks, “to characterize anything but individuals? Isn't whatever can't be multiplied
               after a certain given point just as much a historical entity as something that can no
               longer be divided? Aren't all systems individuals just as all individuals are systems
               at least in embryo and tendency? Isn't every real entity historical? Aren’t there
               individuals who contain within themselves whole systems of individuals?” (51).
               Indeed, for Schlegel, “[t]here is no self-knowledge except historical self-knowledge”
               (107). The Gothic is this historical knowledge’s dark double—is the alterity that
               forms the dialectical ground of “individuality.” As an historical term that
               references its displacement in and of history, the Gothic performs an historical
               pseudo-figuration that parallels but suspends the basically Christian narrative of
               increasing freedom that Hegel, for instance, calls rational history.<note

                  articulation of the relationship between the eighteenth-century philosophy of
                  history and theodicy. See also Hans Blumenberg's critique of Löwith in the first

            </p>
            <p> The parodic relationship between the Gothic and Christianity in aesthetic terms
               offers a model for the perverse relationship between Gothic and eschatological
               historiography. Just as the Gothic mode mortifies then inhabits the ruined Roman
               Catholic Church, expropriating not only its buildings, writings, and artworks
               but—more abstractly—its hierarchies, mysteries, and Spirit, so too does it reoccupy
               hagiography as the method for imagining how events become specifically historical.
               This is not to say that the Gothic is merely anti-Catholic, although this is a
               well-articulated strain in some of the most celebrated exponents of the mode. Rather,
               the Gothic functions as a reliquary for those practices, concepts, and histories that
               seem to be eclipsed by cultural revolutions, for systems persisting beyond the moment
               of their historical viability. Echoing and also extending Julia Lupton's argument
               that “Biblical typology represents [in the Renaissance] one of the foundational
               principles of modern periodization per se” (Lupton 23), the Gothic can be read as a
               gathering point for the negated shapes of historical consciousness, for the types
               that are displaced by their anti-types. Erich Auerbach argues that typological
               signs—like the lives in its biographical counterpart, hagiography—do not completely
               lose their historical validity or meaning when freighted with supplementary meaning.
               In the typological conversion of the Hebrew Bible into an Old Testament, the latter
               text does not, for instance, lose its status as God's word. Hence, when Moses'
               liberation of the Jews from Egyptian captivity and the subsequent forty years of
               wandering is recast as Christ's forty-day temptation in the wilderness (Matthew
               4:1-11), the Mosaic story retains historical and mythical significance in its own
               terms even as it becomes a prophetic sign; while such an event can be read,
               retroactively, as a prelude or <foreign>figura</foreign> nevertheless “it remains an
               event, does not become a mere sign” (Auerbach 196). In this way history begins to
               fold over itself, becoming a tissue of non-identical narratives wherein the negated
               past remains annoyingly active and insistent. </p>
            <p> In Shelley's work we see a double displacement of this sort: Judaism is imperfectly
               absorbed by Christianity and Catholicism is imperfectly absorbed by a modernizing
               Protestantism. Shelley's Gothic reflects this overdetermination of historical forms
               by juxtaposing, overlapping, and blending together these different narratives of
               spirit that, from the perspective of a modern progressivism, ought not to come into
               contact. Given, for instance, the Protestant shift toward a personal relationship
               with Jesus Christ where he takes on the role of sole mediator between human
               sinfulness and redemption, one tends to associate Catholicism with border appeals to
               saintly intercession, to the possibility of conversation between Christians on earth
               and saints and angels in heaven. Yet as early as Henry VIII’s 1536 “Articles devised
               by the Kynges highnes maiestie” where he asserts Christ’s singular, salvational role,
               Protestant thought also praises and promotes worship of the saints. While opinion
               remained divided through the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries, James E.
               Wellington points out that “veneration of the saints and desire for their
               intercession are by no means the exclusive province of Roman Catholic worship” (189).
               Similarly, Christopher Hill notes that from the perspective of radical Protestant,
               apocalyptic thought “the conversion of the Jews and ‘the gathering of the Gentiles’
               were necessary before the millennium could arrive” (22). This condition leads to a
               conflicted kind of Judeophilia in times of intensified millenarianism—like, for
               instance, the late eighteenth century. Protestant apocalypticism promotes Judaism
               only because Judaism’s total cancellation occasions Christian transcendence. Indeed,
               the emergence of the millenarian “London Society for Promoting Christianity among the
               Jews” in 1808 locates this essentially perverse relationship between anti- and
               philo-Semitism within the purview of the neo-Gothic. In fact, Shelley's own atheism
               rehearses this pattern of uncanny repudiation, where one rejected or negated
               formulation of spirit lives on, disguised within the reoccupying idea. In his diary
               Shelley reflects on his conversation with Byron and Lewis: <quote>We talk of ghosts;
                  neither Lord Byron nor Monk G. Lewis seem to believe in them, and they both agree,
                  in the very face of reason, that none could believe in ghosts without also
                  believing in God. I do not think that all the persons who profess to discredit
                  those visitations really do discredit them, or if they do in the daylight, are not
                  admonished by the approach of loneliness and midnight to think more respectfully
                  of the world of shadows. (in Dowden 2.37–38)</quote> In his turn to the Gothic,
               Shelley—thanks to an atheism that, like secularization, fragments and reorganizes
               rather than eliminates the ghosts of Spirit—repeats “a religious hysteria,” the roots
               of which “can most accurately be located in the uncanny sectarian doubleness at the
               heart of Christianity itself, that is, in the conflict between Protestantism and
               Catholicism” (Hoeveler 27) and, even more radically, in Christianity's impossible
               elimination of Judaism. </p>
            <p> This context helps to understand the uncanny affiliation between Judaism and
               Catholicism in Shelley and begins to expose the place of the uncanny in the texture
               of Judeo-Christian history, where the past is never really past, never perfectly
               determined or exhausted. Just as secularization's fragmentation and reorganization of
               the sacred means, ironically, that theism functions all the more forcefully at the
               level of civil society—that the dispersal of religious institutions creates a mobile
               theism that circulates, on the commodity model, more widely and more freely than
               ever—so Walpole's attraction to the past on the basis of its supposed “emptiness”
               promotes, against his claim that “the dead have lost their power of deceiving,” the
               wide cultural and literary recirculation of modernity's prehistory (10.192). In
               Shelley, this recirculation of church property begins, innocently enough, as
               elegy—specifically, his elegy for John Keats. Yet, at the height of its recuperative
               effort, Shelley’s text discloses a materiality outside of recuperative figuration. In
               fact, this materiality goes beyond the indivisible remainders of history left over by
               typology and hagiography. Such materiality had been given tentative shape earlier in
               Shelley’s work as the Wandering Jew—one such haunting form of the past. And in <title
                  level="m">Adonais</title>, the wounded body of the Jew—the figure for the undead
               rather than the immortal—returns to interrupt the elegy by repossessing Keats’ corpse
               and suggesting that Christian and specifically Catholic forms of figuration are
               coextensive with a repressed history of disfiguration. Yet, ultimately, history
               cannot be reduced to a simple opposition between symbolization and defacement.
               Rather, the intensification of this opposition gestures toward a more radical moment
               of pre-historical materiality, to an event that can only be implied beyond the types
               and anti-types of historical representation. </p>
            <p> In the oscillation between Keats’ preservation as celebrity and the Wandering Jew’s
               violent exclusion from rational history, we encounter an historical materiality that
               irritates the “progressive revelation” (Wasserman) that the elegy, one mode of Gothic
               hagiography, supposedly provides. Secular historiography, undertaken by the
               philosophy of history, remains a theodicy that finds in elegy a poetic correlate to
               hagiography: in this model, all loss, violence, or suffering is read as a kind of
                  <foreign>felix culpa</foreign> with elegy providing, like hagiography, aesthetic
               compensation for trauma. Shelley, however, undermines these recuperative aesthetics
               in <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the text unveils a materiality that falls
               outside ideal afterlife. This failed translation of the body gains its own corpus, so
               to speak, in the Wandering Jew. Like C.R. Maturin’s Melmoth, Shelley’s Wandering Jew
               suffers the discipline, in every sense of that word, of official historiography.
               Bypassing both the Church and the charnel house of history, the Jew exists as a
               counter-narrative to Christian and secular progressivism—for the “secular” is but the
               uncanny reiteration of Christianity, the continuation of Christian history in the
               form of its ostensible elimination. Living his afterlife perpetually wounded, the Jew
               collapses progressive history by bearing trauma materially out of the past and into
               the future. But Shelley’s historical thought does not stop there. Rather, in shifting
               between the figuration of history as ideal (canonical) and as Real (traumatic),
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title> gestures, also, toward history's materialization,
               the action of historicization that cannot be fully rationalized by either kind of
               narrative figuration or even contained between the poles of figuration and
               disfiguration. While it is indeed uncanny that the past should live on—as a
               negativity—into a future its suppression ostensibly renders possible, the root of
               this relation lies even deeper, in the tissue of historicization itself: historicism,
               in its various narrative forms, aims not to sensitize but to insulate consciousness
               from the matter of history.</p>
            <p> According to Earl Wasserman, the remarkable aesthetic coherence of Shelley's <title
                  level="m">Adonais </title>“illumine[s] death” (175) by “translating Keats’
               biography into a complex that is primarily conceptual” (278), thereby rendering both
               the work and, effectively, Keats entirely available to consciousness. Through
               Shelley’s “gentle breath” (173), Keats’ corpse is revived as “Adonais,” the composite
               figure of the Greek Adonis and the Hebrew Adonai (Wasserman 279-80). As with the
               Christian martyrs there is here an irony, identified by James Heffernan, that
               “Shelley’s celebration of Keats,” his “visionary transformation of the pastoral
               dreamer into a Miltonic genius,” nevertheless “required a poet weak enough to have
               been killed by the words of a reviewer so that he might be resurrected by the words
               of Shelley” (303). Indeed, Shelley repurposes Keats’ own Grecian urn: through his
               careful incorporation of elements from Keats’ poetry—nightingales and basil pots,
               among other things—Shelley rewrites Keats’ symbol of poetry as the “lucid urn of
               starry dew” in which “quick Dreams,” disconsolate, “Washed [Keats’] light limbs as if
               embalming them” (91,73, 92). True to the promise of his Platonic epigraph to give
               “New splendour to the dead,” Shelley’s poetic lucidity preserves Adonais, “like a
               star” (494), among “The splendours of the firmament of time” (388)—the latter a line
               Michael O'Neill identifies as containing “an image for the canon” (52). Shelley,
               then, is strangely complicit with the murder that then enables him to re-present
               Keats poetically and historically. </p>
            <p> As Joel Faflak notes, “the most overlooked and yet obvious Gothic feature of the
               text is the rotting corpse of Adonais at the centre of its
                  <foreign>mise-en-scene</foreign>. One misses the corpse because of its
               obviousness, like Lacan's purloined letter, except in this case the object itself is
               uncanny” (n. Pag). But Shelley's text not only conceals Keats’ remains at the heart
               of its aestheticizing activity; the poetry, in addition, infuses life as such with
               creeping mortification. Figured as an awakening, Keats, as Adonais, takes life with
               him into the nether-realm, rendering corporeal existence into perpetual decomposition
               such that death becomes the only state of authentic being: <quote><lg>
                     <l> Peace, peace! He is not dead, he doth not sleep—</l>
                     <l> He hath awakened from the dream of life—</l>
                     <l> 'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep</l>

                     <l> And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay. (343-51)</l>
                  </lg></quote> Adonais' exultation is for his mourners—and Shelley’s readers—their
                  <foreign>katabasis</foreign>. The “abandoned Earth” (368), the seat of organic
               life, becomes, echoing Calderóne's play, a dream, whereas the grave, through hope’s
               interment, becomes, as in Blake’s <title level="m">Book of Thel</title>, disturbingly
                  animated.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">See Calderón de la
                  Barca, <title level="m">Life is a Dream </title>(1629-35). In his letters, Shelley
                  notes on several occasions that, in the months leading up to his composition of
                     <title level="m">Adonais</title>, he is rapidly consuming the works of
                  Calderón, calling him, in a letter to Peacock in August, 1819, “a kind of
                  Shakespeare” (2.115). In a footnote to his draft of <title level="m"
                     >Adonais</title> Shelley names Calderón among an expanded pantheon of literary
                  greats (O'Neill 52).</note> If death reigns over life, Adonais feeds on death’s
               (im)mortality: “He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he;/ Mourn not for
               Adonais” (361-2). </p>
            <p> Part of death’s attractiveness in <title level="m">Adonais</title> stems from
               Shelley’s uncanny, pre-emptive commingling of aesthetic pleasure with Keats’
               gravesite. In a letter to Peacock in December, 1818, Shelley describes the Protestant
               cemetery in Rome—the future gravesite not only of Keats but, only a few months later,
               young William Shelley and, ultimately, Percy himself—as “the most beautiful &amp;
               solemn cemetery” he had ever encountered: <quote>To see the sun shining on its bright
                  grass fresh when we visited it with the autumnal dews, &amp; hear the whispering
                  of the wind among the leaves of the trees which have overgrown the tomb of
                  Cestius, &amp; the coil which is stirring in the sunwarm earth &amp; to mark the
                  tombs mostly of women &amp; young people who were buried there, one might, if one
                  were to die, desire the sleep they seem to sleep. Such is the human mind &amp; so
                  it peoples with its wishes vacancy &amp; oblivion. (60)</quote> Months later,
               Shelley recalls the atmosphere of this excursion, describing Keats in Death’s “pale
               court” reclining “as if in dewy sleep” (56, 61). Read proleptically, Shelley’s letter
               diagnoses <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the product of an inversion of life and
               death that confuses metaphysical comfort with depression. At first glance, Shelley
               seems to enjoy imagining himself included among the spirits in this lovely garden and
               appears to sanction the imaginative fecundity that helps the mind overcome “vacancy
               &amp; oblivion.” This reversal, however, where thought and life appear to be
               activated after death, is suspended by a series of qualifications. The desire named
               is, for instance, bracketed not once by twice by hypothetical turns of phrase—“one
                  <emph>might</emph>, <emph>if</emph> one were to die...” Such rhetorical hedging
               casts its shadow across the ostensible desire for the “sleep they seem to sleep.” For
               what precisely is the object of desire here? Does the stress in the penultimate line
               fall on “sleep” or “seem”? Does Shelley find attractive “seeming sleep” taken as
               peaceful death or “seeming sleep” taken as secret (re)animation? Even the final line
               is reversible: while it appears that “vacancy &amp; oblivion” name the setting that
               is populated by the mind’s lively “wishes,” Shelley’s awkward syntax allows one to
               read “vacancy &amp; oblivion” <emph>as</emph> the “wishes” themselves. </p>
            <p> The complex relationships in <title level="m">Adonais</title> among desire, death,
               and afterlife can be clarified by looking at how Shelley appropriates existing
               historical aesthetics. In <title level="m">The Afterlife of the Saints</title>, Julia
               Lupton describes the complex symbolic economy of Christian hagiography in terms that
               prove germane to a reading of Romantic elegy broadly and Shelley's text specifically.
               Hagiography—literally, “sacred writing”—translates death into sainthood, offering the
               martyr a symbolic afterlife in the official calendars and canons of the Church. This
               system rehearses typological and figural hermeneutic practices that can be traced
               back at least as far as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas—practices that
               attempt to redeem Christianity’s Classical and Hebrew past by figuring that past,
               retroactively, as the anticipation of the New Testament’s fulfilment. Christian
               biography, then, is related to a form of mortification as the very mechanism of
               symbolization and historical legitimation. </p>
            <p>For Lupton, Christian historiography is based on the symbolic structure of martyrdom
               dramatized in exemplary fashion by Christ: his crucifixion and burial marks the
               negative moment in the transition from the flesh to the spirit, man to God, pagan to
               Christian history, Old to New Testament. That is, hagiography illustrates the
               perverse relationship between symbolization and violence, where the mundane and
               ephemeral gains historical and indeed spiritual promotion through sublime
               dismemberment. Hence, martyrdom becomes a kind of trope, something that mediates
               between the past and “the <foreign>Nachleben der Antike</foreign>” (Lupton 5), just
               as hagiography, at the level of subjective biography, mediates between anonymity and
               sainthood. Crucially, in each case this formula acts as a way to recuperate
               negation—to put death to work, dialectically. For, if the martyr is always finally
               decapitated, this “loss of the head is not simply one dismemberment among others in a
               potentially infinite metonymic chain, but rather a symbolic recomposition of bodily
               fragments into a subjectivity gathered up by its very cancellation” (Lupton 53). </p>
            <p> Shelley’s inversion of life and death in <title level="m">Adonais</title>
               complicates this final, decisive stroke—a stroke that would accomplish Keats’
               cultural and aesthetic recomposition. It is not merely that Keats joins Chatterton,
               Sidney, and Lucan, “and many more, whose names on Earth are dark/ But whose
               transmitted effluence cannot die” (406-7). For, the kind of beneficent illumination
               these figures cast merely stains the insane purity Shelley attributes to his fallen
               Hyperion: <quote><lg>
                     <l> The One remains, the many change and pass;</l>
                     <l> Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;</l>
                     <l> Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</l>
                     <l> Stains the white radiance of Eternity,</l>
                     <l> Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,</l>
                     <l> If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek! (460-65)</l>
                  </lg></quote> It is as if his very living on as a martyr—as a tragic, historical
               figure—would, for Shelley, hamper Keats’ transcendence. Rather than fusing him into
               the dome of glass, then, Shelley's text presents figuration—mere phenomenalization as
               giving cognizable form to images—as denigration: “stained” glass, indeed.
               Anticipating the paradoxical “shape all light” in the <title level="m">Triumph of
                  Life</title>, the apex of elegiac recuperation outstrips all aesthetic or
               intellectual comprehension, such that perfect redemption must coincide with
               imagination’s self-cancellation. The shattered dome thus gestures toward a
               transcendence that exceeds the comprehension of afterlife in reverential terms, which
               is perhaps why the text can describe the speaker’s “ensanguined brow,” in an
               irreverent pairing, as one “Which was like Cain’s or Christ’s” (305, 306). <title
                  level="m">Adonais</title>, then, aspires—or perhaps “expires”—to an existence
               neither entirely corporeal nor entirely spiritual. But, then, what is afterlife? </p>
            <p>If hagiography is the rhetorical archetype of the kind of historical and subjective
               recuperation continuous with secular, “enlightened” historiography, what is the
               significance of the conflicting, Gothic obsession with the undead? Unnatural,
               physical reanimation offers form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is
               excluded from official accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology. Whether the
               vampire, Frankenstein’s Creature, or the Wandering Jew, such monsters live on
               perpetually but only because they are <emph>denied</emph> complete entry into
               prevailing symbolic systems, whether legal, moral, political or, ultimately,
               historical. Ironically, the absence of the final, deadly stroke that crystallizes and
               illuminates the saints’ en-graving in the official canon of the Church generates a
               wounded, Byronic exile who similarly lives beyond death but does so in terrifyingly
               physical, organic terms.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> In
                     <title level="m">Life: Organic Form and Romanticism</title>, Denise Gigante
                  notes that “once life came to be seen [in Romanticism] as power, monstrosity came
                  to represent life’s relentless fecundity and ‘the monstrous’ a mode of
                  uncontainable vitality” (6).</note> As the extension of but also counterpoint to
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ formal coherence, the text gestures toward a
               form of monstrous afterlife that recurs often in Shelley’s work as the Wandering
               Jew.</p>
            <p> The Wandering Jew appears across a wide range of Shelley’s works. According to the
               Medieval folkloric tradition, the Wandering Jew is cursed to roam the earth until the
               Second Coming for denying Jesus respite during the Passion. Echoing the story of
               Cain, God marks the Jew on the face. This disfigured figure thus plays a complex role
               in Shelley’s thinking on history, writing, and afterlife. For if the Jew’s body bears
               God’s wounding mark then he becomes in effect the sign of God—something like Blake’s
               “Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression” (<title level="m">Milton</title>
               49.15). Shelley’s Jew, forced—in Mathew Arnold’s germane phrase—to wander “between
               two worlds, one dead,/ The other powerless to be born,” seems literally to embody the
               meeting point between the mundane and the sacred, the letter and the spirit. In other
               words, he stands in a position similar to the Christian martyr. Yet, since he is
               denied corporeal finitude he is denied entry into hagiography’s symbolizing system,
               the same system that produces authorized history. In the final analysis, the Jew
               “marks” the irreconcilable distance between the “two worlds of life and death”
                  (<title level="m">Prometheus </title>1.195) because he is, strictly speaking,
               denied access to <emph>both</emph>. </p>
            <p> While the Jew’s life is exactly coextensive with Christian history, he lives as a
               counterhistory to the ideology of progress and even as a countertrope to the logic of
               Christian hermeneutic and typological synthesis. For he reveals in his own flesh, to
               adapt Benjamin’s famous phrase, that “there is no document of civilization which is
               not at the same time a document of barbarism” (<title level="m">Illuminations
               </title>256); through the Jew, Shelley finds a powerful emblem for the tyranny,
               violence, and regression within ostensible progress. In fact, in <title level="m">The
                  Wandering Jew</title>, the protagonist, Paulo, is unable to narrate his own story:
               while he represents the quilting point between autobiography and universal history,
               the Jew, here, suffers from a remarkable narrative aphasia. If the Wandering Jew is
               supposed literally to embody divine writing, if his wandering is a performance of
                  <emph>meta-phora</emph> incarnate, he, at the same time, walks toward the
               indefinite future “to-come” intimated also in Shelley's lyrical drama, <title
                  level="m">Hellas</title>. Despite the attempt to make metaphor suddenly literal
               through the Jew’s body, the endlessness of his wandering generates a halting,
               episodic, and fractured autobiography. </p>
            <p>For instance, Paulo initially makes claims for a superior kind of vision,
               characteristic of conventional expectations concerning the prophetic “seers” with
               which he is aligned: <quote><lg>
                     <l>I pierce with intellectual eye,</l>
                     <l>Into each hidden mystery;</l>
                     <l>I penetrate the fertile womb</l>
                     <l>Of nature; I produce to light</l>

                  </lg>
               </quote> This power—echoed in similar language by Ahasuerus in <title level="m"
                  >Hellas</title>—is suspended, however, by Paulo’s difficulty in facing his own
               history when he attempts to narrate his life to Rosa and his only friend, Victorio: <quote>
                  <lg>
                     <l>At this short retrospect I faint:</l>
                     <l>Scarce beats my pulse—I lose my breath,</l>

                     <l>The varied horrors of my fate. (3.431-438) </l>
                  </lg></quote> This is an acute instantiation of what Paul de Man has called
               autobiography as defacement. Paulo cannot articulate his own history because that
               history is literally the history of his own defacement, which means in a figurative
               and reflexive register the history of his <emph>exclusion from</emph> available forms
               of symbolic and narrative coherence. Biography, autobiography, and even elegy of the
               sort attempted in <title level="m">Adonais</title> would only misrepresent the Jew’s
               relationship to history since narrative organization—with the implicit divisions into
               beginning, middle, and end—precisely cannot apply to the cursed peripatetic.</p>
            <p><title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> dramatizes these two different
               relationships to historical figuration in a moment Blake would call a “minute
               particular.” Early in the poem, Paulo rescues a young novice, named Rosa, from a
               convent in Padua. The text suggests that Rosa is about to be punished by a brutal
               Abbess for indiscretions that remain, for the reader, obscure. The language and
               imagery in the scene suggests, in fact, that we are on the verge of witnessing human
               sacrifice. Rosa, “fainting” (1.147), is borne to “the fatal shrine” (1.183) by a
               group of nuns amidst a crowd whose “confused and open clamors” (1.176) suggest strong
               though impotent opposition to the proceedings. Given her name, it is additionally
               unfortunate that “The roses from [Rosa’s] cheek are fled/ But there the lily reigns
               instead” (1.148-149) and that she should be carried over a path of “fresh roses
               strew[n] upon the ground” (1.163). Paulo, observing the scene, witnesses Rosa’s
               sudden dash for the doors and, quickly navigating the crowd, manages to intercept her
               and carry her off just as she loses consciousness. In escaping from the Abbess, Rosa
               does more than simply preserve her corporeal life, though. More importantly, she
               flees from a site where the light of the Absolute is, literally, mediated by saints
               printed on the windows. She seems, in other words, to have lost any possibility of
               saintly promotion and concomitant historical legitimacy. And yet, describing the
               gloomy atmosphere inside the church, the speaker notices how the stain-glass windows,
               the “saint-cipher’d panes” (1.91), seem to distort the light they also transmit.
               These windows “tinged the pillars with varied stains” (1.93), anticipating the
               description, later, of Paulo’s own eye, his “chilling gaze” that “shot a lurid gleam
               of light” (1.240, 1.242). This stained and lurid light counterpoints the glorious
               illumination of the image of the saint in the window, suggesting that the distance
               between Paulo, whose “burning fillet blazed with blood” (2.204), and saintly
               incandescence might be read not as the failure of spiritual promotion but as life’s
               rescue from Catholicism’s cult of death—a Gothic caricature of Catholic extravagance
               familiar from Radcliffe and Lewis, among others. </p>
            <p>Paulo’s exclusion from various symbolic systems that translate finitude into
               spiritual afterlife through precise violence emerges in this episode in terms of how
               light is, on one hand, illuminating while, on the other, distorting. This casts the
               claims to historical and moral legitimacy made by the Church into shadow. For as the
               scene of near sacrifice suggests, the symbolic economy of hagiography, if
               instrumentalized, looks very much like a regression to precisely those pagan
               practices Judaism and Christianity alike aim to transcend. Such claims will, however,
               always be difficult to make if mundane life is entirely subordinated to
               afterlife—whether spiritual, aesthetic, historical, or some combination of the three.
               Indeed, Shelley exposes the persistence of this subordination by erasing Rosa from
               history through a kind of anti-hagiography. When Rosa chooses to flee from sacrifice
               and join company with Paulo, she forfeits participation both in Christian
               transcendence and official history. Shelley makes this clear through a dramatic
               caesura in the Fourth Canto of his poem. Rosa accidentally takes a fatal dose of
               poison. Shelley, however, does not narrate this moment with the kind of close detail
               characteristic of popular Christian hagiographic compendiums, like Jacobus de
               Voragine’s <title level="m">The Golden Legend</title>. There is, rather, a sudden
               disconnect in the poem, as the speaker turns his attention to the calm summer night
               and then sings, allusively, about decaying flowers. In other words, Rosa’s exile by
               proxy means that, in representational terms, her death is incorporated into—or
               perhaps “incarcerated by”—a different metaphorical code. While her death cannot enter
               into the Church’s official history, it is written on or as nature, as if Classical
               myth displaces Christian transcendence—as if death, like the Wandering Jew’s
               monstrous life, remains disturbingly corporeal and present. </p>
            <p>In a sense, then, Paulo and Rosa return the concept of hagiography to its
               specifically Hebrew application as a description of the twelve books that form the
               final third of the Hebrew Bible. Many of the texts in this section are reclassified
               as “historical books” in the Christian redistribution of the Hebrew Bible into an Old
               Testament. By returning “sacred writing” to mundane history through his physical
               scaring that subtlety re-codes hagiography, Shelley’s Wandering Jew suspends
               Christian transcendence and apocalyptic historiography. With the opacity of a life
               resistant to the “redemption” of symbolization, Paulo’s history preemptively
               collapses Shelley’s key simile in <title level="m">Adonais</title>: if “Life,”
               figured as <quote><lg>
                     <l rendition="#indent1"> a dome of many-colored glass, </l>

                     <l> Until death tramples it to fragments, </l>
                  </lg></quote>
               <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> then suggests that such a conception of
               life and death is, in fact, a product of the peculiar optics of the Christian Church.
               The illumination of life in this image suggests that <emph>living</emph> and
               sanctified <emph>afterlife</emph> uncannily overlap. The murder that, in <title
                  level="m">The Wandering Jew</title>, Rosa could escape has, in <title level="m"
                  >Adonais</title>, already taken place: the rites have been performed and the
               oblation made. And yet, <title level="m">Adonais</title> opens a way to the
               materiality that seems to have been veiled by its elegiac illumination. Moving from
               the image of the fractured dome backward in the text of <title level="m"
                  >Adonais</title>, there is evidence that this collapse is imminent, as Shelley's
               lucidity frequently verges on translucence, turning instances of possible
               revelation—not through privation but, rather, their intensification—into sites of
               blindness. </p>
            <p> Pleasure, for instance, as the affective root beneath the aesthetic exigency that
               like <quote><lg>

                     <l> All new succession to the forms they wear (381-3)</l>
                  </lg></quote> motivates the beautiful, harmonious shape the text of <title
                  level="m">Adonais</title> takes. Poetry, even in its most melancholy instances,
               offers emotional, sensual, or intellectual recompense. And yet, that pleasure betrays
               the sorrow of elegy. As such, Shelley presents “Pleasure, blind with tears, led by
               the gleam/ Of her own dying smile instead of eyes” (114-15). Loath to acknowledge the
               vampiric economy wherein elegy, “like flowers that mock the corse beneath” (17),
               translates grief into beauty, pleasure’s personification becomes vaguely Oedipal and
               attempts to circumvent its own activity through self-blinding. Pleasure’s attraction
               to Adonais and, reflexively, its contribution to the poem’s composition, is
               intensified only through its simultaneous limitation. “Led” on by a “<title level="m"
                  >dying</title> smile,” Pleasure’s pursuit (of herself) follows only as closely as
               the <emph>fading</emph> of that same pleasure will permit, will extended only
               according to an economy of diminishing returns. </p>
            <p> Not only does the text’s vision tend toward blindness but it gestures toward a more
               radical negativity, one outside the opposition of the visible and invisible. This is
               clearest where the poem approaches not merely invisibility but the unconscious.
               Consciousness, the power of intellectual enlightenment, interrupts radical
               transcendence by reducing the blinding brightness of the Eternal to the conditional
               terms of the understanding. Hence, consciousness becomes most acute and sensitive to
               “his mute voice” (27) as it approaches the abyss of unthought. <quote><lg>
                     <l> Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows</l>

                     <l> A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose. (177-80)</l>
                  </lg></quote> Shelley's thought and language here short-circuits. At first,
               “Nought we know, dies” seems to say “nothing we know can die,” that, once elevated to
               the life of the mind, the passing world escapes death, effectively extending the
               sentiment from the immediately preceding lines where poetry “chang'd to fragrance”
               the “leprous corpse” (175, 172). But Shelley hesitates. The comma between “know” and
               “dies” interrupts any simple continuity between terms, as if Shelley approaches but
               then withdraws from thought and art's claims to ideal and sensuous preservation. The
               whole passage, in fact, checks itself, the speaker inhaling while the dead body
               “Exhales itself in flowers” (173). For the positivity implied within the rhetorical
               question—that, no, “that alone which knows” <emph>will</emph> fend off destruction—is
               extremely tenuous. The speaker seems, in short, to lose confidence in his own
               reassuring arguments in the very process of making those arguments. Read in light of
               the subsequent lines, it becomes possible, ultimately, nearly to invert the apparent
               meaning of “nought we know, dies,” to gloss it as “we can know nothing but that which
               dies.” This reading reorients the passage in ways that reveals continuity with the
               recognition, by the stanza’s end, that the mind that understands this sad fact of
               epistemology dies too. Yet, the mind does not <emph>comprehend</emph> its eventual
               loss of comprehension so much as intuit, as thought’s doppelganger, a negativity that
               is coextensive with consciousness. As if reflecting on the subtle powers of the
               fading coal of the mind in creation, human thought can be grasped only by a
               consciousness in the process of extinguishing itself. The mind can only know death if
               understanding is already, in that apprehension, dying, fading. For only a finite mind
               could be capable of understanding the pain of finitude. God could only know death and
               the grief of loss through human frailty—which is precisely why He had to create the
               world and then populate it with imperfect beings. Weakness, then, is strangely
               coextensive with <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ aesthetic figuration. Keats is not
               fully recuperated but only temporarily revived in order to replay the process of
               losing, in order to dissipate the image the text is always on the verge of shaping. </p>
            <p> R.F. Leavis famously objects that in Shelley's poetry “there is nothing to be
               grasped [...]—no object offered for contemplation, no realized presence to persuade
               or move us by what it is” (210). For Leavis, reading “Ode to the West Wind,” this
               disagreeable instability is a result of Shelley's shifting, impatient imagery. <title
                  level="m">Adonais</title> has a similar effect but for different reasons: it is
               not the imagery but the apprehending consciousness itself that begins to lose its
               moorings. Destroying the coloured dome in what looks like an act of fanaticism means
               cancelling all figuration and consciousness, eliminating all categories of thought
               and rejecting the mediation necessary for knowledge. It is as if the senses and the
               understanding have become impediments rather than aids to perception—or rather, that
               perception itself is a diminishment of the surpassing brilliance that can only be
               indicated by its hostility to the mind. This eliminates both hagiographic sublation
               and monstrous protraction as ways of understanding history's (de)formation. Like a
               candle lost in the daylight, these historiographical models become inadequate not for
               any internal shortcomings but because understanding as such has, strangely, become a
               barrier to adequate expression: something about Keats exceeds both the figuration and
               disfiguration of his historical afterlife. So while the Jew offers a precedent for
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>’ own unwriting of aesthetic history, even this
               figure cannot symbolize the sheer givenness of history as event or happening. </p>
            <p> In the instant of aesthetic and cognitive collapse, before elegiac mourning is
               recast and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity, Shelley's <title level="m"
                  >Adonais</title> comes close to a material vision of history, that is, an
               apprehension of history as an activity that always exceeds its (dis)figuration.
               History in Shelley is not reducible to either narrative or counter-narrative, as it
               also includes the <emph>act</emph> of historicizing. As what enables but eludes
               mediation, this action cannot be understood by the histories it frames, nor can it be
               confused with history “in itself” as something objectively present. Instead, material
               history would be history severed from any narrative form, a sheer happening that is,
               at root, senseless—like a death, a gift, or even the gift of death. In this precise
               context, it is the gift of Keats’ death that is a donation, something purely given,
               and coded in the overdetermined proper name: Adonis, Adonai, <foreign>á
                  donner</foreign>. This happening eludes Shelley's narrative containment—something
               begun from the instant Shelley mythologizes Keats' death as murder. Yet, the text's
               interruption of its own figures of understanding—light, consciousness—suggests that
               this gift's madness mars the poem's formal beauty. Just as one might respond to
               Leavis that the slippage among images in Shelley's “Ode” successfully performs the
               urgency and turbulence of the air—that to provide consciousness with an
                  <emph>object</emph> would be to miss the point—so the collapse of the coloured
               dome hints at a power that cannot be rendered completely intelligible even in art. </p>
            <p> The matter of historical materiality here has to be taken in Judith Butler's sense
               as a process of “mattering” or coming into existence. The materiality of history is
               how history matters; materialization is the senseless action anterior to the meaning
               ascribed to that action by one historical paradigm or another. Shelley's late drama,
                  <title level="m">Hellas</title>, suggests one way in which such mattering makes an
               impression before disappearing into concepts of the understanding. The play abandons
               its organization to the unpredictable events immediately contemporary to Shelley,
               namely, the Greek revolt that erupts in March, 1821, against Turkish occupation. The
               action is framed as three scenes, book-ended and separated by visionary interludes,
               wherein Mahmud, the Turkish ruler residing in Constantinople, hosts various
               messengers who bring him news concerning the Turkish response to the Greek uprising.
               Shelley, however, does not simply borrow this Aeschylean technique as a plot formula;
               for Shelley, too, awaits updates, adjusting his text in response to the contingencies
               of the Rebellion in a display of what he calls, in the Preface, “newspaper erudition”
               (429). In other words, this text hovers over the moment of historical
               materialization, the moment of conversion or encoding where the senselessness of the
               unpredictable happening—something that precedes understanding—is made sensible, is
               made available for “proper history.” So, whereas “the strategies of historicism [...]
               evade the problematic and programming of inscription,” Shelley's text nevertheless
               manages to indicate the action “which precedes and partakes of the very mnemotechnic
               site of archival politics out of which the categories of politics, the human, and the
               aesthetic appear organized” (Cohen xi). </p>
            <p> Like consciousness itself, historical representation seems always and instantly to
               appropriate materiality, turning gifts—the sheer givenness of events—into deficits
               that have to be paid for through narrative explanation. This is also the danger in
                  <title level="m">Adonais</title>—that Keats may become a mere trope, that
               something as uncountable as (his) death might be put to work in the interest of
               Shelley's own vendettas against English bards and Scotch reviewers. Indeed, it is a
               danger inherent to the elegy as such, though often restricted to an affective
               complication rather than taken in broader historical, representational terms. “Where
               there is leisure for fiction, there is little grief” (1.163), remarks Samuel Johnson
               in reference to Milton's <title level="m">Lycidas</title>; the elegy, as an effort to
               mourn loss, appropriates and then aims to eliminate sadness—or at least anaesthetize
               consciousness temporarily. As Gregory Nagy describes, elegy is founded on a
               conflicting gesture: “despite its claim to be a form of men's lament, elegy can
               simultaneously make a counter-claim: that it is also an antidote for the grief and
               suffering of lament” (39). And yet the elegy is often, as in <title level="m"
                  >Adonais</title>, reflexive enough to question its own status as antidote. Indeed,
               the kind of Gothic counter-narratives to Christian history that traverse Shelley's
                  <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> can be identified precisely within Shelley's elegy,
               suggesting that the Gothic organizes the negativity of elegiac self-reflexivity. For
               the aforementioned “ensanguin'd brow / Which was like Cain's or Christ's” (305-6)
               describes Shelley's self-figuration in the poem, identifying the voice of elegiac
               lament with none other than the Wandering Jew. In uttering elegy in the Gothic
               tongue, <title level="m">Adonais </title>sharpens the contradiction between the forms
               of historical afterlife developed within each genre. One consequence of this is that
               the text becomes increasingly aware that death remains misapprehended in
                  <emph>both</emph> genres—not for any fault of the genres but because death, the
               material event par excellence, is necessarily misapprehend <emph>by</emph> proper
               understanding.</p>
            <p> In an almost masochistic effort to expose its own internal conflicts, <title
                  level="m">Adonais</title> repeatedly attempts to treat death as an attribute. This
               treatment is necessary in order to preserve the consoling though suicidal desire to
               “hasten thither” and “No more let Life divide what Death can join together” (476-7).
               Such confusion is also behind the ostensibly comforting notion that what is beyond
               all deterioration—“from the contagion of the world's slow stain/ He is secure”
               (356-7)—is precisely that which is already deteriorated, just as “the past are all
               that cannot pass away” (432). Existence, however, is not an attribute; it is, rather,
               substantial, fundamental. Unlike quantities, qualities, modalities, relations or
               other modifications of being, existence's removal would negate the subject as such.
               In other words, death cannot join together nor can it preserve in any conventional
               sense, since <emph>what</emph> it would join together or preserve loses, at death,
               its being. “What Adonais is, why fear we to become?” (459). Such a line of thought is
               possible only if death, as non-being, has been confused with a way of being. For what
               the poem, in its relentless self-effacement of understanding, perception, and
               beautiful figuration, insists on is that what Keats <emph>is</emph> is, precisely,
                  <emph>not</emph>. In fact, the first line of Shelley's elegy, “I weep for
               Adonais—he is dead!”—itself a kind of paraphrase of the genre—is deeply misleading,
               metaphysically speaking: death is the “state of being” in which one ceases to be in
               any state whatever, such that the verb “to be” becomes entirely hypothetical. At the
               moment of its most assertive declarations, of its most compelling presentation of
               objects, the poem is thus suspended by an implicit “as if.”</p>
            <p> Shelley seems to sense this conflict. For while it is a common enough—indeed,
               inevitable—error to think of death as a way of being, he stresses this error by
               characterizing death explicitly as an excrescence and stressing the hypothetical
               nature of this construction: “Now thou art dead, as if it were a part / Of thee, my
               Adonais!” (231-2). Death here has been added—though tentatively, as a kind of
               experiment—to a name that somehow persists beyond the logic of being and nothingness,
               as if Keats, as Adonais, is even more substantial, as if he is what he was, and now
               he is that <emph>and more</emph>—that is, dead. In this the text offers an
               alternative reading of Shelley's conclusion of <title level="m">Prometheus
                  Unbound</title>: <quote><lg>
                     <l> To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;</l>
                     <l> To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;</l>
                     <l> To defy Power, which seems omnipotent;</l>
                     <l> To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates</l>
                     <l> From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;</l>
                     <l> Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;</l>
                     <l> This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be</l>
                     <l> Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;</l>
                     <l> This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory. (4.570-8)</l>
                  </lg></quote> In the context of the Prometheian Age, Shelley’s conception of hope
               suggests irrepressible vitality and optimism, that out of not only the loss of
               concrete objects but its own negation hope can manage to perpetuate and even
               strengthen itself. In <title level="m">Adonais</title>, however, hope becomes a trap.
               “Keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink/ When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd
               thee to the brink,” warns the speaker (422-3). Just as the rhythm of power’s
               diminishment across the text of <title level="m">Adonais</title> makes possible a
               kind of affective and historiographical synchronization, one where loss is registered
               through the repetition of losing rather than the production of an image—effectively,
               the recuperation of loss as another form—so is <title level="m">Adonais</title> aware
               of the sentimentalism it, as elegy, participates in. Given this awareness, the
               persistence rather than dissolution of the sentimental means that the text performs
               itself as sentimental—that is, like Walepole’s Gothic, Shelley’s text wears its own
               genre like a mask and then advertises this dissimulation. Such a performance is not
               exactly ironic but interested in producing a specific trajectory of consciousness:
               where <title level="m">Prometheus</title> (re)produces hope, <title level="m"
                  >Adonais</title> (re)produces the wreck. Keats's death is the thing Shelley
               contemplates and it is precisely hope, positivity and production, that he is aware
               his elegy must, in some way, keep its distance from. The Gothic interruption of
               luminous figuration and its subtle indication of a materiality that is deeply
               historical and yet outside historiography is not, therefore, pessimistic. Rather,
               when Shelley displaces sentimentality through a reflexive performance of the
               sentimental he also frees Keats, in part, from his figuration as the naive poet—that
               is, he frees him from his characterization as the lost object that, as Schiller
               argues, gives the sentimental shape of thought its nostalgic impulse. Keats has
               become death, has his being as dead, and exists as the inexistent. With an insane
               fidelity to the gift of death, Shelley would break his mind and his poem in the
               effort to say this logical impasse, to make splendid the impossibility of this gift's
               perfect return as art, knowledge, pleasure, or even history. </p>
