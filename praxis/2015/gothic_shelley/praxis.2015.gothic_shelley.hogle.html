            <p>The persistent use of Gothic motifs by Shelley from his early Gothic novels (1810-11)
               all the way to <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (1822) has only been partly explained up until now.  This essay argues that Shelley
               develops, across his career in ways especially visible in <em>The Triumph</em>, a "Gothic complex" of connected features that look all the way back to how the "Gothic
               Story" began in Horace Walpole's <em>The Castle of Otranto</em> (1764).  By developing these features as he does, Shelley is able to reveal with
               great power the underlying conflicts at his (and our) time between retrograde belief-systems
               that people still accept as dominant and true, on the one hand, and, on the other,
               progressive re-castings of those old shapes that can make them point to revolutionary
               ideologies that can change the world as his characters and readers perceive it.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The “Gothic Complex” in Shelley: From <em>Zastrozzi</em> to <em>The Triumph of Life</em></span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Ever since John Murphy in 1975 traced the persistence of “Gothic” figurations from
               P.B. Shelley’s earliest works through <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, we have come to see, as Stephen Behrendt has said in his edition of Shelley’s <em>Zastrozzi</em> (1810) and <em>St. Irvyne</em> (1811), “unmistakable foreshadowings” in those adolescent “romances” of his major
               achievements between 1818 and 1822 (Shelley 2002b, 12). A vital question remains,
               however: what is really <em>most</em> fundamentally <em>Gothic</em> — and what is most fundamentally symbolized because of that Gothicism — in what continues
               from those early efforts all the way to the unfinished <em>Triumph of Life</em>? Even the best explanations since Murphy of what lasts from this poet’s youthful
               recastings of Ann Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, and Charlotte Dacre do not ultimately answer
               this question, though I think they have taken us part of the way. Behrendt himself
               rightly shows that, once Shelley gets past direct imitations of Lewis or Dacre (as
               in his poem on “The Wandering Jew”), his early romances point, as the Gothic always
               has, to a “world in which traditional beliefs and values have eroded” but also one
               where the pull of those past ideologies remains (Shelley 2002b, 20). The result in
               <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em>, Behrendt concludes, is “an unwillingness to fully ‘resolve’ the myriad contradictions”
               in the Gothic rendering of their major characters, who thus become precursors of the
               powerful complexity in the Beatrice of Shelley’s Gothic play <em>The Cenci</em> (1819; Shelley 2002b, 30-31). John Whatley essentially agrees by pointing out how
               these early novels “critique . . . religious symbolism through [the] progressive philosophy”
               expressed by the most villainous characters as they echo Enlightenment thinkers important
               to Shelley, albeit within the frame of a traditional Gothic moralizing (Whatley 1999,
               202). The consequence is a “struggle between opposing views” acted out through conflicts
               between different kinds of signifiers, so much so that “Zastrozzi” and the “Matilda”
               he serves or “Wolfstein” as he is tempted towards selling his soul by the Rosicrucian
               “Ginotti” in <em>St. Irvine </em>“hover in a curious, irresolvable middle state between [the older] motivated symbol
               and [the newer] atheist sign” (Whatley 1999, 205 and 217).</p>
            <p>But is what Behrendt and Whatley reveal spawned by Shelley’s own struggles among attitudes
               as they fill the by-now extreme conventionality of the Gothic figures he adapts, or
               are such irresolutions (as these critics intimate, but only sketchily) bound up with
               the symbolic possibilities endemic to Gothic conventions? Peter Finch has neatly sidestepped
               this question by seeing the intercalated plots of <em>St. Irvyne</em>, the Wolfstein story in a German-Gothic mode reminiscent of Lewis and the Eliose
               story in a sentimental mode that recalls Rousseau’s <em>La Nouvelle Heloise</em>, as simply manifesting a “contesting pull of narratives” that Shelley will work to
               critique and then recombine in his later writing (Finch 36). Yet this argument begs
               the question of how much both sets of conventions are bound up together, not just
               in the works of Ann Radcliffe, but in the deliberate launching of the post-medieval
               Gothic in Horace Walpole’s <em>The Castle of Otranto</em> of 1764-65. The most provocative approach to Shelley’s Gothicism, though, has been
               offered by Tilottama Rajan. For her <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em> put in “question the cultural stereotypes in which they remain caught” because of
               their Gothic predecessors, so much so that they both “write” and “withdraw a transgressive
               narrative” at the same time (Rajan 243). That is because they emphasize the “floating”
               nature of long-overused signifiers, including their Gothicized character-types, and
               use them, especially the Ginotti of the Wolfstein plot also called “Nempere” in the
               Eloise plot, to suggest a “semantic excess” of inconsistent references to incompatible
               texts, from the very old to the current, that exposes “the overdetermination of social
               and psychic texts in which” Shelley’s early Gothic form of “narrative has its genesis”
               (Rajan 243, 245, 246). Nevertheless, the question remains: are these semi-transgressions
               almost entirely Shelley’s, given how emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or
               are they really creative extensions of what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically
               does in the conflicting tendencies endemic to its symbolic constitution?</p>
            <p>I want to argue for the second of these alternatives. Shelley, I believe, especially
               in the best work of his final year as it builds on the most Gothic features of his
               early fictions, exploits the symbolic possibilities, including the contradictions,
               most basic to the Gothic as a mixed and self-questioning mode. He does so to such
               an extent that it is those very dynamics that often make his final writings what they
               are, and it is the very nature of the Gothic as he first explored it that sets the
               stage for those late “triumphs” as they deal with the conflicting systems of belief
               that he kept attempting to bridge throughout his writing. Indeed, I think that Shelley
               develops a “Gothic complex” of interacting symbolic processes, based on elements he
               experiments with as early as <em>Zastrozzi</em> and the poems preceding it, that is carried out quite thoroughly as late as <em>The Triumph of Life </em>and consequently fulfills the potentials for suggestion most inherent in the Gothic
               features of his earliest work, ones that end up driving Shelley as much as he employs
               and transmogrifies them.</p>
            <p>Although Whatley has more recently seen such a dynamic (as I do too) in the movement
               of the “Shape all Light” recounted by Shelley’s re-creation of Rousseau (Whatley 2003,
               80-89), this Gothic complex is manifested most fully in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, as I read it (Shelley 2002a, 483-500), when its Narrator describes the victims of
               “Life’s” captivation of them by emphasizing how much their methods of self-definition
               sadly resemble the symbolic rendering of Life itself in its all-conquering chariot.
               That parallel is most visible in the passages from <em>The Triumph </em>I now cite here from the Narrator’s dream-vision, particularly when the “shadow” overarching
               each walker reappears in the “dusky hood” of Life’s shapeless “Shape”: </p>

            <p> In addition, the importance of this whole pattern is underscored by the replaying
               of it later in the dream-<em>within</em>-the-main-dream recalled by the shade of Rousseau as he remembers his own first envisioning
               of the same parade. There he sees its profusion of “dim forms” as proceeding, on the
               one hand, from the draining of substance from the body that each shadow recalls and,
               on the other, from the “creative [or is it de-creative?] ray” of Life’s central “car”

            <p> I find that Shelley’s “Gothic complex” is never more active than at these moments
               and that these manifestations collectively bring forth the cruxes of his earlier Gothicism,
               their deepest symbolic roots in the Walpolean Gothic, and the kinds of meanings that
               can best be located in this kind of fiction-making, which is indeed both highly regressive
               and radically progressive at the same time.</p>
            <p>To begin with, the “shadows” of themselves projected by, yet finally controlling,
               Life’s prisoners are indeed allusions to the material simulacra given off by objects
               and people in Book IV of Lucretius’s <em>De rerum natura</em> (ca. 55 BC), also a critique of imperial Rome (Turner 281-82). But they recall just
               as much what Terry Castle has so perceptively seen in Radcliffe’s Gothic of the mid-1790s:
               the tendency in her (as well as Shelley’s) Lockean sense of perception to “spectralize”
               whatever impressions it receives, given that all perceptions are not objects but traces
               on the <span class="foreign">tabula rasa</span> of our sensorium. This vision of “all things existing only as perceived,” an axiom
               used in both Shelley’s essay “On Life” (1819) and his <em>Defence of Poetry</em> (1821; Shelley 2002a, 506 and 533), results in a Radcliffean world-view, as Castle
               puts it, based on an “absorbing faith in the fantastic” whereby every ghost-like trace
               — each overlaid by a mental interpretation of it formed out of “ideas” developed from
               memories of other such traces — turns every other person or object or landscape into
               a phantom, including externalizations interpreted (as so many are) to be mirrors of
               the self (Castle 246). Such an empirical-but-also-Gothic understanding, Shelley comes
               to see under Radcliffe’s influence among others, produces “a kind of thinking dominated
               by nostalgic mental images” whereby “phatasmic objects” seem “even more real at times
               than the material world” (Castle 247). As a result, the perceivers of such phantasms
               as self-images, for example the slaves of Life in Shelley’s <em>Triumph</em>, submit their thinking to spectral figures of themselves based on a past that is
               taken to be more real and permanent than it really is or was. Their self-images thus
               become in their eyes fixed definitions of their “selves” to which they believe they
               must submit, even though those “dim forms” are actually ghosts of what is dead (made
               explicit by the skeletal “old anatomies” in <em>The Triumph</em>). Indeed, that extension of spectralization, as Rousseau’s dream presents it, means
               that such self-images can operate like “vampire-bats,” less a figure from Radcliffe
               and more of a nod to the gradual Gothicizing of the vampire-figure in the eighteen-teens
               by Byron and Coleridge, then Mary Shelley, then John Polodori’s <em>The Vamypre</em> (1819; see Hogle 2004). Shelley’s 1822 bloodsuckers, each being a version of thought’s
               empire over itself, psychologically drain the life out of every perceiver who believes
               himself subject to them as permanent points of reference and so keeps obeying his
               former sense of his own nature. In that way, they enact the Death-in-Life that captivates
               those who have accepted the control of a master construct (“Life”) also “de-form[ed]”
               vampirically by its own “dusky hood,” the “shadow of a tomb” or “old anatomy” to which
               It, itself an antiquated perception of existence, keeps submitting over and over.</p>
            <p>After all, this Gothic retrospection also harkens back to Walpole’s <em>Otranto, </em>beyond its own echoes of Locke, to the way the three different ghosts there are far
               more shades of shades than they are specters of bodies. As I have noted on other occasions
               (as in Hogle 2012), one <em>Otranto </em>specter is an enlarged fragment of an effigy over a grave (almost <em>literally</em> the “shadow of a tomb”), another is an image that walks out of a full-length portrait,
               and the third, the ghost of the Hermit of Joppa who intones warnings from the mouth
               of his fleshless skull (anticipating Shelley’s “old anatomies”), is a blatant re-presentation
               of a <span class="foreign">dance macabre</span> skeleton from medieval painting. All of these are thoroughly floating signifiers,
               “shadows of shadows” in Rousseau’s words from Shelley’s <em>Triumph</em>, not surprising, it turns out, for a Protestant author (Horace Walpole) whose equally
               famous letters celebrate his own antiquarianism as a playing with old icons that “cannot
               disappoint” because there is no longer any “reason to quarrel with their emptiness”
               (Walpole 1937-83, 10: 192). In the Preface to his first edition of <em>Otranto</em>, we should remember, where he pretends to be the translator of a post-Reformation
               manuscript that once kept alive a Catholicism that for him <em>should</em> be fading, Walpole sets up all the Catholic specters and machinery in his tale to
               be viewed as symbols “exploded now even from romances” and thus emptied of their old
               grounds of belief even as they continue to play those out for audiences of a later
               time (Walpole 1996, 6). Consequently, readers of what Walpole himself labeled the
               first new kind of “Gothic Story” in his Second Edition of <em>Otranto</em> (1996, 3) face tormented characters, often debating within themselves, whose beliefs
               make them subject to “phantoms” that are actually “dim forms,” yet forms which they
               take to be indicators of unchangeable reference-points in the past haunting them by
               drawing them back towards those supposed grounds, however outdated. Walpole’s own
               critique of the medieval Gothic materials in his neo-Gothic, we find, right along
               with his and Radliffe’s Lockean sense of perception, is clearly among the fundamental
               pretexts for Shelley’s critique of the way so many of us enslave ourselves to a fixed
               sense of life by accepting old symbolic orders, especially in the ways we mirror ourselves
               to ourselves in what are really the “base broods” (or symbolic constructs) of “old
               anatomies.”</p>
            <p>At the same time, though, the Gothic, even for Walpole, is not that simple, so neither
               is Shelley’s “Gothic complex” in <em>The Triumph </em>and elsewhere. As much as Walpolean Gothic figures can be exposed as “floating signifiers”
               separable from their older grounds and thus able to signify newer ones, there is an
               insistent antiquity in them, much as there is in Shelley’s reenactment of Dantean
               and Petrarchan dream-visions and terza-rima verse-forms along with echoes of the eighteenth-century
               Gothic in his new <em>Trionf</em>. Such a paradox at the very core of the Gothic indicates (in David Punter’s words),
               yes, a “fear of the violence of the past and its power over the present,” hence <em>The Triumph</em>’s vision of Life as echoing ancient Rome’s paradings of its captives, but also a
               “longing for many of the qualities” and secure grounds of belief “which that past
               possessed” or at least seemed to in retrospect (Punter 418). As Karl Marx has shown,
               the rise of new ideologies and modes of production struggles against the still-powerful
               draw of older beliefs and systems of exchange, and the Gothic is the most flagrant
               symbolic manifestation of that cultural contestation in the history of English fiction-making.
               The pull of “ancient romance” elements, “exploded” as they are, is just as strong
               in the neo-Gothic as the pull of the more “modern” ones akin to the rising middle-class
               novel, according to Walpole’s definition of “Gothic Story” in his Preface to <em>Otranto</em>’s Second Edition (Walpole 1996, 9-11). That looking-backwards-and-forwards simultaneously,
               like the “Janus-faced Shadow” that actually drives Life’s chariot for Shelley, coincides
               with Walpole’s preference, which he expressed in the 1750s, for keeping at least a
               “shadow of monarchy” on an otherwise “empty chair of state,” like the “ghost of Banquo”
               in Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em> (Walpole 1847, 377), rather than facing the uncertainties of total revolution that
               eventually made England (and even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France. It is
               for these reasons that E.J. Clery has so correctly viewed the first “Gothic Story”
               as setting a pattern by both articulating and disguising a profound “contradiction”
               in the culture of Walpole’s time, in his case “between the traditional claims of [aristocratic]
               landed property and the new claims for the [bourgeois] private family” (Clery 77).
               With its Janus-faced symbols, style, and focus on characters so internally conflicted,
               the Gothic has consequently become in the post-Renaissance West <em>the </em>fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the culture
               between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced, as the fear of death
               and dissolution are in Edmund Burke’s terror-based “Sublime” also basic to the Gothic
               tradition, yet where those unresolved quandaries are hyperbolically reenacted and
               played out in the guise of concurrently retrograde and experimental fiction able to
               be conservative and progressive all at once.</p>
            <p>Shelley’s continuation of the Gothic in his <em>Triumph</em>, therefore, is willingly pulled towards the kind of enslavements to patterns of sin
               allegorized by Petrarch and Dante, yet it remains determined to show that their very
               Catholic patterns of God-centered allegory are based on the projections of mere thoughts
               into externalized “shadows” that have come to be interpreted as absolute truths and
               thus as tyrannizing sources of “fear” enforcing submission – all of which is a use
               of allegorical figures to attack the premises of old allegory itself, without leaving
               them behind altogether, alongside resurrections of Walpolean and Burkean “old anatomies”
               to show how such emptied-out figures can still have the psychological force they do.
               Ultimately Shelley realizes in his rendering of <em>The Triumph of Life</em> that he, his poem, and his audience cannot entirely escape from the systems of belief
               he wants to explode in it, one reason for the persistence of the construction of Life
               that drives this poem’s throngs while Life itself turns out to be no more than a “Shape”
               continuously being un-shaped and re-shaped again. Even the shade of Rousseau, in serving
               as a Virgilian truth-teller to Shelley’s Dantean Narrator, is unable to overcome a
               lingering contradiction of ideologies in his own beliefs only somewhat revised from
               those of the author of whom he is a sympathetic critique. As much as he blames himself
               for striving to arrest and confine the movement of the “Shape all light” in his dream-within-the-Narrator’s-dream,
               even as it keeps transfiguring itself from state to state, “forever sought, forever
               lost” (l. 431), that Shape is itself a retrospective Beatricean as well as a revolutionary
               “Asia” or “Witch of Atlas” figure from Shelley’s earlier poetry. Rousseau in Shelley’s
               <em>Triumph</em> thus remains undecided as to how much his own submission to “Life” is his willful
               fault in the face of her transference across traces of perception <em>or</em> how much that failing results from the necessary influence of the environment in
               which he was placed while he lived: “if the spark with which heaven lit my spirit
               / Earth had with purer nutriment supplied,” he wonders in a passage <em>not</em> cited above that echoes the Wordsworth “Immortality” Ode about which Shelley was
               always conflicted, would “Corruption . . . not now thus much inherit / Of what was
               once Rousseau” and now both is and is not him simultaneously (ll. 201-04)? The struggle
               Shelley famously had with William Godwin’s view of Necessity within his early “Gothic
               sensibility” (as Donald Reiman called it in 1981) – how much is behavior determined
               by choice or by environment? — is manifestly unresolved in his final unfinished poem,
               and we now see it is the persistence of the Gothic in that very <em>Triumph</em> that most conceals and reveals that irresolution, and many other quandaries of Shelley’s
               era, even as he was about to set sail into the Gulf of Spezia.</p>
            <p>In any case, speaking of echoes, this whole Gothic process conjoined with others is,
               in its “complex” of disparate yet interconnected elements, remarkably, if not completely,
               similar to what we often see in <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em>, published 11-12 years earlier. Consider this passage taken from <em>Zastrozzi</em>, a moment so typical of the overwrought characterizations in this tale’s constant
               echoing of <em>The Monk</em> and <em>Zofloya</em> that it could have come from almost any chapter, though is here excerpted from near
               the end: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">For a time Matilda stood immovable. At last she looked on Verezzi; she gazed downwards
                  [since he had cast himself at her feet] upon his majestic and youthful figure; she
                  looked upon his soul-illumined countenance, and tenfold love assailed her softened
                  soul. She raised him – in an oblivious delirium of sudden fondness she clasped him
                  to her bosom and, in wild and hurried expressions, asserted her right to his love.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">Her breast palpitated with fierce emotions; she pressed her burning lips to his; most
                  fervent, most voluptuous sensations of ecstacy reveled through her bosom.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">Verezzi caught the infection; in an instant of oblivion, every fidelity which he had
                  sworn to another, like a baseless cloud, dissolved away; a Lethean torpor crept over
                  his senses; he forgot Julia, or remembered her only as an uncertain vision, which
                  floated before his fancy more as an ideal being of another world, which he might thereafter
                  adore there, than as an enchanting and congenial female, to whom his oaths of eternal
                  fidelity had been given. (Shelley 2002b, 139) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> While it does repeat the spectralized images of other beings projected and then obsessed
               upon by the characters of both Lewis and Dacre, with Radcliffe hovering in the background,
               this moment has the confused Verezzi, not knowing he is Zastrozzi’s hated half-brother,
               envision his long-time projection of the remembered “Julia” as separating from her
               now “uncertain” form in the past and receding behind the Matilda who has relentlessly
               pursued him, yet explicitly <em>without</em> Julia disappearing as his ultimate ideal. <em>This</em> complex recalls the ending of Walpole’s <em>Otranto</em> where Theodore, finally revealed as the Castle’s true heir, accepts marriage to the
               Isabella once pursued by the usurping Manfred but keeps thinking of the dead “Matilda”
               (here the daughter of Manfred) whom he loved devotedly before she died, as Verezzi
               thinks Julia has at this point in <em>Zastrozzi</em>. Shelley’s early Gothic thereby replays the figural pattern of <em>Otranto</em>’s final sentence, in which Theodore decides “he could know no happiness but in the
               society of one [Isabella] with whom he could forever indulge the melancholy that had
               taken possession of his soul” because of Matilda’s irreversible absence and yet her
               constant looming in a remembered past that remains an absolute point of reference
               (Walpole 1996, 115), like the primal crimes revealed as the causes of all the specters
               of specters in the first neo-“Gothic Story.”</p>
            <p>The quintessentially Janus-faced nature of Walpole’s prototypical Gothic figure has
               undeniably been transferred from <em>The Castle of Otranto </em>to <em>Zastrozzi</em>, even to <em>its</em> ending where the title character who rejects all religious traditions also confesses
               the root of his vengeance to be the dying words of his mother (Shelley 2002b, 155).
               To much the same extent, we can now see, too, the floating signifier of Julia’s image
               for Verezzi, reinforced by Matilda’s obsession with his surface “countenance” since
               the start of Shelley’s novel, Gothically anticipates the “shadows of shadows” in the
               same author’s late <em>Triumph</em> as they drift from their past referents while being held fixedly by their projector-observers
               to those very receding grounds, dead though they already are or, like Verezzi and
               Julia, are about to be. Shelley could not have conceived of what is really the “moment
               of truth” in <em>The Triumph</em>, the choice between accepting the drift of signifiers towards future redefinitions
               and the re-anchoring of them to dead “anatomies” from the past, unless there had been
               the tug-of-war in the Walpolean Gothic figure that he had thoroughly played with in
               his more youthful writings. He also would not have had as apt a symbolic mode for
               half-concealing and half- revealing <em>The Triumph of Life</em>’s hesitations between free-willed choice and the pressure of one’s historical conditions
               if he had not worked with and continued to employ a Gothic mode <em>designed by its nature</em> to be a repository for unresolved conflicts among contending beliefs. In the <em>Zastrozzi</em> passage above, we have to admit, the text hesitates, just as <em>The Triumph </em>will, between condemning the characters for their essentially selfish choices and
               suggesting that such choices are already made for them. After all, the same characters
               keep making the same errors again and again within the pervasive atmosphere of their
               Gothic environment. These are stances toward which they are driven, like the victims
               of Shelley’s “Life,” by what Godwin invokes in the original main title of his quite
               Gothic <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794): the necessary consequences of “Things As They Are.”</p>
            <p>Now we can see the fully Gothic basis of what previous interpreters have begun to
               find in Shelley’s early romances, as well as the essentials of the “Gothic complex”
               that are transferred almost intact from Walpole through the Gothic of the 1790s to
               the early Shelley and to <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. Myriad contradictions of character cannot be resolved in <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em>, as Behrendt has said, because their very construction is rooted in the Gothic’s
               <em>at least</em> two-directional tug of war between older and newer conceptions of human psychology
               as well as waning and developing economies. The equally “irresolvable middle state
               between the motivated symbol and the atheist sign” found by Whatley in Shelley’s Gothic
               novels stems from their Walpolean mix of retrogression and rebellion that makes characters
               and images both potentially floating signifiers and entities attractively anchored
               in past realities, causes, and beliefs even when those are truly dead and gone. Finch’s
               sense of the conflict between the tragically fated Gothic and the assumptions of sentimentalism
               in the plots of <em>St. Irvyne</em>, meanwhile, actually stems from that novel’s acceptance of a Gothic mode that has,
               since its beginnings and <em>not</em> just in Radcliffe, internally combined freely-chosen states of feeling with fated
               hauntings from older assumptions, as in the ending of <em>Otranto</em> where Theodore willfully accepts a woman because she can help him indulge his “melancholy”
               over his lost true love but also because he cannot help himself as the destined resolver
               of an age-old usurpation guided, perhaps from heaven, towards a marriage that reunites
               the two families with the most sanctioned claims to the castle of Otranto. The quite
               similar depiction of unresolved tensions between external and internal causalities
               in <em>Zastrozzi,</em> <em>St. Irvine,</em> and <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is made possible, after all, by the Walpolean Gothic providing unique verbal means
               specifically for configuring ideological conflicts and their nagging irresolution.
               Finally, too, what we have learned from Professor Rajan’s 1990s take on Shelley’s
               use of Gothic (apart from what she has added in this very collection) depends entirely
               on the Gothic itself being inherently a mode dominated by the uprooted, though also
               backward-looking, signifier that can refer in its incessant mobility to many different
               texts and ideologies of its own and former times – and thereby to the conflicting
               ideologies in its many pre-texts that always (in Rajan’s words) “overdetermine” it
               and make its symbols refer to a “semantic excess” of “indeterminate” cultural debates.
               This dynamic is part of the disunified “essence” of the Gothic in which, as Rajan
               has said, “reality has been replaced by hyperreality, and mimesis by the simulacrum”
               (Rajan 243). I contend that Shelley’s critiques of his own culture from <em>Zastrozzi</em> to <em>The Triumph of Life </em>employ the Gothic as powerfully as they do precisely by bringing forward these deep
               tensions at the core of it. This is the “Gothic complex” he develops across his career
               so as to help his audiences realize the crossroads of choices they face, unless they
               chose to ignore them, between the most retrospective and destructive and the most
               progressive and liberating options for the ways we can construct Life for ourselves
               then, now, and in the future.</p>
