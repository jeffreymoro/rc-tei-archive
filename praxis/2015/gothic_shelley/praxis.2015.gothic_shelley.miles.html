            <p>According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was ‘totalizing’; it explained
               everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of agency that could
               effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the Gothic necessary for Shelley?
               Part of our answer lies in the fact that Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial
               points. At the heart of the post-Walpolian Gothic’s ‘symbolic constitution’ lies the
               ‘dead hand of the past’, a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the
               present, but holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious
               circles of transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the generations.
               As we shall see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the crux that motivates
               <em>The Cenci</em>. But by the time Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had
               been made to its symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his purposes.
               These changes were instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <em>Der Geisterseher</em> (1789; translated as the Ghost-seer, 1795) and William Godwin in <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794).</p>
            <p class="noCount">Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic was to provide a narrative form for
               representing the threat of conspiracy, whether revolutionary or Counter-Reformational.
               </p>
            <p class="noCount">It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he refers
               to the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions” he is just one of many
               radicals responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic constitution and chivalry, the
               legal and social customs he celebrates as the ties that bind the English present.</p>
            <p class="noCount">All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in the late
               1810s) come together in <em>The Cenci</em>:</p>
            <p class="noCount">As a work of abstracted Gothic, <em>The Cenci</em> explores the problematic nature of modern systems of power by drawing upon the symbolic
               constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller and post-Godwin. In the preface
               to <em>The Cenci</em> Shelley references the key elements of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution that will
               concern him: the dead hand of the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions
               that live on in the present; the tendency of this influence to leave us living in
               vicious circles of abuse; a moral antinomy that prods the reader into analytical action
               as a way of rising above such circles; the self-defeating nature of conspiracy; a
               belief in the totalizing power of tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining historical
               agency; the delusive glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and certainly not least,
               critique of Burke. After noting these key Gothic elements, Shelley’s thought takes
               a surprising turn. Rather than freeing us ‘self-anatomy’ is shown to lead to more
               Gothic entrapment. <em>The Cenci</em> suggests that the way to lighten the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions”
               is through the austere prescriptions of the categorical imperative.</p>
            <p class="noCount">In effect Shelley is telling us that he has moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding
               of conspiracy (the sublimity of the secret societies) to a more abstraction proposition
               in which counterproductive conspiracy (any literal endeavour) is compared unfavourably
               with a conspiracy to make the reader think.</p>

            </header><br/><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p><em>The Cenci</em> is one the few undisputed masterpieces of British Gothic/Romantic drama. The awkward
                  “Gothic/Romantic” is unavoidable. One might call <em>The Cenci</em> Gothic, but the locution begs the qualification provided by Tilottoma Rajan: “Thus
                  in Shelley’s major poems the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic.
                  . . . But equally. . . the Gothic is never free of the Romantic, which is to say that
                  Shelley allows us to grasp a transformative potential in the violence and perversity
                  of the Gothic that is less evident in more popular uses of the genre” (para 4). As
                  a belated work of meta-Gothic <em>The Cenci</em> is at an abstracted distance from a popular form that was, by 1819, already undergoing
                  its first revival after a twenty-year slump. As Jerrold Hogle argues in <em>Shelley’s Process</em>, <em>The Cenci</em> is a complex meditation on a spirit of tyranny Shelley experienced as all-pervasive
                  (95). Until about twenty years ago the honorific for this spirit of aesthetic adventure
                  was “Romantic,” whereas “Gothic” served as the abject shadow-term for non-penetrative
                  pulp fiction. But as Rajan further observes, matters are now much different: <span class="quote">‘For in the past several years the Gothic has arguably replaced the greater Romantic
                     lyric as a generic synecdoche for the field, though without the metacritical recognition
                     that M.H. Abrams gave the lyric. Or put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task
                     of deconstructing what has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic
                     ideology,” in particular because it makes manifest, almost schematically, what Godwin
                     calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions.” (para 4)’</span> Shelley’s ambition in <em>The Cenci</em> to help lift the “unintelligible burden of past institutions” is precisely why we
                  now say <em>The Cenci</em> is Gothic.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>However, the matter is not a simple one of substituted terms, so that we use “Gothic”
                     where we used to use “Romantic,” or “Romantick” where we formerly employed “Gothic.”
                     Still less is it one of accepting the terms as synonyms describing phenomena (such
                     as the simultaneous architectural and poetic revivals) unaccountably separated at
                     birth. Rather it is to follow Jerome McGann in acknowledging the necessity of articulating
                     the twin impulses of the period, one towards a Romantic idealization that obscures
                     history’s ruined forms and a countervailing Gothic revelation of their gloomy persistence.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> This is the point I understand Rajan to be making: that we cannot grasp the aesthetic
                     energies of the period without acknowledging a ceaseless dialectical play within them.
                     Gothic and Romantic are indispensable and interchangeable terms for delineating a
                     whole that is larger than either.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But to understand how this works we also have to answer Hogle’s vital question: “what
                  is really <em>most </em>fundamentally <em>Gothic—</em>and what is most fundamentally symbolized because of that Gothicism—in what continues
                  from” Shelley’s Gothic juvenilia “all the way to the unfinished <em>Triumph of Life</em>?” (para 1), including, obviously, <em>The Cenci</em>. If literary Gothic is a kind of narrative language, what does it enable Shelley
                  to say that cannot be said in any other fashion? Why was the Gothic necessary? And
                  why so central? If we are to understand <em>The Cenci</em> as a Gothic/Romantic work, where Gothic and Romantic voices are both in play, we
                  need to understand precisely what was Gothic about it, in the sense Hogle means when
                  he asks the question of Shelley’s sui generis syntheses (their characteristic “overdetermination
                  of social and psychic texts,” as Rajan puts it): “are these semi-transgressions almost
                  entirely Shelley’s, given how emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they
                  really creative extensions of what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in
                  the conflicting tendencies endemic to its symbolic constitution?” (para 2).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I agree with Hogle that the answer to his question is irrefutably the latter. Despite
                     the popularity of the Gothic in recent years criticism of <em>The Cenci</em> has been strangely resistant to the Gothic strain that runs through the play. Outside
                     the contributors to this volume, examples of sustained discussion of Shelley’s Gothicism
                     are hard to come by.

                     </div> This is a very strange omission, not least because, as my fellow contributors all
                     stress, Shelley begins, and ends, as a Gothic writer, starting with the ultra-Gothic
                     works <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em>. My take on his early Gothicism comes from Shelley’s friend and intellectual collaborator,
                     Thomas Love Peacock: <span class="quote">‘A few to think, and many to act; that is the only basis of a perfect society. So thought
                        the ancient philosophers: they had their esoterical and exoterical doctrines. So thinks
                        the sublime Kant, who delivers his oracles in language which none but the initiated
                        can comprehend. Such were the views of those secret associations of illuminati, which
                        were the terror of superstition and tyranny . . . (1.163)’</span> For Peacock, in <em>Nightmare Abbey</em>, the ideology he had to puncture was not Romantic but Gothic. That is to say, at
                     the time of writing (1818), he understood the camera obscura to be casting Gothic
                     shadows, where those shadows were, fashionably, those represented, <em>inter alia</em>, by Flosky and Cypress, Coleridge and Byron. As Peacock saw it, post-Waterloo the
                     dynasts were encouraging an esthetic that propped up church and state and all the
                     old flim-flam of the “ontic logos,”

                     a cultural fashion best understood as ‘Gothic’ (in other words, German and backward
                     looking). Flosky’s impenetrable mystic mumbo-jumbo and Cypress’s melancholic apathy
                     were two sides of the same, apolitical coin. The young, impressionable Scythrop, or
                     Shelley, is heading in the same direction until he throws off his Werther-esque leanings,
                     and learns to embrace a stiff, Epicurean neo-Classicism motivated by a proper Enlightened
                     critique (Butler 135). Until then, in a state of intellectual immaturity he dreams
                     of the sublime Kant and the Illuminati.</p>

                  developments possessed the irresistible glamour of the secret societies allegedly
                  plotting European-wide revolution. De Quincey’s retrospective essay on secret societies
                  eloquently expresses the attraction: <span class="quote">‘The very image, unveiling itself by unsteady glimpses, of men linked by brotherly
                     love and perfect confidence, meeting in secret chambers, at the noontide of night,
                     to shelter, by muffling, with their own persons interposed, and at their own risk,
                     some solitary lamp of truth—sheltering it from the carelessness of the world, and
                     its stormy ignorance; <em>that</em> would soon have blown it out—sheltering it from the hatred of the world; <em>that</em> would soon have made war upon its life—all this was superhumanly sublime. The fear
                     of those men was sublime; the courage was sublime; the stealthy, thief-like means
                     were sublime; the audacious end—viz., to change the kingdoms of earth—was sublime.
                     (244)’</span> For De Quincey, as much as for Peacock mocking the immature Scythrop, the operative
                  word for the illuminati was, indeed, “sublime.” The more incredible the stories—the
                  more they tested belief, shattering the mind’s tidy categories—the better: “Tertullian's
                  profession of believing things, not in spite of not being impossible, but simply because
                  they were impossible, is not the extravagance that most people suppose it” (239-40).
                  As a very young man De Quincey believed in Barruel’s and Robison’s paranoid fantasies
                  precisely because they seemed impossible to credit. They were sublime, because outlandish.</p>
               <p>De Quincey’s essay probes the reasons why, as a young man, he so deeply wanted to
                  believe in masonic conspiracy, which, as an adult, he now realizes was an “extensive
                  monument to elaborate humbug” (255). The essay starts with a humorous account of the
                  extended debate he developed with his governess, who was morally certain Augustin
                  Barruel was correct, and that they were all hourly menaced by conspirators who even
                  now were hatching their plots, and his pre-adolescent self, who would have ardently
                  agreed, for very different reasons, save for the gnawing presence of his rational
                  mind, which insisted on stumbling over the improbability. Peacock catches the attraction
                  for the young Shelley in his description of Scythrop, who had “become troubled with
                  the <em>passion for reforming the world</em>” (362), so much so that he “built many castles in the air, and peopled them with
                  secret tribunals, and bands of illuminati” and slept with <em>Horrid Mysteries</em> “under his pillow” (363). One of the <em>Northanger Abbey</em> “horrid” novels, <em>Horrid Mysteries</em> features, in scintillating detail, the machinations of the illuminati with their
                  torch-lit crypts, cells of conspirators, and revolutionary maidens willing to do anything
                  to advance the cause. Scythrop (like the young Shelley and De Quincey) dreams gothic
                  thoughts of the Schiller kind, just as Catherine Morland dreams hers through Radcliffe.</p>

                  <p>Reading Barruel was formative for the young Shelley in two regards. It was here that
                     he first encountered, methodically laid out in four stuffed volumes, tantalizing extracts
                     from the greatest hits of the radical enlightenment—the atheistical horrors of Voltaire,
                     the spine-tingling materialism of Spinoza, the rousing promise of Rousseau’s general
                     will—and it was here that he encountered a sublime conspiracy, where, with De Quincey,
                     his overwhelming response was a fervent prayer to the Deity begging Him/Her to make
                     Barruel’s phantasies come true.

                     </div> So devoted to conspiracy was the young Shelley, that he started his own at school
                     to extirpate the “Gothic”—that is to say, feudal—practice of “fagging” (Memoir 241).</p>
               </div>
               <p>As regards Shelley’s creative extensions of the “conflicting tendencies” endemic to
                  the “symbolic constitution of post-Walpolean Gothic,” two crucial points emerge from
                  this material. The first relates to the “mentalité” or “imaginary” of radical members
                  of Shelley’s generation. While Shelley’s generation might subscribe to the notion
                  of a progressive “spirit of the age,” they understood it to be one—and this was how
                  Hazlitt himself saw it—continuously buffeted by the headwinds of a spirit of tyranny
                  that was as all pervasive as it was systematic. The period did indeed appear to be
                  an age of conspiracy, although the conspiracy that mattered—or rather, the truly effective
                  conspiracy that shaped lives—was the one emanating from the government side, from
                  the “system of terror” administered through Pitt’s spy networks, to the gagging acts,
                  suspension of habeas corpus, and other repressive measures taken by the central authorities,
                  in a concerted effort to subvert the ancient liberties—and natural rights—of the British
                  populace. The illuminati, alas, might be fiction, but the police state, with its press
                  in the grip of the “paranoid style of politics,” was not. “Obsessed with the threat
                  of revolution, users of the paranoid style—conspiracy theorists by definition—ascribe
                  to their enemies the ability to effect large-scale social and political change” (para
                  2). So Kim Wheatley on the reviewing culture that targeted the Hunts, Keats, Shelley,
                  and other suspicious personages. Quoting Richard Hofstadter, she notes that for the
                  “paranoid rhetorician, ‘History is a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of
                  almost transcendent power’” (para 29). As Orrin Wang comments in his introduction
                  to the volume in which Wheatley’s essay appears, “the rhetoric and epistemology of
                  conspiratorial thought also acted in varying, emphatic ways upon the imaginary of
                  the second generation Romantics” (para 4). Shelley may have awoken from the self-incurred
                  immaturity of believing in a secret, Europe-wide brotherhood bent on sublime ends,
                  but it was only to a deeper appreciation of the systems of tyranny that gripped contemporary
                  life.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For those in the grip of the paranoid style, “the Illuminati were responsible for
                     both the American and French Revolutions. At such a point conspiracy absorbed all
                     other narratives, becoming the totalizing motor behind history itself” (Wang, para
                     3). For those opposed to the paranoid style, the key issue was producing “a more complex
                     historical causality” than simple conspiracy (Wang, para 5). Thus the lead article
                     of the first issue of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, written by Francis Jeffrey himself, which reviews Joseph Mournier’s memoir of his
                     time as a Girondin in the heart of the Revolution, which sets out to expose Barruel’s
                     work as utter fantasy, on the grounds that he was there, and there wasn’t a Freemason
                     to be seen, no matter how many beds one might lift, let alone a German member of the
                     illuminati. In his review Jeffrey advances economic and social causes for the revolution.

                     with a plan.</p>
               </div>
               <p>According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was “totalizing”; it explained
                  everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of agency that could
                  effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the Gothic necessary for Shelley?
                  Part of our answer lies in the fact that Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial
                  points. At the heart of the post-Walpolian Gothic’s “symbolic constitution” lies the
                  “dead hand of the past,” a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the
                  present, but holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious
                  circles of transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the generations.
                  As we shall see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the crux that motivates
                  <em>The Cenci</em>. But by the time Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had
                  been made to its symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his purposes.
                  These changes were instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <em>Der Geisterseher</em> (1789; translated as the <em>Ghost-seer</em>, 1795) and Willian Godwin in <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Schiller’s <em>Ghost-seer</em> is the first work of conspiracy fiction in the Western literary tradition. A young
                     German prince from a Protestant principality with a “love of the marvellous” falls
                     under the spell of the mysterious “Armenian” while visiting Venice during carnival.
                     The Armenian has a habit of popping up at unexpected moments whispering hints to the
                     Prince respecting forms of immanent danger, including a séance arranged by the “Sicilian,”
                     an obvious reference to Count Cagliostro, magus, friend of mankind, and secret agent
                     of the Illuminati ever since he passed through Ingolstadt following his expulsion
                     from St. Petersburg for plotting revolution with the Swedish freemasons.

                     mystic symbols, oaths, and the technology of the phantasmagoria. So impressed is the
                     Prince by the Armenian that he eventually comes to repose all his trust in him, suspending
                     his critical faculties in the process. The Armenian, we eventually learn, is an agent
                     of the Inquisition (the same Inquisition that was later to arrest, torture, and imprison
                     Cagliostro). The exposure of the Sicilian was the first step in an elaborate sting
                     designed to turn the impressionable Prince away from Protestantism, back to Catholicism,
                     as a last ditch effort of the Counter-Enlightenment. Schiller’s novel was immensely
                     influential. Besides such works as Cajetan Tschink’s <em>The Victim of Magical Delusion: or, the Mystery of the Revolution of P----l; A Magico-Political
                        Tale</em> (1795) and Karl Grosse’s <em>Horrid Mysteries</em> (1796), it inspired Shelley’s Juvenilia. Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic
                     was to provide a narrative form for representing the threat of conspiracy, whether
                     revolutionary or Counter-Reformational.</p>

                  <p>It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he refers

                     radicals responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic constitution and chivalry, the
                     legal and social customs he celebrates as the ties that bind the English present.
                     For Wollstonecraft in <em>The Rights of Man</em> “Gothic” serves as a synonym for “feudal,” a note she sounds whenever she touches
                     upon Burke’s idealisations of social and legal traditions; for Thomas Christie the <em>Reflections</em>’ “tuneful periods” entomb a “deformed Gothic idol”; while for Thelwall Burke’s constitution
                     is a Gothic customary, a mental Bastille.

               </div>
               <p>In <em>Caleb Williams</em> the task of demystification follows a severe logic. The present system of tyranny
                  is indeed all pervasive. No point, then, in railing against chivalry (loaded as it
                  is with its Burkean freight). Godwin shows the totalizing system in action, down to
                  the institutional forms of conspiracy Falkland is able to bring to bear upon the errant
                  individual, and from which there is no escape, as Caleb discovers. Instead the task
                  of puzzling the contradictions, and so breaking free from the immaturity of customary
                  thought, is left to the reader.</p>
               <p>All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in the late
                  1810s) come together in <em>The Cenci</em>: the dead hand of the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that live
                  on in the present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral antinomy that prods
                  the reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of
                  tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining historical agency; the delusive glamour
                  of the sublime; and, finally, and certainly not least, critique of Burke. To this
                  mix Shelley adds, I believe, the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant.</p>

                     crucial points, both of which touch upon <em>The Cenci</em>. Firstly, it ironically underscores the reason why conspiracy theories flourished

                     notes the way the followers of Weishaupt replicate the very power structure they look

                     the problem. Whatever solution is needed to the present discontent, it is not more

               </div>
               <p>As a work of abstracted Gothic, <em>The Cenci</em> explores the problematic nature of modern systems of power by drawing upon the symbolic
                  constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller and post-Godwin. As is to be
                  expected of such a belated, self-conscious work, much of the meaning is placed before
                  us on the surface, is indeed collected for us in the preface: <span class="quote">‘The Cenci Palace is of great extent; and though in part modernized, there yet remains
                     a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful
                     scenes which are the subject of this tragedy. (para 9)’</span> The phrasing echoes one of the great cliché’s of the period, Blackstone’s metaphor
                  comparing English law to “an old Gothic castle, erected in the days of chivalry, but
                  fitted up for a modern inhabitant” (124). Shelley flips the image, emphasizing, not
                  the modern convenience, but the Gothic structure’s feudal remnants. Shelley’s anti-Burkean
                  phrasing emphasizes the past as a negative force, one drawing us back into the feudal
                  pile’s vast and gloomy reaches. The phrasing does two things: it calls to mind the
                  notion that the nation lives on in a Gothic house (horrifyingly so for Thelwall; reassuring
                  for Burke) and it sets in motion the play’s dominant metaphor, the somewhat trite
                  comment that the human heart is a dark, treacherous place.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The preface’s other de rigeur note is the acknowledgement that the horrors passing

                        fabric of life. It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind admiration; not
                        a rule for moral conduct. (para 5)’</span> One might dismiss this as stock Gothicism, as a reminder that truly diabolical acts

                     reluctantly concedes). So stock, in fact, that most critics pass over the remark in
                     silence, as if embarrassed by it as an otiose reminder of Shelley’s predictable anti-Catholicism.
                     In fact it is an attempt to articulate one of Shelley’s key concerns. Just as Beatrice
                     Cenci lived and thought amidst a set of “background”

                     of comprehension, alienation, and self-reflexive scrutiny, so do we live and think
                     amongst our own enveloping fabric. Beatrice’s attempts at self-analysis and self-knowledge
                     end in abject failure, precisely because she is fully enmeshed in the background understanding
                     of her culture, in its enveloping, and constitutive, systems of power (her mind-forged
                     manacles, as Blake would style them). She has no coin of vantage that would allow
                     her to step outside. The point Shelley is driving at, is that the modern reader, whether
                     Catholic, Protestant or atheist, also lacks a place where they can stand outside their
                     culture and take in the landscape. Shelley argues that the task of stepping outside
                     is not hopeless, just strenuous.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Shelley’s statement of the play’s lesson appears to be a mere bromide: <span class="quote">‘The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching
                        the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of itself;
                        in proportion to the possession of which knowledge, every human being is wise, just,
                        sincere, tolerant and kind. (para 4)’</span> This sounds like trite codswollop. It is. We are meant to catch the broad irony, especially
                     in the closing phrase. And that is because the lesson of the play is to be found on
                     either side of this sentence. The key binary is the one closing Shelley’s statement
                     on Catholicism: “It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind admiration;
                     not a rule for moral conduct.” The sources of right action are not to be found within
                     religious belief, within our background understanding. The sources Shelley urges are
                     more abstract and demanding. They emerge from the telling of the tale: <span class="quote">‘Such a story, if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who
                        once acted it, their hopes and fears, their confidences and misgivings, their various
                        interests, passions, and opinions, acting upon and with each other, yet all <em>conspiring</em> to one tremendous end, would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark
                        and secret caverns of the human heart (emphasis added). (para 1)’</span> As Ann McWhir notes in her commentary on it, the passage turns on two applications
                     of the word “conspiracy.”

                     </div> The characters in the play conspire to murder Cenci; at the same time the representation
                     of their feelings is a conspiracy to shake up the reader (the sneaky work, one might
                     say, of an unacknowledged legislator). In effect Shelley is telling us that he has
                     moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding of conspiracy (the sublimity of the
                     secret societies) to a more abstract proposition in which counterproductive conspiracy
                     (any literal endeavour) is compared unfavourably with a conspiracy to make the reader
                     think. A representation of the conflicting feelings mobilized by a moral antinomy
                     will subtly immerse the reader in the same murky quarters of the human heart as those
                     traversed by the conspirators. Only then can a process of moral and psychological
                     discovery begin.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Shelley’s statement of the process does indeed sound strenuous: <span class="quote">‘It is in the restless and anatomising casuistry with which men seek the justification
                     of Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs justification; it is in the superstitious
                     horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs, and their revenge, that the dramatic
                     character of what she did and suffered, consists. (para 4)’</span> More recent critics of the play see this statement as the key to Shelley’s intentions.
                  Shelley presents us with a moral antinomy from which there is no easy egress. We feel
                  at once that Beatrice was both justified and wrong in taking her revenge. Through
                  our sympathetic engagement with the representations of her predicament—and the rights
                  and wrongs of the actions taken—we finally come to know our own dark heart, and our
                  own inner caverns.</p>
               <p>That seems to be the drift of Shelley’s preface, and, indeed, of the play’s argument.
                  However, I believe this inference to be mistaken. The clues to this misreading lie
                  in the words “casuistry,” “anatomising,” and “superstitious.” In contemplating Beatrice’s
                  “wrongs and their revenge” the reader initially reacts with “superstitious horror.”
                  Whatever Shelley has in mind for the reader, it surely involves more than terrified
                  stupefaction. Presumably it involves some kind of critical introspection through our
                  sympathetic engagement with the moral antinomy of Beatrice’s revenge, perhaps into
                  our own dark heart. However, as Mary Fin points out in her analysis of the play, “casuistry”
                  held a particular, negative, valence for Shelley. She persuasively quotes De Quincey
                  as someone likely to have had an understanding of casuistry similar to Shelley’s (indeed,
                  De Quincey may be recalling Shelley’s preface and play). The problem with casuistry
                  was that it</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">held aloft a torch for exploring guilty recesses of human life which it is far better
                  for us all to leave in their original darkness. Crimes that were often all but imaginary,
                  extravagancies [sic] of erring passion that would never have been known as possibilities
                  to the young and the innocent, were thus published in their most odious details. (qtd.
                  in Fin 190)</blockquote>
               <p>Henry S. Richardson explains what it is De Quincey is complaining about: <span class="quote">‘The Roman Catholic casuists of the middle ages did so by drawing on Aristotle's categories.
                     Accordingly, they asked, where, when, why, how, by what means, to whom, or by whom
                     the action in question is to be done or avoided... The idea was that complete answers
                     to these questions would contain all of the features of the action, of which the morally
                     relevant ones would be a subset. (2.3 para 2)’</span> Casuistry proceeds from cases, not theories. In any particular case the casuist begins
                  by comparing the case in hand with an existing stock of settled, therefore paradigm,
                  cases, in order to determine if there is a moral principle that would inform the present
                  instance. But in order to determine if there was an applicable rule one would need
                  to canvass the action in all its lights and possibilities. Hence De Quincey’s complaint:
                  the priest might review a moral issue occasioned by a young person’s desire, but in
                  such exhausting detail, involving hitherto undreamt of permutations, that the young
                  person in question would find his or her mind subtly polluted by the moral quest as
                  he or she contemplated possible sins for the first time. At the bottom of De Quincey’s
                  complaint is the unspoken fear that the act of naming has a talismanic power. To explore
                  one’s own dark heart, one would in casuistical fashion need to name and identify a
                  desire in all its permutations. The act of bringing them to light is also the act
                  of bringing them to horrific life. Named, they flicker, and become real. The fear
                  is not materially different from the one Matthew Lewis appeals to when he cautions
                  mothers not to let their daughters read the Bible lest their minds be polluted by
                  its racy subject matter.</p>
               <p>The notion is directly canvassed in the play. Orsino, in a soliloquy, lets us in on
                  his conspiracy to seduce Beatrice. “From the devices of my love,” he tells us, he
                  shall form a net from “which she shall not escape.” Yet he fears </p>

               <p> As good post-Freudians our reflex is to read “anatomize” positively as a virtual
                  synonym for therapeutic psycho-analysis. In fact Shelley is using anatomizing as a
                  modifier for casuistry, specifying, in the process, a particularly pernicious kind.
                  Orsino’s repetition of the figure later in the play makes this clear:</p>

               <p> The “self-anatomy” referred to by Orsino operates much like De Quincey’s casuistry:
                  “Crimes that were often all but imaginary . . . that would never have been known as
                  possibilities . . . were thus published in their most odious details.” The main difference
                  is that in <em>The Cenci</em> desires are no sooner “published” or named than they are acted. To drag them from
                  the heart’s gothic caverns is to succumb to them. If Beatrice has the trick, the master
                  is Cenci, the monstrous, malevolent patriarch whose oaths have a magical performative
                  power, beginning on himself. As Orsino notes, Cenci fell first through self-anatomy.
                  Not only does the act of cursing announce new desires and abominations to him but
                  the act of utterance itself seems to bring them about—or so Cenci believes, when the
                  malediction on his absent sons is immediately rewarded with news of the deaths he
                  devoutly wishes. </p>

               <p> As Eve Kososvky Sedgwick and Edgar Allan Poe both knew, live burial was the Gothic’s
                  master trope (the dead hand of the past being just another way of entombing the living).
                  At the root of the trope is a perverse boundary between self and other: where one
                  wants one (to keep invasive entities out) there isn’t one, and where one emphatically
                  doesn’t want a boundary (say, between you and life above ground) there is. The principle
                  extends to language, which can be a source of both ingress (deadly thoughts you can’t
                  keep out), and blockage (vital thoughts you can’t convey). In a moment of high camp,
                  Cenci threatens his wife with a theatrical version of live burial: being immured in
                  a ruined Gothic pile guarded by ruffians utterly immune to the pleadings of speech
                  or body. The trope recurs throughout the play. Cenci will shroud his daughter in an
                  impenetrable mist of infamy while Beatrice complains of being so shrouded, or sepulchured.
                  When it comes to the moment of self-polluting anatomy, when the conspirators first
                  conspire, their faces are alternatively an open book others can read, or mirrors shining
                  the viewer back upon himself.</p>

                  <p>One might think of this strand of Shelley’s imagery, from the Preface on, as a crypt.
                     Cenci’s victims are encrypted, as it were, buried alive or sepulchured inside the
                     perverted “mentalité” Cenci represents, incarnates, and spreads; while the crypts
                     or caverns of the mind disgorge poisonous mists. Self-anatomy simply speeds the process,
                     taking characters down to a place from where none return. Most critics of <em>The Cenci</em> note at some point that the play seems to end, disappointingly, with the simple truth
                     of the vicious circle entrapping both Cenci and the conspirators; that in conspiring
                     against Cenci’s undoubted evil, the conspirators, but especially Beatrice, replicate
                     the evil incarnate in the paternal principle.

                     in the play. The source for Jacobin Gothic was Burke’s project (and this was how Archibald
                     Alison understood matters in retrospect

                     Shelley tilts at Burke. In the final analysis the problem with casuistry was that
                     it was based on case law; it stands to morality as English common law does to jurisprudence.
                     It is based in practical reason, and is anti-theoretical in its stance. Casuistry
                     works—or worked—in the context of a settled society with established norms of moral
                     thought. “If we lack the kind of broad consensus on a set of paradigm cases on which
                     the Renaissance Catholic or Talmudic casuists could draw, our casuistic efforts will
                     necessarily be more controversial and tentative than theirs . . .” (Richardson, 2.3
                     para. 5). As moralists as diverse as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor have stressed,
                     modernity is what it is because all such bases for consensus evaporated in the course
                     of the Enlightenment. As Taylor puts it, we live in a mental universe where there
                     are competing and incommensurable frameworks and “hypergoods.”

                     </div> Moral antinomies are the order of the day. To rely upon “case law” is simply to replicate
                     the particular system of power—its particular frameworks woven deep into the fabric
                     of life—of a particular social interest. Faced with moral antinomies our reflex prejudices,
                     even if expressive of our morals and manners—in other words, even in the best case
                     Burke presents—can only replicate the system.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We need to put the matter like this in order to grasp the radical nature of Shelley’s
                  thought. It begins with his response to Burke who was, for Jacobins, the high priest
                  of case law, the English common law, the unwritten constitution, and the inherited
                  stock of wisdom bound up in manners. As a moralist, Burke was a casuist. In <em>The Cenci</em> Shelley is a militant Kantian. Burke offered “adoration, faith, submission, penitence,
                  blind admiration”—slavishness, according to his Jacobin critics—not rules for moral
                  conduct. In the Gothic world Shelley depicts—which is clearly also our world—live
                  burial is all pervasive, like conspiracy. Or to change the register, and once again
                  draw upon Hogle, our present is uniformly distorted by the dark powers of transference.
                  Damaged by the system, we project that damage onto others, in infinite series. In
                  the current system, self-anatomy is casuistrical, because uninstructed by theory,
                  by abstract, universalizable, rules of conduct. Insofar as the reader is caught up
                  “in the restless and anatomising casuistry” of justifying Beatrice’s action he/she
                  is caught up in the very gestalt that is the problem. No amount of anatomizing will
                  solve it. By the same token introspection—visiting our own caverns of the heart—is
                  a fallacious route to enlightenment. Nothing good comes of those Gothic spaces.</p>
               <p>As Shelley’s best critics note, his thought is dialectical. No single work encapsulates
                  his thought. To read <em>The Cenci</em> correctly, one must counterbalance it with <em>Prometheus Unbound.</em> In Rajan’s terms, we must be alert to the complex dialogue between the Gothic and
                  Romantic Shelley. In <em>The Cenci</em>, Gothic Shelley is at his most militant. As an abstracted work of Gothic, it is explicitly
                  darker—and more radical—than the work of any other contemporary writer, for no other
                  writer of the period is so uncompromising about our inability to emancipate ourselves
                  into free agency while drawing upon inner resources unaided by the austere, Kantian,
                  rules of conduct floating free of casuistry, case law, or manners. Unaided by theory
                  our attempts at visiting our inner caverns will only replicate the horror show. Imagining
                  agency begins with the recognition of the need of impersonal theory at the level of
                  ethics. Self-knowledge is likely to be as effective for us as it is for Orsino.</p>
