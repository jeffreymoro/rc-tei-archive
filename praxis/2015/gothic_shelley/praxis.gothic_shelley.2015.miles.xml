            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was ‘totalizing’; it explained
                        everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of agency that could
                        effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the Gothic necessary for Shelley?
                        Part of our answer lies in the fact that Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial
                        points. At the heart of the post-Walpolian Gothic’s ‘symbolic constitution’ lies the ‘dead
                        hand of the past’, a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the present, but
                        holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious circles of
                        transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the generations. As we shall
                        see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the crux that motivates <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. But by the
                        time Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had been made to its
                        symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his purposes. These changes were
                        instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <title level="m">Der Geisterseher</title> (1789; translated as the Ghost-seer,
                        1795) and William Godwin in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794).</p>
                <p rend="noCount">Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic was to provide a narrative form for
                        representing the threat of conspiracy, whether revolutionary or Counter-Reformational. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he refers to the
                        “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions” he is just one of many radicals
                        responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic constitution and chivalry, the legal and social
                        customs he celebrates as the ties that bind the English present.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in the late 1810s)
                        come together in <title level="m">The Cenci</title>: </p>
                <p rend="noCount">As a work of abstracted Gothic, <title level="m">The Cenci</title> explores the problematic nature of modern systems
                        of power by drawing upon the symbolic constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller
                        and post-Godwin. In the preface to <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Shelley references the key elements of the
                        Gothic’s symbolic constitution that will concern him: the dead hand of the past; the baleful
                        influence of Gothic institutions that live on in the present; the tendency of this influence
                        to leave us living in vicious circles of abuse; a moral antinomy that prods the reader into
                        analytical action as a way of rising above such circles; the self-defeating nature of
                        conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of
                        regaining historical agency; the delusive glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and
                        certainly not least, critique of Burke. After noting these key Gothic elements, Shelley’s
                        thought takes a surprising turn. Rather than freeing us ‘self-anatomy’ is shown to lead to
                        more Gothic entrapment. <title level="m">The Cenci</title> suggests that the way to lighten the “Gothic and
                        unintelligible burden of past institutions” is through the austere prescriptions of the
                        categorical imperative. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">In effect Shelley is telling us that he has moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding
                        of conspiracy (the sublimity of the secret societies) to a more abstraction proposition in
                        which counterproductive conspiracy (any literal endeavour) is compared unfavourably with a
                        conspiracy to make the reader think.</p>

                    <p><title level="m">The Cenci</title> is one the few undisputed masterpieces of
                        British Gothic/Romantic drama. The awkward “Gothic/Romantic” is unavoidable.
                        One might call <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Gothic, but the locution
                        begs the qualification provided by Tilottoma Rajan: “Thus in Shelley’s major
                        poems the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. . . . But
                        equally. . . the Gothic is never free of the Romantic, which is to say that
                        Shelley allows us to grasp a transformative potential in the violence and
                        perversity of the Gothic that is less evident in more popular uses of the
                        genre” (para 4). As a belated work of meta-Gothic <title level="m">The
                            Cenci</title> is at an abstracted distance from a popular form that was,
                        by 1819, already undergoing its first revival after a twenty-year slump. As
                        Jerrold Hogle argues in <title level="m">Shelley’s Process</title>, <title
                            level="m">The Cenci</title> is a complex meditation on a spirit of
                        tyranny Shelley experienced as all-pervasive (95). Until about twenty years
                        ago the honorific for this spirit of aesthetic adventure was “Romantic,”
                        whereas “Gothic” served as the abject shadow-term for non-penetrative pulp
                        fiction. But as Rajan further observes, matters are now much different:
                            <quote>For in the past several years the Gothic has arguably replaced
                            the greater Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for the field, though
                            without the metacritical recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the lyric. Or
                            put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task of deconstructing what
                            has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic ideology,”
                            in particular because it makes manifest, almost schematically, what
                            Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past
                            institutions.” (para 4)</quote> Shelley’s ambition in <title level="m"
                            >The Cenci</title> to help lift the “unintelligible burden of past
                        institutions” is precisely why we now say <title level="m">The Cenci</title>
                        is Gothic. </p>
                    <p> However, the matter is not a simple one of substituted terms, so that we use
                        “Gothic” where we used to use “Romantic,” or “Romantick” where we formerly
                        employed “Gothic.” Still less is it one of accepting the terms as synonyms
                        describing phenomena (such as the simultaneous architectural and poetic
                        revivals) unaccountably separated at birth. Rather it is to follow Jerome
                        McGann in acknowledging the necessity of articulating the twin impulses of
                        the period, one towards a Romantic idealization that obscures history’s
                        ruined forms and a countervailing Gothic revelation of their gloomy
                            persistence.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1" resp="editors">
                            Jerome McGann, <title level="m">Romantic Ideology: A Critical
                                Investigation</title> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
                            1983).</note> This is the point I understand Rajan to be making: that we
                        cannot grasp the aesthetic energies of the period without acknowledging a
                        ceaseless dialectical play within them. Gothic and Romantic are
                        indispensable and interchangeable terms for delineating a whole that is
                        larger than either. </p>
                    <p> But to understand how this works we also have to answer Hogle’s vital
                        question: “what is really <emph>most </emph>fundamentally
                            <emph>Gothic—</emph>and what is most fundamentally symbolized because of
                        that Gothicism—in what continues from” Shelley’s Gothic juvenilia “all the
                        way to the unfinished <title level="m">Triumph of Life</title>?” (para 1),
                        including, obviously, <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. If literary Gothic
                        is a kind of narrative language, what does it enable Shelley to say that
                        cannot be said in any other fashion? Why was the Gothic necessary? And why
                        so central? If we are to understand <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as a
                        Gothic/Romantic work, where Gothic and Romantic voices are both in play, we
                        need to understand precisely what was Gothic about it, in the sense Hogle
                        means when he asks the question of Shelley’s sui generis syntheses (their
                        characteristic “overdetermination of social and psychic texts,” as Rajan
                        puts it): “are these semi-transgressions almost entirely Shelley’s, given
                        how emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they really creative
                        extensions of what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in the
                        conflicting tendencies endemic to its symbolic constitution?” (para 2).</p>
                    <p> I agree with Hogle that the answer to his question is irrefutably the
                        latter. Despite the popularity of the Gothic in recent years criticism of
                            <title level="m">The Cenci</title> has been strangely resistant to the
                        Gothic strain that runs through the play. Outside the contributors to this
                        volume, examples of sustained discussion of Shelley’s Gothicism are hard to
                        come by.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2" resp="editors"> The relative
                            scarcity of criticism on Shelley and the Gothic is explored by David
                            Brookshire in <title level="m">Percy Bysshe Shelley and the
                                Gothic</title> (Unpublished PhD Thesis, U. of Maryland, 2009). John

                            1975), is an early exploration of the subject but largely focuses on
                            generic features. Another exception would be Dale Townshend, <title
                                level="m">The Orders of Gothic: Foucault, Lacan, and the Subject of

                    <p> For the generation coming to maturity in the aftermath of the French
                        Revolution, few developments possessed the irresistible glamour of the
                        secret societies allegedly plotting European-wide revolution. De Quincey’s
                        retrospective essay on secret societies eloquently expresses the attraction:
                            <quote>The very image, unveiling itself by unsteady glimpses, of men
                            linked by brotherly love and perfect confidence, meeting in secret
                            chambers, at the noontide of night, to shelter, by muffling, with their
                            own persons interposed, and at their own risk, some solitary lamp of
                            truth—sheltering it from the carelessness of the world, and its stormy
                            ignorance; <emph>that</emph> would soon have blown it out—sheltering it
                            from the hatred of the world; <emph>that</emph> would soon have made war
                            upon its life—all this was superhumanly sublime. The fear of those men
                            was sublime; the courage was sublime; the stealthy, thief-like means
                            were sublime; the audacious end—viz., to change the kingdoms of
                            earth—was sublime. (244)</quote> For De Quincey, as much as for Peacock
                        mocking the immature Scythrop, the operative word for the illuminati was,
                        indeed, “sublime.” The more incredible the stories—the more they tested
                        belief, shattering the mind’s tidy categories—the better: “Tertullian's
                        profession of believing things, not in spite of not being impossible, but
                        simply because they were impossible, is not the extravagance that most
                        people suppose it” (239-40). As a very young man De Quincey believed in
                        Barruel’s and Robison’s paranoid fantasies precisely because they seemed
                        impossible to credit. They were sublime, because outlandish. </p>
                    <p>De Quincey’s essay probes the reasons why, as a young man, he so deeply
                        wanted to believe in masonic conspiracy, which, as an adult, he now realizes
                        was an “extensive monument to elaborate humbug” (255). The essay starts with
                        a humorous account of the extended debate he developed with his governess,
                        who was morally certain Augustin Barruel was correct, and that they were all
                        hourly menaced by conspirators who even now were hatching their plots, and
                        his pre-adolescent self, who would have ardently agreed, for very different
                        reasons, save for the gnawing presence of his rational mind, which insisted
                        on stumbling over the improbability. Peacock catches the attraction for the
                        young Shelley in his description of Scythrop, who had “become troubled with
                        the <emph>passion for reforming the world</emph>” (362), so much so that he
                        “built many castles in the air, and peopled them with secret tribunals, and
                        bands of illuminati” and slept with <title level="m">Horrid
                            Mysteries</title> “under his pillow” (363). One of the <title level="m"
                            >Northanger Abbey</title> “horrid” novels, <title level="m">Horrid
                            Mysteries</title> features, in scintillating detail, the machinations of
                        the illuminati with their torch-lit crypts, cells of conspirators, and
                        revolutionary maidens willing to do anything to advance the cause. Scythrop
                        (like the young Shelley and De Quincey) dreams gothic thoughts of the
                        Schiller kind, just as Catherine Morland dreams hers through Radcliffe.</p>
                    <p> Reading Barruel was formative for the young Shelley in two regards. It was
                        here that he first encountered, methodically laid out in four stuffed
                        volumes, tantalizing extracts from the greatest hits of the radical
                        enlightenment—the atheistical horrors of Voltaire, the spine-tingling
                        materialism of Spinoza, the rousing promise of Rousseau’s general will—and
                        it was here that he encountered a sublime conspiracy, where, with De
                        Quincey, his overwhelming response was a fervent prayer to the Deity begging
                        Him/Her to make Barruel’s phantasies come true.<note place="foot"

                        Shelley, that he started his own at school to extirpate the “Gothic”—that is
                        to say, feudal—practice of “fagging” (Memoir 241).</p>
                    <p> As regards Shelley’s creative extensions of the “conflicting tendencies”
                        endemic to the “symbolic constitution of post-Walpolean Gothic,” two crucial
                        points emerge from this material. The first relates to the “mentalité” or
                        “imaginary” of radical members of Shelley’s generation. While Shelley’s
                        generation might subscribe to the notion of a progressive “spirit of the
                        age,” they understood it to be one—and this was how Hazlitt himself saw
                        it—continuously buffeted by the headwinds of a spirit of tyranny that was as
                        all pervasive as it was systematic. The period did indeed appear to be an
                        age of conspiracy, although the conspiracy that mattered—or rather, the
                        truly effective conspiracy that shaped lives—was the one emanating from the
                        government side, from the “system of terror” administered through Pitt’s spy
                        networks, to the gagging acts, suspension of habeas corpus, and other
                        repressive measures taken by the central authorities, in a concerted effort
                        to subvert the ancient liberties—and natural rights—of the British populace.
                        The illuminati, alas, might be fiction, but the police state, with its press
                        in the grip of the “paranoid style of politics,” was not. “Obsessed with the
                        threat of revolution, users of the paranoid style—conspiracy theorists by
                        definition—ascribe to their enemies the ability to effect large-scale social
                        and political change” (para 2). So Kim Wheatley on the reviewing culture
                        that targeted the Hunts, Keats, Shelley, and other suspicious personages.
                        Quoting Richard Hofstadter, she notes that for the “paranoid rhetorician,
                        ‘History is a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost
                        transcendent power’” (para 29). As Orrin Wang comments in his introduction
                        to the volume in which Wheatley’s essay appears, “the rhetoric and
                        epistemology of conspiratorial thought also acted in varying, emphatic ways
                        upon the imaginary of the second generation Romantics” (para 4). Shelley may
                        have awoken from the self-incurred immaturity of believing in a secret,
                        Europe-wide brotherhood bent on sublime ends, but it was only to a deeper
                        appreciation of the systems of tyranny that gripped contemporary life.</p>
                    <p> For those in the grip of the paranoid style, “the Illuminati were
                        responsible for both the American and French Revolutions. At such a point
                        conspiracy absorbed all other narratives, becoming the totalizing motor
                        behind history itself” (Wang, para 3). For those opposed to the paranoid
                        style, the key issue was producing “a more complex historical causality”
                        than simple conspiracy (Wang, para 5). Thus the lead article of the first
                        issue of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>, written by Francis
                        Jeffrey himself, which reviews Joseph Mournier’s memoir of his time as a

                        plan.</p>
                    <p> According to the period’s dominant imaginary conspiracy was “totalizing”; it
                        explained everything. Against this was the urgent task of imaging a form of
                        agency that could effectively countermand the spirit of tyranny. Why was the
                        Gothic necessary for Shelley? Part of our answer lies in the fact that
                        Gothic precedents addressed both these crucial points. At the heart of the
                        post-Walpolian Gothic’s “symbolic constitution” lies the “dead hand of the
                        past,” a metaphor for the way the past not only reaches into the present,
                        but holds it in its palsied grip. The Gothic is a means of imagining vicious
                        circles of transgression and violence repeating themselves down through the
                        generations. As we shall see, the inherited vicious circle is precisely the
                        crux that motivates <title level="m">The Cenci</title>. But by the time
                        Shelley started his Gothic experiments crucial modifications had been made
                        to its symbolic constitution that made it even more eligible for his
                        purposes. These changes were instigated by Friedrich Schiller, in <title
                            level="m">Der Geisterseher</title> (1789; translated as the <title

                    <p>Schiller’s <title level="m">Ghost-seer</title> is the first work of
                        conspiracy fiction in the Western literary tradition. A young German prince

                        a trickster employing the mummery of the illuminati: mystic symbols, oaths,
                        and the technology of the phantasmagoria. So impressed is the Prince by the
                        Armenian that he eventually comes to repose all his trust in him, suspending
                        his critical faculties in the process. The Armenian, we eventually learn, is
                        an agent of the Inquisition (the same Inquisition that was later to arrest,
                        torture, and imprison Cagliostro). The exposure of the Sicilian was the
                        first step in an elaborate sting designed to turn the impressionable Prince
                        away from Protestantism, back to Catholicism, as a last ditch effort of the
                        Counter-Enlightenment. Schiller’s novel was immensely influential. Besides
                        such works as Cajetan Tschink’s <title level="m">The Victim of Magical

                        Schiller’s primary contribution to the Gothic was to provide a narrative
                        form for representing the threat of conspiracy, whether revolutionary or
                        Counter-Reformational. </p>
                    <p> It was Godwin who urgently raised the question of historical agency. When he
                        refers to the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past institutions” he is
                        just one of many radicals responding to Burke’s defense of the Gothic
                        constitution and chivalry, the legal and social customs he celebrates as the
                        ties that bind the English present. For Wollstonecraft in <title level="m"

                    <p> In <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> the task of demystification
                        follows a severe logic. The present system of tyranny is indeed all
                        pervasive. No point, then, in railing against chivalry (loaded as it is with
                        its Burkean freight). Godwin shows the totalizing system in action, down to
                        the institutional forms of conspiracy Falkland is able to bring to bear upon
                        the errant individual, and from which there is no escape, as Caleb
                        discovers. Instead the task of puzzling the contradictions, and so breaking
                        free from the immaturity of customary thought, is left to the reader. </p>
                    <p> All these constituents of the Gothic’s symbolic constitution (as it stood in
                        the late 1810s) come together in <title level="m">The Cenci</title>: the
                        dead hand of the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that
                        live on in the present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral
                        antinomy that prods the reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief
                        in the totalizing power of tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining
                        historical agency; the delusive glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and
                        certainly not least, critique of Burke. To this mix Shelley adds, I believe,
                        the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant. </p>

                        then, as now. In parodying the Illuminati’s political credo as “A few to
                        think, and many to act” Peacock mordantly notes the way the followers of
                        Weishaupt replicate the very power structure they look to supplant. The line
                        references a key issue that led to the breakdown of the public sphere—the
                        demonizing of universal (male) suffrage—while drawing its principle lesson:
                        to fight fire with fire is self-defeating for the obvious reason that it
                        simply replicates the problem. Whatever solution is needed to the present
                        discontent, it is not more conspiracy. </p>
                    <p> As a work of abstracted Gothic, <title level="m">The Cenci</title> explores
                        the problematic nature of modern systems of power by drawing upon the
                        symbolic constitution of the Gothic as it stood post-Schiller and
                        post-Godwin. As is to be expected of such a belated, self-conscious work,
                        much of the meaning is placed before us on the surface, is indeed collected
                        for us in the preface: <quote>The Cenci Palace is of great extent; and
                            though in part modernized, there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of
                            feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes
                            which are the subject of this tragedy. (para 9)</quote> The phrasing
                        echoes one of the great cliché’s of the period, Blackstone’s metaphor
                        comparing English law to “an old Gothic castle, erected in the days of
                        chivalry, but fitted up for a modern inhabitant” (124). Shelley flips the
                        image, emphasizing, not the modern convenience, but the Gothic structure’s
                        feudal remnants. Shelley’s anti-Burkean phrasing emphasizes the past as a
                        negative force, one drawing us back into the feudal pile’s vast and gloomy
                        reaches. The phrasing does two things: it calls to mind the notion that the
                        nation lives on in a Gothic house (horrifyingly so for Thelwall; reassuring
                        for Burke) and it sets in motion the play’s dominant metaphor, the somewhat
                        trite comment that the human heart is a dark, treacherous place.</p>
                    <p>The preface’s other de rigeur note is the acknowledgement that the horrors
                        passing before us do so in a Catholic country: <quote>Religion coexists, as
                            it were, in the mind of an Italian Catholic, with a faith in that of
                            which all men have the most certain knowledge. It is interwoven with the
                            whole fabric of life. It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence,
                            blind admiration; not a rule for moral conduct. (para 5)</quote> One
                        might dismiss this as stock Gothicism, as a reminder that truly diabolical
                        acts were to be found almost exclusively among the Catholic nations (as
                        Catherine Morland reluctantly concedes). So stock, in fact, that most
                        critics pass over the remark in silence, as if embarrassed by it as an
                        otiose reminder of Shelley’s predictable anti-Catholicism. In fact it is an
                        attempt to articulate one of Shelley’s key concerns. Just as Beatrice Cenci
                        lived and thought amidst a set of “background”<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn12" n="12" resp="editors"> For my use of “background” here

                        formed the “whole fabric of life,” a fabric beyond her powers of
                        comprehension, alienation, and self-reflexive scrutiny, so do we live and
                        think amongst our own enveloping fabric. Beatrice’s attempts at
                        self-analysis and self-knowledge end in abject failure, precisely because
                        she is fully enmeshed in the background understanding of her culture, in its
                        enveloping, and constitutive, systems of power (her mind-forged manacles, as
                        Blake would style them). She has no coin of vantage that would allow her to
                        step outside. The point Shelley is driving at, is that the modern reader,
                        whether Catholic, Protestant or atheist, also lacks a place where they can
                        stand outside their culture and take in the landscape. Shelley argues that
                        the task of stepping outside is not hopeless, just strenuous. </p>
                    <p>Shelley’s statement of the play’s lesson appears to be a mere bromide:
                            <quote>The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the
                            drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and
                            antipathies, the knowledge of itself; in proportion to the possession of
                            which knowledge, every human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and
                            kind. (para 4)</quote> This sounds like trite codswollop. It is. We are
                        meant to catch the broad irony, especially in the closing phrase. And that
                        is because the lesson of the play is to be found on either side of this
                        sentence. The key binary is the one closing Shelley’s statement on
                        Catholicism: “It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind
                        admiration; not a rule for moral conduct.” The sources of right action are
                        not to be found within religious belief, within our background
                        understanding. The sources Shelley urges are more abstract and demanding.
                        They emerge from the telling of the tale: <quote>Such a story, if told so as
                            to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it,

                            interests, passions, and opinions, acting upon and with each other, yet
                            all <emph>conspiring</emph> to one tremendous end, would be as a light

                        say, of an unacknowledged legislator). In effect Shelley is telling us that
                        he has moved on from his juvenile, jejune understanding of conspiracy (the
                        sublimity of the secret societies) to a more abstract proposition in which
                        counterproductive conspiracy (any literal endeavour) is compared
                        unfavourably with a conspiracy to make the reader think. A representation of
                        the conflicting feelings mobilized by a moral antinomy will subtly immerse
                        the reader in the same murky quarters of the human heart as those traversed
                        by the conspirators. Only then can a process of moral and psychological
                        discovery begin. </p>
                    <p> Shelley’s statement of the process does indeed sound strenuous: <quote>It is
                            in the restless and anatomising casuistry with which men seek the
                            justification of Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs
                            justification; it is in the superstitious horror with which they
                            contemplate alike her wrongs, and their revenge, that the dramatic

                        recent critics of the play see this statement as the key to Shelley’s
                        intentions. Shelley presents us with a moral antinomy from which there is no
                        easy egress. We feel at once that Beatrice was both justified and wrong in
                        taking her revenge. Through our sympathetic engagement with the
                        representations of her predicament—and the rights and wrongs of the actions
                        taken—we finally come to know our own dark heart, and our own inner
                        caverns.</p>
                    <p> That seems to be the drift of Shelley’s preface, and, indeed, of the play’s
                        argument. However, I believe this inference to be mistaken. The clues to
                        this misreading lie in the words “casuistry,” “anatomising,” and
                        “superstitious.” In contemplating Beatrice’s “wrongs and their revenge” the
                        reader initially reacts with “superstitious horror.” Whatever Shelley has in
                        mind for the reader, it surely involves more than terrified stupefaction.
                        Presumably it involves some kind of critical introspection through our
                        sympathetic engagement with the moral antinomy of Beatrice’s revenge,
                        perhaps into our own dark heart. However, as Mary Fin points out in her
                        analysis of the play, “casuistry” held a particular, negative, valence for
                        Shelley. She persuasively quotes De Quincey as someone likely to have had an
                        understanding of casuistry similar to Shelley’s (indeed, De Quincey may be
                        recalling Shelley’s preface and play). The problem with casuistry was that
                        it</p>
                    <quote>held aloft a torch for exploring guilty recesses of human life which it
                        is far better for us all to leave in their original darkness. Crimes that
                        were often all but imaginary, extravagancies [sic] of erring passion that
                        would never have been known as possibilities to the young and the innocent,
                        were thus published in their most odious details. (qtd. in Fin 190)</quote>
                    <p>Henry S. Richardson explains what it is De Quincey is complaining about:
                            <quote>The Roman Catholic casuists of the middle ages did so by drawing
                            on Aristotle's categories. Accordingly, they asked, where, when, why,
                            how, by what means, to whom, or by whom the action in question is to be
                            done or avoided... The idea was that complete answers to these questions
                            would contain all of the features of the action, of which the morally
                            relevant ones would be a subset. (2.3 para 2)</quote> Casuistry proceeds
                        from cases, not theories. In any particular case the casuist begins by
                        comparing the case in hand with an existing stock of settled, therefore
                        paradigm, cases, in order to determine if there is a moral principle that
                        would inform the present instance. But in order to determine if there was an
                        applicable rule one would need to canvass the action in all its lights and
                        possibilities. Hence De Quincey’s complaint: the priest might review a moral
                        issue occasioned by a young person’s desire, but in such exhausting detail,
                        involving hitherto undreamt of permutations, that the young person in
                        question would find his or her mind subtly polluted by the moral quest as he
                        or she contemplated possible sins for the first time. At the bottom of De
                        Quincey’s complaint is the unspoken fear that the act of naming has a
                        talismanic power. To explore one’s own dark heart, one would in casuistical
                        fashion need to name and identify a desire in all its permutations. The act
                        of bringing them to light is also the act of bringing them to horrific life.
                        Named, they flicker, and become real. The fear is not materially different
                        from the one Matthew Lewis appeals to when he cautions mothers not to let
                        their daughters read the Bible lest their minds be polluted by its racy
                        subject matter. </p>
                    <p> The notion is directly canvassed in the play. Orsino, in a soliloquy, lets
                        us in on his conspiracy to seduce Beatrice. “From the devices of my love,”
                        he tells us, he shall form a net from “which she shall not escape.” Yet he
                        fears <quote><lg>

                            </lg>
                        </quote> As good post-Freudians our reflex is to read “anatomize” positively
                        as a virtual synonym for therapeutic psycho-analysis. In fact Shelley is
                        using anatomizing as a modifier for casuistry, specifying, in the process, a
                        particularly pernicious kind. Orsino’s repetition of the figure later in the
                        play makes this clear:<quote><lg>
                                <l>I had disposed the Cardinal Camillo </l>
                                <l>To feed his hope with cold encouragement: </l>
                                <l>It fortunately serves my close designs </l>
                                <l>That ’tis a trick of this same family </l>
                                <l>To analyse their own and other minds. </l>
                                <l>Such self-anatomy shall teach the will </l>
                                <l>Dangerous secrets: for it tempts our powers. </l>
                                <l>Knowing what must be thought, and may be done, </l>
                                <l>Into the depth of darkest purposes: </l>
                                <l>So Cenci fell into the pit; even I, </l>
                                <l>Since Beatrice unveiled me to myself, </l>
                                <l>And made me shrink from what I cannot shun </l>
                                <l>Shew a poor figure to my own esteem,</l>
                                <l>To which I grow half reconciled. I'll do </l>

                                <l>Shall free the accuser conscience. (2.2.105-19)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The “self-anatomy” referred to by Orsino operates much
                        like De Quincey’s casuistry: “Crimes that were often all but imaginary . . .
                        that would never have been known as possibilities . . . were thus published
                        in their most odious details.” The main difference is that in <title
                            level="m">The Cenci</title> desires are no sooner “published” or named
                        than they are acted. To drag them from the heart’s gothic caverns is to
                        succumb to them. If Beatrice has the trick, the master is Cenci, the
                        monstrous, malevolent patriarch whose oaths have a magical performative
                        power, beginning on himself. As Orsino notes, Cenci fell first through
                        self-anatomy. Not only does the act of cursing announce new desires and
                        abominations to him but the act of utterance itself seems to bring them
                        about—or so Cenci believes, when the malediction on his absent sons is
                        immediately rewarded with news of the deaths he devoutly wishes. <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> As Camillo notes, Cenci commands this power because the
                        Pope “holds it of most dangerous example / In aught to weaken the paternal
                        power, / Being, as ’twere, the shadow of his own” (2.2.54-6). The talismanic
                        power of words to translate utterance into reality extends to planted
                        thoughts. Giacomo complains that his father coined <quote><lg>
                                <l>A brief yet specious tale, how I had wasted </l>
                                <l>The sum in secret riot; and he saw </l>
                                <l>My wife was touched, and he went smiling forth. </l>
                                <l>And when I knew the impression he had made,</l>
                                <l>And felt my wife insult with silent scorn </l>
                                <l>My ardent truth, and look averse and cold,</l>
                                <l>I went forth too . . . (3.1.319-25)</l></lg></quote>
                                Falsehoods are planted, take root, flower. Cenci exults that he
                                    will do the same to his youngest son, Barnardo, through
                                    memory:
                            <quote><lg><l>He is so innocent, I will bequeath </l>
                                <l>The memory of these deeds, and make his youth </l>
                                <l>The sepulchre of hope, where evil thoughts </l>

                            </lg></quote> The thin boundary between language and prophecy, name and
                        thing, desire and act, is also evident in a particularly arch example of
                        dramatic irony. Cenci taxes his wife Lucretia with conspiracy:<quote><lg>
                                <l>You were not here conspiring? You said nothing </l>
                                <l>Of how I might be dungeoned as a madman; </l>
                                <l>Or be condemned to death for some offence, </l>
                                <l>And you would be the witnesses?—This failing, </l>
                                <l>How just it were to hire assassins, or </l>
                                <l>Put sudden poison in my evening drink? </l>
                                <l>Or smother me when overcome by wine? </l>
                                <l>Seeing we had no other judge but God, </l>
                                <l>And he had sentenced me, and there were none</l>

                        death it is hard to discount the suggestion that this is one just one
                        further aspect of his verbal string pulling, so that he commits suicide, as
                        it were, through the family trick of self-anatomy. </p>
                    <p> The Gothic’s symbolic constitution once again illuminates the drift of
                        Shelley’s thought. Receiving an answer from Lucretia he does not like, Cenci
                        once again explodes into a curse:<quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> As Eve Kososvky Sedgwick and Edgar Allan Poe both knew,
                        live burial was the Gothic’s master trope (the dead hand of the past being
                        just another way of entombing the living). At the root of the trope is a
                        perverse boundary between self and other: where one wants one (to keep
                        invasive entities out) there isn’t one, and where one emphatically doesn’t
                        want a boundary (say, between you and life above ground) there is. The
                        principle extends to language, which can be a source of both ingress (deadly
                        thoughts you can’t keep out), and blockage (vital thoughts you can’t
                        convey). In a moment of high camp, Cenci threatens his wife with a
                        theatrical version of live burial: being immured in a ruined Gothic pile
                        guarded by ruffians utterly immune to the pleadings of speech or body. The
                        trope recurs throughout the play. Cenci will shroud his daughter in an
                        impenetrable mist of infamy while Beatrice complains of being so shrouded,
                        or sepulchured. When it comes to the moment of self-polluting anatomy, when
                        the conspirators first conspire, their faces are alternatively an open book
                        others can read, or mirrors shining the viewer back upon himself.</p>
                    <p>One might think of this strand of Shelley’s imagery, from the Preface on, as
                        a crypt. Cenci’s victims are encrypted, as it were, buried alive or
                        sepulchured inside the perverted “mentalité” Cenci represents, incarnates,
                        and spreads; while the crypts or caverns of the mind disgorge poisonous
                        mists. Self-anatomy simply speeds the process, taking characters down to a
                        place from where none return. Most critics of <title level="m">The

                        disappointingly, with the simple truth of the vicious circle entrapping both
                        Cenci and the conspirators; that in conspiring against Cenci’s undoubted
                        evil, the conspirators, but especially Beatrice, replicate the evil
                        incarnate in the paternal principle.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"

                        Shelley’s purposes, but his thought does not end there.</p>
                    <p> The thread of his thought is to be found in the Jacobin Gothic carefully
                        unspooled in the play. The source for Jacobin Gothic was Burke’s project
                        (and this was how Archibald Alison understood matters in retrospect<note
                            place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15" resp="editors"> Archibald Alison,
                            “The Historical Romance,” <title level="j">Blackwood’s Magazine</title>

                        feudalism. Like other Jacobin-Gothic writers, Shelley tilts at Burke. In the
                        final analysis the problem with casuistry was that it was based on case law;
                        it stands to morality as English common law does to jurisprudence. It is
                        based in practical reason, and is anti-theoretical in its stance. Casuistry
                        works—or worked—in the context of a settled society with established norms
                        of moral thought. “If we lack the kind of broad consensus on a set of
                        paradigm cases on which the Renaissance Catholic or Talmudic casuists could
                        draw, our casuistic efforts will necessarily be more controversial and
                        tentative than theirs . . .” (Richardson, 2.3 para. 5). As moralists as
                        diverse as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor have stressed, modernity is
                        what it is because all such bases for consensus evaporated in the course of
                        the Enlightenment. As Taylor puts it, we live in a mental universe where
                        there are competing and incommensurable frameworks and “hypergoods.”<note
                            place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16" resp="editors"> See also Alasdair
                            MacIntyre, <title level="m">After Virtue</title>, 3rd ed. (Notre Dame:

                        order of the day. To rely upon “case law” is simply to replicate the
                        particular system of power—its particular frameworks woven deep into the
                        fabric of life—of a particular social interest. Faced with moral antinomies
                        our reflex prejudices, even if expressive of our morals and manners—in other
                        words, even in the best case Burke presents—can only replicate the
                        system.</p>
                    <p> We need to put the matter like this in order to grasp the radical nature of
                        Shelley’s thought. It begins with his response to Burke who was, for
                        Jacobins, the high priest of case law, the English common law, the unwritten
                        constitution, and the inherited stock of wisdom bound up in manners. As a
                        moralist, Burke was a casuist. In <title level="m">The Cenci</title> Shelley
                        is a militant Kantian. Burke offered “adoration, faith, submission,
                        penitence, blind admiration”—slavishness, according to his Jacobin
                        critics—not rules for moral conduct. In the Gothic world Shelley
                        depicts—which is clearly also our world—live burial is all pervasive, like
                        conspiracy. Or to change the register, and once again draw upon Hogle, our
                        present is uniformly distorted by the dark powers of transference. Damaged
                        by the system, we project that damage onto others, in infinite series. In
                        the current system, self-anatomy is casuistrical, because uninstructed by
                        theory, by abstract, universalizable, rules of conduct. Insofar as the
                        reader is caught up “in the restless and anatomising casuistry” of
                        justifying Beatrice’s action he/she is caught up in the very gestalt that is
                        the problem. No amount of anatomizing will solve it. By the same token
                        introspection—visiting our own caverns of the heart—is a fallacious route to
                        enlightenment. Nothing good comes of those Gothic spaces. </p>
                    <p> As Shelley’s best critics note, his thought is dialectical. No single work
                        encapsulates his thought. To read <title level="m">The Cenci</title>
                        correctly, one must counterbalance it with <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound.</title> In Rajan’s terms, we must be alert to the complex
                        dialogue between the Gothic and Romantic Shelley. In <title level="m">The
                            Cenci</title>, Gothic Shelley is at his most militant. As an abstracted
                        work of Gothic, it is explicitly darker—and more radical—than the work of
                        any other contemporary writer, for no other writer of the period is so
                        uncompromising about our inability to emancipate ourselves into free agency
                        while drawing upon inner resources unaided by the austere, Kantian, rules of
                        conduct floating free of casuistry, case law, or manners. Unaided by theory
                        our attempts at visiting our inner caverns will only replicate the horror
                        show. Imagining agency begins with the recognition of the need of impersonal
                        theory at the level of ethics. Self-knowledge is likely to be as effective
                        for us as it is for Orsino.</p>
