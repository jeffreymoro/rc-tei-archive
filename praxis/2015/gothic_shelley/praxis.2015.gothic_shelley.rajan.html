            <p>This paper begins with the Gothic, exemplified in Shelley’s early Gothic novels <em>Zastrozzi</em> and <em>St. Irvyne</em>, as an overdetermined and unprocessed moment that interrupts aesthetic ideology,
               and that is problematically entwined with the Romantic in ways that help to illuminate
               the deconstructive role that the Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. More
               particularly, I approach this interimbrication through Hegel’s distinction between
               “Symbolic” and Romantic art in his <em>Aesthetics</em>, which distinguishes three modes based on art’s (in)ability fully to configure the
               “Idea.” In Symbolic art the “Idea” is still "indeterminate"; it achieves “adequate
               embodiment” in Classicism; but in the Romantic, form and content are again separated,
               because of an inadequacy in external forms that repeats and reverses the problems
               of the Symbolic. Curiously placing Classical beauty and unity in the middle of his
               dialectic, as an abandoned synthesis, Hegel oscillates between two forms of inadequacy
               that are both similar and different. For the Romantic beautiful soul withdraws from
               existing discourses, while the imagination of the Symbolic artist is deformed by what
               it cannot form. But the Romanticist thereby risks a bad infinity, while the Symbolic
               artist works on content in the here and now, even at the cost of trapping his work
               in what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy.” Given Hegel’s association of the
               Symbolic with the fantastic and monstrous but also the sublime (which I read here
               through ðiñek), we can use his category to think through Shelley’s use of the Gothic
               as a mode whose very disfigurations—and sometimes its conscious badness—form part
               of a creative negativity. The Gothic, as a stalled and blocked form, has been seen
               as a “complex.” But this makes it a vanishing mediator in the transition from residual
               to emergent societal modes. I suggest, instead, that it is a “matrix” for an irresolvable
               contention and ferment in the work of culture: one to which Shelley comes back again
               and again. In conclusion, I touch briefly on three of these Shelleyan returns. In
               <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> Demogorgon’s clumsy overthrow of Jove is merely a parenthesis. Concessive clause.
               More complex is <em>Alastor</em>, as Shelley’s autonarration of his unsettled relation to a poetry he conceives Romantically
               but Gothically dis-figures. Finally, in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> the Shape in the Car seems to punish the Idealism of the Shape all Light. But their
               inter-folding reconfigures the relation of Gothic and Romantic, as Shelley can no
               longer immunize “the splendour of unfaded beauty” against “the secrets of anatomy
               and corruption,” nor protect literature from a cultural and political debasement that,
               by “eat[ing] out the poetry” from history, actually releases a disastrous creativity.</p>

               <p>Towards the end of Shelley’s second Gothic novel <em>St.Irvyne</em> (1811) the alchemist Ginotti is about to initiate Wolfstein into the secrets of life.
                  Wolfstein is the hero of the main plot, while Ginotti is the obscure figure, the unstable
                  compound, who sanctions Wolfstein’s poisoning of the bandit Cavigni to obtain the
                  lovely Megalena. In the main story Ginotti functions as the Dark Interpreter of the
                  increasingly dissolute Wolfstein, until the plot disposes of both in its Faustian
                  “Conclusion.” The novel is also intersected by a Radcliffean subplot focused on Eloise,
                  who turns out to be Wolfstein’s sister, even though she seems to be French while he
                  is Bohemian. Eloise is seduced by the casuistical Nempere, rescued by another libertine,
                  and marries Fitzeustace, a Peacockian parody of the Shelleyan Poet. This Romantic
                  subplot fantastically escapes the Gothic main plot, by which it is nevertheless enveloped
                  as Nempere turns out to be Ginotti. The result is that Nempere, though terminated
                  in the subplot, is still alive in the main plot,thus casting doubt on whether the
                  text has indeed disposed of the matrix figure whose metamorphic alias he is. And do
                  we want to dispose of this matrix towards which the more obscure and elusive figure
                  of Ginotti gestures? Or does the novel’s titular remembering of Godwin’s <em>St. Leon</em> (1799), where alchemy is also a metonymy for schemes of sociopolitical improvement,
                  make Ginotti a shorthand figure for a still undigested future transformation of “the
                  potable waters that flow from death through life” (<em>Defence</em> 533)?

            <p>Indeed this unprocessed dimension of the characters and “figures” that “rise on the
               bubble” of Gothic experimentation only to be cast off (<em>Triumph</em> 248-50), is evident in the hasty algebra with which <em>St. Irvyne</em> ends: <span class="quote">‘Ginotti is Nempere. Eloise is the sister of Wolfstein. Let then the memory of these
                  victims to hell and malice live in the remembrance of those who can pity the wanderings
                  of error; let remorse and repentance expiate the offences which arise from the delusion
                  of the passions, and let endless life be sought from Him who alone can give an eternity
                  of happiness. (252)’</span> With these pious clichés Shelley throws away a project with which he has grown impatient.
               But three chapters earlier, when Ginotti promises Wolfstein the elixir of life, he
               endows this juvenile literary performance with an unexpected metaphysical depth. As
               a prelude to this promise which is never fulfilled, Ginotti launches into his biographia
               literaria.He tells how by the age of seventeen he had delved into the secrets of “natural
               philosophy” and “metaphysical calculations,” convincing himself of “the non-existence
               of a First Cause” (236-7). This epistemological transgression, or <span class="foreign">acte gratuit</span> as André Gide might call it, had led him to experiment with poison, killing a youth
               who had offended him. Thereupon, having tasted death, he became despairingly nihilistic
               yet avid for eternal life. Contemplating suicide, he found himself on the edge of
               a gulf, facing a “form of most exact and superior symmetry.” The passage is worth
               quoting at length: <span class="quote">‘The phantasm advanced towards me; it seemed then, to my imagination, that his figure
                  was borne on the sweet strain of music which filled the circumambient air. In a voice
                  which was fascination itself, the being addressed me, saying, `Wilt thou come with
                  me? Wilt thou be mine?’ ... “No, no,” I unhesitatingly cried, with a feeling which
                  no language can either explain or describe. No sooner had I uttered these words, than
                  methought a sensation of deadly horror chilled my sickening frame ... the beautiful
                  being vanished; clouds, as of chaos, rolled around, and from their dark masses flashed
                  incesant meteors. ... My neck was grasped firmly and, turning round in an agony of
                  horror, I beheld a form more hideous than the imagination of man is capable of portraying,
                  whose proportions, gigantic and deformed, were seemingly blackened by the inerasible
                  traces of the thunderbolts of God; yet in its hideous and detestable countenance,
                  though seemingly far different, I thought I could recognize that of the lovely vision.

               <p>This passage from Shelley’s early novel strikingly anticipates Rousseau’s symbolic
                  autobiography in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, where Rousseau too is offered the elixir of life: “a chrystal glass/ Mantling with
                  bright Nepenthe” (358-9). In Rousseau’s dream-vision, the Shape all light, the aestheticization
                  of a revolutionary idealism that Ginotti pursues in more Sadeian and Nietzschean ways,
                  becomes the deformed shape in the Car, returning us to the Gothic scene that opens
                  the character “Shelley’s” dream-vision of history.

                           Disfigured” (The Rhetoric of Romanticism 67-82, 93-124). However, disfiguration is
                           not the same kind of analytic operation that deconstruction is. My use of the term
                           thus tries to restore some of the generative potential of a mutilation of figures
                           whose affect suggests the struggle or “restless fermentation” that Hegel sees in the
                           Symbolic.</span></div>
                  </div> it never quite ceases to be present in the “severe excess” of the enlightenment that
                  follows: “The ghost of a forgotten form of sleep” (<em>Triumph of Life</em> 424-8). While in both cases we seem to proceed sequentially from illusion to disillusion,
                  both texts are better described as folding the Gothic and Romantic into each other.
                  In <em>St. Irvyne</em>, that is, the romance of Eloise and Fitzeustace, which itself exists only by repressing
                  a traumatic Gothic kernel, is enveloped within a larger narrative of Faustian depravity
                  that conceals a core of idealism disclosed and defaced in Ginotti’s vision. Likewise
                  in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, “Shelley’s” dream-vision is infolded with Rousseau’s in a pattern of blindness and
                  insight that confuses misprision and enlightenment: while Rousseau awakens from his
                  encounter with the Shape all light to the nightmare of history, “Shelley” <em>dreams</em> this nightmare which folds inwards and backwards to a core of idealism at the heart
                  of darkness.</p>

                           Romantic Narrative (46-74).</span></div>
                  </div> to Shelley’s last poem, I want therefore to suggest that it entwines the Gothic and
                  Romantic in a way that is emblematic of the role Gothic has come to play in Romantic
                  Studies. For in the past several years the Gothic has arguably replaced the greater
                  Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for the field, though without the metacritical
                  recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the Greater Romantic lyric. Or put differently,
                  the Gothic has assumed the task of deconstructing what has variously been called “aesthetic
                  ideology” or “Romantic ideology” (McGann; Redfield 24-7), in particular because it
                  makes manifest, almost schematically, what Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible
                  burden of past institutions” (II.101). The prominence of the Gothic also marks a shift
                  from so-called “High” Romanticism to the popular that might superficially seem to
                  be part of “cultural studies.” Yet unlike cultural studies, if the Gothic deconstructs
                  Romantic ideology, it does so on the ground of literature, by exposing Romanticism
                  to its own in(di)gestion of the work of the negative, rather than by demystifying
                  it from the outside as a social or economic phenomenon. Thus in Shelley’s major poems
                  (as also in Blake’s <em>Europe</em> and <em>(First) Book of Urizen</em>) the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. An example from Shelley’s
                  most ethereal text is the unprocessed melodrama of Demogorgon’s victory over Jove.
                  But equally, for Shelley at least, the Gothic is never free of the Romantic, which
                  is to say that he allows us to grasp a transformative potential in the violence and
                  perversity of the Gothic that is less evident in more popular uses of the genre.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We can approach this linkage of Romantic and Gothic through Hegel’s distinction between
               Romantic and Symbolic art: modes he opposes while conceding their profound connection.
               Hegel’s triad of Symbolic, Classical and Romantic art in his lectures on <em>Aesthetics</em> is particularly useful because on the one hand, though the post-Walpolean Gothic
               may not fall chronologically within the Oriental phase that Hegel delimits as Symbolic,
               Hegel’s association of the Symbolic with the monstrous and fantastic applies equally
               to the Gothic (I. 76). On the other hand, the Symbolic is a broader category than
               the Gothic, including as it does the sublime, which we might conventionally expect
               to find in the Romantic phase. As such, the category of the Symbolic helps to open
               up the Gothic philosophically beyond the sensationalism to which the sheer mass production
               of the genre at the time reduces it. Indeed there is a certain consistency between
               Hegel’s unconventional placement of the sublime in the Symbolic phase and my own use
               of the Symbolic to think through the (pre)Romantic genre of the Gothic. For both anachronisms
               register the generative potential of a mode whose disfigurations form part of a creative
               negativity.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Hegel theorizes three modes based on art’s ability to fully configure the “Idea,”
                  a term derived from Kant, but which is curiously unreferred in Hegel, as it is not
                  the idea “of” anything and is thus a form of desire. For Kant in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em> “aesthetic ideas” are forms that have not quite found their content, while “rational
                  ideas” are concepts (such as freedom) that have not achieved material form (192, 218).
                  Thus already for Kant a certain inadequacy seems to be at the heart of the “Idea.”
                  As a desire for the Idea rather than any specific idea, Hegel’s Idea is not unlike
                  what Shelley defends as “poetry,” which often turns out to be a creativity that exceeds
                  generic and historical containment (<em>Defence</em> 518). In Hegel’s sequence, which historicizes Kant’s analyses of the beautiful and
                  sublime, the Symbolic, Classical and Romantic involve different relations between
                  "inwardness" and its "externalization," “theme” and execution,” or the Idea and its
                  "embodiment" (I.75, 79, 96, 422).

                           and Romantic are different versions of the sublime. It should be noted that Hegel
                           does not use the term “Symbolic” in the way it was used by contemporaries such as
                           Goethe, Schelling, Coleridge and others (nor in the way it is used by Lacan, for whom
                           the “symbolic order” is really an order of signs). For Hegel’s contemporaries the
                           symbol is the unification of the particular and universal, whereas allegory is their

                  </div> In the Symbolic phase, which is pre-art, pre-mature, art fails to achieve identity
                  with itself because of a deficiency in self-consciousness that is reflected in the
                  Idea still being "indeterminate." This problem is overcome in the Classical, as art
                  becomes "the adequate embodiment of the Idea" (I.76-7). But in the Romantic, form
                  and content are again separated, this time because of a deficiency in matter that
                  repeats and reverses the problems of the Symbolic. For while the Idea in the Symbolic
                  fails to embody itself because of its own deficiency, in the Romantic phase the Idea
                  is fully developed, but “can no longer find its adequate reality” in the “shapes”
                  available to it in its culture (I.442). Thus the Romantic “reverts, even if in a higher
                  way, to that difference and opposition of the two sides which in symbolic art remained
                  unconquered” (I.79).</p>
            </div>
            <p>The “critical history of Poetry” in which Shelley finds the “defence” of his Idea
               “betrayed” (528) likewise contains both Romantic and Symbolic versions of this inadequacy.
               Thus on the one hand poetry is constrained by “distorted notions” that result in even
               poets such as Dante and Milton walking “through eternity” “enveloped” in the “mask
               and mantle of prejudice” (526). On the other hand poetry is also figured in the quintessentially
               Romantic images of a “fading coal” (531) or a “lightning which has yet found no conductor”
               (528). On one level the <em>Defence</em> presses towards a Romantic <span class="foreign">telos</span> that disavows the Symbolic matrix of the history in which it finds itself embedded.
               Yet the very contradiction between the images of the fading coal and the lightning,
               in the first of which the idea is fully developed while in the second it is yet to
               come, marks the tenuousness of the Romantic category.</p>
            <p>Act IV of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, or the scene where Asia grasps Panthea’s dreams by reading her “written soul” in
               her eyes (II.i.110) are examples of a Romanticism that presses beyond mediation. By
               contrast, the Symbolic is associated with the monstrous or fantastic, and disfigures
               its too hasty hypostasis of the Idea through what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy”
               (<em>Aesthetics</em> I.76): a description we can extend to the Gothic. Thus in <em>St. Irvyne</em> Nempere de-forms rather than embodies Ginotti . For his part, Ginotti is himself
               the inchoate materialization of a juvenile and indeterminate Idea. Like Demogorgon,
               who is nothing if not Symbolic, this Idea has neither “form nor outline” (<em>Prometheus Unbound</em> II.iv.6). It is an unstable compound in which the Nietzschean “death of God” in the
               materialism of the <span class="foreign">philosophes</span> makes possible social and thought experiments whose association with libertinism
               and perversion figures their underlying ideological contradictions.</p>
            <p>Ginotti is a “figure” that materializes at the threshold between fear and desire.
               Opposing “figure” to “discourse” Lyotard describes three levels of figuration that
               are more and more removed from any kind of clear formulation: the image-figure, which
               is visible but already blurred; the form-figure, which can be “perceived” but not
               “seen” and is a schema that underlies the visible; and finally the matrix figure,
               which is neither “visible” nor “readable,” and which is “difference itself” (277-8).
               Ginotti is this form-figure or schema that gestures towards the matrix described by
               Lyotard, which Wolfstein and Nempere, as stereotyped image-figures, disfigure through
               their “bad and untrue definiteness” (<em>Aesthetics</em> I.74). Yet if the Gothic is “bad” literature, Shelley’s explicit association of the
               genre in <em>St. Irvyne</em> with the <span class="foreign">philosophes</span> (236-7), gives its distortions a Symbolic potential: one that Hegel recognizes when
               he describes how in the crudity of the Symbolic, “the Idea . . . persists <em>sublime</em> above all this multiplicity of shapes which do not correspond with it” (<em>Aesthetics</em> 77).</p>
            <p>Returning to Hegel, what is notable in his dialectic is the place of the Classical,
               as a synthesis oddly displaced to the middle. For the Classical, as the "unity of
               the artist's subjective activity with his work,” “achieves what true art is in its
               essential nature” (I.427, 431). Yet Hegel is dissatisfied with this completion, as
               the Classical is superseded by the Romantic, which reverts to the difference of Idea
               and shape in the Symbolic, as if it is really inadequacy which is the essence of art.
               We sense Hegel’s disappointment with the Classical when he says that the Classical
               artist adequately embodies the Idea only because he receives his content “cut and
               dried” from “national faith and myth,” leaving him free to work on the formal and
               rhetorical shaping of this content (I.439). By contrast, form and content in the Symbolic
               have a more integral relationship: Symbolic art senses "the inadequacy of its . .
               . shapes” and yet can do nothing but distort these shapes, thus "positing it[self]
               as the inherently deficient, something to be superseded" (I.318-19). Yet the Symbolic,
               as a mode in which the "Idea . . . does violence" to "natural shapes," also “stretches
               them unnaturally" in order to "<em>elevate their phenomenal appearance to the Idea</em>" (I.76; italics mine). There is thus something sublime in its deformations that distinguishes
               it both from Classical complacency and from the ineffectually angelic claims of the
               Romantic.</p>
            <p>Hence Hegel’s strategic location of the sublime in the Symbolic rather than Romantic
               phase. For there are two kinds of Symbolic art: the “positive” art of India and Persia
               and the “negative” art of the sublime (I.364). In a section of the third Critique
               that Hegel cites, Kant argues that the physical presentation of the sublime (as in
               a raging ocean) is merely “horrible,” because it fails to understand the sublime as
               an “invisible meaning devoid of shape” that has no adequate objective correlative
               in phenomena (Hegel, Aesthetics I.363-4). Hence Kant prefers the dynamic sublime to
               a merely mathematical sublime limited to <span class="foreign">res extensa</span>. Hegel’s criticism of Symbolic forms such as the grotesque that involve a hyperactive
               visual surface has its origin in these comments by Kant, and is generated by a philosophical
               argument against visibility as the premature foreclosure of negativity. The Symbolic,
               then, is by no means simple. It is the site of a difference between an Idea falsely
               posited in a determinate image-figure like Nempere, or Zastrozzi whose gigantic stature
               makes him mathematically sublime, and the more invisible matrix to which this character
               gestures.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At the same time this matrix is by no means to be identified with the <em>transcendental</em> Idea of the Kantian sublime. It is not just that Kant still assumes that “the Thing-in-itself,
                  ” or we might say Idea, “exists as something positively given beyond the field of
                  representation,” whereas for Hegel the “basic dialectical moment of the Sublime” consists
                  in “the notion that the Idea is reached through purely negative presentation – that
                  the very inadequacy of the phenomenality to the Thing is the only appropriate way
                  to present it” (Žižek, <em>Sublime Object</em> 205). Kant, as Žižek says, also refused to confront the monstrous (<em>Plague of Fantasies</em> 280-1).Thus on the one hand, in the wake of the Kantian sublime, Hegel’s location
                  of the sublime in the Symbolic associates even the more positive forms of the Symbolic
                  such as the Gothic with projects of Reason and freedom. Hence Ginotti’s excursus on
                  materialism (236-8) and Zastrozzi’s defiant embrace of an atheism that rises “above
                  the shackles of prejudice . . . and injurious superstition” (153). But on the other
                  hand the Kantian sublime involves a missed encounter of these projects of Pure Reason
                  with a core of darkness that we necessarily confront in characters like Ginotti.

                  </div> For in Symbolic art “the spirit . . . shapes itself out of its own resources” (I.362).
                  Its “restless fermentation” is the “labour” of the negative, wherein consciousness
                  is still “producing its content and making it clear to itself,” rather than resting
                  in ideas “already determined for imagination as settled” (I.438-9). Similarly, to
                  adapt Shelley in <em>A Defence</em>, the “distorted notions of invisible things” in the Gothic are the “mask and the
                  mantle” that conceal a certain “poetry” (526). But this very distortion makes aesthetic
                  form the site of a perpetually vital struggle between dominant, residual and emergent
                  ideologies: one that calls for a symptomatic reading of what Jameson calls “the form
                  of content” and “the content of form” (<em>Political Unconscious</em> 99). Other essays in this volume also locate in the Gothic a “matrix” that continues
                  to trouble Shelley’s work. But the question is whether this matrix, even if it recurs
                  in Shelley’s work, is a kind of “vanishing mediator” that serves as a transition out
                  of a particular historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent kernel of
                  error at the heart of all idealism. And the further question is whether “error,” the
                  word with which <em>St. Irvyne</em> concludes (252), simply means “mistake” or whether it is, in a pathological and twisted
                  way, also creative.

            <p>In Jerrold Hogle’s essay in this volume this question remains unanswered, or is perhaps
               answered in the form of a “both/and” rather than an “either/or.” In Hogle’s previous
               work, which has been seminal in opening up the seriousness of the genre, the post-Walpolean
               Gothic is the expression of a particular cultural moment that is riven by underlying
               contradictions. Or as he puts it here, it has been “<em>the</em> fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the culture
               between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced.” But insofar as
               Hogle places these irresolutions within a historical development that in fact does
               resolve them—from feudal to capitalist, Catholic to Protestant, or symbol to sign—the
               Gothic then becomes what Jameson calls a “vanishing mediator.” For Jameson, writing
               on Max Weber, the vanishing mediator is the catalyst that disappears in the transition
               from the residual to the emergent. But if Shelley inherits a “Gothic complex” “almost
               intact” from Walpole and the 1790s Gothic, and if Shelley’s Gothic novels are in this
               sense derivative, does the Gothic “complex” in becoming a “matrix” reconstitute the
               Gothic as the permanent expression of an irresolvable contention and ferment in the
               work of culture, for which Hegel’s Symbolic also provides a name? And is this emergence
               of the Gothic as not simply a complex but also a matrix what happens between Shelley’s
               early Gothic novels and <em>The Triumph of Life</em>? My answer would be in the affirmative. Indeed it is because the Gothic becomes a
               matrix, and not just a complex flattened out by its containment within a genre that
               is its “form-figure,” that the Gothic has become so interimbricated with Romanticism
               itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses texts that do <em>not</em> formally belong to the genre: texts such as Blake’s Lambeth books, Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em> and <em>Fleetwood</em>, Mary Shelley’s <em>Mathilda</em>, and Byron’s <em>The Giaour</em>, and even <em>Adonais</em> as discussed by Christopher Bundock in this volume.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For on the one hand, as Hogle argues, Gothic figures are transitional insofar as they
                  are “‘floating signifiers’ separable from their older grounds and thus able to signify
                  newer ones.” As a result the “figures ever new” of <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (248), “the material simulacra given off by objects and people in Lucretius” (and
                  Baudrillard), are the sedimented traces of past ideologies which they render “spectral.”
                  The Gothic mode thus becomes an epistemology for diagnosing how the present continues
                  to be haunted by the ghosts or residues of “old symbolic orders,” and in this way
                  is part of the work of ideological progress. But on the other hand it is precisely
                  this progress that is put in question when Shelley, as described by Hogle, recognizes
                  the claims of the old as well as the new:

                  </div> hence the functioning of these figures not just as “signs” but more archaically as
                  “symbols.” I would go farther and suggest that the force of these symbols is not just
                  critical—a sense that the new must be mediated through the old if anarchy is not to
                  result

                           simultaneously, like the ‘Janus-faced shadow’ that actually drives Life’s chariot
                           for Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference . . . for keeping at least a ‘shadow
                           of monarchy’ on an ‘otherwise empty chair of state,’ . . . rather than facing the
                           uncertainties of total revolution that eventually made England (and even Shelley)
                           fearful of the violence in France.” </span></div>
                  </div>—but also creative. The “emptied-out figures” of the procession, Gothicized as “vampire
                  bats” (484), retain, in their very decay, a kind of creativity. Thus in the enthusiasm
                  of the procession, which includes Plato as well as Caesar and Constantine, “something
                  not yet made good pushes its essence forward,” as Habermas says of the utopianism
                  of Ernst Bloch (71). This (de)constructive creativity is implicit in the differend
                  between “Shelley” and Rousseau over the “figures” cast onto and cast off by the Car
                  of Life. “Shelley” disdains to “worship” these idols that fashion projects onto “the
                  world’s false and fragile glass.” But Rousseau, even as he acknowledges the relentless
                  consumption of the old by the new, insists that the “vitally metaphoric” process of
                  history goes on as a mixture of idealism and idolatry: “Figures ever new / Rise on
                  the bubble, paint them how you may” (<em>Defence</em> 512; <em>Triumph</em> 243-51).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Put differently, the cultural work of the Gothic is not limited to the demystification
               of past systems of belief. As Deborah White argues, in the spirit of Adorno and Horkheimer’s
               critique of “enlightenment,” the Romantics’ attitude to “superstition” is tied up
               with the issue of imagination. This is to say not only that modernity is itself built
               on superstitious foundations, but also, as a correlative, that literature “cannot
               surrender the resources of illusion” even if it thereby becomes a form of superstition
               (12, 51). Hence a certain persistence of idolatry in <em>The Triumph</em> that resists both “Shelley’s” disdain for life, and what White calls the “Enlightenment’s
               quasi-materialist vision of history,” evident in the poem’s relentless serialization
               of its failed “figures” (12). Hence also the way the rationalization of the supernatural
               in Gothic novels is set up <em>not</em> to work: a procedure that Shelley strategically if impatiently repeats in the emptiness
               of the formulae that conclude <em>St. Irvyne</em>. For the Gothic is in fact a shelter for the potentiality of superstition and perversion,
               for the “gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present” (Shelley, <em>Defence</em> 535).</p>
            <p>This restless fermentation of the Idea as superstition is what Hegel tries to access
               through the Symbolic. For the Symbolic is the form taken by what Žižek calls the “sublime
               object of ideology”: as a form of fantasy rather than Coleridgean imagination, it
               projects an Idea but, through its bad and untrue determinacy, allows for a “traversal”
               of the fantasm (<em>Plague</em> 7-11, 97). Of course in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hegel dismisses the Symbolic
               as crude and pagan. He prefers the Romantic because its dissonance of matter and spirit
               is Christian and accords with criteria of beauty. Shelley expresses the same historical
               complacency when he claims that the “poetry” of “Chivalry and Christianity . . . erase[s]”
               the “deform[ities]” of earlier social formations (<em>Defence</em> 518). But the Romantic for Hegel is an alibi for revisiting the Symbolic; hence their
               distinction in terms of a reversed relation in the two between the Idea and its embodiment
               keeps collapsing.</p>
            <p>In the Symbolic, as we will recall, the Idea itself is said to be inadequate, while
               in the Romantic the Idea is complete in itself but external forms are inadequate for
               its purposes. But if the Symbolic warps the forms it takes, is this not because they
               are inadequate, or as Shelley says,because its “distorted notions of invisible things”
               are “the mask and mantle” in which poetry “walk[s] through eternity enveloped and
               disguised” (526)? And if the Romantic cannot find adequate forms, is this not because
               its Idea too is undeveloped? And finally if art needs an “external medium for its
               expression,” is not the Romantic also defective in resisting an “adequate union with
               the external” (Hegel, <em>Aesthetics</em> I.81)? At issue here is the very criterion of “adequacy,” since as Hegel also says
               "the specific shape which every content of the Idea gives” itself “is always adequate
               to that content” (I.300), which means that Symbolic forms too are organic and purposive
               dis-integrations of their content. Unable to resolve these tensions in his idea of
               art, Hegel finally announces the “end of art” (I.602). But rather than conclude that
               there is no future for art, we should see this “end,” as the ex-termination of a term
               exhausted in its current conception. For in conjunction with the forms of art that
               have emerged in the <em>Aesthetics</em>, the end of art can also serve as a deconstruction that allows us to imagine new
               configurations of the aesthetic.</p>
            <p>But as we think such models, we must also attend to the difference between the Symbolic
               and Romantic. Pinnacled dim in the intense inane, the Romantic artist is the beautiful
               soul whose bad faith Hegel criticizes in the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (406-7). He is superior to the Symbolic artist because he withdraws from existing
               discourses into the clarity of a free resistance, while the latter is at the mercy
               of contemporary material, his imagination deformed by what it cannot form. On the
               other hand, this withdrawal into Spirit is a form of bad infinity. By contrast the
               Symbolic artist does not refuse mediation, but works on content at the material site
               of forms. This positing and consequently positivity, which Hegel also criticizes,
               often results in a "bad and untrue determinacy" which closes off the dissonance of
               “Idea and shape” (I.76-7). Thus Ginotti,as the schema for an Idea with neither “form
               nor outline,” is given an untrue determinacy by his avatar Wolfstein and by his own
               role in the narrative: a role constricted by the form Shelley had available to him,
               namely Faustian melodrama. And Zastrozzi too, the eponymous hero of Shelley’s previous
               Gothic novel, is conventionalized by the way his author has been interpellated into
               the model of revenge tragedy. Nor is the Gothic as a genre unaware of the force of
               institution, what Jean-Paul Sartre calls the “practico-inert,” or the matter in which
               past praxis is stuck by a “reifying sociality” (67, 318). It is this automatized sociality
               that leads Verezzi to prefer Julia to Matilda, even though the Narrator concedes that
               what he prefers is Julia’s “image” (116). Interestingly, the Narrator goes so far
               as to note “a comparison between [Matilda] and Julia” (84); and hence in the next
               novel, <em>St. Irvyne</em>, the lovely Megalena quickly deteriorates from being a Julia to being a Matilda.
               Indeed the Gothic insistently marks its conventionalism, its badness, as a way of
               breaking the moulds into which it is forced.</p>
            <p>For Shelley such deformations of “poetry” occur in “periods of the decay of social
               life,” such as the one he describes after the Restoration, when “vice,” “weakness,”
               and “obscenity” take over (<em>Defence</em> 520-1): an account that applies equally to the depraved world of Italy and Bohemia
               in the Gothic novels. Symbolic art is just as frequently limited by its bad determinacy
               as it is expanded by an indeterminacy that allows for the development of the idea
               which Ginotti’s dream-vision gestures towards. Yet such determinacy is what Jameson
               calls a “symbolic resolution”: a temporary overriding of contradictions, without which
               negativity could not be invested in the work of history (<em>Political Unconscious</em> 77-80). And it is only through this investment that art remains responsible to the
               cultural unconscious, or to what is left out in its attempt to classically domicile
               the Idea or romantically defer it into the infinite future. We see this investment
               in history in Shelley’s novels. Indeed in <em>The Defence</em> Shelley’s description of the decayed history he despises is strikingly Gothic. The
               “obscenity” of the Restoration, he says, “is a monster for which the corruption of
               society for ever brings forth new food, which it devours in secret” (521). And yet
               this supposed monster recalls the earlier description of poetry as “replenishing”
               imagination “with thoughts of ever new delight . . . which form new interstices whose
               void for ever craves fresh food” (517).</p>
            <p>In short, Hegel lets us think a dialectic that circulates imagination between its
               premature hypostasis in the Symbolic, and withdraws it as “spirit” from the concepts
               that limit it so as to think it once more. In its disfiguration of the Romantic Idea
               the Gothic is thus part of the work of the negative, whether as a transitional negation
               of Romanticism’s tendency to settle into aesthetic ideology, or as an untransformed
               potentiality aware of its traumatic core. Conceived on this model, the <em>work</em> of art is not form or hypostasis, but “configuration,” “the work on form, the deformation
               of form” as much as its “formation” (Carroll 29, 39). As such, even in its positivity
               it requires what Žižek calls an “anamorphic” reading, able to release the underlying
               negativity of its bad and untrue clichés. In “Kantian terms,” as Žižek puts it, such
               a reading would allow “us to discern an apparently positive object as a ‘negative
               magnitude,’” to see even a character such as Nempere or Zastrozzi as the “‘mere positivization
               of a void’” (<em>Plague</em> 97).</p>
            <p>In conclusion let me then sketch three versions of the relation between the Romantic
               and its Gothic disfiguration that attempt to deal with the return of the moment of
               Symbolic blockage staged in Shelley’s early Gothic novels: a return more fully detailed
               in other essays in this volume. In <em>Prometheus</em> the Gothic is no more than a concessive clause. Shelley grants the Romanticism of
               an Idea that cannot be embodied in existing forms when Prometheus and Asia retire
               to a cave after their marriage, to dwell “Like human babes in their brief innocence”
               (II.iii.33). At the same time the means used to end the Jovian age in the present
               are crudely Gothic. For if Demogorgon is a metaphysical principle or Idea “devoid
               of shape” (Hegel <em>Aesthetics</em> I.363), in order to act in time he becomes Jove’s son. The bad and untrue determinacy
               of this positing of the negative is then reflected in the brutality with which he
               overthrows Jove: a violence at odds with the Promethean reign of peace. Hence Shelley,
               who as Asia has insisted on converting Demogorgon’s cryptic words into a project of
               Reason and freedom, admits that Jove may rise again, offering a variety of “spells”
               to deal with him (IV.562-9), which are no more than what Kant would call rational
               ideas.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> Shelley manages to segregate the Romantic from its Gothic disfiguration. In fact
               the Gothicism of Jove’s downfall reduces to a cliché the unreadable matrix that the
               play approaches in the figure of Demogorgon. More tangled is <em>Alastor</em>, which conflates the Gothic and Romantic. In the opening, the Narrator invokes the
               Muse of the Greater Romantic Lyric, only to speak of himself as a “desperate Alchymist”
               who has made his “bed / In charnels and coffins” (23-5). At the end, having failed
               to make the Poet credible, he ends with a disconnected outburst on the elixir of life
               and the Wandering Jew, describing himself as a “dark magician . . . raking the cinders
               of a crucible” (682-4), and appealing to “Medea’s wondrous alchemy” (672). This Gothic
               self-representation is matched by the Narrator’s lurid figure of the Poet, whose “divinest
               lineaments” are “Worn by the senseless wind” (704-5), as if he foresees the body of
               the Poet, whose grave was “ a pyramid / Of mouldering leaves” decaying, his skin and
               bones blown round and literally caught on the thorns of life (53-4). And yet the Poet
               is also referred to Romantically as a “surpassing Spirit” (714), a beautiful soul
               whose inwardness transcends materiality.</p>
            <p><em>Alastor</em> is Shelley’s autonarration of his unsettled relationship to “poetry” as “subjective
               poetry,” which Browning in his essay on Shelley describes as the “<em>Ideas</em> of Plato, seeds of creation, lying burningly on the Divine Hand” (63-7). Yet the
               “frail” figure of the Poet (<em>Alastor</em> 687) cannot bear this Romanticization, which has become part of the practico-inert.
               Indeed the Poet seems disconnected from the “image” of him that the Narrator constructs
               (661). For the depopulated global landscape through which he moves, the perilous journey
               he takes in his drunken boat, and the tattered scenery of a Nature that Shelley cannot
               put into a Wordsworthian frame, all point to a more modern conception of poetry as
               sifting through the waste land of culture that would emerge later with Rimbaud, Nerval
               and Baudelaire. <em>Alastor</em> is thus hysterically split between the Romantic “spirit” of poetry, and its de-jection
               into the Gothic as a “peculiar cultural space into which the horrors generated by
               early modern cultural changes . . . can be ‘thrown under’” or abjected, as Jerrold
               Hogle puts it (178): cast off but also cast into a future “crucible” whose void “for
               ever craves fresh food” (<em>Alastor</em> 683; <em>Defence</em> 517).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless in <em>Alastor</em> the Gothic is more a defacement of the Romantic than it is the creative matrix suggested
               by the word “crucible” (624). Finally, in <em>The Triumph of Life </em>Shelley’s Gothicism shows itself first in the defacement of Rousseau, whom “Shelley”
               initially encounters in the vegetable form of an “old root which grew / To strange
               distortion” (182-3), and then in the disfiguration of the Shape all light, the figure
               for the dawn of a new revolutionary era. It would be easy to see the Shape in the
               Car as punishing the idealism of the Romantic shape, and the poem as demystifying
               <em>Prometheus Unbound,</em> where Asia, after her missed encounter with the Symbolic matrix of the play in the
               Cave of Demogorgon, romantically bounds off the Chariot of the Hour driven by the
               spirit with a “dreadful countenance” from the one guided by a spirit with the “dove-like
               eyes of hope” (II.iv.142-62). Returning to this scene of the chariots through the
               Car of Life, Shelley’s last poem unleashes a different hour in which the two perspectives
               on the second coming of the world-historical spirit can no longer be separated. Nevertheless
               the ensuing dis-integration releases an energy as powerful as the beauty of the Shape
               was lethargic, for the “crew” dance “like atomies . . . / Within a sunbeam” (444-6),
               while Rousseau “plunge[s]” into the future (467) with a blindness that is the very
               condition for the deconstructive creativity thrown off and around the Car in whose
               disaster he urges “Shelley” to participate as “actor or victim” rather than “spectator”
               (305-6). Shelley describes this “restless fermentation” of “Life” in terms of a Symbolic
               pre-maturity when he compares the Car to “the young moon,” which bears “As the herald
               of its coming . . . / The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form / Bends in dark
               aether from her infant’s chair” (79-85). In this Gothic unfolding of the beautiful
               simile of the moon, history becomes a “process without a <span class="foreign">telos</span> or a subject” (Althusser 91-8). For the dead mother shrouds a chair that may be empty,
               since the lines refer only to the infant’s chair. Moreover, she bends “from,” not
               over, the chair, as if brought down by this second coming of an infant power whose
               advent is or was expected, but whom we do not see.</p>
            <p>Yet it is notable how simile follows simile, or how one simulation enfolds another,
               such that “veil after veil [is] undrawn” (<em>Defence</em> 528), without any adequate embodiment of a phenomenon that has neither “form nor
               outline.” For like the “sun’s image” reflected in a well, which is then brought into
               focus and perceived as the “shape all light” (<em>Triumph</em> 345-52), the young moon contains another figure: the dead mother bending from her
               infant’s chair. This composite simile is then displaced by a further likeness, as
               the slouching mother becomes “the dusky hood and double cape” shrouding a shape that
               is now unnaturally old rather than young: “as one whom years deform” (87-90). “Figures
               ever new” are cast off in the cinematography of the poem (248), which commingles the
               beautiful, the sublime, and the repellent. “Shelley” wants to arrange these figures
               to distinguish various phases of the procession: the Car at the centre, and in front
               the leaders, while an anonymous crowd brings up the rear (101, 131-8). Because the
               core experience for him is the Shape’s disenchantment, “Shelley” also wants to level
               the difference between those who lead and those who follow, dismissing “All but the
               sacred few” as a “deluded crew” (128, 184). He asks himself why “all” is “here amiss”
               and does not hear the irony when a voice answers “Life!” (178-80).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But the scene is in fact a moving army of differences, metaphors and metonymies. At
                  the end the poem is taken over by Bosch-like scenes of “vampire bats” and “vultures”
                  sitting on the tiaras of “pontiffs” (484-505), what Shelley in the <em>Defence</em> describes as the “utter anarchy and darkness” that sometimes threaten to engulf poetry
                  (523). But since the manuscript of <em>The Triumph of Life</em> omits quotation marks, we cannot know if this segment marks Rousseau’s renunciation
                  of his idealism, or is spoken by the Thel-like “Shelley.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

                           so as to create a reading text, and retained by Donald H. Reiman with slight alterations
                           that often have unscrutinized consequences. Thus we do not always know whether to
                           attribute particular lines to Rousseau or “Shelley,” or where the breaks between the
                           lines of the two speakers occur. On this subject see Rajan, The Supplement of Reading
                           (332-35, 346-48). As regards the infernal vision with which the poem ends, Reiman
                           attributes everything after l. 300 to Rousseau. But one could argue that “Shelley”
                           again becom…</span></div>
                  </div> Moreover, just as the leaders include figures as different as Plato and Caesar, so
                  too the ribald crowd is metamorphically imaged through bats and apes, but also “elves
                  / Danc[ing] in a thousand unimagined shapes” (490-1). Indeed this last segment is
                  prefaced by a reference to Dante and described as “a wonder worthy of his rhyme” (469-80),
                  though what follows is hardly wondrous in any conventional sense. The scene, in other
                  words, is one of degeneration and entropy, yet harbours a strange vitality. Its logic
                  is not Dante’s serial logic of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, but combines all
                  three “in the chaos of a cyclic poem” (<em>Defence</em> 512), whose “rotary motion” is figured in the wheel of the Car and the cyclic form
                  of the poem itself, which returns upon and into itself through its folding of figure
                  within figure. In this chaos, Shelley can no longer insulate “the form and the splendour
                  of unfaded beauty” from “the secrets of anatomy and corruption” (531), nor protect
                  literature from a cultural and political debasement that “eats out the poetry” from
                  history so as to rethink both poetry and history as a void that forever craves fresh
                  food (515, 517). Instead he lets down his ladder “into the foul rag and bone shop
                  of the heart” (Yeats 391-2), finding the crucible of a disastrous creativity in this
                  space into which the horrors of early modern culture have been cast off.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">This paper is based on a paper given in a session on “Shelley and the Gothic” organized
               by Neil Fraistat at the 2011 MLA in Los Angeles. A significantly different and expanded
               version of the same paper appeared under the title “The Work of the Negative: Symbolic,
               Gothic and Romantic in Shelley and Hegel” in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em>, 52: 1 (2013), 3-32. The author wishes to thank the Canada Research Chairs Programme
               for research support that has made the writing of this paper possible.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">I use “Shelley” in quotation marks to refer to the first-person speaker of the poem,
               the character Shelley, as distinct from the author.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">My use of this term obviously evokes de Man’s “Autobiography as De-Facement” and “Shelley
               Disfigured” (<em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em> 67-82, 93-124). However, disfiguration is not the same kind of analytic operation
               that deconstruction is. My use of the term thus tries to restore some of the generative
               potential of a mutilation of figures whose affect suggests the struggle or “restless
               fermentation” that Hegel sees in the Symbolic.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For a more extensive discussion of Shelley’s Gothic novels themselves, see Rajan,

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In Kant’s terms from the <em>Third Critique</em> the Classical is beautiful, whereas the Symbolic and Romantic are different versions
               of the sublime. It should be noted that Hegel does not use the term “Symbolic” in
               the way it was used by contemporaries such as Goethe, Schelling, Coleridge and others
               (nor in the way it is used by Lacan, for whom the “symbolic order” is really an order
               of signs). For Hegel’s contemporaries the symbol is the unification of the particular
               and universal, whereas allegory is their separation; in effect, the symbol is a form
               of the beautiful. For Hegel the Symbolic is one form taken by the separation of particular
               and universal. Indeed Hegel’s inversion of the usual meaning of the term is part of
               a complex critique—engaged with the work of Goethe and Friedrich Creuzer—of the idea
               of art as <span class="foreign">Darstellung</span> or the presencing of the Idea. For elaboration of this point see Rajan, “Towards
               a Cultural Idealism” (62-5), which also discusses the relation between Symbolic and
               Romantic in Hegel.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">I take this to be the gist of Hogle’s comment, in his essay here, that the “looking-backwards-and-forwards
               simultaneously, like the ‘Janus-faced shadow’ that actually drives Life’s chariot
               for Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference . . . for keeping at least a ‘shadow
               of monarchy’ on an ‘otherwise empty chair of state,’ . . . rather than facing the
               uncertainties of total revolution that eventually made England (and even Shelley)
               fearful of the violence in France.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">The manuscript does not contain quotation marks, which were added by Mary Shelley
               so as to create a reading text, and retained by Donald H. Reiman with slight alterations
               that often have unscrutinized consequences. Thus we do not always know whether to
               attribute particular lines to Rousseau or “Shelley,” or where the breaks between the
               lines of the two speakers occur. On this subject see Rajan, <em>The Supplement of Reading</em> (332-35, 346-48). As regards the infernal vision with which the poem ends, Reiman
               attributes everything after l. 300 to Rousseau. But one could argue that “Shelley”
               again becomes the speaker after l. 469 (the description of Dante) or after l. 480.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
