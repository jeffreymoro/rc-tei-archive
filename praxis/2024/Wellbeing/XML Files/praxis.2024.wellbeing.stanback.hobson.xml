            <quote>"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
                complexions: but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
                first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in
                the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that
                I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
                Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity."
                (114)</quote>
                
            <p>By the point in Mary Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein </hi>when we hear of
                the Creature startling at his own reflection, we already know the extent of his pain
                and isolation, which he has eloquently expressed to Victor. We also know of his
                rejection by his creator, who regards him as a “Devil” and “vile insect” (99).
                Nearly two centuries later, in <hi rend="italic">Waist-High in the World
                </hi>(1997), Nancy Mairs described a similar scene: once, on catching a glimpse of
                herself in a mirror, she “squealed,” “Eek, a cripple!’” (46). Although Mairs recalls
                “laughing” at the time, she notes that her “humor betrayed a deeper, darker
                reaction” based on her acute sense, as a disabled woman, of bodily inadequacy (46).
                In most ways Mairs’s life could hardly be more different from the Creature’s; Mairs
                describes a fulfilling career and community, an intimate and mutually supportive
                marriage, two children, and her Catholic faith. But both moments of shock illustrate
                the internalization of embodied expectations—something Adam Smith suggested when he
                called society a mirror by which we can learn to judge ourselves—and illustrate how
                profoundly an awareness of non-normative embodiment can undermine our personal sense
                of wellbeing.<note place="foot" resp="author">Smith suggests this generally, but as Paul
                            Kelleher has argued, Smith’s theory of sympathy operationally and
                            conceptually depends on the category of deformity.</note></p>
                
            <p>In this essay, we share Martha Stoddard Holmes’s sense of
                    “how much <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein </hi>has to say about disability” and share her puzzlement
                    about why “we rarely see it on those terms” (375). Stoddard Holmes incisively
                    reads <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> “‘with’ disability”—following several scholars who have
                    read the Creature as a metaphor for disability, or as defined by an unnamed
                    deformity. <note place="foot" resp="author"> In a short reading of the novel, Lennard J.
                            Davis lays out a provocation, “We do not often think of the monster in
                            Mary Shelley’s work as disabled, but what else is he?”—and goes on to
                            read the Creature as “a disruption in the visual field” (143). Yet, as
                            Fuson Wang has noted, “there still exists no detailed account of [the
                            novel’s] take on disability” (3). Wang’s and Stoddard Holmes’s articles
                            have begun to fill in this gap, as has Jared Richman’s reading
                            of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> as “both a disability narrative and a passing
                            novel” that hinges on “elocutionary mastery” (190 – 1). It is worth
                            mentioning that foundational literary disability studies scholars David
                            Mitchell and Sharon Snyder view the novel as an example of the
                            instrumental and exploitative use of disability as a plot device—a
                            conclusion that scholars of Romanticism might find more difficult to
                            reach, given the tendency to view Shelley’s Creature as complex and
                            sympathetic, and to view the novel’s ending as unresolved. Also see
                            Essaka Joshua on blindness in the novel.</note> We wish to go further. 
                Fuson Wang has aptly noted how “Shelley frustrates every attempt to see the creature” (4), yet when
                    historically contextualized, the novel’s few specific and relatively stable
                    descriptors of the Creature’s appearance begin to seem like very clear and
                    recognizable markers of nineteenth-century disease and disability.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Wang rightly calls attention to the novel’s ambiguous characterization
                            of the Creature’s “deformity of…aspect” (76); its “unreliable narration,
                            contradiction, half-truths, exaggerations, and strategic prevarication”
                            (3); and the “flagrant contradiction” in the most detailed bodily
                            description we are given of the Creature, in the animation scene
                            (4). Emily teaches these features of the novel as characteristic of descriptions of disability:
                            because disability can “disorder expectations” (Garland-Thomson <hi
                            rend="italic">Staring</hi> 37)
                            and trigger what Ato Quayson calls “aesthetic nervousness,” it often
                            provokes unstable narration.</note> 
                
                Most notably, the Creature’s “dull yellow eye” and
                “yellow skin” are signals of illnesses including yellow fever (57), and the
                Creature’s stature, “about eight feet” (54), matches the advertised height of
                several famous eighteenth- and nineteenth-century “giants.” </p>
                
            <p>Just as <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> addresses contemporaneous scientific
                    flashpoints such as galvanism and vitality debates, then, we view the novel as an early exploration of
                    “disability” in its modern sense, written coincident to the consolidation of
                    medical authority over the body and the development of normative ideals of
                    embodiment.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Essaka Joshua’s <hi rend="italic">Physical
                        Disability in British Romantic Literature</hi> (2020) has
                        a chapter on <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein </hi>in which Joshua reads the
                        Creature in the contexts of deformity and monstrosity while arguing, as her
                        book does as a whole, that it is anachronistic to identify “disability” in
                        the Romantic era. (As what Joshua calls a “pre-disability” period, she
                        claims that Romanticism requires us to use another set of terms.) By
                        contrast, Emily views Joshua’s thorough and compelling discussion of the
                        Creature alongside 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>- and 19<hi rend="sup"
                        >th</hi>-century accounts of monstrosity and deformity as in fact evidence
                        of the existence of an operative Romantic-era concept of “disability” as a
                        sociocultural identity and aesthetic category—even if it wasn’t so named by
                        1818. In many cases (such as <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>), literary,
                        medical, and philosophical authors explicitly engaged, and sometimes even
                        theorized, the social and aesthetic dimensions of non-normative
                        embodiment—the foundation of “disability” for many contemporary Disability
                        Studies scholars. (See Emily B. Stanback’s 2016 book <hi rend="italic">The
                            Wordsworth-Coleridge Circle and the Aesthetics of
                        Disability</hi>.)</note>
                The Creature embodies deformity in a general sense, is “disabled” by virtue of his
                    sociocultural and aesthetic positioning within the novel, and also gestures to
                    specific types of embodiment that were pathologized during the Romantic era.
                    Importantly, the novel also addresses aspects of Romantic-era discussions of
                    race, calling attention to the ways that Western medicine and science
                similarly studied, classified, pathologized, and exploited disabled and non-European
                    people in the eighteenth and nineteenth
                centuries—a legacy that we still live with today.<note

            <p>Using Frankenstein’s Creature as a focal point, this essay
                    addresses three pedagogical situations at the University of Southern Mississippi
                    (USM), where Emily is a faculty member, and from where Ashley is a graduate with
                    a degree in English and a minor in biological sciences. The first is a yearlong
                    freshman-level interdisciplinary Honors College seminar (henceforth “Honors
                    Colloquium”) that Emily taught in 2018 – 2019 and in 2019 – 2020; though themed
                    differently, both sections of Honors Colloquium featured historically
                    contextualized examinations of disability and race. The second is “Literature of
                    Experimentation,” a section of the capstone to USM’s English major that Emily
                    taught in the spring of 2018, with Ashley as a student. Both Honors Colloquium
                    and “Literature of Experimentation” were discussion-based courses; assignments
                    included research presentations, low-stakes writing assignments such as reading
                    responses and journals, and a final research paper. Finally, we discuss Ashley’s
                    2019 Honors College thesis, which examined <hi rend="italic">
                    Frankenstein</hi> alongside two responses to
                    Shelley’s novel, James Whale’s 1931 film and Victor LaValle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Destroyer </hi> (2018). When possible, we integrate the voices
                    of other of Emily’s students who have volunteered to reflect on the course
                    material.</p>
                
            <p>In what follows, we situate the Creature as the heart of a constellation of texts,
                historical and fictional figures, and conceptual concerns that we believe can allow
                students to apprehend the importance of how we react to those bodyminds we deem
                non-normative—the bodyminds of strangers, coworkers, classmates, and loved ones, and
                even our own bodyminds.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In using Margaret Price’s term “bodymind”
                            here and elsewhere, we have in mind Sami Schalk’s note that the phrase
                            is apt for discussions of race, in addition to disability, insofar as
                            the “enmeshment of mind and body” can be useful in “discussing the toll
                            racism takes on people of color” (5).</note>
                The courses and connections we discuss are all
                transhistorical but begin with, or look back to, the early nineteenth century.
                Implicit to this essay, then, is a claim that to understand how disability and race
                function today, we need to revisit the Romantic era—and Mary Shelley’s Creature
                provides an unusually rich locus around which we can focus classroom conversations.
                It is our belief that reading Mary Shelley’s Creature as disabled can allow for
                productive and ethically important conversations about embodiment—especially if in
                doing so we situate the Creature in non-literary contexts, both historical and
                present day. By rendering the novel’s engagements with medicine, disability, and
                race concrete, conversations about the Creature can promote—and in some cases
                disrupt, or promote through disruption—students’ and professors’ sense of
                    wellbeing. <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> invites us to do the uncomfortable
                work of questioning our beliefs about medicine and rethinking our relationships with
                our own bodies and the bodies that surround us. Perhaps most importantly, Shelley’s
                Creature can also provide an impetus to work towards actively creating more
                inclusive and hospitable worlds. </p>
         
            <div type="section">
                <head>The Creature Constructed: Romantic Medicine and
                    Spectacular Bodies</head>
           
            <p>From the first, Emily frames <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> as a
                    novel that interrogates scientific perspectives on non-normative embodiment.
                    This is why Emily always spends significant class time on the novel’s earliest
                    description of the Creature, which appears in Letter IV as Captain Walton writes
                    to his sister of having witnessed a “gigantic” figure from afar. For Walton, the Creature is clearly a specimen whose
                    extraordinary body demands recording for an English audience. Walton is drawn to the Creature, calling him a "strange sight" that "suddenly attracted our attention"
                    (23), describing how he watched the Creature until he was no longer visible, and
                    noting that “This appearance excited our unqualified wonder” (24). Walton
                    situates the Creature’s body on the boundary of humanity: the Creature is a
                    “traveler” and also a “he” (24)—and later is a “man” (26)—but is also distanced
                    from humanity, “a being which had the shape of a man” (24). Walton also
                    discloses his interpretation of the Creature’s race: the “traveler [the
                    Creature] seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island”
                    (24)—tapping into scientific and cultural connections between exploration,
                    anthropology, disability, and race theory. Here and elsewhere the novel suggests
                    how easily discourses of race and disability slipped into one another and how in
                    many ways these discourses were mutually constitutive. In the 1831 “Preface” and the creation scene, the
                    Creature’s yellow tone can be read as a gesture to disease, or can be read
                    as another racial reference, possibly suggesting (especially alongside the
                    Creature’s dark hair) what Johann Friedrich Blumenbach classified as the Mongolian race (see Anne Mellor).
                    <note place="foot" resp="author"> Over the course
                            of the novel both the Creature and Victor Frankenstein speak of the
                            Creature’s identity in ways that link him to contemporaneous discourse
                            on race. This is a topic of discussion in Emily’s classes, although
                            space does not permit us to discuss it in detail here. In addition to
                            Anne Mellor, the several scholars who have read the Creature in the
                            context of race include Allan Lloyd Smith, who explores the novel’s
                            “thematics of race and slavery” in relation to “contemporary discourses
                            on race, slavery, and antislavery” (209), and H. L. Malchow, who
                            explains how characterizations of the Creature “drew upon contemporary
                            attitudes towards non-whites”—what he calls a “hidden, or ‘coded’”
                            dimension of the Creature’s characterization (90, 92). Just as many
                            critics have read the Creature’s “deformity” as unclassifiable, some
                            critics have suggested that the Creature resists racial classification.
                            Elizabeth Bohls claims that the Creature exists “Beyond any specific
                            category of difference or otherness – gender, race, class” and it is for
                            this reason that he “comes to symbolise a principle of absolute
                            outsiderhood” (168).</note></p>
                
            <p> Emily’s students have been struck by Walton’s
                    enthusiasm—his awe at the Creature, but also his arctic ambition and even his
                    brotherly “love” of Victor Frankenstein despite Victor’s singularly
                    “wretched…condition” and the “wildness, and even madness” in his eyes
                    (25). When contextualized alongside Romantic-era balloonists,
                    medical experimenters like Humphry Davy, and explorers like Joseph Banks, the
                    passionate and danger-seeking Walton—and later Victor Frankenstein—look
                    representative of the Romantic sciences, rather than a perversion of
                    them. Kori M. writes that before Honors
                    Colloquium, she had “for a long time operated under the notion that there were
                    certain entities that you do not challenge: God, government, and medical
                    professionals.” Critiquing Walton and Frankenstein can allow students to
                    question this presumption, and to begin to apprehend that medicine is not, in
                    the words of Honors Colloquium student Eden O., “stone-cold science preserved
                    from the influence of human prejudice and error.” Rather, medicine is profoundly
                    shaped by culture, is (in Eden's words) “subject
                    to every human flaw” of those who shape it, and is marked by frequent revisions
                    and truths that shift over time. In both Honors Colloquium and “Literature of
                    Experimentation,” students researched and gave short presentations on medical
                    and scientific contexts for <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>, from galvanism to arctic
                    exploration to race theory. By researching and critiquing Romantic-era
                    medicine—which developed many features of medicine we now take for
                    granted—students can develop the critical eye that Emily hopes they will deploy
                    in examining contemporary medicine and approaches to embodiment.</p>
                    
            <p> In the context of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> and the links between Romantic-era
                    medicine, disability, and race, Charles Byrne and Sara Baartman can provide
                    especially salient touchstones for students.
                    Shelley’s novel centers the Creature’s narrative while raising questions of
                    voice and agency. Discussing Byrne and Baartman can help us to center the
                    experiences of the historically exploited, rather than the medical authorities
                    whose names and innovations are still celebrated, while also grappling with the
                    ways that their stories have been filtered and altered in entering the
                    historical record <note place="foot" resp="author"> Paul Youngquist’s <hi

                In many compelling ways Byrne’s and Baartman’s stories of scientific abuse echo
                    one another. Both had their identities reduced to their ethnicity and the
                    physical traits that made them valuable medical specimens: Byrne, “The Irish
                    Giant,” was prized and pathologized for his height, an advertised 8’ (the same
                    as Mary Shelley’s Creature, although Byrne was
                    actually 7’7”); Baartman, “the Venus Hottentot,” was diagnosed with
                “steatopygia,” a diagnosis whose sole function was to pathologize Africans who
                appeared to European eyes to have unusually large buttocks.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Hottentot was
                            a European name for a Khoikhoi; “Venus” was a reference to a body whose

                            desire projected onto the bodies of Baartman and other Khoikhoi

                Hunter in Byrne’s case and Georges Cuvier in Baartman’s) through their dissection

                            Byrne’s reported wish to be buried at sea, acquiring his corpse and
                            keeping his bones. Georges Cuvier made a full body cast of Baartman’s
                            body before dissecting her corpse and preserving her
                        genitalia.</note>

                        Paul Youngquist has called Victor Frankenstein
                            John Hunter’s “heir,” and has written of the Creature that “This prodigious
                            being, . . . this tall man, comes to avenge the bones of Charles Byrne” (55).
                            Emily concurs, and reads the end of the novel—in particular the
                            Creature’s agency to choose (or not) a death at sea—as a kind of answer
                            to Byrne’s wishes.</note>
                Discussing the stories of people like Byrne and Baartman underscores the danger latent to
                    responses of awe and exoticization—that wonder and exploitation are in fact two
                    sides of the same coin. Discussing historical figures also can allow students to
                    more readily picture the Creature as a human rather than as a hybrid or
                    otherworldly monster. This allows for fresh classroom interpretations of
                    <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>, especially for students who have encountered the novel—or the
                    Creature—before. For Ashley, discussing and later researching the Creature
                    alongside people like Charles Byrne allowed her
                    to expunge long-held images of a monster with green skin and neck bolts, and to
                    begin to more concretely imagine him as he is described in Shelley’s novel—as
                    the kind of figure who, like Byrne and Baartman, was used to challenge the
                    boundaries of humanity. There also is a reciprocal effect to such discussions: because Byrne’s and Baartman’s voices have
                been almost completely lost to history, in some ways it may be easier to center them
                as subjects alongside the Creature’s moving narrative.</p>
                
            <p>Importantly, both Byrne’s and Baartman’s remains were still held in Europe at the
                turn of the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> century: Baartman was repatriated to South
                Africa in 2002, after periodic display in Paris; until 2017, when the Hunterian
                Collection closed for renovations, Byrne’s skeleton was on display in London. 
                Knowing that the issue of Baartman’s and Byrne’s bodies is
                    contemporary allows Emily’s students to trace the influence of the Romantic era
                    to the present. Honors Colloquium student Kelcie B. writes that Baartman 
                    “is an important figure because we still see her legacy in
                    modern times,” especially in the continued sexualization and dehumanization of
                    Black women.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Crais and Scully for

                    to question our own participation in the troubling patterns of objectification
                    that determined the lives of people like Byrne and Baartman. 
                   In her classes, Emily has found Suzan-Lori Parks’s play
                    Venus (1996) useful in exploring such issues of complicity. The play writes the audience into
                    Baartman’s exploitation in its opening “Overture,” as Venus “revolves” 270 degrees, then an additional 90,
                    then 180 (1 – 2). From the first, we—theatre goers, but also readers—are asked
                    to confront our own desire to stare at Venus’s extraordinary body. Likewise,
                    through its extensive temporal interplay, <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>
                allows students to think through the

                            non-normative bodyminds, largely through the play’s depictions of the
                            Cuvier-inspired character Baron Docteur (and his medical colleagues), as

            <p>When writing her Honors College thesis, Ashley conducted research at Philadelphia’s College of
                    Physicians. She studied records related to the anonymous 19<hi
                    rend="sup">th</hi>-century Mütter American Giant, who at 7’6” nearly matched the height of
                    Charles Byrne, and visited his skeleton at the Mütter Muesum. 
                    Not only did this allow Ashley to more fully
                    appreciate the exploitation of people who have been made into medical specimens;
                    it also allowed her to more fully recognize her affinity with those medical
                    professionals she increasingly had come to condemn. When she encountered the
                    bones of the Mütter American Giant, Ashley was intending to attend
                    medical school, and she experienced an uncomfortable self-recognition: she felt
                    that could understand Victor Frankenstein and Robert Walton—and even John
                    Hunter—when she found herself transfixed by the towering skeleton, feeling that
                    she couldn’t look away, wanting to know more. The presentation of the Mütter 
                    American Giant—as an unnamed specimen on display in a glass box,
                    advertised as “the tallest skeleton on exhibit in North America”—invited
                    objectification, and absolved Ashley of the sense
                    of responsibility she may have felt on encountering a living man of gigantic
                    stature. Nonetheless, in retrospect Ashley felt embarrassment at the fact that
                    it took her so long to regard the skeleton as once having been connected to a
                    human being. Her coursework in literary studies, Ashley believes, allowed her to
                    finally imagine a human back into the skeleton; like other proponents of the
                    health humanities and narrative medicine, she now wonders what would happen if
                    all medical professionals were required to have similar training. </p>
                
            <p>In Emily’s classes, conversations about the history of
                    medicine often reached a kind of climax when students watched <hi rend="italic">Get Out</hi>, which Jordan
                    Peele has called “sort of . . .  my take on <hi rend="italic"
                >Frankenstein</hi>.” The film’s horror hinges on medicine: the protagonist, Chris
                Washington, is the latest would-be victim of a transplantation surgery, “the
                Coagula,” that uses Black bodies as hosts for the brains and consciousness of mostly
                white clients. The surgery allows these patients to recapture youth and health,
                while relegating the host to the position of a “passenger” viewing helplessly from
                an inner distance in the “Sunken Place.” The surgery also allows clients to reap
                what they see as the benefits of blackness, including physical strength and
                athleticism, as well as exoticized coolness (“Black is in fashion!,” a potential
                buyer exclaims to Chris in the prelude to his auction). Chris is a spectacle to be
                admired, a Black body to be bought and sold. Like the Creature—and Sara Baartman and
                Charles Byrne—Chris’s humanity and subjectivity don’t matter to the medical
                professionals and patients who will benefit from his effective murder.<note

                            demonstrated how, in turn, slavery was foundational to the development
                            of gynecology: “Most pioneering surgeries” in gynecology in the United
                            States “happened during interactions between white southern doctors and
                            their black slave patients” (4). In a similar vein, Jim Downs has argued
                            that epidemiology developed in part because of the opportunities to
                            study disease afforded by slave ships and plantations.</note>
                
                In such contexts, Dean Armitage, the father and surgeon in <hi rend="italic">Get
                    Out</hi>, seems less fantastical—just as historical context can render Victor
                Frankenstein more realistic. In their focus on the value
                    of disabled and enslaved bodies to scientific progress, such historical figures
                    as John Hunter and James Marion Sims, like the fictional characters of Victor
                    Frankenstein and Dean Armitage, failed to consider human beings as more than a
                    means to a medical end. “Literature and Experimentation” student Hiba T.
                    found the class’s discussions of "Western Medicine’s exploitation
                    of non-white bodies . . . incredibly unsettling.” Before discussing race, Emily’s
                    “Literature of Experimentation” class had discussed animal experimentation,
                    largely through <hi rend="italic">The Island of Doctor Moreau</hi>. Hiba reflects, “It
                    was really disturbing to know that while we had struggled, through various
                    discussions, to determine if non-human creatures deserved humanity, some people in history
                    had denied actual humans their humanity in such outrageously cruel
                ways.”</p>
                
            <p>Such conversations can be especially difficult—and
                    especially important—for students majoring in the sciences or working towards
                    careers in medicine. One such student, Sonny M., acknowledges that his
                “profession has had a controversial and perhaps cruel past.” 
                Sonny reflects that “It is important that I keep in
                mind just how influential my opinions will be to my future patients, and that not
                all individuals know to seek a second opinion.” Forensic
                    biology major Caroline G. writes that “When we learn that our science
                and medicine is built off of the horrors endured by [marginalized] people in the
                    18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries . . . it allows us
                to see how the systems we have today perpetuate the inequalities.” And yet, Caroline
                notes, “When we can learn about the roots of this system, we can effectively work to
                reverse the damage done.” Brooklynn S., who
                intends to pursue an MD/PhD, writes that “Modern medicine trains people to distance
                themselves from their patients and to curb empathy in the name of science, but a
                lack of empathy and a drive for innovation is what created James Marion Sims.” Brooklyn
                reflects of her future, “More than anything, I don’t want to be James Marion Sims. I
                don’t want to replace empathy with innovation or trade humanity for science.”</p>

                <head>The Creature Rejected: Disability and Society</head>
                
            <p>In both Honors Colloquium and “Literature of
                    Experimentation” Emily has taught the Creature’s animation as a moment at which
                    medicine, via Victor Frankenstein, literally constructs disability by creating
                    the Creature’s non-normative body—but also, by virtue of Victor’s rejection of
                    his progeny, constructs the Creature as “disabled.” As student responses make
                    clear, however, the particular horror of Victor’s response in the animation
                    scene is that it carries the emotional impact of a rejecting parent.
                    <note place="foot" resp="author">Martha Stoddard Holmes has suggested that the
                            Creature’s awakening scene may be interpreted as “dramatiz[ing] an
                            unsatisfactory parental response to the birth of a disabled child”
                            (374). </note>The scene therefore can be said to emblematize the ways that medicine and culture collaborate in
                    shaping responses to non-normative bodyminds. After Victor’s refusal to acknowledge his
                    creation, the Creature’s earliest experiences continue to be of unmitigated
                    rejection—by an old man, villagers, the Delaceys, William Frankenstein, and the
                    companion of a drowning girl. If Walton’s initial response to the Creature
                    tracks with contemporaneous scientific responses to non-normative humans—awe, a
                    desire to collect—the reactions of these other characters require additional
                    explanations. </p>
                
            <p>Emily’s classes, and Ashley’s thesis, looked in part to
                    yellow fever to help explain the horror the Creature elicits. We would not claim
                    that Mary Shelley intended for her readers to think that the Creature was
                    infected with yellow fever. However, jaundiced skin and eyes were an especially
                    potent and fearful shorthand for illness and infectious disease in the
                    19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>century: yellow fever epidemics were unpredictable and medicine had proven impotent at
                    treating the disease or preventing its transmission. 
                    Yellow fever also triggered xenophobic fears because port
                    cities and European travelers to tropical climates had proven susceptible to its
                    deadly effects. The novel’s gestures to yellow fever can be seen as a factor
                    that for 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century audiences may have complicated and amplified responses to the
                    Creature’s gigantic stature and the general sense of deformity he conveys
                    throughout the novel. To more fully account for responses to the Creature,
                    Emily’s classes looked to more general Romantic-era responses to disability. When
                    discussing blind old DeLacey, as well as Justine’s murder trial, Emily’s classes
                    discussed the “science” of physiognomy, and the implications of the belief
                that it is possible to limn a person’s talents, character, and personality by
                attending to their appearance. Physiognomy operates on a fantasy of making the
                interior visible, of finding moral significance in one’s exterior—and Victor
                operates according to this fantasy when he concludes that “Nothing in human shape
                could have destroyed” his brother William (76).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                        part because of an added passage in which Elizabeth becomes a more direct foil
                        to Victor: she is invested in poetry, the sublimity of nature, and “the
                        magnificent appearance of things,” while Victor is invested in “the hidden
                        laws of nature” (36). Elizabeth also is no longer Victor’s cousin, and her
                        beauty is described in greater detail in 1831. The later edition therefore
                        amplifies the novel’s engagements with issues of embodiment and aesthetics,
                        as well as inheritance and bloodlines.</note>
            </p>
                
            <p>Some students suggested that the novel caused them to think about their own
                interpretive processes, and their possible complicity in adopting troubling views of
                    those bodyminds they deem non-normative. One Honors Colloquium student,
                Caroline G., noted that “While physiognomy may not be a scientific practice
                today, reading Frankenstein brought my attention to how much it is still a social
                practice. I’ve begun noticing, too, when people judge others based on their looks or
                demeanor.” A second colloquium student, Eden O., remarked that “Mary Shelley’s

                “point[ing] out the human propensity to fear and despise those that look different
                and think differently than ourselves. In seeing the way Frankenstein’s monster is
                cast out…for no crime greater than an abnormal appearance, I was confronted with my
                own tendency to be made uncomfortable by [disability or illness].” And yet, Eden
                wrote, becoming “aware” of these tendencies “has given me the opportunity to address
                it directly and better recognize the prevalence of everyday discrimination.” </p>
                
            <p>Emily’s class discussions often dwell on young William
                    Frankenstein’s response to the Creature, which suggests how Shelley’s 19<hi
                    rend="sup">th</hi>-century readers—just
                    like 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>-century college students—would have received contradictory messages about
                    disability. The Creature has approached William because of his young age,
                    assuming him “unprejudiced” because presumably he “had lived too short a time to
                    have imbibed a horror of deformity” (142). But the Creature’s hope is misplaced,
                    as William interprets him as a fearful “ogre” who will “eat me, and tear me to
                    pieces” (142). This is the novel’s only reference to an ogre, the gigantic
                    creature that populated children’s stories. As students can easily recognize, in
                    many traditional fairy tales, bodily difference is often symbolic of evil
                    intent. Asking students to list physically
                    disabled villains in popular media—fairy tales, comic books, Disney movies,
                    superhero movies, crime procedurals—can be a useful exercise. So, too, is asking
                    them to think of villains whose bodies do not visibly reflect their evil; often these
                    villains are explicitly diagnosed with psychiatric conditions that in reality do
                    not correlate with violent crime.</p>
                
            <p>When discussing the moment at which the Creature is shot by
                    the companion of a girl he has just saved from drowning (141), Emily has
                drawn links to recent police shootings of disabled people in the United States, as
                well as the mechanisms by which we determine that someone is a threat. For example,
                in 2017, Magdiel Sanchez was shot dead in his front yard while holding a
                pipe—despite cries from witnesses who told cops that he was deaf and could not hear
                their commands. In 2016 a North Miami police officer shot Charles Kinsey, the Black
                occupational therapist of an autistic man named Arnaldo Rios-Soto; the police
                officer had misapprehended Rios-Soto’s toy truck as a weapon, although Kinsey
                repeatedly explained the situation to the police. The police defended the shooting
                by saying that the autistic Rios-Soto, not Kinsey, was the intended target. Such
                incidents raise difficult questions. How and why do some misapprehend disabled
                people, whose bodies may move differently from how they expect bodies will move, or
                who might communicate in ways that they don’t recognize? And how can we account for
                the intersections between disability and race when it comes to violent police
                responses to unarmed, or legally armed, people?</p>
                
            <p>Victor LaValle’s <hi rend="italic">Destroyer </hi>(2018), which Emily has assigned in
                Honors Colloquium and which Ashley discussed in her thesis, directly hinges on a police shooting. 
                Although <hi rend="italic">Destroyer</hi> begins in the Artic with Mary Shelley’s Creature, who has
                survived for two centuries, we also soon meet a second Creature-figure in the form
                of Akai, the reanimated son of Black experimental scientist Dr. Josephine Baker.<note place="foot" resp="author" >
                        In addition to Shelley’s Creature—a truly
                            fascinating character in <hi rend="italic">Destroyer</hi>—as well as a (briefly)
                            reconstituted Victor Frankenstein, the key characters in the graphic
                            novel gesture to Shelley’s characters in complex ways. Dr. Baker is in
                            some ways a figure of Victor Frankenstein, but also resembles the
                            Creature in her losses and revenge. Both Akai and the Bride (formerly
                            Pliers, Akai’s father) are figures for the Creature in the scientific,
                            experimental, hybrid constitution of their bodies. As a figure who seeks
                            the advancement of science at all cost, Dr. Baker’s boss embodies some
                            of Victor’s characteristics.</note> Akai was shot by police
                officers after they mistook the 12-year-old boy’s little league baseball bat for a
                    gun. <hi rend="italic">Destroyer</hi> frames Akai’s death in the same way that
                more and more people have come to interpret similar events: as the product of a
                racism that is foundational to the history of the United States. (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Destroyer </hi>links Dr. Baker’s loss to that of Medgar Evers’s widow, and
                depicts Baker in the seat of the Lincoln Memorial when she declares herself “the
                Destroyer” in avenging her son’s death.) Similarly, <hi rend="italic">Destroyer </hi>
                    problematizes past technological milestones as well as possible technological
                    futures. We may take aspects of science and medicine for granted, but like
                    <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein,</hi> LaValle’s <hi rend="italic">Destroyer</hi> invites us to cultivate skepticism.</p>
                
            <p>Emily’s classes pursue what she hopes are troubling
                    conversations about the agency of characters in, and readers of, <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Destroyer</hi>.
                    It is difficult to hold Shelley’s Creature solely responsible for what he
                    does—he had no guidance or love, as students so often note—but it 
                    is also difficult to fully absolve him of responsibility,
                    especially for the murders he commits out of revenge. From a Disability Studies
                    standpoint, we believe it is important that the Creature is not merely a villain
                    or a victim, two stereotypes that disabled characters often inhabit, especially
                    in 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>- and
                    21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>-century
                    media. Instead, the novel may be said to offer a stringent critique of the
                    common tendency to presume character from appearance, depicting the pain and
                    futility with which an individual may fight against such assumptions. Because he
                    is neither victim nor villain, we are forced to recognize the Creature’s human
                    complexity. Something similar may be said of Dr. Josephine Baker, who assumes
                    the mantle of “The Destroyer” and takes violent revenge after tremendous
                    struggle and loss, and after fruitlessly contending with the systemic misogyny
                    that led to the loss of her job and the systemic racism that led to the loss of
                    her only child.</p>
                
            <p>In the end, Emily’s students expressed deep feeling for
                    Mary Shelley’s Creature, but also the pain of feeling for him. Honors Colloquium
                    student Mallory E. wrote of the Creature that she “hurt for him,” and
                felt distress at being privy to so much of his pain and “trauma.” Honors Colloquium
                student Emma S. was most moved by the scene in which Victor tore apart the
                Creature’s mate: “All he craved was a community and to be loved. When Victor
                destroyed the mate, he destroyed the Creature’s last chance at being loved, which in
                turn destroyed his last chance of fulfilling the purpose that God had written on the
                borrowed heart inside his chest.” For Ashley, the effect of researching and writing
                about both <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Destroyer
                </hi>in her thesis was to provoke her to confront racist and ableist assumptions she
                had been acculturated to make. She did not think of her own ingrained prejudices
                while reading Shelley’s and LaValle’s novels; rather, after reading them and
                reflecting on them, she began to much more readily identify, question, and address
                her own quick judgments. </p>
                
            <p>For other students, confronting the Creature allowed them to recognize internalized
                normative values that they had wielded against themselves—much like Nancy Mairs
                describes reeling at her own reflection, and then interpreting that impulsive
                response. Kori M. wrote about how the discussions in Honors Colloquium led her to
                view her own bodymind differently.“At some point it really hit me,” she wrote. “I might not
                    have all the medical verbiage to explain what's happening in my body but in a
                    lot of ways I will always understand it better than someone standing on the
                    outside looking in.” Reading <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>, and
                    discussing the history of medicine, she wrote, was part of recognizing and
                    processing her embodied identity, and how society had shaped her sense of
                    wellbeing. She wrote, 
                    
            <quote>"In my own experience I had to overcome the fear not of how
                    my declining health was continuing to encroach upon and diminish my quality of
                    life, but on how differently people would see me if they knew the extent of my
                    disability. As a young woman I had to address whether or not my body’s
                    dysfunction had at all diminished my feminine beauty. As a young black woman I
                    had to face the fact that seeking treatment and medication was almost as if I
                    was crossing an invisible barrier into an untapped sphere of vulnerability. I
                    experienced none of these difficulties separately but rather they acted in
                    conjunction with one other."</quote>
                
            What Kori describes is, Emily hopes, is an ongoing process
                    of seeking and questioning and scrutinizing that may allow each of us to have
                    more agency over how we view and treat ourselves as bodyminds. Such seeking and
                    questioning and scrutinizing also may help us to be more accountable for the
                    ways that we interpret—and impact—the bodyminds we encounter. </p>

                <head>The Creature and Crip Futures</head>
                
            <p>As humanists, we are trained to consider the kinds of
                    difficult questions that medicine necessitates, such as how we do—and could
                    otherwise—value different kinds of bodyminds, and what constitutes a life worth
                    living. Many of us teach our students to identify biases and critique
                    stereotypes, and teach literature that allows our students to consider the
                    perspectives of people who are different from them. As literary scholars, we can
                    understand and articulate the importance of the language we use when talking or
                    writing about certain kinds of bodily conditions. We also understand the
                    importance of narrative and why, for example, it matters if a doctor believes
                    their patient’s account of her own body, or what it might mean for technology to
                    contradict a patient’s sense of his own symptoms. “Literature of
                    Experimentation” student Zachary W. suggests, “The world needs
                scientists and engineers in order to push humanity forward and bring to life
                extraordinary and impossible ideas, but we need those individuals in philosophy and
                the arts to inspire us to keep pushing and ethically guide how we choose to do
                that.” Or, as Honors Colloquium student and future medical professional Sonny M. has
                    commented, humanistic inquiry can be seen as part of a “a system of checks and
                    balances” that is “necessary . . . in order to keep [science and medicine]
                    functioning fairly and humanely.” </p>
                
            <p>Hiba T. wrote that reading <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frankenstein</hi> “forced me to contend with what it means to be human”—a line
                of inquiry that left her “disturbed” and “bewildered,” and that she had never before
                considered. Now a graduate student in creative writing, Hiba says that she was “still reeling from those questions” and that
                “they continue to haunt me in my poetry studies.” It is our hope that the Creature
                can likewise continue to haunt us, but we hope he also may guide us. Although he
                regarded his reflection with “terror,” the Creature requested a mate who looked like
                him. This request often is read as pragmatic or defeatist, but it also can be
                interpreted as resistant, or even as recuperative. Emily teaches it as a promise to
                behold disability and to not turn away. This is, of course, precisely what the
                Creature himself was denied by his creator, by strangers, and by a child, all of
                whom covered their eyes or otherwise averted their gaze; even old DeLacey, the one
                character who conditionally accepted the Creature, implied that were he not blind,
                he would “judge of [the Creature’s] countenance” (134). The Creature’s request of
                Victor is to enable his future with a similarly embodied companion, explicitly
                removed from European society in South America. In imagining this future, the
                Creature resists curative logic (see Alison Kafer), identifying the problem of
                disability as a problem with (European) society and not with his bodymind itself. We
                can and should regard the Creature’s story as a cautionary tale. But we may also
                look to the Creature as we work to imagine crip futures—the possibilities that move
                beyond the norms that consolidated as Mary Shelley sent her “hideous progeny” into
                the world.</p>
