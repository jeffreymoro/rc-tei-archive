               <h1><span class="head">Introduction</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>There are moments in every life when the importance of wellbeing becomes unavoidable:
               moments of acute illness or extreme anxiety; moments when we must confront death.
               As we revise this introduction in 2021, we are collectively experiencing one such
               moment. In the current global COVID-19 pandemic, our lives have been profoundly affected
               by issues of contagion, health, mortality, and the deep systemic inequalities that
               shape embodied experience. Those of us in teaching professions have additionally had
               to confront the pandemic’s complex effects on the relationship between wellbeing and
               pedagogy. We may find ourselves struggling to balance our own wellbeing against our
               institution’s, advocating for our students’ wellbeing, and thinking in new ways about
               the relationship between labor (our own and our students’) and mental and physical
               health. </p>
            <p>As we’re reminded of our vulnerability, we also may feel more acutely the value of
               the humanities and the arts. We look to writing, film, and music for meaning and solace.
               We may look to the past for insight into the present: how did we get here, and how
               do we move forward? As scholars of Romantic literature and culture, we know that the
               years between 1750 and 1850 were pivotal for shaping contemporary ideas about wellbeing,
               health, illness, and disability. In this introductory essay, we hope to show that
               the Romantic era can also offer resources for thinking about the particular intersection
               between wellbeing and pedagogy. Romantic thinkers mapped out territory we would do
               well to revisit, scouting out the pitfalls they dug for us and using their insights
               to help us identify and avoid new ones. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To say that the Romantics believed wellbeing informed pedagogy is in some ways to
                  state the obvious. In the “Preface to Lyrical Ballads (1802),” Wordsworth explains
                  that poets can enlighten a reader’s understanding, provided the reader “is in a healthful
                  state of association,” and in “The Tables Turned,” Wordsworth posits that “spontaneous
                  wisdom” is “breathed by health”—as if health were wisdom’s prerequisite.

                           of the mind and the body as separate entities, the latter of which (the body) is and

                  of whose bodymind always matters. The canon as it emerged in the Victorian era occluded
                  the voices of marginalized people that we must foreground to understand the stakes
                  of Romanticism’s conceptual preoccupations. In focusing on British Romanticism, this
                  volume considers the decades during which a rising medical profession helped consolidate
                  bodily norms as well as what Rosemarie Garland-Thomson calls the “normate”: “the corporeal
                  incarnation of culture's collective, unmarked, normative characteristics.”

                  </div> While oppressive structures of race, disability, and gender predate the nineteenth
                  century, the rise of professional medicine during the Romantic era gave them a destructive
                  scientific legitimacy. During the era, physicians worked to justify the ideas that
                  disabled bodies should be cured and that non-white and non-male bodies were designed
                  to be, in different ways, subjugated.</p>

               <p>Yet in the decades leading to the consolidation of these violent norms, authors also

                  alternatives—from Thomas Beddoes’s conception of “health” as a functional and aesthetic
                  category, to Charles Lamb’s embrace of non-normative embodiment, to Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                  negotiation of chronic illness.

                  wellbeing and pedagogy, we pick up on the lively, robust, and generous conversations
                  about this topic that already exist on social media and have begun to take place at
                  our conferences.

                           at the University of Colorado, Boulder, hosted a pedagogy workshop to which considerations
                           of wellbeing were central. Meanwhile, the 18th- and 19th-century twitter community
                           has regular conversations about pedagogy, accessibility, and instructor and student

                  </div> By engaging some of those conversations, we invite our field to take them further.
                  As we will show, Romantic thinkers saw wellbeing as relative, embodied, and inextricable
                  from social and political circumstances. Teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has
                  urgently clarified how dependent good pedagogy is upon such multidimensional wellbeing—our

                  <p>While the terms “wellness” and “wellbeing” are often used interchangeably, their histories
                     reveal very different conceptual approaches to health. We draw a distinction between
                     them because we want to show how thinking with “wellbeing” opens possibilities that
                     “wellness” forecloses. In particular, thinking with wellbeing—rather than wellness—can
                     productively reframe conversations about pedagogy. We understand “wellbeing” as a
                     capacious, relative, and individual model of being “well” that aligns with Romantic
                     ideas of health and stands in contrast to current models of “wellness,” which often
                     reinscribe ableist, classist, and sometimes racist and Eurocentric embodied ideals,
                     perpetuating inequalities in and beyond the classroom. In focusing on these two terms,
                     we hope to draw a conceptual and terminological distinction that can allow scholars
                     to more precisely identify and critique issues of wellness, acknowledge wellbeing,
                     and explore wellbeing’s pedagogical importance.

                  <p>In the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, “wellness” has two primary definitions, each reflecting aspects of how the concept
                     has come to operate in contemporary society. The first sense of “wellness” had appeared
                     by the 17th century, while the second took root in the mid-20th century. Both are
                     problematic for who they exclude, and why. The first definition equates wellness with
                     physical health: “The state or condition of being well or in good health, in contrast
                     to being ill; the absence of sickness; the state of (full or temporary) recovery from
                     illness or injury.” This definition is straightforward and unsurprising in its exclusions.
                     It precludes many disabled and all sick people from “being well,” even while acknowledging
                     that “temporary” recovery can amount to wellness. The mid-20th century definition
                     is more troubling: “As a positive rather than contrastive quality: the state or condition

                     </div> Framing wellness as a “goal” to be “pursued” demands “physical, mental, and spiritual”
                     labor from the pursuer. Notably, its emphasis on agency (“actively pursued”) implicates
                     the pursuer for any failure to achieve or maintain that goal. And the definition’s
                     emphasis on wellness as a “positive rather than contrastive quality” means its “good”
                     is static and ideal, not flexible and relative. This more recent definition implies
                     wellness in fact has become a moral virtue that demands independent effort to achieve.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As the OED suggests, as an ideal, wellness is a “state or condition” that excludes
                  not only the disabled, sick, and injured, but also bodyminds our culture has stigmatized
                  as “unhealthy” by definition—fat or addicted people, for example. It also excludes
                  many who might otherwise be considered “normal” and “healthy” but who lack the social
                  and economic access to resources that sustain “good” health, like adequate food, health
                  insurance, or a workday that allows for sufficient sleep and exercise. Poor people,
                  many people of color, incarcerated people, and others are frequently prevented by
                  systemic oppression from “actively pursuing” wellness—if, in fact, they would even
                  want to pursue it in the first place. As with all ideals, wellness is not something
                  all people can prioritize, even as it is a standard to which most are held at some
                  point in their lives. </p>

                     been identified by scholars as forms of cultural capital.

                              the 2019 Peloton commercial in which an already slender woman, after being gifted
                              a $2500 stationary bike by her partner, used her phone to document a year of her daily
                              exercise routine, which she edited into a video to share with her partner. Critics
                              castigated the commercial’s dangerously sexist assumption that women should undertake
                              grueling—and possibly unchosen—exercise regimens in order uphold an ideal of femininity.
                              To our minds, the commercial’s celebration of documenting exercise illustrates how

                  <p>By contrast, wellbeing is a more flexible and community-oriented concept, and is much
                     less dependent on capitalist industries. The first OED definition of “wellbeing” is
                     markedly more capacious than any definition of “wellness”: “With reference to a person
                     or community: the state of being healthy, happy, or prosperous; physical, psychological,
                     or moral welfare.” By suggesting several different ways in which a person can achieve
                     wellbeing (being happy, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> healthy, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> prosperous), rather than a positive “state or condition,” “wellbeing” better aligns
                     with the issues of access equity in which our volume is invested. The second definition
                     of “wellbeing” encompasses “things,” including humans, non-human life, and communities:
                     a “good or safe condition, ability to flourish or prosper.”

                     </div> Unlike wellness, wellbeing can be flexible, defined according to personal and possibly
                     evolving standards. What wellbeing means for me may not apply to you, and might change
                     over our lifetimes. The “ability to flourish” is open to disabled, sick, and fat people.
                     Moreover, wellbeing can be used to describe communities as well as individual people.
                     Like individuals, communities can flourish or not, and their wellbeing depends on
                     a wide variety of social, political, and cultural factors. Nowhere is this clearer
                     than in the second OED definition, which indicates how a “safe condition” can be integral
                     to wellbeing. Safety is created by supportive communities and threatened by oppression;
                     unsurprisingly, it is an aspect of wellbeing that wellness culture’s liberal individualism
                     often ignores. By calling attention to what might enable or prevent a person—or groups
                     of people—from flourishing, wellbeing invites us to interrogate systems of power and
                     privilege.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wellbeing, by this definition, is a surprisingly Romantic idea. Relative notions of
                     health prevailed in eighteenth-century medicine and culture, reminding us that it
                     is possible to conceive of our bodyminds without always judging them against others.
                     The Romantic era was a time when such relative conceptions of health existed alongside
                     developing ideas about bodily norms.

                              medical men were developing a language (which we still use) for situating all people
                              in relation to each other, for measuring their deviation from the normal, and, increasingly,

                     and privilege, from gender norms to slavery, affected the wellbeing of individuals
                     and communities. We can draw a clear line between the Romantics and the concept of
                     wellbeing we develop in this introduction, a concept that resists the exclusions central

                  <p>To offer a brief history: in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, people assessed
                     their health by more individual standards than those to which we’ve become accustomed.
                     For example, Coleridge’s notebooks and letters contain a nuanced terminology for his
                     varying states of wellbeing. “My Health is indifferent / I am rather endurably unwell,
                     than tolerably well” is a characteristic statement.

                              definitions of wellbeing. In response to his chronic illnesses he is at different
                              times vulnerable and stoic: “The effect of years cannot be done away with in a few
                              weeks—I am tranquil &amp; resigned—and even if I should not bring back Health, I shall

                     </div> Coleridge’s measure for his own health was not a set of normative statistics, but
                     his relative comfort in his own body and how that comfort had shifted over time. Similarly,
                     medicine of the era took a more flexible, individualistic approach to “health” than
                     Victorian medicine would go on to endorse. James Curry and William Babington, lecturers
                     at Guy’s Hospital during Keats’s study there, critiqued definitions of disease as
                     “any variation from the most perfect and healthy state” because these were “too general.”
                     For Curry and Babington, “health and disease” are “relative rather than positive terms,”
                     respecting “the individual as compared with the generality of men, and with himself

                     Romantic era were “part of a contest in which ideologies and stereotypes were in the
                     process of being formed, often in conflict with each other and in contradiction with

                     gender, and disability, among others. For example, the Romantic stereotype of the
                     hysterical woman leverages anti-dualism to claim that women’s bodies blunt their rational
                     faculties, while William Lawrence deployed his anti-dualist materialism in racist
                     claims of the superiority of European (white) intelligence, aligning non-whites with
                     apes on the grounds of supposed bodily resemblance.

                     </div> For the Romantics, wellbeing was viscerally political. Hungry citizens in England’s
                     major cities were keenly aware that the 1815 Corn Laws were enacted in response to
                     the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But preserving the bodily politic did not necessarily
                     mean the exclusion of disabled people; at the heart of John Thelwall’s elocutionary
                     project was his desire to help a broader range of people, including variously disabled
                     people, participate in public discourse. In the same way, Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> is a cautionary tale about why ostracizing bodily difference causes mental and physical
                     anguish not only for the person who is ostracized, but also for their broader social
                     and political communities. Moreover, the desire of one man to pursue an impossible
                     ideal of individual health—Victor’s desire to create artificial life began as a quest
                     for medical immortality—proves fatal for his social sphere.

                     consumption could be markers of status, while writers like Wordsworth idealized the
                     rural poor as healthier because of their presumed proximity to Nature.

                     focused on a particular form of functional health that almost exclusively emphasized
                     laboring capacity. In <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince</span>, for example, Prince explains “they will have work—work—work, night and day, sick
                     or well, till we are quite done up” (38), and describes the abuse that she and other
                     enslaved people suffered when they were unable to work because of physical disability.

               <p>All of these contexts demonstrate how labor was a key interlocutor between wealth
                  and wellbeing. To be well-off meant having the leisure to either languish with consumption
                  or afford a healthful walking-tour in Nature; to be poor meant working through consumption
                  and physical labor undertaken in the outdoors. This relationship between wellbeing
                  and work conditions persists today, and is of particular significance for the contemporary
                  university, whose reliance on an overworked, underpaid, and uninsured contingent labor
                  pool has far-reaching consequences for both workers and students. The COVID-19 pandemic
                  has thrown all of these relationships into even sharper relief. In 2021, as universities
                  continue to make widely variable decisions about course delivery methods and health
                  and safety protocols, the bodyminds whose wellbeing is most at risk are campus staff
                  and contingent faculty, many of whom are already multiply marginalized, and who now
                  face firings, furloughs, or weighing their financial survival against working in risky

               <h2><span class="head">Wellbeing and Pedagogy </span></h2>
               <p>To adopt a Romantic attitude towards wellbeing and learning, then, is to recognize
                  the complexity of the relationship between those terms. Yet considerations of wellbeing
                  in the academy often fail to acknowledge this complexity. Revisiting Romantic conceptions
                  of wellbeing can allow us to identify and challenge simplistic approaches. While open
                  discussions of wellbeing in the academy have increased in past years, they have largely
                  confined themselves to conversations about what in this Introduction we interpret
                  as issues of wellness. For example, the “wellness” tag on the Chronicle of Higher
                  Education’s ProfHacker blog series contains several posts on time management, perfectionism,
                  social media, and activity-tracking technology, but few on adjunctification, campus
                  accessibility, or the emotional costs of systemic racism in the academy. Such analyses
                  explore individual experiences of wellbeing but downplay their wider social and political
                  contexts—contexts that were central to conceptions of wellbeing for Romantic thinkers.
                  As a result, they shift responsibility for being well onto the individual and promote
                  limited ideals of health. These ideals become exclusionary when adopted as guides
                  for university policy. For example, some universities have responded to calls to improve
                  the wellbeing of faculty, students, and staff by offering free fitness classes, building
                  outdoor exercise equipment, and enrolling workers in incentive-based fitness tracking
                  programs. Regardless of intention, these initiatives fail to acknowledge how the wellness
                  they offer is not accessible to many and that “health” is, as Romantic authors articulate,
                  individual and variable. Campus initiatives based on normative ideals of wellness,
                  like yoga classes or campus rock-climbing walls, support some at the expense of others.
                  In doing so, they replicate marginalizations that already threaten the wellbeing of
                  many faculty, staff, and—of special importance for this volume—students. </p>
               <p>It is a core principle of this collection that issues of wellbeing are issues of pedagogy,
                  and vice versa. When our students enter our classrooms, they bring with them their
                  personal histories, intellectual curiosities, hopes, fears, sociocultural positionings,
                  and more—all of which can be well, or not, in ways that matter for their learning.
                  Our students enter our classrooms as bodyminds that have complex histories of inclusion
                  and exclusion, illness and medical management. Considering their wellbeing as a pedagogical
                  issue means more than thinking through our courses’ late policies, including content
                  notes on readings, or setting ground rules for respectful discussion—though it certainly
                  includes all these things. It also means seeing students’ learning as dependent on
                  a wellbeing shaped by their environment, both within the university and beyond it.
                  Access is often what’s at stake in these considerations. Marginalized students face
                  unique challenges to their wellbeing on campuses that were not, in many cases, designed
                  with them in mind—and that in some cases may originally have been designed to specifically
                  exclude them. </p>
               <p>Accordingly, the relationship between wellbeing and pedagogy means more than what
                  happens during class. A student’s absence can be the first indication that something
                  is wrong. Instructors are often the first to recommend campus counselling, or help
                  a student report a sexual assault. First-generation students, as well as students
                  who are immigrants or undocumented, face threats not necessarily visible during class
                  time. Several essays in this volume address the question of what pedagogies of wellbeing
                  look like once we step outside the classroom. Corey Goergen asks students in his Romanticism
                  courses to map barriers to accessibility on their campuses, while Elizabeth Effinger
                  teaches Romantic poetry to women inmates, a population whose wellbeing is often overlooked
                  and who some would claim have relinquished their right to pursue it. Emily B. Stanback
                  and Ashley Hobson think about how texts like <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> invite students to confront normative assumptions about disability and race, a sometimes
                  uncomfortable process in which they may realize the basis of their own exclusion,
                  but also ways in which they have been complicit in excluding others. These essays
                  demonstrate how limiting pedagogical questions of wellbeing to the strict space of
                  the classroom, or locating their answers in university initiatives focused on wellness,
                  neglects whole dimensions of experience for students and instructors.</p>
               <p>At the same time, acknowledging that our obligations to our students extend beyond
                  the classroom reminds us how instructor wellbeing is essential to good pedagogy. The
                  problem of adjunctification is very much a pedagogical problem, too. How do we bear
                  the effects of our students’ trauma and suffering? This question becomes especially
                  fraught for contingent and graduate student instructors. It is also pressing for instructors
                  who are BIPoC, neurodivergent, queer, trans, religious minorities, or part of other
                  regionally, nationally, and academically marginalized groups. These instructors are
                  often expected to take on extra emotional labor in mentoring marginalized students
                  as they move through institutions fraught with systemic racism, ableism, homophobia,
                  classism, and transphobia—all while navigating these same spaces themselves. In this
                  volume, Travis Chi Wing Lau’s essay takes up some of these issues, meditating on what
                  it means to teach disability as a disabled instructor whose pedagogical goals include
                  helping his students advocate for themselves. Similarly, Jason S. Farr’s concept of
                  “improvisational accessibility” shows how pedagogies of flexibility, creativity, and
                  responsiveness can promote instructor and student wellbeing beyond institutional constraints.
                  </p>
               <p>As the essays in this volume demonstrate, “wellbeing” is a capacious category. It
                  touches everything that matters to our lives, and everything affects it. This Romantic
                  Circles Pedagogies volume is inspired by the Romantic recognition that all learning,
                  whether it happens in a “vale of Soul-making” or through “spontaneous wisdom breathed
                  by health,” invites us to be in the world differently. It is an urgent invitation.
                  We are currently facing a transformation of the humanities—and academia—as we’ve known
                  them. The university looks very different than it did thirty years ago. The COVID-19
                  pandemic will alter it even further in ways that are difficult to predict. So too,
                  the ways we teach and conduct research have changed, and will continue changing. In
                  Twitter threads and articles in major news outlets, scholars are protesting the commodification
                  of higher education, and mourning the generation of young academics who have not been
                  able to secure tenure-track employment. There is now a much broader recognition that
                  scholarship is not the sole province of university professors, and that public humanities
                  work is just as vital as traditional research. The values of the humanities should
                  remind us that publications are not more important than people—both within and beyond
                  the academy. Thinking about the connections between Romanticism, pedagogy, and wellbeing
                  can center the care that we must take of ourselves, our colleagues, and our students.
                  It can also be a way to understand and assert our value as humanists. And perhaps
                  at this time of upheaval, revisiting Romantic approaches to wellbeing can allow us
                  to reimagine what kinds of spaces we can create in our classrooms and universities,
                  in whatever follows this time of uncertainty.</p>

               many disability studies scholars have adopted the term in recognition of, in Sami
               Schalk’s words, the inextricable “enmeshment” of body and mind (Bodyminds Reimagined:
               (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women’s Speculative Fiction. Durham: Duke
               U P, 2018, p 5.). As a concept, bodymind resists ableist presumptions that conceive
               of the mind and the body as separate entities, the latter of which (the body) is and
               should be under the control of the former (the mind). See Margaret Price, “The Bodymind

         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">The oppressive nature of wellness expectations came out vividly in the debate around
               the 2019 Peloton commercial in which an already slender woman, after being gifted
               a $2500 stationary bike by her partner, used her phone to document a year of her daily
               exercise routine, which she edited into a video to share with her partner. Critics
               castigated the commercial’s dangerously sexist assumption that women should undertake
               grueling—and possibly unchosen—exercise regimens in order uphold an ideal of femininity.
               To our minds, the commercial’s celebration of documenting exercise illustrates how
               some strains of wellness culture privilege the performance of specific visions of
               “health,” even possibly over health itself. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               for constituting a person in terms of his life history and experiences. It could describe
               a person’s own natural state and (sometimes) restore him to it if he fell sick. Nineteenth-century
               medical men were developing a language (which we still use) for situating all people
               in relation to each other, for measuring their deviation from the normal, and, increasingly,
               for managing their deviations from that norm.” Christopher Lawrence, <span style="font-style:italic">Medicine in the Making of Modern Britain, 1700-1900</span> (New York: Routledge, 1994), 45.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               (Letter #591 to Sarah Coleridge, April 1, 1804). See also Letter #600 to Sara Coleridge,
               June 5, 1804 in the same volume, p. 1140. A valuable study might be written on Coleridge’s
               various definitions of wellbeing. In response to his chronic illnesses he is at different
               times vulnerable and stoic: “The effect of years cannot be done away with in a few
               weeks—I am tranquil &amp; resigned—and even if I should not bring back Health, I shall
               at least bring back experience, &amp; suffer with patience &amp; in silence,” he writes to
               Sara (Letters, 2: p. 1140). Years later, in a May 25, 1820 letter to J. H. Green,
               he would postulate that his body had been so greatly changed by illness that were
               any one organ to be magically repaired to its original healthy state, the rest of
               his “Organismus” would reject it, “as if, for instance, a <span style="font-style:italic">worn</span> lock with an equally worn key—might no longer fit the lock. The repaired organs might
