                History” (2001)</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italic">By reading cultural representations alongside the testimonies of
                    disabled people themselves, a more complex picture of disability in history
                    emerges, one which is sensitive to the dynamics of oppression, but which also
                    recognizes disabled people as historical actors in their own right.</hi>”</p>
            <p> — David M. Turner, <hi rend="italic">Disability in Eighteenth-Century England:
                    Imagining Physical Impairment </hi>(2012)</p>
            
            <p>During my final year of graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, I
                received a joint research and teaching fellowship, which enabled me to complete my
                dissertation and teach two courses of my own design. In the process of designing one
                of these courses, I began with a question that I was already trying to address
                throughout my scholarship and more recently in my preparation for the academic job
                market: <hi rend="italic">what is the value of centering disability in literary
                    studies? </hi>My attempts at thinking through different answers to this question
                culminated in my lower-division undergraduate seminar offered in the fall semester
                of 2017. As a fellow at The College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS), I was
                tasked with creating a course catered to English majors and minors, as well as LPS
                students, many of whom are non-traditional students pursuing continuing education
                alongside other employment. This unique rostering and enrollment cap on the number
                of English students ensured that the class would not be composed of solely majors in
                the field but would also include STEM students and working professionals in nursing,
                medicine, and law. At first, I had conceived of “Disability Narratives” as a broad
                survey of disability writing, but I realized after seeing the mix of students
                enrolled that I needed to reframe this course in a way that also made accessible to
                non-majors the key skills in literary studies, like close reading, that help us
                better understand <hi rend="italic">why</hi> disability matters in the first place.
                I needed to make a compelling, semester-long case for the vibrancy of disabled life
                against reductive views of disability as an unbearable state of being defined only
                by suffering and stigma. Such vibrancy, I wanted to insist to my students, pervades
                much of literary history in ways we are just now beginning to take seriously.</p>
                
            <p>Part of doing justice to this project of scholarly inquiry was also putting into
                practice an activist slogan from the Disability Rights movement: <hi rend="italic"

                we should not only be foregrounding the narratives of disability produced by
                disabled people themselves, but we should be wary of confining disability to its
                representations alone. While close readings of literary characters can reveal how
                ableist structures operate and disability theory may provide useful frameworks by
                which we might analyze our objects of study, what frequently gets sidelined in
                classrooms are the everyday lives of disabled people and the ways disabled people
                have learned to live within and in spite of ableism. Instead, narratives about the
                disabled by ablebodied writers often come to stand in or speak for the disabled
                experience. Community organizers like Alice Wong and Vilissa Thompson have taught me
                that to truly understand disability requires us to attend to more than the many
                spectacular narratives of misery or overcoming that so often dominate our critical
                    attention.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Alice’s <hi rend="italic"

                <hi rend="italic">Which stories of disability are we not paying attention to?
                </hi>We have a responsibility to the quotidian, the everyday of disability, not just
                the “extreme or exotic bodies,” which David Turner sees as “deflect[ing] attention
                from the experiences or representations of thousands of people whose impairments
                were less visually apparent or unusual” (3). Only attending to sensational or
                “interesting” cases contributes to an erasure of the extensive archive of disabled
                experience that remains understudied and undervalued. As my LPS students would come
                to discover, disabled people have long theorized ways of living that enabled them to
                thrive—a disabled wellbeing. To trace the multiple forms that disabled being takes
                requires us to suspend our ongoing assumptions about disability and to see
                disability on its own terms, even if those terms challenge what we think we know
                about disability as a shifting category of human experience.</p>
                
            <p>As a scholar used to working in older historical periods, I first imagined the class
                chronologically. While this ordering of texts was certainly more straightforward,
                this structure inadvertently reproduced a progress narrative of disability from
                pathology and oppression to empowerment and activism. Given my own training in
                Romantic literature and culture and the history of medicine, this trajectory felt
                too reductive and teleological, especially as this period witnessed profound
                transitions in how disability was understood in relation to shifting definitions of
                the body and the human. To address these larger concerns I had, I applied a
                technique from my early days in graduate school to help me rework my syllabus. Dr.
                Suvir Kaul, my advisor and chair for my first-year exam, suggested that I prepare
                for my exam by thinking thematically rather than chronologically about the texts in
                my lists. I hoped that by playing with unexpected configurations of key texts, my
                students could offer equally unexpected answers to classroom questions—just as I had
                attempted to do in my exam. How, for instance, might more contemporary activism and
                scholarship on neurodivergence shape the ways we read works like William
                Wordsworth’s “The Idiot Boy” or John Clare’s “I Am” poems? This thematic course
                structure also better reflected the field of Disability Studies and its recent
                shifts toward more intersectional scholarship and disability in pre-modern and early
                modern contexts. Since my class met only once a week, each three-hour meeting gave
                us ample time to explore how disability and disability theory links up with other
                marginalized identities like queerness or blackness. Each of the course’s text
                clusters ultimately included combinations of fiction, poetry, and plays from
                different historical periods with disability life-writing and theory that together
                flesh out the multiple dimensions of disabled experience and speculate on what more
                inclusive futures and worlds might look like. </p>
                
            <p>One of my other primary goals for the course was to have students learn how to think
                and write from their respective bodyminds, for the personal is the place from which
                transformative, invested scholarship comes.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Margaret Price’s critical term “bodymind” underscores the inextricable
                    relationship between mind and body. In refusing Cartesian dualism, Price
                    understands disability as an interaction between mind and body that cannot be so
                    easily separated out. See also Sami Schalk’s <hi rend="italic">Bodyminds

                    term in relation to disability in black women’s speculative fiction.</note> My
                work has been greatly influenced by feminist standpoint theory and more recently
                what Rosemarie Garland Thomson has called <hi rend="italic">sitpoint theory</hi>:
                the acts of writing and thinking and the forms of knowledge we produce are
                inextricable from our complexly embodied situations. Disability scholarship has
                taught me the great value of refusing the persona of the detached and disembodied
                critic, which unrealistically disavows the bodymind behind it. This resonates with
                ongoing shifts in the study of Romanticism, which seek to recognize how disability
                was formative for Romantic writers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge or Mary Robinson
                such that their work cannot be understood without attending to their disabled lived
                experience. In what follows, I reflect on the trajectory of my Disability Narratives
                course that moves from introducing students to broader frameworks in disability
                theory to examining more specific, historicized instances of disability like Frances
                Burney’s mastectomy letter and George Byron’s <hi rend="italic">The Deformed
                    Transformed</hi>, two works not typically assigned in Disability Studies
                courses. I realized in the process of teaching this course how Romantic
                representations of disability by disabled writers complicated the dominant
                narratives in Disability Studies by exploring a much more robust spectrum of
                disabled experiences not reducible to pathology and normality. As a classroom
                community, we learned to how to read in a way that recognizes the centrality of
                disability to these writers’ literary and artistic productions to the extent that
                such attention reconfigured what we thought we knew about Romanticism and earlier
                periods preceding disability’s formation as a politicized identity. </p>
                
            <p>My pedagogical method remains indebted to this explicit recognition of the bodymind
                actually doing the labor of thinking and writing, the bodymind that I and my
                students have unfortunately been long trained to neglect. From a disabled sitpoint,
                “wellbeing” does not signify individual healthiness or an ableist expectation to
                work or think. A sitpoint approach to the classroom instead affirms the full range
                of different bodyminds, each living with different capacities and limits, toward a
                sense of collective wellbeing: my role as an educator is to encourage each member of
                our community of inquiry to contribute and participate in the ways most accessible
                to them while also acknowledging the access needs of their classmates. In
                “Disability Narratives,” I wanted my students to understand wellbeing as a community
                effort that is ongoing as our needs and goals changed over the semester: I stressed
                from the first day that we had a collective responsibility to maintain a supportive
                environment that would allow each student to inhabit as fully as possible their own
                bodyminds... From freewriting sessions to group reflections to peer review, I tried
                to create the conditions in which vulnerability could be coinhabited among the
                students and shaped into thoughtful and exciting arguments about the literature and
                art they encountered, often for the first time. To that end, I avoided the role as
                the figure of authority in the room but instead participated as a member of the community that
                learned from them as much as they learned from me. Such interdependence
                characterizes what Liat Ben-Moshe finds most powerful about a Disability Studies
                classroom: “that kind of space, of prefiguration, of taking into account both
                difficult and uncommon content and unfamiliar forms by which to convey it” (par. 4).
                This was not simply a class “about disabled topics” but about building an accessible
                community of inquiry invested in working through difficult, uncommon, and unfamiliar
                material across embodyminded and disciplinary difference. </p>
               
            <p>Over the course of fifteen weeks, my students and I explored how different
                representational forms perpetuate, reject, or even transform stereotypes of the
                disabled. Were there other ways of imagining disabled life beyond the abnormal or
                the deficient? To develop a conceptual vocabulary for us to theorize potential
                answers, we began with David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder’s “narrative prosthesis,” a
                critical term they use to describe a work’s dependency on disability as a device of
                characterization or plot that produces certain narratives of progress or cure.<note
                   place="foot" resp="author"> See David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Narrative Prosthesis: Disability and the Dependencies of
                        Discourse </hi>(Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 200). </note> I had my
                students mark not only when disability appears in texts but also when disabled
                characters become relegated to minor, flat, and non-agential roles like the comic
                relief of an otherwise serious plot or the shady figure easily identifiable as
                villainous because of their disabilities. We compiled lists and sketched out
                mindmaps of the tropes repeatedly invoked from compensatory ability (i.e. Tiresias’
                prophetic sight replacing his blindness in Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>) to infantilization (i.e. the disabled
                bought out of slavery by the women in Sarah Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Millennium
                    Hall</hi>). Disability in such works is repeatedly invoked for its symbolic or
                transgressive implications but ultimately contained or eliminated for the sake of
                narrative resolution, be it in the form of marriage or recovery. But the (mis)use of
                disability as a narrative prop towards ableist ends is hardly new. As Mitchell and
                Snyder argue, “narrative prosthesis” is deployed repeatedly throughout literary
                history to the extent that we have become accustomed to assuming disability must
                function in such objectifying and limiting ways. The Western literary tradition
                since Homer’s <hi rend="italic">Iliad </hi>and Sophocles’ <hi rend="italic">Oedipus
                    Rex </hi>has “persistently, even obsessively, deployed disability” precisely for
                its ideological implications (Couser 603). The ubiquity of disability throughout
                literary history has paradoxically contributed to its invisibility, its being
                everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. A key strategy for structuring my course
                around clusters of texts was to make this ubiquity apparent even with texts that are
                not ostensibly about disability and to provide analytical tools for thinking about
                representations of disability that were always already there within and without the
                Western canon. </p>
                
            <p>For many of my students, learning to read characters <hi rend="italic">explicitly in
                    terms of disability </hi>was novel, and to some, deeply unsettling, for the way
                that it undermined how familiar texts have traditionally been received.
                Destabilizing and revising conventional readings—to <hi rend="italic">crip </hi>them
                through a series of un-readings of texts we thought we knew—became a useful
                methodology that prompted students to question the ideological work of a text’s
                invocations of disability. The term “crip” first emerged out of disability activism,
                which reclaimed slurs like “cripple” as a form of politicized community
                identification but has now become a methodology in Disability Studies as an academic
                    field.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                    University Press, 2006).</note> A crip approach also meant considering the
                ableism of scholarly responses to a text—this was one of the central interventions
                in the recent edited collection of essays on disability and Romantic literature, <hi
                    rend="italic">Disabling Romanticism</hi> (2013). Just as some authors deployed
                ableist metaphors of “crippled economies” or characters’ “blind spots,” some critics
                recycled such metaphors by reading texts only in terms of an author’s disability or
                even entirely ignoring disability all together as an unnecessary or unsavory detail
                that devalues the work’s literary merit. Attention to these biases in scholarship
                also helped my students become more comfortable challenging what felt like the
                unassailable authority of published literary critics while encouraging students to
                be self-conscious about their own potentially ableist readings. </p>
                
            <p>To practice this kind of approach, I dedicated each class meeting to slow close
                readings of passages mostly chosen ahead of time by my students. These readings
                would then form the bases of responses to larger thematic questions I posed on the
                board at the start of each class. These questions were collated from student
                discussion posts and elaborated upon in ways that would help connect themes across
                different weeks in the course or to earlier questions posed in previous classes. To
                check in on their progress after the first month, I assigned for the first extended
                writing assignment a critical interpretation of Raymond Carver’s short story,
                “Cathedral” (1983). The story describes an unnamed narrator’s encounter with his
                wife’s friend, Robert, repeatedly referred to by the narrator as “the blind man.”
                The narrator notes how Robert does not seem to look or act like a typical blind man.
                After the narrator’s wife falls asleep, the narrator and Robert are left to watch
                television. When a cathedral appears on screen in a documentary, the narrator
                struggles to describe it for Robert, who then offers that they draw the image
                together on paper. For the narrator, this intimate experience is epiphanic, and he
                subsequently abandons his hostility toward Robert and his blindness. Many of my
                students remarked on how Carver uses the encounter with Robert simply to catalyze
                the narrator’s spiritual transformation by the story’s end. As a form of narrative
                prosthesis, Robert is flattened to his disability as “the blind man” who is
                compensated with insight and self-consciousness only useful for reforming the
                unnamed narrator’s prejudices. Many of my students at first interpreted the text as
                humanizing Robert by giving him subjectivity, but in fact, the text is revealed to
                be less and less about Robert’s lived experience or interiority as a disabled man
                but about his capacity to bring about the ablebodyminded narrator’s moral
                improvement. While the Robert’s characterization is not directly disparaging, his
                function as the short story’s narrative prosthesis precludes any possibility of his
                identification as anything other than the “blind man” whose commanding presence
                unsettles the narrator. </p>
                
            <p>Such unsettling and its implications became part of an ongoing set of questions in
                the class how different affects became attached to disability. The second short
                paper in the course asked my students to consider the affective strategies of a set
                of short films, some of which were entries for the Easterseals Disability Film
                Challenge. By this point in the class, my students had come to expect narratives of
                disability “inspiration porn.”<note place="foot"> For

                From the competitive athlete in the wheelchair to the disabled child who grows up to be
                successful and independent, “inspiration porn” perpetuates a series of sentimental
                fantasies of overcoming disability. “Inspiration porn” frames disability as an
                undesirable state that the disabled should aspire to exceed rather than embrace.
                Disability “inspiration porn” remains popular in everything from commercials to
                romantic comedies, but as my students observed, it is part of a well-established
                tradition dating back to sentimental fiction and Romantic melodrama like Percy

                representations of Tiny Tim as a pitiable young disabled boy whose poverty and
                suffering help to catalyze Scrooge’s moral reformation. Cripping literature like <hi
                    rend="italic">A Christmas Carol</hi>—a work of children’s literature not
                explicitly about disabled experience—reveals the manipulative qualities of
                “inspiration porn” that depend on the work’s ability to pull on heartstrings in
                response to disability as a tragic state of being. Dickens’s novella exemplifies
                precisely how affect is integral to its appeal to readers old and young such that it
                has become a Christmas classic frequently a part of family holiday traditions. After
                all, Victorian social reformers similarly depended on such sob stories to make the
                disabled more sympathetic and worthier of charity. To quote one of my students, “the
                history of disability is also a history of feelings.” And it was those feelings that
                I wanted students not to disavow but to use as the affective foundations for their
                own crip readings of texts. </p>
              
            <p> In the month before classes began, I realized in previewing the enrollment numbers
                    that <hi rend="italic">Disability Narratives </hi>would include not just English
                majors but also a significant number of STEM and pre-professional students. Fully
                aware that these students have more frequently encountered a medicalized approach to
                disability, I started to re-envision the course in terms of what Roy Porter has
                called “doing medical history from below,” a way of doing medical history as social
                history that centers the lived experience of sick and disabled people so often
                excluded from histories preoccupied with medical advancement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    See Porter’s “The Patient’s View: Doing Medical History from
                        Below.”<hi rend="italic">Theory and Society </hi>14.2 (1985): 175-198.
                </note> I reworked the class narrative to better unpack how disability comes into
                being not only through scientific and medical understandings but also through
                cultural production like fiction and poetry by and about disabled people. If I
                wanted my students to understand that disability has an extended cultural history, I
                needed to create opportunities where they might witness the manifold ways disability
                has been metaphorized within medicine and science and more importantly how disabled
                people continue to define themselves by and against those concept metaphors. As
                opposed to understanding narratives as mere reflections of a static disability
                reality defined only by natural philosophers, scientists, and physicians, I
                challenged my students to think more capaciously about narrative beyond the mimetic:
                    <hi rend="italic">how do these narratives imagine and reimagine disability and
                    the worlds in which disabled people live</hi>? </p>
                
            <p>In efforts to crip the triumphalist accounts of medical progress many of the
                pre-medicine and nursing students received in their lecture courses, I also began
                the course thinking with them about medicine’s role in producing and maintaining
                what Tobin Siebers has termed “the ideology of ability,” or the pervasive cultural
                “preference for able-bodiedness” that came to “defin[e] the baseline by which
                humanness is determined, setting the measure of body and mind that gives or denies
                human status to individual persons” (8-9). This ideology underpins the medical model
                of disability, which locates disability in individual bodies and seeks to return
                those bodies to health by correcting or eliminating that disability. The
                consequences of such ideology became disturbingly clear in our case studies of
                euthanasia programs like Nazi Germany’s <hi rend="italic">Aktion T4, </hi>which
                killed over 300,000 disabled people on the grounds that it purified the population
                and eliminated burdens on the nation. Such cases underscored how medicine was often
                complicit with legal and social systems of oppression through its authority over
                definitions of healthiness and ability. Often definitions at the level of the
                individual and the population depended on the direct marginalization or exclusion of
                the disabled. Archival accounts of institutionalization and violent medical
                intervention, like the case of Carrie Buck, who was forcibly sterilized in Virginia
                in 1927 for her “feeble-mindedness,” helped to make real the ugly consequences of
                Western medical ableism that were in fact recent history. We read trans and disabled
                writer Eli Clare’s own reflections on the traumatic but moving encounter with Carrie
                Buck in the archive and the ongoing struggle for disabled people to recover their
                lost histories while finding themselves within them.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                archive reach further back in literary history in seemingly unexpected places.</p>
                
            <p>A cursory look at historical representations of disability easily creates the
                illusion that disability always was what Mitchell and Snyder have called “the master
                trope of human disqualification” (125). Exemplified by figures like Shakespeare’s
                Richard III<hi rend="italic"> </hi>or Homer’s Thersites<hi rend="italic">,
                </hi>disability had long been understood as teratological monstrosity or divine
                error. In terms of character, their deformity and ugliness externally signaled moral
                deficiency and corrupt character. Yet, a turn to Romantic-era literature reveals
                that the “master trope” was not nearly as totalizing as both disability thinkers and
                literary scholars have suggested. In fact, the cultural equivalence between
                deformity and immorality would be repeatedly questioned by eighteenth-century and
                early nineteenth-century writers from William Hay to George Byron. Closer attention
                to the periods prior to the rise of eugenics and medical pathology reveals
                understudied instances of disability resistance, flourishing, and agency that often
                escape and even challenge the familiar narrative of the “master trope of human
                disqualification” presumed to be definitive of disabled experience
                transhistorically. </p>
                
            <p>In moving away from “militating against a monolithically ableist past” in favor of
                “recovering the social and historical particulars that add up to our ableist
                present,” scholars of Romantic-era disability like Fuson Wang, Emily B. Stanback,
                and Essaka Joshua have revealed how the Romantic period offers surprisingly positive
                representations and conceptions of bodily difference during a “transitional moment
                between Enlightenment yearning for universal humanism and the Victorian codification
                of social mores” (Wang 2). Attention to this period “in between” complicates (or
                crips) what has too often been understood as a straightforward trajectory from
                religious, juridical, and moral understandings of disability to biomedical pathology
                and statistical norms by the nineteenth century. Most recently, the contributors of
                    <hi rend="italic">Disabling Romanticism </hi>have made a powerful case for how
                many Romantic authors wrote consciously about and from the position of their own
                disabilities to explore seemingly disembodied abstractions like sublimity and
                transcendence. In attending to the ways in which disability shapes the creative
                conditions and forms of writing, this newer generation of interdisciplinary scholars
                has begun to resituate Romantic writers within the context of disability history and
                resist the presentism of Disability Studies as a field. This has importantly
                expanded the canon of disability texts beyond more contemporary works and pushed the
                field to think more capaciously about forms of disability in history before the
                constitution of ablebodymindedness as a medical and cultural norm.</p>
                
            <p>Given that most of the dramatic works I had included in “Disability Narratives” were
                contemporary, I took a risk assigning a text I had not previously taught in a
                disability context: Byron’s dramatic fragment, <hi rend="italic">The Deformed
                    Transformed</hi> (1822). I wanted to experiment with reading the fragment not in
                terms of Byron’s oeuvre and reductive notions of “Romantic genius” but rather as a
                transitional text marking the ways in which disability’s meanings were being
                renegotiated before the rise of hospital medicine and the specialized sciences<hi
                    rend="italic">. </hi>The text begins with the hunchbacked protagonist, Arnold,
                who is traumatically rejected by his mother during childhood. Tempted by the
                prospect of a more beautiful and capable body, Arnold makes a Faustian pact with an
                unnamed Stranger who offers to give him the body of the heroic Achilles and assume
                Arnold’s body in his place. The conclusion Byron had planned in his final notes is
                that Arnold ultimately becomes jealous of his own body as he fails to court Olimpia,
                a young woman who falls in love with the Stranger for his insight and intelligence
                rather than with Arnold despite his newfound form. </p>
                
            <p>In what scholars have described as Byron’s semiautobiographical play about his club
                foot, <hi rend="italic">The Deformed Transformed </hi>has been read as an exposé of
                how “the meaning of disability is tethered to discriminatory cultural ideologies”
                that coerce the disabled to choose death rather than stigma in life
                    (Snyder 272).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See also Snyder’s essay
                    with David T. Mitchell, “Re-engaging the Body: Disability Studies and the
                    Resistance to Embodiment.” <hi rend="italic">Public Culture. </hi>13.3 (2001):
                    367—389.</note> Arnold’s very desire to liberate himself from his own body (at
                first through suicide, then later through an exchange of bodies) is futile because
                it merely reflects a tragic internalization of the cultural pressures to be and
                remain ablebodyminded. Despite the play’s tragic end in which Arnold loses Olimpia
                to the very man with whom he exchanged his own body and ultimately laments his
                decision to cast off his original body, my students kept returning to the articulate
                defense and celebration of disability that Arnold presents before the iconic
                body-swap scene: “Deformity is daring. / It is its essence to o’ertake mankind / By
                heart and soul, and make itself the equal” (I.i. 314-316). Part of the negotiation
                between Arnold and the Stranger is a debate over how deformity uniquely prepares
                humans and animals for survival even as it may hinder that survival in the first
                place. As my students concluded, the overemphasis upon Arnold’s internalized ableism
                and shame misses the opportunity to recognize an early form of what we might call in
                the disability community “disability pride” or a valuation of disability that sees
                it as a resource for survival.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                    Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s “The Case for Conserving Disability.”<hi

                    she argues for a revaluation of disability as an identity and embodiment worthy
                    of protection and conservation. As a way of countering eugenic practices
                    increasingly framed as benefits for society and health, Garland-Thomson makes
                    the case for the ethical, epistemic, and narrative value of disability as a
                    resource to be conserved.</note></p>
                
            <p>Alongside recovering historical examples of disabled life, the course focused on
                disability’s interrelationship with gender. I paired Frances Burney D’Arblay’s 1812
                letter to her sister with Audre Lorde’s <hi rend="italic">The Cancer Journals
                    </hi>(1980)<hi rend="italic">. </hi>Burney underwent a mastectomy of her right
                breast in 1811 after surgeons discovered what they believed to be a cancerous tumor.
                During her convalescence, she detailed the experience of surgery with only a “wine
                cordial” for anesthesia in a harrowing letter to Esther, her sister. Lorde’s
                journals similarly capture the traumatic experience of seeking medical treatment for
                her breast cancer and her struggle to make sense of that experience from her vantage
                point as a black lesbian feminist. Drawing on the pedagogical exercises familiar to
                students training to be clinicians, I had my students work in groups to approach
                Burney’s and Lorde’s texts as bioethics cases. These exercises train students to
                read and interpret a case report that details an ethical dilemma typically
                associated with a decision to provide or refuse treatment or access to care. One of
                my mentors, Dr. Lance Wahlert, frequently teaches his narrative medicine classes in
                the school of medicine by presenting literary sources as “case studies” that raise
                bioethical questions about issues like autonomy or consent. I asked my students to
                consider whether the therapeutic experiences for either Burney or Lorde shifted
                their understanding of what constitutes ethics in these contexts, especially given
                the difference in privilege between the two women. I was moved by my students’
                collective refusal to make the conversation purely about whether or not Burney or
                Lorde were treated ethically. Instead, they considered the consequences of such
                unethical care and the disturbing continuities of healthcare between this late
                eighteenth-century moment and the 1970s, where medical professionals actively denied
                and even erased the subjective experiences of already vulnerable patients like
                Burney and Lorde before, during, and after treatment. </p>
                
            <p> As one of my students smartly argued in his final project on Lorde’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journals, </hi>this pairing of texts reveals the cruelty of what
                Burney calls in her letter a “perfect recovery” even after medical trauma. This
                standard of “perfect recovery” is characterized by bodily wholeness and a
                preservation of physical beauty linked to a woman’s social status and
                marriageability. In reading Burney’s account, students saw the historical
                foundations for the gendered social pressures women like Lorde continue to face as
                in her direct condemnation of the expectation that sheget a prosthetic breast
                implant in order to pass as a woman in public life. As a guiding question, I asked
                my students how the demands of cure and recovery might work to further disable women
                    <hi rend="italic">socially </hi>rather than exclusively in terms of bodily
                health: <hi rend="italic">how do women who fail to recover or whose full “return” to
                    health is impossible become further stigmatized in ways that contribute to their
                    ongoing mistreatment as women or even exclusion from womanhood entirely?</hi>
                The class found especially useful Alison Kafer’s critique of the “curative
                imaginary,” which helped to make sense of what students felt was a counterintuitive
                argument against cure. If “inspiration porn” defined the ideal disabled person as
                one who overcomes their disability, narratives of cure enforce the idea that “the
                only appropriate disabled mind/body is one cured or moving toward cure” (27-28).
                Thus, to fail to be cured or to refuse cure risks further stigma and rejection that
                gets mediated across multiple axes of identity and marginality. Thinking across the
                significant historical and identity divides between Burney and Lorde also
                importantly helped students recognize unexpected opportunities for solidarity based
                on shared struggle with ableism and medical trauma. </p>
                
            <p>Challenging inherited assumptions about what disability is and why it matters is
                difficult work. I took many pedagogical risks in the design and execution of this
                course during a period of great professional uncertainty, but one of the hardest
                aspects to reckon with was teaching a disability-centered course without presuming
                that Disability Studies or even the category of disability had any value to my
                students. I had to learn different ways of making accessible the very foundations of
                Disability Studies to students whose training primed them to be skeptical or even
                hostile to these ways of thinking and being. As we often challenge our students to
                address the “stakes” question in their writing, part of the transformative act of
                teaching is realizing those stakes for ourselves and conveying them to our students
                who may or may not accept them. Teaching disability has trained me to welcome and
                even invite student resistance as a means of opening up conversation rather than
                closing it down, generous invitations to work through impasses and disagreement
                instead of dismissive accusations of ableism. Choosing to join our students in their
                encounters with history, literature, and theory requires a scholarly humility open
                to the unpredictable, the unplanned. After all, disability reminds us that life is
                about <hi rend="italic">contingency</hi>.</p>
                
            <p>During a particularly heated discussion toward the end of “Disability Narratives,” a
                biomedical sciences student expressed frustration with what felt to her like an
                indictment of the medical establishment and a needless “blame game against people
                just trying to help.” Another added that it seemed contradictory and even
                hypocritical that disabled people are advocating for healthcare access and seeking
                medical assistance while simultaneously celebrating disability pride and damning
                medical assistance that might better their lives. For the disabled students in the
                room, such remarks entirely miss what many disabled writers had been telling us all
                semester: that it is entirely possible to embrace disability as an identity while
                also desiring to have humane, patient-centered care that better enables disabled
                people to flourish rather than be fixed or eliminated by medicine. “If cure was all
                that mattered, I wouldn’t even be here,” one disabled student remarked at the very
                end of class. Sobering as this comment was, the biomedical student recognized the
                personal stakes the disabled students had in resisting a cure narrative that she was
                complicit in perpetuating uncritically even in her desire to help alleviate
                suffering. Such recognition, as my disabled students made clear, is only possible
                when we center disabled people and their ways of knowing.</p>
                
            <p>One of the great successes of this class was fostering a classroom space in which
                such heated discussions could happen safely and productively. Early in the semester,
                I asked my students what brought them to my class. A few chose to disclose their
                disabilities, while others described the experiences of disabled friends and family.
                I made very clear that disclosure was never an expectation nor a requirement for
                success in my course, outside of an invitation on the syllabus to speak with me
                should they want help accessing accommodations, but many of my disabled students
                insisted that this was one of the only classroom spaces where disclosure had felt
                allowed, even necessary. Their moving reflections on how disability has shaped their
                personal and academic lives inspired me to disclose for the first time in an
                academic setting my own experience living and teaching with scoliosis-related
                disability, brain fog, and chronic pain.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                I admitted that I often struggled to articulate myself clearly when speaking if my
                pain and fog were intense and that the very act of physically being in the room to
                teach inevitably exacerbated my pain. Rather than concealing these facts of my daily
                living that shape every facet of my academic life, I told them that, according to
                vicissitudes of my own bodymind, I would need to rely on them frequently throughout
                the semester just as much as they, as bodyminds with their own vicissitudes, would
                need to rely on me. I frequently hear from fellow educators that they often fear
                such admissions might lead to students questioning their ability to teach or risk
                potentially alienating their students. In my experience, this form of honesty has
                been empowering because students feel connected to their instructors in new ways
                that prompt them to bring their fullest selves to the classroom and to take risks
                with other members of a classroom community invested in collective
                wellbeing. Centering disability aspires toward an interdependent vulnerability that
                makes possible the act of communal knowledge-making, one that is compassionate and
                accessible to the bodyminds that share the classroom together.</p>
