            <p>A copy of a page from the journal Dorothy Wordsworth kept from February 12,
                1831-September 7, 1833 serves as the frontispiece to Susan Levin’s 1987 book
                   <hi rend="italic">Dorothy Wordsworth &amp;
                    Romanticism</hi>. In the reproduction, Dorothy’s script is illegible, but the
                page is an evocative aesthetic object: the text is cross-written, with a larger,
                vertical script covering over the smaller text that runs from left to right. The
                image implicitly demonstrates one of what Levin calls the “special problems for the
                editor” posed by Wordsworth’s writing: her non-linear, recursive style (175). These
                late journals resist the form of the printed book and the values that shape the
                academy, both through their idiosyncratic structure and through their content.
                Wordsworth during this period was experiencing a range of physical and cognitive
                impairments, possibly deriving from complications from an inflamed gall bladder and
                a progressive mental disability that some have likened to or identified as
                Alzheimer’s or pre-senile dementia.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Medical
                    doctor Iris Gibson wrote an appendix for Robert Gittings and Jo Manton’s
                    biography (1985). He offers a retrospective diagnosis that identifies Dorothy’s
                    mental illness as “pre-senile dementia” (282).</note> Levin connects
                Wordsworth’s difficult manuscripts directly to her cognitive decline, noting that
                her late journals and poetry “[provide] a fascinating record of her mind’s
                wanderings/deterioration/development” (175). These unpublished journal entries
                demonstrate that the state of Wordsworth’s mind and body—or, perhaps more precisely,
                critics’ understanding of the state of her mind and body—shapes our understanding of her work. These interrelations
                between Wordsworth’s body and corpus make these “special problems” for the editor
                into unique opportunities for students in courses dedicated to studying disability
                and Romanticism. </p>
                
            <p>In this essay I describe an extended unit and major assignment centered on Dorothy
                Wordsworth’s published and unpublished journals in an upper-level English course I
                have designed, titled “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies.” The course will
                demonstrate, among other things, how disability studies-based interventions reveal
                the ways in which notions of normal and able bodies shape not only our ideas about
                health and wellness but also the Romantic canon and, in turn, how the traditional
                Romantic canon contributes to normative ideas about health and wellness. In this, I
                am influenced by Allison Kafer’s concept of the “curative imaginary” (27). Kafer
                distinguishes the “curative imaginary,” as an idea, from medical cure as a practice
                by highlighting the social forces that compel people with noncompliant bodies and
                minds towards rehabilitation. The curative imaginary derives from “an understanding
                of disability that not only expects and assumes intervention but also cannot imagine
                or comprehend anything other than intervention” (27). “Romanticism and Feminist
                Disability Studies” asks students to consider how these notions of health rooted in
                normalcy have shaped and continue to shape both the literary canon and access to
                that canon. Students will imagine Dorothy Wordsworth as part of a larger, more
                disabled Romanticism and will develop strategies for making her work more accessible
                to disabled readers and scholars today. In this way, “Romanticism and Feminist
                Disability Studies” brings together two important strands of my teaching that are
                both informed by disability studies. First, it asks students to consider how
                thinking through disability changes our understanding of literature and the cultures
                that read it; and second, it asks students to engage in rhetorical strategies to
                make their work—in the classroom and in writing assignments—more accessible to an
                audience that can include disabled people. </p>
                
            <p>“Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” is in many ways the product of several
                years of teaching courses about disability, Romanticism, and their intersections at
                Emory University and later at Spelman College and The Georgia Institute of
                Technology, where I am currently a Brittain fellow and instructor in English. As a
                graduate student at Emory, I taught composition and literature courses aimed at
                attracting the school’s many undergraduates with plans to go on to medical school,
                nursing, or public health. In those courses, I found that teaching disability
                studies and Romanticism together proved valuable in a number of ways. The
                theoretical approach allows students not typically interested in English literature
                or close reading to find the stakes in the subject matter. My background in
                disability studies always informs my teaching, and I find that bringing disability
                into the conversation enhances it at all levels. My students at Emory who read
                William Hay’s 1754 essay <hi rend="italic">Deformity: An Essay </hi>in part or in
                whole used Hay’s insights to better make sense of more canonical readings from
                Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. That same spirit informed our conversations about
                the Wordsworths, Coleridge, and Mary Shelley. At the same time, I rarely teach
                disability without Romanticism. My first-year writing course at Emory, “Disability and the Gothic,” used Mary Shelley’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> and some of its cinematic and digital
                adaptations and intertexts to trace a shifting, complicated history of the
                relationships between literary and medical notions of disability from the early
                nineteenth century to today. Similarly, I taught a second-year English course at
                Emory titled “Fictions of Addiction” that traced continuities and shifts in
                attitudes about drug users from the eighteenth century to the present. Students
                considered, among other things, how Lady Delacour, the dissipated opium-user whose
                rehabilitation shapes much of the first two volumes of Maria Edgeworth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Belinda </hi>(1801), and Billie Holliday, who describes
                discriminatory police practices that kept her from getting medical treatment for
                addiction in her memoir <hi rend="italic">Lady Sings the Blues </hi>(1956), were
                subjected to medical authority ultimately undergirded less by medical knowledge than
                by gender and racial scripts. </p>
                
            <p> Another course that I taught at Emory, “Disability and the Gothic,” also highlighted
                continuities between standard practices for successful writers—awareness of audience
                or rhetorical situation, strategic use of multimodality—and strategies for making
                communication accessible. I built on those experiences in an ENGL 1101 course I
                developed and currently teach at Georgia Institute of Technology, “Composing
                Access.” In that class, accessibility becomes both the subject and goal of the
                student’s reading and writing. Students produce digital maps of barriers to access
                on their campus, audio description guides to on-campus art instillations for blind
                and low-vision users, and podcasts that assess the accessibility of educational
                practices and research opportunities at the school. These writing assignments draw
                explicitly and implicitly on Jay Dolmage’s call for principles of universal design
                to reshape our pedagogy and Georgina Kleege and Scott Wallin’s claim that multimodal
                accessibility documents like audio description can be used to produce interesting
                and valuable writing assignments. At the same time, these assignments force students
                to consider audience and the ways in which multimodal communication can either
                create or address barriers to access, depending on how they are deployed. </p>
                
            <p>Drawing on those experiences has allowed me to envision a unit on Dorothy
                Wordsworth’s <hi rend="italic">Grasmere Journals </hi>and her poetry. The journals
                and poems are short enough that this project could be adapted with slight revisions
                for a range of period courses, including a Romanticism survey, but I will be
                describing here how it would operate in the upper-level English course I’ve named
                “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies.” The course is framed by two key
                critical insights: first, Anne Mellor’s observation that what Romantic scholars have
                long termed “Romanticism” is, in fact, a “masculine Romanticism” that is shadowed by
                an unrecognized “feminine Romanticism”; and second, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s call
                to “transform” feminist theory by “integrating disability” (333). Students in this
                course will use Romantic texts to test Garland-Thomson’s claim that “integrating
                disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens,
                expands, and challenges feminist theory” (335). In addition to addressing these
                important critical questions, approaching Romanticism from the intersection of
                gender and ability also addresses two key concerns raised by David Higgins and
                Sharon Ruston’s recent volume, <hi rend="italic">Teaching Romanticism</hi>:
                Romanticism’s increasingly marginal position in the academy and the difficulty of
                bringing new works and authors recovered by Romantic scholars into the classroom.
                Each unit in “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” pairs Romantic women
                authors with both contextual readings from their contemporaries and twentieth- and
                twenty-first century texts on related issues. Reading Mary Wollstonecraft alongside
                Carole Pateman’s work on what she calls “Wollstonecraft’s dilemma” in the modern
                social safety net, or the cancer plot in Edgeworth’s <hi rend="italic">Belinda
                </hi>alongside Susan Sontag’s <hi rend="italic">Illness as Metaphor</hi>,<hi
                    rend="italic"> </hi>encourages a fuller understanding of both historical
                moments. In so doing, it reveals the value of the study of Romanticism for students
                with a range of academic and professional goals and interests.</p>
                
            <p>Bringing disability studies into the Romanticism classroom also helps to close what
                Higgins and Ruston call the “gap between teaching and research” in the field (2).
                Disability studies has only recently begun to make its mark on the period, with the 
                first book-length project on Romanticism and disability, Michael Bradshaw’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Disabling Romanticism</hi>, appearing in 2016. Taking up these
                authors in both their own and our historical moments allows “Romanticism and
                Feminist Disability Studies” to engage in practices that Bradshaw and Essaka Joshua
                call for in their volume. Reading Romantic authors as part of a canon of disability
                literature works to disable Romantic texts, which Joshua and Bradshaw describe as,
                in part, an effort to both produce “new reading[s]” of texts and “un-reading[s]” of
                traditional accounts of the canon (1-2). By tracing the echoes and anticipations of
                contemporary conversations about health and disability in Romantic-era texts,
                “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” also counters the critical tendency
                towards “symbolic appropriation,” that is, the tendency of critics to read
                representations of disability as symbols meant to describe other, supposedly more
                foundational or elemental experiences. </p>
                
            <p>The course will come to Dorothy Wordsworth after units on Wollstonecraft, Edgeworth,
                and Romantic and twentieth-century notions of independence and health. Students will
                read Wordsworth’s <hi rend="italic">Grasmere Journals </hi>alongside relevant poems
                by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. For example, students of course
                will read William’s “Resolution and Independence” alongside Wordsworth’s journal
                entry on the leech gatherer. But in an in-class exercise I have used in the past, I
                will break students into small groups to discuss the poem in the context of
                different entries from the journal. Some will examine her account of the encounter
                with the leech gatherer. Other groups will look at later diary entries that account
                for the composition of the poem. On May 4, 1802, Wordsworth tucks an account of
                transcribing part of the poem into a longer description of William’s physical and
                mental dis-ease: "William had slept pretty well &amp; though he went to bed nervous &amp; jaded in the
                extreme he rose refreshed. I wrote the Leech Gatherer for him which he had begun the
                night before &amp; of which he wrote several stanzas in bed this Monday morning"
                (94). At the end of the entry, Wordsworth describes herself “repeat[ing] verses to William
                while he was in bed” until “he was soothed &amp; I left him” (96). A third group
                will take up an entry from three days later, wherein Wordsworth notes that William
                takes advantage of his improved state to finish the poem: "William had slept uncommonly well so, feeling himself strong, he fell to work at the
                Leech gatherer—he wrote hard at it till dinner time, then he gave over tired to
                death—he had finished the poem. I was making Derwents frocks" (97). In the past, students who have read the more well-known entry have discussed
                Wordsworth’s role in cataloging their walks and raised the question of the value of
                that work to William’s poetry. Groups reading the other entries considered a broader
                conception of Romantic collaboration that accounted for not only labor of composing
                and recording but also how that labor is at times complicated by and at others
                enabled by the day-to-day encroachment of bodily needs, illness, and mental
                distress. After I brought the class back together to share their journal entries and
                their insights, I asked them to speculate about which journal entry is most often
                published with William’s poem. When students had a guess—and most of them guessed
                correctly—we talked about how our understanding of authorship and literary labor is
                still shaped by particular notions of gender and bodily ability. In isolation, the
                exercise was useful for asking students to think about William’s poetry beyond the
                text as both the output of labor from a range of historical figures and as a
                document that we, as a class, do not receive in a vacuum. </p>
                
            <p>In “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies,” this conversation will connect to
                the larger questions of how notions of gender and bodily ability have shaped
                critical understandings of Romantic literature. Putting this conversation in the
                context of a sustained reading of the entire <hi rend="italic">Grasmere Journals
                </hi> also will provide students with an opportunity to further consider William’s
                poetry as, in part, an editorial project. In the traditional Romanticism classroom,
                the poem and Wordsworth’s account of the leech gatherer enjoy a mutually supporting
                relationship in that his poem justifies the presence of her journal entry on the
                syllabus. But absent William’s poem, the “old man almost double” described in
                Wordsworth’s journal bears no immediately apparent difference or distinction from
                the many other itinerate, often disabled figures that appear throughout her journals
                (23). In class, students are prompted to consider why this figure struck William, in
                particular. In discussion boards, I will ask students to produce poetic or prose
                works that build from any of the other arguably equally striking figures that
                populate Wordsworth’s journal. Such exercises raise another important question for
                this class: how does the tendency to anthologize Wordsworth’s journal entry and
                “Resolution and Independence” in tandem shape our understanding of both Wordsworth’s
                and her brother’s intellectual work?</p>
                
            <p>Students reading the full <hi rend="italic">Grasmere Journals</hi> can also consider
                the journals as an account of what critics have identified as a particularly
                feminine Romantic subjectivity and as a disabled Romantic subjectivity. After we
                read and discussed the journals together, I would assign different groups within the
                class different secondary essays about the journals. In class, we would
                pair/square/share to discuss how these critical accounts of Wordsworth’s journals
                reveal what Joshua and Bradshaw call the “symbolic appropriation” of disability to
                serve other critical purposes (1). Chief among those is what Mellor identifies as
                feminist readings of Wordsworth’s late-life cognitive disability as an “unconscious
                rebellion” against the domestic demands placed upon her (166). But even for Mellor,
                Wordsworth’s dementia becomes “a triumph of the relational self” in that it was
                supported by Mary Hutchinson Wordsworth’s thoughtful care in ways that reciprocated
                Wordsworth’s earlier commitment to caring for others (167). In “Romanticism and
                Feminist Disability Studies,” students will consider in individual writing and in
                group discussion whether these critics, in figuring gender as the primary source for
                Wordsworth’s fluid conception of identity and dementia as its symbolically resonant
                end point, implicitly ignore her experiences of
                disease and disability as disease and disability. </p>
                
            <p> But while some students will read and respond to critical works that understand
                Wordsworth’s late-life cognitive impairments as an expression of her more elemental
                experience of gender, others will be assigned secondary readings that interpret
                disability as lack or as an absence of the self.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Examples of this sort of reading include Robert Gittings and Jo Manton’s
                    biography, which describes Wordsworth’s late poem “Thoughts on my Sickbed” as
                    “the ghost voice of her true self, speaking from the ruins” (276). For Gittings
                    and Manton, the act of recognizing that true self becomes “almost unbearably
                    sad” (276). Their reaction to Wordsworth’s late-life mental health is emblematic
                    of scholars’ general tendency to enforce a boundary between Dorothy’s more
                    neurotypical mind from her mentally impaired mind. Gibson suggests that
                    Dorothy’s habitual repetition of lines of poetry are “islets” into her previous
                    mind (282). That binary distinction between the real Dorothy and the mentally
                    impaired Dorothy echoes a similar divide that appears in Carl H. Ketcham’s 1978
                    summary of Dorothy’s late journals. Citing a bit of verse that appears late in
                    her writing, Ketcham calls it the “appalling end of the more than thirty-five
                    years of close intellectual and imaginative companionship recorded in Dorothy’s
                    journals” (10). Pamela Woof’s more recent assessment of Wordsworth’s late-life
                    journal pays explicit attention to her writing on illness and death, but
                    nonetheless justifies her interest in that late writing in opposition to
                    disability when she asserts that “[t]he reader knows that even in these final
                    years there was more than imbecility to Dorothy Wordsworth” (175).</note> 
                These accounts of disability as lack do not map perfectly onto Wordsworth’s actual
                collected writings. While she does, at times, express frustration, hopelessness, and
                even something like depression in response to her physical and mental impairments,
                and some of her friends and family, in their own writing, connect those expressions
                with a fundamental change or loss of self, those moments are interspersed with other
                moments of enjoyment both in and out of her sickbed. This tension between
                Wordsworth’s own experience of impairment within her familial community and the
                critical accounting of it provides a coherent account of the ways that
                discriminatory and exclusionary narratives about disability, which were coming into
                being in the Romantic era, came to dominate the discourse in the succeeding decades. </p>
            <p>In untangling Wordsworth’s journals from this critical accounting of them, students
                see how these critical accounts can unwittingly reinforce notions of health and
                wellness that Wordsworth’s journals actually challenge and complicate. Through this
                work, students participate in Bradshaw and Joshua’s
                project of “disabling” Romantic texts, which requires, in their view, both “new
                reading[s]” of texts and “un-reading[s]” of traditional accounts of the canon (1-2).
                But the fact that much of Wordsworth’s late writing is available only as mediated
                through these secondary sources in academic journals or perhaps as pdfs available to
                those with institutional access to JStor speaks to two other issues of interest to
                scholars and students of Romanticism and disability: what is available to be read?
                And for whom is it available? These questions will allow the course’s major
                editorial assignment, with which the Wordsworth unit culminates, to arise naturally
                from our conversations about Wordsworth and her critics. </p>
                
            <p>The class readings of both Wordsworth and her critics ultimately inform a final
                project in which students will propose—and make a prototype for—an online,
                accessible collection of Wordsworth’s work. Such a project, thoughtfully considered
                and executed, can foreground the ways that Wordsworth challenges our notions of
                health and wellbeing. This work requires students to develop a strong understanding
                of not only Wordsworth’s writing and its history of reception and dissemination, but
                also of important practices in digital publishing and web accessibility. Through
                this project, students will engage with disability studies not only as a set of
                analytical tools but also as a set of ethical concerns and practices that bridges
                the gap between scholars and students and breaks down barriers that can keep
                disabled people from entering our conversations. This assignment draws on Stephen C.
                Behrendt’s useful template for doing recovery work with students. Behrendt provides
                “hands-on opportunities to do some of the things we do as scholars” through
                assignments in which students participate in the work of recovery and publication
                (123). His students transcribe microfiche or pdf copies of unpublished
                eighteenth-century work to prepare them for online publication. Although he does not
                frame them as such, these assignments are in effect access labor. Microfiche in
                academic libraries present physical barriers to able-bodied and disabled scholars
                alike. PDFs remove many of the physical barriers incurred through geographical
                distance and the built environment, but they remain difficult to access for blind
                and low-vision scholars. By transcribing them, Behrendt’s students potentially make
                these texts more accessible not only to the data mining programs of digital
                humanities scholars and readers geographically separated from the library’s physical
                collections, but also to readers, students, and scholars who rely on screen readers
                or other accessibility technology to interact with digital materials. Behrendt’s
                assignments, then, offer a useful template for assignments that explore the
                potential access gains born from online publishing.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    In this way, these assignments participate in a recent move in disability
                    studies pedagogy, in which access labor become formal classroom assignments.
                    Georgina Kleege and Scott Wallin describe a series of writing assignments that
                    ask students to participate in the production of audio description of images and
                    video for blind and low-vision users. Such assignments require students to
                    engage with debates about best practices and intent and then publish their
                    resulting work online. The assignments, then, ask students to not only engage
                    with but participate in the ongoing conversation around online access.</note></p>
                
            <p>In undertaking such a project, students must not only recognize but also interrogate
                the critical and scholarly practices that shape our field. To prepare for such a
                project, students will assess the usability and accessibility of existing online
                publications. The <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/">William Blake
                    Archive</ref> enables comparisons across multiple extant versions of Blake’s
                illuminated works. The <ref target="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">Shelley/Godwin
                    Archive</ref> offers a distinct approach that highlights different authors’
                additions and edits to manuscript materials. Dickinson College’s <ref
                    target="https://michaelfield.dickinson.edu/">online edition of Michael Field’s
                    poetry</ref> uses the web to address a different challenge: how to offer
                twenty-first-century readers the context they need to make sense of Field’s
                ekphrastic poetry while maintaining something like the simple, unadorned white pages
                on which Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper chose to publish their work as “Michael
                Field.” Each of these online publications—and there are of course numerous
                others—offers students examples of web design choices that variously increase and
                limit access to information. Students—very much a key target market for these
                repositories—should be empowered to draw on their reactions to these texts to build
                a set of guiding design principles to shape a strategy for effectively publishing
                some piece of Wordsworth’s writing online. </p>
                
            <p>After analyzing their own experience with these web-based publications, students will
                test them using WebAIM’s free <ref target="https://wave.webaim.org/">Web
                    Accessibility Evaluation Tool</ref>(WAVE), which tests any website for common
                accessibility failures. The program does not, of course, replace full usability
                testing with disabled users, but it does expose and display the many ways in which
                common web design decisions can create barriers to access (and proposes solutions to
                those problems). In the past, when my students have used WAVE to examine the
                accessibility of websites, they have found that much of what they consider to be
                generally bad web design is also inaccessible for disabled users.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    In addition to highlighting unconsidered issues with
                    accessibility, WAVE aids students in proofreading their web writing and design
                    by catching basic issues like mis-used headline formatting or missing
                    alternative text for images. Addressing these access issues also offers practice
                    in writing, more generally. Proper use of headlines in web texts is better for
                    both screen readers and visual design. In crafting effective alternative text
                    for their images, students must both interpret the image and reflect on its
                    purpose in their text.</note> But they also find unexpected (and
                counter-intuitive) barriers in seemingly benign design choices. For example, a
                student once discovered that the “Buy Now” button on a major retailer’s website was
                hidden for screen readers, essentially making it impossible for the website to sell
                products to blind or low-vision visitors. I also often require students in my
                composition courses to use WAVE to assess the web design and digital writing they
                have done in the class; in this context, accessibility testing becomes an
                opportunity to consider audience, revision, and strategies for multimodal
                (re)composition. In “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies,” it would serve a
                similar purpose, but instead of only revising their own work, students will revise
                the scholarly practices of a wider field and use their findings to produce plans for
                new modes of publishing primary documents that would enable scholars to understand
                more fully the intersections of disability and gender in the Romantic period.</p>
                
            <p>After comparing the strategies and outcomes at work in a range of online
                publications, students will work individually or collaboratively in small groups to
                produce a guiding ethic and rationale for e-publishing some of Wordsworth’s work in
                ways that increase accessibility for all readers. While students who code may use
                those skills on this project, groups without aspiring computer scientists can use
                tools like Wordpress or Omeka to create functional, accessible prototypes without
                digging into the code. This work would be informed by their research on previous
                approaches to publishing Wordsworth’s writing, from their initial appearance in
                biographies of William through the abridged versions of Wordsworth’s writing in the
                early twentieth century to Levin and Woof’s distinct approaches to scholarly
                editions in recent years. In order to engage critically with that history, students
                must connect their proposed editorial work to conversations about how gender and
                disability have shaped both the archive and its readers. Conversations about
                physical and institutional access allow students to derive an ethic of or rationale
                for new online editions of Wordsworth’s work. In addition to a traditional proposal,
                which includes both a rationale and an annotated bibliography of critical and
                editorial publications their project draws on and/or responds to, students produce a
                proof-of-concept page for a piece of Wordsworth’s writing—perhaps a set of poems and
                their various revisions or a series of journal entries. </p>
                
            <p>Such an assignment could serve as a step on the path towards something like what
                Behrendt describes, in which students produce materials ready for online publishing,
                while also showing how such projects increase the accessibility of those materials.
                The project will ask students to address the lack of unmediated access to texts
                important to the literary history of disability. In so doing, it will reinforce many
                of the key ideas and questions raised by taking up Wordsworth as a figure of
                interest to the field. Scholars in disability studies and Romantic studies have done
                much work to recover marginalized authors and to reconsider history and literary
                production accordingly, but much work remains to be done. Attuning students to the
                limits of Wordsworth’s current archive serves as useful spur for students who now
                more than ever can be empowered to participate in that recovery work.</p></div>
