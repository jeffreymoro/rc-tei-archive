               <h2><span class="head">&gt;Context, Demographics, and Structure</span></h2>
               <p>At Duquesne University, I regularly teach a 300-level writing-intensive “Healthcare
                  and Literature” class populated almost exclusively by sophomores and juniors enrolled
                  in a Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) program, which awards them a bachelor’s degree
                  after 4 years and a doctorate after 6. My primary goal is for these students to articulate
                  practical, professional takeaways from studying literary representations of illness
                  and medical intervention. Thus, I prioritize relevance, foregrounding it on the first
                  day of class and throughout the semester, frequently asking students, “What does this
                  mean for you as future physical therapists?” I let them know that I have worked to
                  align the class’s goals and their needs by considering their program’s outcomes. And
                  I require them to reflect on how experiences of illness and expectations for healthcare
                  professionals have changed over time. We extend our discussion into how wellbeing
                  coexists with illness on separate yet parallel tracks. We read a narrative of illness,
                  and we ask, “Despite how sick the patient was, what made that patient’s experience
                  terrible? What made that patient’s experience uplifting? How did the healthcare provider
                  affect that experience? How can the healthcare provider manage their own wellbeing
                  to subsequently increase patient wellbeing?” These things are interconnected. </p>
               <p>My “Healthcare and Literature” class is part of a trend in higher education: students
                  majoring in health sciences are increasingly offered liberal arts courses designed
                  to address humanistic issues that arise in their fields. Though at times the gap between
                  literary studies and my students’ study of physical therapy has yawned wide, outcomes
                  for the physical therapy program dovetail with literary and cultural studies’ investments
                  in social justice, intersectionality, and careful reading. Indeed, this overlap is
                  a hallmark of the medical humanities, which uses an interdisciplinary framework to
                  bridge that imagined gap between medicine and literature. When we take a medical humanities
                  approach, we draw from literature and art as well the social sciences to critically
                  examine representations of medical education and medical practices. The college’s
                  vision for the physical therapy program is outlined in their “Strategic Statements”
                  document, which harmonizes with studies in the medical humanities by asking students
                  to be “compassionate, culturally competent, and socially responsible reflective practitioners,”
                  and “critical thinkers, life-long learners, healthcare educators … critical consumers
                  of pertinent literature, and leaders in the profession” (“Strategic Statements”).
                  In addition, the program’s learning outcomes emphasize “practic[ing] … in a competent,
                  safe, ethical … reflective and professional manner,” “perform[ing] effective patient
                  examination [and] evaluation,” “provid[ing] healthcare education to patients, clients,
                  families, peers, and society, using culturally appropriate teaching methods,” and
                  “demonstrate[ing] social responsibility and altruism” (“Outcomes”). </p>
               <p>Clearly, the program stresses empathy and reflection. It also links textual literacy
                  to interpersonal literacy. Professional acumen flows from the ability to interpret
                  patients’ individual needs. Students are expected to understand that patients <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> practitioners are influenced by socio-cultural contexts and power-privilege dynamics;
                  there is additionally an investment in holistic patient-centered care. My pedagogy,
                  drawn from the medical humanities and narrative medicine, facilitates developing professional-personal
                  critical reflection, altruism, interpersonal communication skills, and an awareness
                  of the factors that affect hearing, telling, and developing care plans. Under the
                  umbrella of the medical humanities, narrative medicine draws attention to the narratives
                  that patients and practitioners construct. It also teaches students to interpret those
                  narratives by thinking about things like word choice, mind-body relations, point of
                  view, power, and context. I emphasize that skills in textual analysis are a personal-professional
                  asset that will help students to hear patients and, by meeting them where they are,
                  ensure that they are administering effective care.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In “Healthcare and Literature,” the classroom becomes a space of conceptualizing wellbeing.
                     Our medical humanities approach invites students to imagine themselves as future practitioners,
                     but more importantly, it requires students to consider the relevance of their emotions
                     in the present. We confront difficult scenarios together as a class. We discuss and
                     process those feelings to create emotional resilience, a <span style="font-style:italic">preparedness</span> that equips them to lean into hard emotions now, which may prevent burnout later.
                     The class—capped at 18—is discussion driven and thematically organized, and transhistorical.
                     Focusing on North American and Western European medicine and culture, students complete
                     reading, in-class writing, and process-writing with individual guidance.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Process writing involves assisting students with planning, drafting, and revising.
                              I dedicate class time to each stage of the process, including workshopping student
                              drafts. During workshop we discuss how the student might revise their paper to meet
                              the assignment’s guidelines. It also allows me to demonstrate to them what an “A”
                              thesis looks like, for example. </span></div>
                     </div> I explain to students that our discussions will facilitate their awareness of humanistic
                     issues in medical contexts past and present; improve literary analysis and close reading
                     skills across genres; enable them to articulate their professional goals and values;
                     and finally, set them up to write informal and formal essays.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although I teach texts from many historical periods, there is good reason in “Healthcare
                  and Literature” to discuss Romantic texts as a foundation and starting point because
                  the Romantic era is an especially rich moment in medical history. At the time, for
                  example, surgery suffered from low status as manual craft (i.e., the “sawbones”) compared
                  to the more “cerebral” work of physicians. Pairing Romantic texts with contemporary
                  ones also shows how medical attitudes change across time. Clusters of texts allow
                  us to study how anatomy has been taught and learned; shifting attitudes towards mental
                  illness and disability; different conceptualizations of pain and attitudes towards
                  pain management; and individual articulations of how treatment can traumatize patients.
                  In this vein, our texts include long and short fiction and medical texts, poetry and
                  visual art. We end the semester with contemporary nonfiction written by medical professionals
                  and a visit to the campus cadaver lab where students will perform a dissection during
                  their fourth year.</p>
               <p>Romantic texts that address medical topics are diverse, but I have found two texts
                  especially useful for helping my students develop compassion and cultural awareness:
                  Frances Burney’s journal letter, “Account from Paris of a Terrible Operation – 1812,”
                  and an anonymous 1831 short story “The Victim” from <span style="font-style:italic">The New Monthly Magazine, </span>in which a medical student finds his friend’s fiancée on his dissection table. These
                  works enable us to discuss aspects of healthcare that many students typically take
                  for granted: that surgeons embody the pinnacle of expertise and manual dexterity,
                  and that dissection and human anatomy are foundations for medical knowledge. As we
                  engage both of these texts, historical distance allows students to safely express
                  shock or anger and to openly criticize the practitioners as well as the “barbarism”
                  of medicine. Students begin to probe their assumptions about professionalism, patients’
                  rights, and even the construction of the body in medical study.</p>
               <p>As I will demonstrate, when taught using principles of narrative medicine, including
                  the concepts of logotherapy and pathography, Burney’s letter and “The Victim” provide
                  an opportunity to connect literary study to the physical therapy program’s goals.
                  The texts present relatable healthcare situations, such as receiving a cancer diagnosis
                  or studying for an anatomy exam, with a striking strangeness that engages students’
                  emotional and intellectual interest. Ultimately, the texts often lead students to
                  not only question the history of the medical professions, but also to assess their
                  own personal and professional values and learn how to use emotions to facilitate care.
                  As is characteristic of Romantic texts, Burney’s letter and “The Victim” stage and
                  elicit powerful sentiment. The sexualized cadaver in “The Victim” disgusts students
                  and opens a conversation about clinical distance as the story’s own medical students
                  fail to balance clinical distance with empathy. Burney’s letter invites students to
                  explain how they might communicate with their own patients differently from Burney’s
                  surgical team in order to better support patient quality of life.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Narrative Medicine, Logotherapy, and Pathography</span></h2>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Narrative medicine emphasizes the transportability of close reading skills and the
                     importance of language to the medical practitioner (Charon et al, “Close Reading”
                     np). Narrative medicine also considers forms and effects through two concepts, pathography
                     and logotherapy, which are a key focus of my “Healthcare and Literature” course.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Anne Hunsaker Hawkins coined the term “pathography” in Reconstructing Illness: Studies
                              in Pathography. Purdue UP, 1993.</span></div>
                     </div> Pathographies, or patient-produced narratives, provide audiences with the deeply subjective
                     “extra-clinical” details of illness that resonate poignantly and build empathetic
                     connections. As a philosophy, logotherapy affirms that narratives have the power to
                     validate experiences of illness and can promote recovery.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Narrative medicine uses literary texts to increase provider effectiveness by fostering
                  skills in listening, critical thinking, and interpretation. Together, these skills
                  are known as “narrative competence, that is, the competence that human beings use
                  to absorb, interpret, and respond to stories … it enables the physician to practice
                  medicine with empathy, reflection, professionalism, and trustworthiness” (Charon,
                  “Narrative Medicine” 1897). Working with diverse kinds of texts ultimately equips
                  the practitioner to avoid any one-size-fits-all assumptions, because “[e]valuating
                  patients requires the skills that are exercised by the careful reader” (Charon et
                  al ,“Literature and Medicine” 601). Much like literary scholars, the healthcare provider
                  listens, collates, and interprets metaphors, point of view, and repetition. Narrative
                  medicine fundamentally values patients’ stories, whether filled with overwhelming
                  detail or loaded with meaningful silences, and views each story as much more than
                  an index of symptoms. Narrative competence ensures that the practitioner meets the
                  patient where they are (Charon, “Narrative Medicine” 1898). Patients can feel compelled
                  to narrate their histories into coherence (Torney 37), and they know when they are
                  being heard. </p>
               <p>Broadly speaking, writing about traumatic illness or treatment can promote wellbeing.
                  Trauma-focused therapy frequently requires patients to write, read, and re-read narratives
                  of their trauma because repeated exposures decrease episodes of physiological distress
                  (Gurak et al). Pathographies prioritize the patient’s point of view within their socio-cultural
                  moment: “in the full, rich, nuanced particularity seldom if ever available elsewhere,
                  literary accounts of illness widen physician-readers’ knowledge of the concrete realities
                  of being sick and enable these readers to appreciate their own patients’ stories of
                  sickness” (Charon et al, “Literature and Medicine” 600). Pathographies tap into readers’
                  emotions. Healthcare providers who believe that clinical detachment keeps them unbiased
                  while emotions distract from caregiving can benefit from using pathography to discuss
                  how emotions can be appropriately leveraged into caregiving. </p>
               <p>Clinical detachment, though at times necessary, can become dangerous when practitioners
                  are burned out. Yet suffering and illness cannot be ignored, nor can narratives in
                  which medical professionals fail to practice effective care. Narrative medicine offers
                  safeguards against the exhaustion deadly to careful interactions, and against the
                  weariness born of bearing constant witness to suffering. The design of my “Healthcare
                  and Literature” course follows a logical chain. Students read pathographies to encounter
                  difficult patient experiences. Discussing these pathographies together as a class,
                  we share our own strong emotions. In sharing these emotions, the emotions are in turn
                  validated. Through such discussions, students can therefore begin to see emotions
                  as a meaningful guide to patient care and to self care. When students can trust their
                  emotions in this way, their wellbeing is preserved. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">Burney’s Mastectomy Letter</span></h2>
               <p>I use Burney’s letter early in the semester to foreground the value of transhistorical
                  analysis and reading medicine “across history.” Students usually expect that surgeons
                  will explain to patients what kind of operation they need and what will be done to
                  them. It is difficult for students to imagine surgeons lying – deliberately or through
                  omission – because they believe that patients are entitled to transparency. However,
                  by reading Burney’s letter they realize that their assumptions about surgical professionalism
                  are historically constructed. Ultimately, I want students to consider how and why
                  Burney’s surgeons fail to communicate honestly with her and what kinds of emotions
                  drive their interactions. Before reading Burney’s letter, I have students watch “Being
                  Mortal” (2015), an episode of <span style="font-style:italic">Frontline</span> in which Atul Gawande addresses how difficult it is for oncologists to discuss end-of-life
                  priorities with terminal patients, often because they fear hurting a patient’s feelings
                  or being perceived as a failure. After discussing Gawande, the class reads Burney’s
                  letter to study the ways in which Burney’s surgical team compounds her suffering by
                  avoiding hard conversations. Finally, we read Mary Roberts Reinhart’s 1947 interview
                  with Greta Palmer for <span style="font-style:italic">Ladies Home Journal</span>, “I Had Cancer,” about her experience with breast cancer. We discuss these three
                  texts over three class periods. I offer framing questions or comments, but most of
                  my time is spent reading passages aloud, moderating discussion, and synthesizing students’
                  comments. They then submit a two-page reflection in which they may respond to a single
                  text or the triad overall.</p>
               <p>The thematic focus on cancer allows us to confront a troubling topic head-on while
                  also inviting us to consider what kinds of things are said about cancer at different
                  moments in history. What kinds of assumptions surround the symptoms, diagnosis, and
                  treatment plan? What must be communicated? What is at stake? Many of these questions
                  lead us to close examinations of language: the words used to describe disease reflect
                  social attitudes towards that disease. After watching “Being Mortal,” we typically
                  discuss the belief that patients need their doctors to communicate openly, even if
                  doctors are worried about arousing strong emotions or coming across as failures. Only
                  when doctors manage their own negative emotions can they venture into conversations
                  that, though painful, can spare a patient long-term suffering.</p>
               <p>While students have not yet read secondary materials on logotherapy or pathography,
                  I introduce these terms to them during our discussion on Burney’s writing. Given the
                  letter’s vivid and sometimes gruesome details, it is perfect for linking emotions
                  to wellbeing via logotherapy. In addition, Burney’s literary skill infuses her pathography,
                  enabling students to emotionally connect with her. I begin class by asking students
                  how they felt about the reading: Was the letter hard to understand? What feelings
                  did they have about Burney’s experience? They usually confess that they had difficulty
                  sustaining attention up to the surgery. Student recall of the surgery is very high
                  because of the feelings it elicits, while the “build up” takes more work to unpack.
                  I lean into their discomfort with the earlier part of the text by having students
                  recount Burney’s experience before the surgery. What results is a discussion about
                  the meandering process of illness and treatment, and what students expect doctors
                  will do when a patient needs help. </p>
               <p>Students react especially strongly to the way that Burney’s surgical team treats her,
                  and they empathize with her. We linger over passages where Burney describes her shock
                  and terror. When I ask why Burney feels so terrified, students blame the surgeons.
                  The students believe that Burney’s doctors prioritize their own fears and concerns
                  over her wellbeing, and also that Burney’s male doctors treat her with a destructive
                  delicacy because she is a woman. Moreover, they perceive the surgeons as inappropriately
                  emoting. In their eyes, medical professionals should inspire confidence in their patients
                  instead of expressing fear and anxiety. When Burney is told that a surgery is unavoidable,
                  Dr. Larrey has tears in his eyes: “All were silent, and Dr. Larrey, I saw, hid himself
                  nearly behind my Sofa… I saw all hope was over. I called upon them to speak. M. Dubois
                  then, after a long and unintelligible harangue, from his own disturbance, pronounced
                  my doom” (435-436). Students interpret Larrey’s hiding as childish, and Dubois’s “long
                  and unintelligible harangue” as an inadequate effort to communicate clearly. In this
                  respect, students see Burney’s doctors as incompetent because they cannot balance
                  appropriate empathy with confidence. The surgeons’ poor communication compounds Burney’s
                  helplessness and disempowerment. </p>
               <p>The disempowerment escalates as Burney must fully submit to the surgeons. While Burney
                  does not mention embarrassment at baring her breast to a male doctor, she comes close
                  to expressing humiliation: “I was compelled, however, to submit to taking off my long
                  robe de Chambre, which I had meant to retain – ah, then, how did I think of My Sisters!
                  – not one, at so dreadful an instant, at hand, to protect – adjust—guard me” (440).
                  Students interpret this passage as a commentary on gender. Burney realizes that only
                  a woman could understand what she feels, yet her surgery is spearheaded by men who
                  have demonstrated little interest in her wellbeing. A particularly poignant endorsement
                  once came from a student who had experienced breast biopsy. She said that Burney’s
                  account collapsed historical distance and made a Romantic text accessible. She knew
                  the rawness. She knew the pull of modesty during disrobing and the helplessness in
                  relinquishing it. She felt affirmed in her connection to Burney. It was like a shared
                  triumph. This is an example of how the upsetting emotions elicited by pathography
                  can lead a student to an insight about caregiving. Burney’s narrative allowed a student
                  to think of herself as both patient and practitioner. By powerfully empathizing with
                  Burney she could ask herself what responsibilities the surgeons abdicated andappreciate
                  Burney’s fortitude. Difficult emotions thus become a gateway to assessing patient
                  care. </p>
               <p>Taken together, Burney’s letter and Gawande’s “Being Mortal” bring students to recognize
                  that communication issues have long plagued medical interactions and that a fear of
                  emotions is at the root of the problem. But while Gawande emphasizes including patients
                  in conversation, making sure they understand their disease and asking about their
                  goals and priorities, Burney’s doctors bowl her over, and in the end they don’t protect
                  her from any suffering. Patients expect doctors to take the lead, but doctors may
                  be unprepared for the emotional nature of conversations about critical illnesses.
                  What is the patient’s understanding of their disease? What are their priorities? Gawande
                  insists that medical professionals should avoid instilling false hope. He advises
                  allowing patients to emote in whatever way they need to, since patient personalities
                  differ. I ask students, as future physical therapists, what kinds of difficult conversations
                  they may have to have with patients and how Gawande’s claims and Burney’s experience
                  help them to think about what they should take into consideration when talking to
                  patients. </p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>After discussing Burney and Gawande, I transition students into texts on anatomy and
                     surgical education during the Romantic period, focusing on Ruth Richardson’s historical
                     analysis of the 1832 Anatomy Act called <span style="font-style:italic">Death, Dissection, and the Destitute</span> and the short story “The Victim” (1831). What were surgeons taught? How were they
                     taught? Can we find in other texts examples of emotions interfering with patient care?
                     While Burney’s doctors emoted in uncontrolled ways, Richardson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Death, Dissection and the Destitute</span> shows how clinical detachment, or emotionlessness, could be taken to such an extreme
                     that patients were treated as objects. She argues that during the nineteenth century,
                     the emotional distance that medical professionals adopted in order to dissect human
                     beings took on new stakes.

                              could be used for dissection (Richardson 50). This abuse of the dependent poor showed
                              how Romantic surgeons’ clinical detachment could encourage a callous attitude towards
                              patients. </span></div>

               <p>The dark fictional landscape of “The Victim” presents the dangers of clinical detachment
                  when medical study overshadows the main characters’ social awareness. Dudley, the
                  narrator, is a medical student. He and his roommate St. Clare order a cadaver from
                  a resurrectionist to study for an examination on the arteries of the neck. Passing
                  this exam has high stakes for St. Clare: once he receives his certification, he will
                  be able to marry his fiancée Emily and receive a significant sum of money. Dudley
                  receives the cadaver late one evening and directs the resurrectionists to take it
                  to the closet in his bedroom. Upon unwrapping the body, he is astounded to see the
                  most beautiful woman he’s ever encountered. Rather than dissecting her, he kisses
                  her, sketches her, and falls asleep on her exposed “inanimate breast, which had been
                  deprived too soon of existence to know the pure joy of pillowing a fellow-heart it
                  loved” (190). When St. Clare arrives home, he is devastated to learn that the cadaver
                  is Emily. Time passes, St. Clare dies, and Dudley ends up treating a man who confesses
                  to the murder of Emily. The story’s somewhat heavy-handed moral comes with the horrifying
                  revelation that St. Clare’s love interest had been abducted and murdered because resurrectionists
                  found it more convenient than digging up a dead body. Once Dudley realizes his complicity
                  in the trafficking of the dead he “renounc[es] the scalpel for ever” (193). </p>
               <p>Students invariably discuss the irreplaceable importance of hands-on dissection. Students
                  in the DPT program have the privilege of completing a yearlong cadaver lab on campus
                  during their undergraduate curriculum. They know that dissection is a vital privilege.
                  Some anticipate it with anxiety, while others look forward to it for years, but most
                  have not thought about it critically. “The Victim” provides us with an opportunity
                  to talk about students’ emotional experiences by using the characters in the story
                  as our case study. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Before we begin discussing the story, we analyze images from John Bell’s and Govard
                     Bidloo’s Romantic-era anatomical atlases so that they can get a sense of what anatomical
                     study looked like before the historical development of the clinical gaze. I ask them
                     what they could learn from these images and what their reactions are. They find them
                     frightening and compelling, but not scientific. When I show them these images, they
                     even more deeply understand why Dudley and St. Clare feel the <span style="font-style:italic">need </span>to dissect to prepare. Illustrations from John Bell’s 1810 <span style="font-style:italic">Engravings of the Bones, Muscles, and Joints</span>, for example, do not meet their criteria for a didactic anatomy textbook. They marvel
                     that students learned anything at all when textbooks were so encumbered with emotional
                     valences and chaotic excesses.

                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Janis McLarren Caldwell’s essay “The Strange Death of the Animated Cadaver” could
                              be taught in tandem with J. Bell and “The Victim.” To extend discussion into the Victorian
                              period, Ruth Richardson’s The Making of Mr. Gray’s Anatomy provides an outstanding
                              analysis of what made Gray the game-changer in anatomical textbook illustration and
                              design.</span></div>
                     </div> Through these images my students also speculate on how anatomists felt when dissecting
                     and sketching their cadavers. John Bell’s images especially communicate a horror and
                     sadness that students believe has no place in the dissecting room, even if they anticipate
                     feeling fear or sadness when it is their turn in the lab. Even Dudley calls dissection
                     a “necessary, but revolting, part of the profession” (189). Most importantly, “The
                     Victim” gives a sexual torque to dissection’s insult. The sight of Emily’s cadaver
                     stirs up erotic feelings in Dudley. He feels dissection will dishonor her, but he
                     cannot resist her beauty. He experiences a warping of his ethical and erotic drives: <span class="quote">‘never till that instant had I seen aught that came so near to my most ideal picture
                        of female loveliness; even though the last touches had been painted by the hand of
                        Death . . . I had almost brought myself to meet with indifference the objects which
                        are found on the dissecting table, [but] I could not gaze on one so young, so very
                        fair, without feeling the springs of pity dissolve within me.' (189) ’</span> Dudley is stirred away from clinical distance toward more altruistic thinking. But
                     his activated emotions lead him to a series of activities that starkly emphasizes
                     his masculinity, agency, and dominance in contrast to her feminine and unresisting
                     vulnerability. Receiving Emily’s body, unwrapping it, examining it, opening her eye,
                     kissing her, sketching her, cutting off her hair, then finally dissecting her: these
                     acts show Emily’s sexual undoing as a drawn-out process culminating in dissection.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While students do not interpret this as a rape scene, I read out loud Dudley’s description
                     of Emily’s body and his behaviors to push them to see the eroticized power dynamics
                     at play in “The Victim.” I also show them anatomist Robert Knox’s 1828 nude sketch
                     of Mary Paterson’s cadaver.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                              (5)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Richardson details Knox’s treatment of Paterson’s body: “men had come to draw her
                              body, comments had been made upon her physical attributes and Knox had even had her
                              body preserved in spirits so that he could continue to indulge in necrophiliac voyeurism”
                              (96).</span></div>
                     </div> This allows them to imagine that Dudley’s sketch of Emily may have looked to them
                     more like an eroticized image of a nude, consenting, living woman than like a dead
                     body. I also remind them that in the early nineteenth century, anatomists were viewed
                     with disgust and distrust because they meddled in guts, and their affiliation with
                     surgeons linked them to manual craft and butchery—not intellect. Excess of clinical
                     distance, thinking of humans as inert material, facilitates the cavalier ordering
                     and receiving of Emily’s remains. The ensuing objectification enables Dudley’s Robert
                     Knox-esque abuse, even as it is masked as a misdirection of socially appropriate chivalrous
                     emotion. We take time to identify the thoughts Dudley has, the emotions he feels,
                     and the behaviors that follow from these.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While students cannot imagine admiring the beauty of a cadaver, they <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> imagine feeling exhilarated to see anatomical structures. They can also imagine being
                  unable to “turn off” their feelings to achieve the clinical distance they need to
                  dissect. None of them, I certainly hope, are at risk of sexualizing their cadavers,
                  but I ask them what kinds of behaviors might be similar to Dudley’s behavior, such
                  as making a joke about a cadaver’s appearance or taking photos. Most students share
                  that they are afraid of what they will think and feel in the lab. They believe that
                  to be studious, they must be <span style="font-style:italic">somber</span>. This is where we really hit on appropriate emotions and coping. They can feel sad,
                  frightened, excited, nervous, and even silly. But there are ways to experience all
                  of these feelings, to accept them, and to use them as guides to engage their learning.
                  If they are sad, they can talk about it. If they are excited, they can express it.
                  If they are afraid, that’s okay, too. As narrative medicine can teach us, registering
                  and exploring these emotions can make my students more compassionate and more effective
                  medical professionals. I often share my own thoughts and feelings about the cadaver
                  lab and how I have coped.</p>
               <p>We come back to the dissecting experience twice more in the last three weeks of class.
                  First, we read Pauline Chen’s 2012 work of creative nonfiction, “Resurrectionist,”
                  in which Chen describes her first dissection as a med student. The essay allows us
                  to discuss what a current-day student thinks, feels, and experiences before, during,
                  and after dissecting. I again ask students how they feel about their upcoming dissection
                  – are they anxious, excited, worried? This discussion is usually animated, and it’s
                  clear that students are relieved to hear their peers’ concerns. Then, I collaborate
                  with the Anatomy I lab professor who meets us in the cadaver lab where students will
                  eventually be doing their dissections. My students have the opportunity to meet students
                  who are currently dissecting. We give students time to experience their sensations
                  and talk about their feelings first. Then, we open the body bags and let the students
                  talk through their thoughts and feelings. Anatomy I students share what they thought
                  and felt about dissecting, and how they coped. They show my students their cadavers
                  and dissections. This has been an enormously fruitful collaboration. The Anatomy I
                  professor knew that his students at times had struggled emotionally, and we both anticipate
                  that the collaboration will equip future anatomy students with more resources for
                  addressing these struggles. My students report great appreciation for the experience
                  in written reflections, in the class discussion following the lab, and in their course
                  evaluations. They feel that when it will be their turn to dissect, they will be able
                  to fully engage intellectually instead of worrying about getting sick or crying. Organizing
                  this collaboration has required emotional labor on my part, but supporting students
                  during a difficult confrontation with a cadaver has afforded me another opportunity
                  to validate their difficult emotions. It also has allowed me to show students how
                  we can work through sadness or fear. For example, one semester I sat in the hallway
                  with a sobbing student. I listened to her, and we developed a plan to walk into the
                  lab together. She asked me to walk ahead of her, to keep up a steady stream of chatter,
                  and to lead her to a table where a few of her friends were. Students know that they
                  need to work through the discomfort of seeing cadavers but have few guided opportunities
                  to do so. Visiting the cadaver lab has also given me a chance to really communicate
                  to students that I care about their wellbeing, and I am able to welcome and withstand
                  their feelings. I am, in other words, modeling how I accept emotions as part of my
                  profession. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Student Reactions</span></h2>
               <p>The medical worlds of literary texts like Burney’s letter and “The Victim” are unimaginable
                  to students pursuing degrees in health science—a world in which a mastectomy is performed
                  on an inadequately informed, fully conscious woman by a clutch of terrified and silent
                  surgeons, and a world in which anatomy students become sexual predators complicit
                  in murder. My students’ world is one in which cancer is openly discussed, where cadaver
                  lab is part of their undergraduate curriculum, and where surgeons are stereotypically
                  the apotheosis of efficient protocol. My students are not ready for the butchery,
                  for the emotionally labile surgical team, for the woman who holds her own breast on
                  a pile of old mattresses. Nor are they ready for the student falling weeping onto
                  and kissing his study-cadaver in his bedroom the night before an exam. The strength
                  of these texts, then, is their medical uncanniness. They are familiar enough to comprehend
                  and alien enough to shock students into engaged reflection. They bring to the surface
                  students’ assumptions about appropriate study and care and thus embed them more mindfully
                  in the present. Burney’s letter and “The Victim” invite conversations about clinical
                  detachment as both necessary to practice surgery and dissection and also something
                  that can be taken to a dangerous extreme. By reading these nineteenth-century texts,
                  students come to the conclusion that empathy cannot be sacrificed in medical care.
                  Even though medical professionals face complicated emotional challenges that can make
                  effective care difficult, the patient’s experience must always be weighed and appreciated.
                  Narrative medicine makes it clear that this leads to better outcomes for patients
                  and can prevent other negative effects for medical professionals.</p>
               <p>My “Healthcare and Literature” students connect to the texts in three significant
                  ways: as learners with professional aspirations, as erstwhile and future patients,
                  and as individuals who want to change lives. Official Student Evaluation Surveys have
                  confirmed that students find the texts relevant to their future professions. They
                  appreciate being introduced to communication challenges, and they can express the
                  importance of language when working with patients. Students have stated that they
                  appreciate discussing difficult medical scenarios. They know that they will have hard
                  conversations when they ask a patient why they aren’t completing their prescribed
                  exercises or when they resist instilling false hope in a postoperative athlete who
                  will likely not comfortably play their sport again. Part of my joy in working with
                  future physical therapists is their belief in recovery and triumph. They are optimistic
                  and excited to help future patients. My ancillary joy is mediating their journey,
                  even if in a small way, to becoming comfortable with situations where they may feel
                  powerless, overwhelmed, angry, or frustrated—and being able to persist in the midst
                  of those feelings. By normalizing difficult conversations, they can, I hope, take
                  comfort, feel prepared, and know they are not alone. </p>

               the assignment’s guidelines. It also allows me to demonstrate to them what an “A”
