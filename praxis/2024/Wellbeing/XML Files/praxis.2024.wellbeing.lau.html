                  absent from the histories we write.”</span></p>
            <p>— Douglas C. Baynton, “Disability and the Justification of Inequality in American
               History” (2001)</p>
            <p>“<span style="font-style:italic">By reading cultural representations alongside the testimonies of disabled people themselves,
                  a more complex picture of disability in history emerges, one which is sensitive to
                  the dynamics of oppression, but which also recognizes disabled people as historical
                  actors in their own right.</span>”</p>
            <p>— David M. Turner, <span style="font-style:italic">Disability in Eighteenth-Century England: Imagining Physical Impairment </span>(2012)</p>
            <p>During my final year of graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, I received
               a joint research and teaching fellowship, which enabled me to complete my dissertation
               and teach two courses of my own design. In the process of designing one of these courses,
               I began with a question that I was already trying to address throughout my scholarship
               and more recently in my preparation for the academic job market: <span style="font-style:italic">what is the value of centering disability in literary studies? </span>My attempts at thinking through different answers to this question culminated in my
               lower-division undergraduate seminar offered in the fall semester of 2017. As a fellow
               at The College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS), I was tasked with creating
               a course catered to English majors and minors, as well as LPS students, many of whom
               are non-traditional students pursuing continuing education alongside other employment.
               This unique rostering and enrollment cap on the number of English students ensured
               that the class would not be composed of solely majors in the field but would also
               include STEM students and working professionals in nursing, medicine, and law. At
               first, I had conceived of “Disability Narratives” as a broad survey of disability
               writing, but I realized after seeing the mix of students enrolled that I needed to
               reframe this course in a way that also made accessible to non-majors the key skills
               in literary studies, like close reading, that help us better understand <span style="font-style:italic">why</span> disability matters in the first place. I needed to make a compelling, semester-long
               case for the vibrancy of disabled life against reductive views of disability as an
               unbearable state of being defined only by suffering and stigma. Such vibrancy, I wanted
               to insist to my students, pervades much of literary history in ways we are just now
               beginning to take seriously.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Part of doing justice to this project of scholarly inquiry was also putting into practice
                  an activist slogan from the Disability Rights movement: <span style="font-style:italic">nothing about us without us</span>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           Nothing About Us Without Us: Disability Oppression and Empowerment (Berkeley: University
                           of California Press, 1998).</span></div>
                  </div> This phrase, coined by early disability activists, reminds us that we should not only
                  be foregrounding the narratives of disability produced by disabled people themselves,
                  but we should be wary of confining disability to its representations alone. While
                  close readings of literary characters can reveal how ableist structures operate and
                  disability theory may provide useful frameworks by which we might analyze our objects
                  of study, what frequently gets sidelined in classrooms are the everyday lives of disabled
                  people and the ways disabled people have learned to live within and in spite of ableism.
                  Instead, narratives about the disabled by ablebodied writers often come to stand in
                  or speak for the disabled experience. Community organizers like Alice Wong and Vilissa
                  Thompson have taught me that to truly understand disability requires us to attend
                  to more than the many spectacular narratives of misery or overcoming that so often
                  dominate our critical attention.

                  </div> <span style="font-style:italic">Which stories of disability are we not paying attention to? </span>We have a responsibility to the quotidian, the everyday of disability, not just the
                  “extreme or exotic bodies,” which David Turner sees as “deflect[ing] attention from
                  the experiences or representations of thousands of people whose impairments were less
                  visually apparent or unusual” (3). Only attending to sensational or “interesting”
                  cases contributes to an erasure of the extensive archive of disabled experience that
                  remains understudied and undervalued. As my LPS students would come to discover, disabled
                  people have long theorized ways of living that enabled them to thrive—a disabled wellbeing.
                  To trace the multiple forms that disabled being takes requires us to suspend our ongoing
                  assumptions about disability and to see disability on its own terms, even if those
                  terms challenge what we think we know about disability as a shifting category of human
                  experience.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As a scholar used to working in older historical periods, I first imagined the class
               chronologically. While this ordering of texts was certainly more straightforward,
               this structure inadvertently reproduced a progress narrative of disability from pathology
               and oppression to empowerment and activism. Given my own training in Romantic literature
               and culture and the history of medicine, this trajectory felt too reductive and teleological,
               especially as this period witnessed profound transitions in how disability was understood
               in relation to shifting definitions of the body and the human. To address these larger
               concerns I had, I applied a technique from my early days in graduate school to help
               me rework my syllabus. Dr. Suvir Kaul, my advisor and chair for my first-year exam,
               suggested that I prepare for my exam by thinking thematically rather than chronologically
               about the texts in my lists. I hoped that by playing with unexpected configurations
               of key texts, my students could offer equally unexpected answers to classroom questions—just
               as I had attempted to do in my exam. How, for instance, might more contemporary activism
               and scholarship on neurodivergence shape the ways we read works like William Wordsworth’s
               “The Idiot Boy” or John Clare’s “I Am” poems? This thematic course structure also
               better reflected the field of Disability Studies and its recent shifts toward more
               intersectional scholarship and disability in pre-modern and early modern contexts.
               Since my class met only once a week, each three-hour meeting gave us ample time to
               explore how disability and disability theory links up with other marginalized identities
               like queerness or blackness. Each of the course’s text clusters ultimately included
               combinations of fiction, poetry, and plays from different historical periods with
               disability life-writing and theory that together flesh out the multiple dimensions
               of disabled experience and speculate on what more inclusive futures and worlds might
               look like. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One of my other primary goals for the course was to have students learn how to think
                  and write from their respective bodyminds, for the personal is the place from which
                  transformative, invested scholarship comes.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Margaret Price’s critical term “bodymind” underscores the inextricable relationship
                           between mind and body. In refusing Cartesian dualism, Price understands disability
                           as an interaction between mind and body that cannot be so easily separated out. See
                           also Sami Schalk’s Bodyminds Reimagined (Duke University Press, 2018) for her application
                           of this term in relation to disability in black women’s speculative fiction.</span></div>
                  </div> My work has been greatly influenced by feminist standpoint theory and more recently
                  what Rosemarie Garland Thomson has called <span style="font-style:italic">sitpoint theory</span>: the acts of writing and thinking and the forms of knowledge we produce are inextricable
                  from our complexly embodied situations. Disability scholarship has taught me the great
                  value of refusing the persona of the detached and disembodied critic, which unrealistically
                  disavows the bodymind behind it. This resonates with ongoing shifts in the study of
                  Romanticism, which seek to recognize how disability was formative for Romantic writers
                  like Samuel Taylor Coleridge or Mary Robinson such that their work cannot be understood
                  without attending to their disabled lived experience. In what follows, I reflect on
                  the trajectory of my Disability Narratives course that moves from introducing students
                  to broader frameworks in disability theory to examining more specific, historicized
                  instances of disability like Frances Burney’s mastectomy letter and George Byron’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Deformed Transformed</span>, two works not typically assigned in Disability Studies courses. I realized in the
                  process of teaching this course how Romantic representations of disability by disabled
                  writers complicated the dominant narratives in Disability Studies by exploring a much
                  more robust spectrum of disabled experiences not reducible to pathology and normality.
                  As a classroom community, we learned to how to read in a way that recognizes the centrality
                  of disability to these writers’ literary and artistic productions to the extent that
                  such attention reconfigured what we thought we knew about Romanticism and earlier
                  periods preceding disability’s formation as a politicized identity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>My pedagogical method remains indebted to this explicit recognition of the bodymind
               actually doing the labor of thinking and writing, the bodymind that I and my students
               have unfortunately been long trained to neglect. From a disabled sitpoint, “wellbeing”
               does not signify individual healthiness or an ableist expectation to work or think.
               A sitpoint approach to the classroom instead affirms the full range of different bodyminds,
               each living with different capacities and limits, toward a sense of collective wellbeing:
               my role as an educator is to encourage each member of our community of inquiry to
               contribute and participate in the ways most accessible to them while also acknowledging
               the access needs of their classmates. In “Disability Narratives,” I wanted my students
               to understand wellbeing as a community effort that is ongoing as our needs and goals
               changed over the semester: I stressed from the first day that we had a collective
               responsibility to maintain a supportive environment that would allow each student
               to inhabit as fully as possible their own bodyminds... From freewriting sessions to
               group reflections to peer review, I tried to create the conditions in which vulnerability
               could be coinhabited among the students and shaped into thoughtful and exciting arguments
               about the literature and art they encountered, often for the first time. To that end,
               I avoided the role as the figure of authority in the room but instead participated
               as a member of the community that learned from them as much as they learned from me.
               Such interdependence characterizes what Liat Ben-Moshe finds most powerful about a
               Disability Studies classroom: “that kind of space, of prefiguration, of taking into
               account both difficult and uncommon content and unfamiliar forms by which to convey
               it” (par. 4). This was not simply a class “about disabled topics” but about building
               an accessible community of inquiry invested in working through difficult, uncommon,
               and unfamiliar material across embodyminded and disciplinary difference. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Over the course of fifteen weeks, my students and I explored how different representational
                  forms perpetuate, reject, or even transform stereotypes of the disabled. Were there
                  other ways of imagining disabled life beyond the abnormal or the deficient? To develop
                  a conceptual vocabulary for us to theorize potential answers, we began with David
                  Mitchell and Sharon Snyder’s “narrative prosthesis,” a critical term they use to describe
                  a work’s dependency on disability as a device of characterization or plot that produces
                  certain narratives of progress or cure.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder’s Narrative Prosthesis: Disability and the Dependencies
                           of Discourse (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 200).</span></div>
                  </div> I had my students mark not only when disability appears in texts but also when disabled
                  characters become relegated to minor, flat, and non-agential roles like the comic
                  relief of an otherwise serious plot or the shady figure easily identifiable as villainous
                  because of their disabilities. We compiled lists and sketched out mindmaps of the
                  tropes repeatedly invoked from compensatory ability (i.e. Tiresias’ prophetic sight
                  replacing his blindness in Ovid's <span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span>) to infantilization (i.e. the disabled bought out of slavery by the women in Sarah
                  Scott’s <span style="font-style:italic">Millennium Hall</span>). Disability in such works is repeatedly invoked for its symbolic or transgressive
                  implications but ultimately contained or eliminated for the sake of narrative resolution,
                  be it in the form of marriage or recovery. But the (mis)use of disability as a narrative
                  prop towards ableist ends is hardly new. As Mitchell and Snyder argue, “narrative
                  prosthesis” is deployed repeatedly throughout literary history to the extent that
                  we have become accustomed to assuming disability must function in such objectifying
                  and limiting ways. The Western literary tradition since Homer’s <span style="font-style:italic">Iliad </span>and Sophocles’ <span style="font-style:italic">Oedipus Rex </span>has “persistently, even obsessively, deployed disability” precisely for its ideological
                  implications (Couser 603). The ubiquity of disability throughout literary history
                  has paradoxically contributed to its invisibility, its being everywhere and nowhere
                  simultaneously. A key strategy for structuring my course around clusters of texts
                  was to make this ubiquity apparent even with texts that are not ostensibly about disability
                  and to provide analytical tools for thinking about representations of disability that
                  were always already there within and without the Western canon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For many of my students, learning to read characters <span style="font-style:italic">explicitly in terms of disability </span>was novel, and to some, deeply unsettling, for the way that it undermined how familiar
                  texts have traditionally been received. Destabilizing and revising conventional readings—to <span style="font-style:italic">crip </span>them through a series of un-readings of texts we thought we knew—became a useful methodology
                  that prompted students to question the ideological work of a text’s invocations of
                  disability. The term “crip” first emerged out of disability activism, which reclaimed
                  slurs like “cripple” as a form of politicized community identification but has now
                  become a methodology in Disability Studies as an academic field.

                  was one of the central interventions in the recent edited collection of essays on
                  disability and Romantic literature, <span style="font-style:italic">Disabling Romanticism</span> (2013). Just as some authors deployed ableist metaphors of “crippled economies” or
                  characters’ “blind spots,” some critics recycled such metaphors by reading texts only
                  in terms of an author’s disability or even entirely ignoring disability all together
                  as an unnecessary or unsavory detail that devalues the work’s literary merit. Attention
                  to these biases in scholarship also helped my students become more comfortable challenging
                  what felt like the unassailable authority of published literary critics while encouraging
                  students to be self-conscious about their own potentially ableist readings.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To practice this kind of approach, I dedicated each class meeting to slow close readings
               of passages mostly chosen ahead of time by my students. These readings would then
               form the bases of responses to larger thematic questions I posed on the board at the
               start of each class. These questions were collated from student discussion posts and
               elaborated upon in ways that would help connect themes across different weeks in the
               course or to earlier questions posed in previous classes. To check in on their progress
               after the first month, I assigned for the first extended writing assignment a critical
               interpretation of Raymond Carver’s short story, “Cathedral” (1983). The story describes
               an unnamed narrator’s encounter with his wife’s friend, Robert, repeatedly referred
               to by the narrator as “the blind man.” The narrator notes how Robert does not seem
               to look or act like a typical blind man. After the narrator’s wife falls asleep, the
               narrator and Robert are left to watch television. When a cathedral appears on screen
               in a documentary, the narrator struggles to describe it for Robert, who then offers
               that they draw the image together on paper. For the narrator, this intimate experience
               is epiphanic, and he subsequently abandons his hostility toward Robert and his blindness.
               Many of my students remarked on how Carver uses the encounter with Robert simply to
               catalyze the narrator’s spiritual transformation by the story’s end. As a form of
               narrative prosthesis, Robert is flattened to his disability as “the blind man” who
               is compensated with insight and self-consciousness only useful for reforming the unnamed
               narrator’s prejudices. Many of my students at first interpreted the text as humanizing
               Robert by giving him subjectivity, but in fact, the text is revealed to be less and
               less about Robert’s lived experience or interiority as a disabled man but about his
               capacity to bring about the ablebodyminded narrator’s moral improvement. While the
               Robert’s characterization is not directly disparaging, his function as the short story’s
               narrative prosthesis precludes any possibility of his identification as anything other
               than the “blind man” whose commanding presence unsettles the narrator. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Such unsettling and its implications became part of an ongoing set of questions in
                  the class how different affects became attached to disability. The second short paper
                  in the course asked my students to consider the affective strategies of a set of short
                  films, some of which were entries for the Easterseals Disability Film Challenge. By
                  this point in the class, my students had come to expect narratives of disability “inspiration
                  porn.”

                  to be successful and independent, “inspiration porn” perpetuates a series of sentimental
                  fantasies of overcoming disability. “Inspiration porn” frames disability as an undesirable
                  state that the disabled should aspire to exceed rather than embrace. Disability “inspiration
                  porn” remains popular in everything from commercials to romantic comedies, but as
                  my students observed, it is part of a well-established tradition dating back to sentimental
                  fiction and Romantic melodrama like Percy Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Cenci </span>(1823) or Samuel Coleridge’s <span style="font-style:italic">Remorse</span><span style="font-style:italic">  (1813).</span>A more familiar text to my students, Charles Dickens’ <span style="font-style:italic">A Christmas Carol </span>(1843), served as a useful case study for tracking how disability became a particularly
                  “sticky” category that was increasingly attached to certain affective qualities like
                  pity or fear .

                  </div> In conjunction with the Dickens’s original staves, we watched television and film
                  adaptations of the novella, specifically for their different representations of Tiny
                  Tim as a pitiable young disabled boy whose poverty and suffering help to catalyze
                  Scrooge’s moral reformation. Cripping literature like <span style="font-style:italic">A Christmas Carol</span>—a work of children’s literature not explicitly about disabled experience—reveals
                  the manipulative qualities of “inspiration porn” that depend on the work’s ability
                  to pull on heartstrings in response to disability as a tragic state of being. Dickens’s
                  novella exemplifies precisely how affect is integral to its appeal to readers old
                  and young such that it has become a Christmas classic frequently a part of family
                  holiday traditions. After all, Victorian social reformers similarly depended on such
                  sob stories to make the disabled more sympathetic and worthier of charity. To quote
                  one of my students, “the history of disability is also a history of feelings.” And
                  it was those feelings that I wanted students not to disavow but to use as the affective
                  foundations for their own crip readings of texts.</p>

               <p>In the month before classes began, I realized in previewing the enrollment numbers
                  that <span style="font-style:italic">Disability Narratives </span>would include not just English majors but also a significant number of STEM and pre-professional
                  students. Fully aware that these students have more frequently encountered a medicalized
                  approach to disability, I started to re-envision the course in terms of what Roy Porter
                  has called “doing medical history from below,” a way of doing medical history as social
                  history that centers the lived experience of sick and disabled people so often excluded
                  from histories preoccupied with medical advancement.

                  </div> I reworked the class narrative to better unpack how disability comes into being not
                  only through scientific and medical understandings but also through cultural production
                  like fiction and poetry by and about disabled people. If I wanted my students to understand
                  that disability has an extended cultural history, I needed to create opportunities
                  where they might witness the manifold ways disability has been metaphorized within
                  medicine and science and more importantly how disabled people continue to define themselves
                  by and against those concept metaphors. As opposed to understanding narratives as
                  mere reflections of a static disability reality defined only by natural philosophers,
                  scientists, and physicians, I challenged my students to think more capaciously about
                  narrative beyond the mimetic: <span style="font-style:italic">how do these narratives imagine and reimagine disability and the worlds in which disabled
                     people live</span>?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In efforts to crip the triumphalist accounts of medical progress many of the pre-medicine
                  and nursing students received in their lecture courses, I also began the course thinking
                  with them about medicine’s role in producing and maintaining what Tobin Siebers has
                  termed “the ideology of ability,” or the pervasive cultural “preference for able-bodiedness”
                  that came to “defin[e] the baseline by which humanness is determined, setting the
                  measure of body and mind that gives or denies human status to individual persons”
                  (8-9). This ideology underpins the medical model of disability, which locates disability
                  in individual bodies and seeks to return those bodies to health by correcting or eliminating
                  that disability. The consequences of such ideology became disturbingly clear in our
                  case studies of euthanasia programs like Nazi Germany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Aktion T4, </span>which killed over 300,000 disabled people on the grounds that it purified the population
                  and eliminated burdens on the nation. Such cases underscored how medicine was often
                  complicit with legal and social systems of oppression through its authority over definitions
                  of healthiness and ability. Often definitions at the level of the individual and the
                  population depended on the direct marginalization or exclusion of the disabled. Archival
                  accounts of institutionalization and violent medical intervention, like the case of
                  Carrie Buck, who was forcibly sterilized in Virginia in 1927 for her “feeble-mindedness,”
                  helped to make real the ugly consequences of Western medical ableism that were in
                  fact recent history. We read trans and disabled writer Eli Clare’s own reflections
                  on the traumatic but moving encounter with Carrie Buck in the archive and the ongoing
                  struggle for disabled people to recover their lost histories while finding themselves
                  within them.

                  in seemingly unexpected places.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A cursory look at historical representations of disability easily creates the illusion
               that disability always was what Mitchell and Snyder have called “the master trope
               of human disqualification” (125). Exemplified by figures like Shakespeare’s Richard
               III<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>or Homer’s Thersites<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>disability had long been understood as teratological monstrosity or divine error.
               In terms of character, their deformity and ugliness externally signaled moral deficiency
               and corrupt character. Yet, a turn to Romantic-era literature reveals that the “master
               trope” was not nearly as totalizing as both disability thinkers and literary scholars
               have suggested. In fact, the cultural equivalence between deformity and immorality
               would be repeatedly questioned by eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century
               writers from William Hay to George Byron. Closer attention to the periods prior to
               the rise of eugenics and medical pathology reveals understudied instances of disability
               resistance, flourishing, and agency that often escape and even challenge the familiar
               narrative of the “master trope of human disqualification” presumed to be definitive
               of disabled experience transhistorically.</p>
            <p>In moving away from “militating against a monolithically ableist past” in favor of
               “recovering the social and historical particulars that add up to our ableist present,”
               scholars of Romantic-era disability like Fuson Wang, Emily B. Stanback, and Essaka
               Joshua have revealed how the Romantic period offers surprisingly positive representations
               and conceptions of bodily difference during a “transitional moment between Enlightenment
               yearning for universal humanism and the Victorian codification of social mores” (Wang
               2). Attention to this period “in between” complicates (or crips) what has too often
               been understood as a straightforward trajectory from religious, juridical, and moral
               understandings of disability to biomedical pathology and statistical norms by the
               nineteenth century. Most recently, the contributors of <span style="font-style:italic">Disabling Romanticism </span>have made a powerful case for how many Romantic authors wrote consciously about and
               from the position of their own disabilities to explore seemingly disembodied abstractions
               like sublimity and transcendence. In attending to the ways in which disability shapes
               the creative conditions and forms of writing, this newer generation of interdisciplinary
               scholars has begun to resituate Romantic writers within the context of disability
               history and resist the presentism of Disability Studies as a field. This has importantly
               expanded the canon of disability texts beyond more contemporary works and pushed the
               field to think more capaciously about forms of disability in history before the constitution
               of ablebodymindedness as a medical and cultural norm.</p>
            <p>Given that most of the dramatic works I had included in “Disability Narratives” were
               contemporary, I took a risk assigning a text I had not previously taught in a disability
               context: Byron’s dramatic fragment, <span style="font-style:italic">The Deformed Transformed</span> (1822). I wanted to experiment with reading the fragment not in terms of Byron’s
               oeuvre and reductive notions of “Romantic genius” but rather as a transitional text
               marking the ways in which disability’s meanings were being renegotiated before the
               rise of hospital medicine and the specialized sciences<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>The text begins with the hunchbacked protagonist, Arnold, who is traumatically rejected
               by his mother during childhood. Tempted by the prospect of a more beautiful and capable
               body, Arnold makes a Faustian pact with an unnamed Stranger who offers to give him
               the body of the heroic Achilles and assume Arnold’s body in his place. The conclusion
               Byron had planned in his final notes is that Arnold ultimately becomes jealous of
               his own body as he fails to court Olimpia, a young woman who falls in love with the
               Stranger for his insight and intelligence rather than with Arnold despite his newfound
               form.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In what scholars have described as Byron’s semiautobiographical play about his club

                  cultural ideologies” that coerce the disabled to choose death rather than stigma in
                  life (Snyder 272).

                  </div> Arnold’s very desire to liberate himself from his own body (at first through suicide,
                  then later through an exchange of bodies) is futile because it merely reflects a tragic
                  internalization of the cultural pressures to be and remain ablebodyminded. Despite
                  the play’s tragic end in which Arnold loses Olimpia to the very man with whom he exchanged
                  his own body and ultimately laments his decision to cast off his original body, my
                  students kept returning to the articulate defense and celebration of disability that
                  Arnold presents before the iconic body-swap scene: “Deformity is daring. / It is its
                  essence to o’ertake mankind / By heart and soul, and make itself the equal” (I.i.
                  314-316). Part of the negotiation between Arnold and the Stranger is a debate over
                  how deformity uniquely prepares humans and animals for survival even as it may hinder
                  that survival in the first place. As my students concluded, the overemphasis upon
                  Arnold’s internalized ableism and shame misses the opportunity to recognize an early
                  form of what we might call in the disability community “disability pride” or a valuation
                  of disability that sees it as a resource for survival.

            <p>Alongside recovering historical examples of disabled life, the course focused on disability’s
               interrelationship with gender. I paired Frances Burney D’Arblay’s 1812 letter to her
               sister with Audre Lorde’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Cancer Journals </span>(1980)<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Burney underwent a mastectomy of her right breast in 1811 after surgeons discovered
               what they believed to be a cancerous tumor. During her convalescence, she detailed
               the experience of surgery with only a “wine cordial” for anesthesia in a harrowing
               letter to Esther, her sister. Lorde’s journals similarly capture the traumatic experience
               of seeking medical treatment for her breast cancer and her struggle to make sense
               of that experience from her vantage point as a black lesbian feminist. Drawing on
               the pedagogical exercises familiar to students training to be clinicians, I had my
               students work in groups to approach Burney’s and Lorde’s texts as bioethics cases.
               These exercises train students to read and interpret a case report that details an
               ethical dilemma typically associated with a decision to provide or refuse treatment
               or access to care. One of my mentors, Dr. Lance Wahlert, frequently teaches his narrative
               medicine classes in the school of medicine by presenting literary sources as “case
               studies” that raise bioethical questions about issues like autonomy or consent. I
               asked my students to consider whether the therapeutic experiences for either Burney
               or Lorde shifted their understanding of what constitutes ethics in these contexts,
               especially given the difference in privilege between the two women. I was moved by
               my students’ collective refusal to make the conversation purely about whether or not
               Burney or Lorde were treated ethically. Instead, they considered the consequences
               of such unethical care and the disturbing continuities of healthcare between this
               late eighteenth-century moment and the 1970s, where medical professionals actively
               denied and even erased the subjective experiences of already vulnerable patients like
               Burney and Lorde before, during, and after treatment.</p>
            <p>As one of my students smartly argued in his final project on Lorde’s <span style="font-style:italic">Journals, </span>this pairing of texts reveals the cruelty of what Burney calls in her letter a “perfect
               recovery” even after medical trauma. This standard of “perfect recovery” is characterized
               by bodily wholeness and a preservation of physical beauty linked to a woman’s social
               status and marriageability. In reading Burney’s account, students saw the historical
               foundations for the gendered social pressures women like Lorde continue to face as
               in her direct condemnation of the expectation that sheget a prosthetic breast implant
               in order to pass as a woman in public life. As a guiding question, I asked my students
               how the demands of cure and recovery might work to further disable women <span style="font-style:italic">socially </span>rather than exclusively in terms of bodily health: <span style="font-style:italic">how do women who fail to recover or whose full “return” to health is impossible become
                  further stigmatized in ways that contribute to their ongoing mistreatment as women
                  or even exclusion from womanhood entirely?</span> The class found especially useful Alison Kafer’s critique of the “curative imaginary,”
               which helped to make sense of what students felt was a counterintuitive argument against
               cure. If “inspiration porn” defined the ideal disabled person as one who overcomes
               their disability, narratives of cure enforce the idea that “the only appropriate disabled
               mind/body is one cured or moving toward cure” (27-28). Thus, to fail to be cured or
               to refuse cure risks further stigma and rejection that gets mediated across multiple
               axes of identity and marginality. Thinking across the significant historical and identity
               divides between Burney and Lorde also importantly helped students recognize unexpected
               opportunities for solidarity based on shared struggle with ableism and medical trauma.</p>
            <p>Challenging inherited assumptions about what disability is and why it matters is difficult
               work. I took many pedagogical risks in the design and execution of this course during
               a period of great professional uncertainty, but one of the hardest aspects to reckon
               with was teaching a disability-centered course without presuming that Disability Studies
               or even the category of disability had any value to my students. I had to learn different
               ways of making accessible the very foundations of Disability Studies to students whose
               training primed them to be skeptical or even hostile to these ways of thinking and
               being. As we often challenge our students to address the “stakes” question in their
               writing, part of the transformative act of teaching is realizing those stakes for
               ourselves and conveying them to our students who may or may not accept them. Teaching
               disability has trained me to welcome and even invite student resistance as a means
               of opening up conversation rather than closing it down, generous invitations to work
               through impasses and disagreement instead of dismissive accusations of ableism. Choosing
               to join our students in their encounters with history, literature, and theory requires
               a scholarly humility open to the unpredictable, the unplanned. After all, disability
               reminds us that life is about <span style="font-style:italic">contingency</span>.</p>
            <p>During a particularly heated discussion toward the end of “Disability Narratives,”
               a biomedical sciences student expressed frustration with what felt to her like an
               indictment of the medical establishment and a needless “blame game against people
               just trying to help.” Another added that it seemed contradictory and even hypocritical
               that disabled people are advocating for healthcare access and seeking medical assistance
               while simultaneously celebrating disability pride and damning medical assistance that
               might better their lives. For the disabled students in the room, such remarks entirely
               miss what many disabled writers had been telling us all semester: that it is entirely
               possible to embrace disability as an identity while also desiring to have humane,
               patient-centered care that better enables disabled people to flourish rather than
               be fixed or eliminated by medicine. “If cure was all that mattered, I wouldn’t even
               be here,” one disabled student remarked at the very end of class. Sobering as this
               comment was, the biomedical student recognized the personal stakes the disabled students
               had in resisting a cure narrative that she was complicit in perpetuating uncritically
               even in her desire to help alleviate suffering. Such recognition, as my disabled students
               made clear, is only possible when we center disabled people and their ways of knowing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One of the great successes of this class was fostering a classroom space in which
                  such heated discussions could happen safely and productively. Early in the semester,
                  I asked my students what brought them to my class. A few chose to disclose their disabilities,
                  while others described the experiences of disabled friends and family. I made very
                  clear that disclosure was never an expectation nor a requirement for success in my
                  course, outside of an invitation on the syllabus to speak with me should they want
                  help accessing accommodations, but many of my disabled students insisted that this
                  was one of the only classroom spaces where disclosure had felt allowed, even necessary.
                  Their moving reflections on how disability has shaped their personal and academic
                  lives inspired me to disclose for the first time in an academic setting my own experience
                  living and teaching with scoliosis-related disability, brain fog, and chronic pain.

                  </div> I admitted that I often struggled to articulate myself clearly when speaking if my
                  pain and fog were intense and that the very act of physically being in the room to
                  teach inevitably exacerbated my pain. Rather than concealing these facts of my daily
                  living that shape every facet of my academic life, I told them that, according to
                  vicissitudes of my own bodymind, I would need to rely on them frequently throughout
                  the semester just as much as they, as bodyminds with their own vicissitudes, would
                  need to rely on me. I frequently hear from fellow educators that they often fear such
                  admissions might lead to students questioning their ability to teach or risk potentially
                  alienating their students. In my experience, this form of honesty has been empowering
                  because students feel connected to their instructors in new ways that prompt them
                  to bring their fullest selves to the classroom and to take risks with other members
                  of a classroom community invested in collective wellbeing. Centering disability aspires
                  toward an interdependent vulnerability that makes possible the act of communal knowledge-making,
                  one that is compassionate and accessible to the bodyminds that share the classroom
                  together.</p>
