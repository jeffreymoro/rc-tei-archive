            <p>I argue that a transatlantic perspective is not enough when we teach our students
               about the slave trade and the Abolition movement during the Romantic period. What
               is needed is an Atlantic studies perspective that involves the circum-Atlantic trade
               of goods and persons, disrupting a white Anglo-American dialogue of historical persons
               and texts with a more fluid set of networks and relationships. In order to situate
               an Atlanticist pedagogy, I enlist the historical nautical strategy of triangulation
               between Africa, the Caribbean, and Britain in its metaphorical sense: the triangulation
               of three narratives within contextual materials; the triangulation of literary interpretation
               with historical and current interpretive concepts and methods; the triangulation of
               Atlantic coasts and land entities; and the triangulation of the strategic terms “fluidity,”
               “circulation,” and “movement” borrowed from non-literary fields of study. I also introduce
               the way that the triadic relation between past, present and future is an important
               lens for student to read through: the slave trade’s prospective effects on the Black
               Lives Matter movement and the literary genre of Afrofuturism, or the impassioned rhetoric
               of corresponding texts from past, present and imagined future. Effectively, an Atlantic
               approach has the depth and breadth to put history, economic trade, political movements,
               and maritime realities in relation to rhetorical and figurative analysis of literary
               texts.</p>

               <p>Romantic Period studies has tended to focus on those literary and cultural concerns
                  that apply to Anglo-American relations in terms of a transatlanticism belonging to
                  a determinate timeframe. However, the Romantic Period was actually an age of global
                  capitalism, plundered resources, and cross-contamination; therefore, enlarging the
                  Anglo-American dialogue of public voices and efficacious texts more expansively makes
                  sense as Bernard Bailyn and Joselyn M. Almeida have argued in separate contexts.

                  </div> Although I will be focusing here on the triangular relation of Africa, Britain, and
                  British holdings in the Caribbean, folding into that relation the French colony of
                  San Domingue and the American city Philadelphia for two of the texts discussed, the
                  same argument holds for colonizers and the colonized, brutalized or enslaved peoples
                  of other territories belonging to panatlantic land masses. The point of engaging with
                  these histories, the ideologies that produced them, and the testimonies of survivors
                  is that the concerns of the Atlantic world remain central to the concerns of today’s
                  Atlantic and global reality. Historically, too, a more expansive treatment of the
                  Romantic-era Atlantic world could put the trading circuits of the West Indies and
                  the East Indies in dialogue; or one might make the connection for students between
                  the working of West Indian plantations and the not-too different circumstances of
                  the diamond mines today in mineral rich countries like the Democratic Republic of
                  the Congo, nations whose people see no profit from the rapacious mining of their land
                  by others. In terms of the transatlantic, this more expanded perspective is the domain
                  of Atlantic World studies, which is interdisciplinary, and involves a deep sense of
                  history from plate changes in the ocean’s bottom to human geography (which, for example,
                  examines migration patterns over centuries, death tolls amongst enslaved people, movement
                  between Caribbean islands and plantations).</p>

               <p>The dilemma of what can be crammed into a class discussion arises when the materials
                  concerning the sites of literary production and dissemination (important for emphasizing
                  the precarity of narratives and testimonials of enslaved peoples) can be enriched
                  by contextualizing them with charity organizations and Parliamentary records of Abolitionist
                  and conservative documents. Yet I want to argue instead for a more engaged Atlanticist
                  lens to broaden how we situate and affirm the complexities of Atlantic life for students,
                  the malleable nature of Atlantic identity, and its opportunities for self-reinvention.

                           teaching the Romantic period: the Black Atlantic intersects with the Red Atlantic
                           (the circulation, exchanges, and material productions of indigenous peoples in the
                           Atlantic and coastal regions of the Americas, as well as their travels to Britain,
                           Europe and Africa), and the Hispanic and Lusophone Atlantic world whose historical
                           importance loomed large in the period, as well as the Francophone Atlantic, all of
                           which extend our teaching about British empire through these other circulations and
                           imperial networks.</span></div>
                  </div> To think pedagogically using such a lens has allowed me to think more broadly geographically
                  and temporally in order to situate the revolutionary aspects of Atlantic life in the
                  Romantic period. My main strategy is one I adapted from the nautical strategy of triangulation
                  to teach literary interpretation of narratives and testimonials of enslaved persons,
                  historical texts or information, related texts and websites in groups of three, and
                  to apply Atlantic studies concepts and methods in connection with literary analysis.
                  The strategy of triangulation has been richly explored in the work of Bailyn, Jeremy
                  Smith, Almeida, and others.

                  </div> Against the Anglo-American oppositional model, triangulation is not just adding a
                  middle term to create a dialectical engagement; rather, it involves the fluid movement
                  of dynamic relationality among multiple, and variable subjects. In this way texts
                  can be revisited several times in order to resee them, and the strategic terms “fluidity,”
                  “circulation,” and “movement” help students approach the revisiting as necessary and
                  deepening rather than repetitive. This strategy has helped me unpack with my students
                  a vitally mobile and contingent arena in which texts embodying this dynamic can be
                  read against those stemming from empire, against each other, and within a network
                  of unstable conditions and circumstances.

               <p>Moreover, broadening the historical horizon from an Atlantic World perspective allows
                  students to view the slave trade, Abolition, and radical politics during the Romantic
                  period as conversant with our contemporary politics. The courageous voices of those
                  enslaved during the Romantic period take on a new legitimacy for my most recent students,
                  compared with the way in which earlier student cohorts had responded to such texts;
                  current students can more readily hear and empathize with the outrage of those from
                  so long ago. This outrage responds to the authority of lived experience. While students
                  understand that the value of <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> singular life made clear in individually voiced accounts was politically important
                  to the Abolitionist cause, the personal and communal resilience such accounts express
                  was necessary then, and comes across all these many years later to be heard in all
                  its dignity. These voices, then, can be further complicated (rather than polarizing
                  them against the claims of colonists and politicians), with the biographies of figures
                  like Baron de Vastey, who Marlene Daut has argued was signal for the development of
                  a “[B]lack Atlantic humanism.” In counterpoint to Toussaint L’Ouverture’s rhetorical
                  promotion of brotherhood across color lines, Vastey, a Haitian of biracial descent
                  and Toussaint’s contemporary, critiques colonial dependencies on slavery. The slave
                  trade and the high morbidity of slave labor, Vastey unceasingly argued, reveals that
                  a free-market economy is merely an ideological justification for the inexcusability
                  of racism.

               <p>Using material like Daut’s to set the triangle trade within cosmopolitan humanism,
                  as well as other globalizing contextual materials (the competition between goods produced
                  in the East Indies and the West Indies, for instance), expands the horizon of how
                  we teach the transatlantic and the Atlantic World, but only if those singular voices
                  are heard as integrated with larger contexts. Accounts of formerly enslaved persons
                  are important for our students because, although mediated for a white audience, they
                  make disclosures about lived experience that novels can only gesture to, especially
                  for those students who resist the empathy necessarily involved in reading actual accounts,
                  and worse, the documentation of abusive planter practices.

                           voice and rhetorical strategy. More recently, Patricia Matthew and Manu Chander’s

                           as a genre in “Abolitionist Interruptions.”</span></div>
                  </div> While I rely on the arguments of Mark Salber Phillips for understanding historical
                  distance through the narrative function, that gut-level pain is also interpretatively
                  useful. To make connections between textual accounts in a way that makes for meaningful
                  interpretation, I have found that starting with an emotionally rather than physically
                  painful event can translate what students may be feeling into something we can discuss
                  and then extend to other connections between the texts that are more politicized,
                  and therefore more rhetorically inflected. For instance, in my recent course offering,
                  I asked students to look at a similar event in Prince’s and Equiano’s narratives,
                  and then to contrast it with Toussaint’s experience. Mary Prince’s account of the
                  end of childhood, when her mistress sends her to work at another house, is charged
                  with the distress of the twelve-year-old girl; but the moment when her mother has
                  to take her and her sisters to the slave market to be sold after the death of her
                  mistress, despite the distance of years at the time of writing, is suffused with emotional
                  pain at confronting this final separation from family and home. Beginning with the
                  day before, she writes: <span class="quote">‘Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,--it is too much.—It recalls the great
                     grief that filled my heart, and the woeful thoughts that passed to and fro through
                     my mind, whilst listening to the pitiful words of my poor mother, weeping for the
                     loss of her children. (Prince, <span style="font-style:italic">History</span> [1831], 3)’</span> In describing the next morning, Prince uses funereal language to depict the emotional
                  death she and her mother feel at this moment: “The black morning at length came .
                  . . whilst she was putting on us the new osnaburgs in we were to be sold, she said,
                  in a sorrowful voice, (I shall never forget it!) ‘See, I am <span style="font-style:italic">shrouding </span>my poor children; what a task for a mother!’” (<span style="font-style:italic">History</span>, 3). This chilling moment, in which the mother has to sell her own children at the
                  slave market, is heart-rending in itself, while Prince’s use of language and word
                  choice feels authentic rather than rhetorically distant (“I shall never forget it!”);
                  the imagery of a funeral rather than a marketplace symbolizes the death of the subject-self
                  that being sold is meant to create. But the exclamations and the never-forgotten emotion
                  reveal, just as surely, that Prince has held onto her subjectivity in a way that students
                  can now see is revealed throughout her narrative; Prince is a strong woman, one who
                  can advocate through her story, and so providing a heroic model of fortitude in the
                  face of extreme suffering.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Equiano has a similar story to tell that usefully compares to Prince’s of the rending
                  of the family. Although his begins with his sister’s and his abduction by African
                  “slavers,” his parents never to be seen again, their strong sibling bond sustains
                  them until the fatal moment when they are broken apart.

                     the alarm . . . But alas! Ere long it was my fate to be thus attached, and to be carried
                     off, when none of the grown people were nigh . . . But alas! we were soon deprived
                     of even the small comfort of weeping together . . . for my sister and I were then
                     separated, while we lay clasped in each other’s arms." (Equiano,<span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> (1789, 62)’</span> Rhetorically, the “But, alas!” repetition has a lot of work to do, but for a modern
                  reader, it can’t carry the weight of the experienced trauma in the way that Prince’s
                  “Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,--it is too much.—” still does. If Equiano’s
                  response to the loss of his sister is different from Prince’s strikes the reader as
                  pathos-filled rather than grief-stricken perhaps—so that students try to locate the
                  difference in experienced pain contextually— I’ve found it helpful to shift their
                  attention to seeing that the way the story is told can change the emotional register,
                  and that the way emotion is being put to use should not influence us to value or devalue
                  one person’s pain over another’s given our historical biases. Critical context thus
                  informs students’ understanding ofthe disruptive force of the Atlantic trade during
                  this period and the valuation of bodies in a marketplace that took no account of pain.

                           to give a certain amount of physical labor value against which all the others could

                  </div> Equiano openly states that his own father owned enslaved people, a repugnant fact
                  for many students; he also explains the practice of African enslavers in terms of
                  kidnapping and domestic servitude, and in opposition to the brutality of the triangle
                  slave trade. This sometimes leads students to dismiss Equiano’s narrative. But by
                  getting students to look for resemblance rather than difference, they can then see
                  that like Prince, Equiano also tries to find a sense of home when he is with kinder
                  people, and yet whereas she finds her real sense of “home” in her own strong sense
                  of self, he continually remakes himself, transforming himself fluidly through the
                  circulations of ship voyages he participates in. He makes himself into an Atlantic
                  identity, so that he’s at home everywhere—on shipboard, in Philadelphia, in London,
                  and so on—whereas we sense that she is never at home except within herself. And his
                  rhetorical style is not just due to the temporal distance between the act of writing
                  and biographical events; Equiano is becalmed as he writes his narrative, stilled by
                  the land he now inhabits and the perhaps unyielding political audience he addresses.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In C.L.R. James’s<span style="font-style:italic">The Black Jacobins</span>, which tells the history of San Domingo and Toussaint L’Ouverture’s extraordinary
               transformation of the colony into a free state by 1803, James refuses the fiction
               of historical objectivity; students immediately respond to his passionate engagement
               with his story and his protagonist, and the book is filled with his exclamatory asides.
               Toussaint suffers none of the rending of family that Prince and Equiano experience,
               and so James’s indignation is focused on the abuses endemic to slavery and those historians
               who had covered it over: “A venal race of scholars, profiteering panders to national
               vanity, have conspired to obscure the truth about abolition” (James 51) he rails.
               By contrast Toussaint “was so genuinely kind to the whites in their distressful condition
               that they could not fail to appreciate it” (157). James cannot but revel in the man’s
               political acuity and gracious use of political speech acts and his tolerance as a
               political leader for all San Domingans; his voice and message are clear in quotations
               from letters and speeches: “Learn, citizens, to appreciate the glory of your new political
               status. In acquiring the rights that the Constitution accords to all Frenchmen, do
               not forget the duties it imposes on you. Be but virtuous and you will be French men
               and good citizens . . . Work together for the prosperity of San Domingo . . . [to]
               assure public well-being” (James 205). I point out to students how this passage, and
               Toussaint’s worry over “the fate of some unhappy whites who have been victims in this
               business’” (157), is in stark contrast to James’s own assessment of white treatment
               of Blacks: “The difficulty was that though one could trap them like animals . . .
               and beat both [man and animal] with the same stick . . . they remained, despite their
               black skins and curly hair, quite invincibly human beings” (11).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To situate James’s passionate history I ask students to read Sylvia Wynter’s article
                  on C.L.R. James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,” which clarifies
                  her own theoretical adaptation of James’s Afro-Caribbean based theory of capitalism
                  as a colonial-based economy rather than trade-based, one requiring enslaved labor
                  rather than wage labor. The bourgeoise development of capitalism that overthrew a
                  monarchy-based economy depended on the development of a colonial scheme based on unpaid
                  labor from colonists, indentured servants, and enslaved persons. The monarchial symbolics
                  of blood (blood lineage, vassalage, war), as Wynter explains, was replaced by a symbolics
                  of skin color, the effects of which still reverberate today. Wynter posits the human
                  condition of “becoming [B]lack” to explain the way that discourse co-produces social
                  experience along with colonial capitalism for anyone who, we could say, has not undergone
                  “becoming white.”

            <p>For students then, first-hand accounts put the entire phenomenon of the slave trade
               into perspective, and for some students of color, especially those who are African,
               African American, or Caribbean American, first-hand accounts can be empowering while
               second-hand accounts like James’s can reinforce that self-empowerment. These first-hand
               narratives give students a sense of what self-determining voices like Prince’s, Equiano’s,
               and Toussaint’s sounded like. The inner strength and the courage to simply live a
               life, or to trade up one’s own life-value, or to liberate a people, come through in
               these narratives. Romantic literature gains a special meaning for these students,
               one that speaks to them in today’s contexts; it can also give them a history of strength,
               endurance and courage. Texts from the more recent past such as James’s, and from today’s
               headlines or popular genres add resonance to making personal connections with such
               a history. Identifying with texts from a different time and culture has resulted in
               multiple research papers at the end of the semester on Equiano, women’s slave testimonials,
               and on a comparative treatment of women’s escape narratives in the period. Recently
               a student has also used information from short lectures I gave on the slavery and
               human trafficking practices in theperiod on the Barbary Coast and in the Ottoman Empire
               to develop a paper on Equiano that sets him in a wider context of slaver practices
               historically and within the period. </p>

               <p>In using an Atlanticist lens to teach this material, I try to return our focus to
                  the networks of colonialism wherever this makes sense because more was at stake in
                  the triangle slave trade than the economy of bodies. The forward trajectory of the
                  larger stakes surely begins with the population decimation of northwestern Africa
                  and the overpopulation of the West Indies, but they include the monoculture practices
                  of Caribbean plantations (and continuing today with Caribbean banana plantations,
                  for instance), which—concurrently with the rise in western national gross products—also
                  changed the natural resource structure of Caribbean terrain. Through increased commerce
                  in peoples, animals, plants, and goods, the slave trade also grossly heightened the
                  effects and pace of anthropocenic change, giving students a sense of how disastrous
                  history can affect worlds as well as peoples.

                  specifically the chronotope of the ship.

                  </div> That the ship should also be understood literally through viewing the virtual slave
                  ship on the SlaveVoyages.org website gives the metaphor powerful resonance in its
                  suggestion of mobility and flexible use. To image fluidity, movement (a term encompassing
                  more than human mobility and displacement), and circulation, of the Atlantic world,
                  the metaphor of the Atlantic-ranging ship is perhaps unsurpassed. Whereas both fluidity
                  and circulation take into account the stagnation of being becalmed, Equiano’s autobiography
                  underscores how thriving amongst aquatic conditions requires understanding oneself,
                  or at least one’s life, in terms of the vessel that sails such waters. Living in and
                  on the Atlantic waterways requires at the very least an abiding interest in shipping
                  news and port landings; in order to flourish, however, of more value would be a working
                  knowledge of the vessel, and indeed the classificatory terminology used for distinguishing
                  vessels and their component parts. These, as Equiano’s life story reflects, was key
                  not just to ship life but to life itself: ship life <span style="font-style:italic">was</span>, in a sense, Atlantic life. And, learning to navigate—as Equiano does—requires a
                  more flexible thinking, one based on a triangulating impulse that can reconcile oppositions
                  through adjacencies and affiliations.</p>

            <p>Triangulation—not just the juxtaposition of three terms but the fluid and dynamic
               movement between them—is key, I would argue, to teaching Romanticism in terms of Atlantic
               movement, whether we are working with the binaries of the Anglo-American transatlantic
               or with the multiple triangulations of the Caribbean islands and Atlantic littoral
               which are always in play or potentially so. Putting the Atlanticship metaphor and
               triangulation together, we might consider what the triangle slave trade has culturally
               produced as our heritage, the disturbed flow of water and lives that Christina Sharpe
               argues in <span style="font-style:italic">In the Wake: On Blackness and Being</span> is demonstrably ongoing. The “wake” figures a disruptive dimension in the lives of
               African Americans that began with a cut across what had been, the ship cutting across
               the ocean’s own waves as it cuts into lives, cuts off lives, and changes human relations
               in monstrous ways. In this sense, the United States is in relation not only to Britain
               and the West African coast, but in relation to the ocean and its human footprint on
               land, an ongoing relation of turmoil, . the Understanding the western impact on the
               West Indies during this period gives students a way to place Romanticism within their
               twenty-first century perspective, not only as a chapter in the difficult history of
               enslavement but also as part of an aspirational identity, of a heroism born of struggle
               that is evidenced in the narratives of formerly enslaved persons where singular voices,
               accounts of uprisings and attempted uprisings, and the hopes and aspirations that
               fueled Abolition and Emancipation can be found.</p>
            <p>To think Atlantically allows me to pose one regulative idea—that of the world as a
               centered experience that affirms the uniqueness of the white enfranchised self that
               is supported by peripheral others and contrast it to the disenfranchised (the world,
               in other words, of thecolonial economic system)—against another regulative idea of
               the Atlantic of a fluid world of multiple and mobile players. It allows me to keep
               my students focused on the dynamic, fluid relation between center and periphery, larger
               and local contexts, and what is counted (money, bodies, trade items) and what does
               not count (lives). These are also the problems of sovereignty, and what in years past
               Romantic studies mainly focused on; they have only been transformed, but not displaced,
               in the slave trade economy and are the problems that Equiano marshals so well for
               his tale of self-recovery, innovation, and reinvention. </p>

                  and San Domingan experience in a deeply involved perspective that includes the newly
                  independent U.S. Thus Equiano’s, Prince’s and Toussaint’s achievements (self-improvement,
                  self-liberation, and the liberation of a people) participate in the very conditions
                  that fueled the French Revolution (financed by France’s slave-trade enriched bourgeoisie)
                  and the English Abolition movement (which, as C.L.R. James argues, was encouraged
                  by William Pitt as Prime Minister to deflect other political tensions [<span style="font-style:italic">Black Jacobins</span>, pp. 53-54]). But triangulation requires positioning and revisiting: following Prince’s
                  story with Equiano’s is achronological, but his rhetorically sophisticated style,
                  because it distances and softens raw experience, allows for a more appreciative revisiting
                  of Prince’s rhetorical moves. The clear parallels between Prince’s story of British
                  colonial enslavement and Toussaint’s political speechmaking as he liberates both his
                  fellow slaves and his island from colonial legal, economic, and political control
                  enable students to bring together the three texts through both formal and experiential
                  commonalities and differences.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To balance the first-hand narrative unit on Prince, Equiano and the Haitian Revolution,
               I designed a second unit focusing on women’s experience in fictional texts. Beginning
               with the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Woman of Colour, A Tale</span> (1808), the students then read a novel that also creates comparisons between women
               whose wealth makes them decadent and women who regard morality as more valuable, Austen’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> (1814). In each case the heroine’s transplantation into a different family depends
               on a reliance on the wealth generated by exploiting legal and capitalist networks
               that masked over the horrors of enslavement. Olivia Fairfield is the daughter of a
               Jamaican plantation owner and the majestic Marcia, a gifted but enslaved African woman;
               the conditions of Mr. Fairfield’s will are that Olivia is to be married into, or become
               the dependent of, her relations, the English Merton family. Fanny Price is adopted
               into her uncle Bertram’s family as a charity case, and in this sense Olivia and Fanny
               have opposed relations to plantation wealth, but in a chiasmic relation to each other
               which students can appreciate: the biracial heroine brings wealth with her, the white
               heroine brings only her poverty. Sir Thomas makes his wealth from his own Antiguan
               plantations though the family, like Olivia’s Merton relations, is resident in England.
               In both novels the women of these families display the decadent lifestyles and egocentrism
               created by West Indian caste divisions, and so stand in for what Olivia calls “the
               most die-away lady on the whole island of Jamaica” (Anon. 73). Both Olivia and Fanny
               take the role of outside observer, Olivia through her Jamaican birth and biracial
               identity, and Fanny through her parents’ downward social mobility. Both are treated
               by their adoptive families as different in appearance (Olivia is beautiful and biracial,
               Fanny is small and plain) and in kind (Olivia’s Black mother; Fanny’s disreputable
               father). And both make observations that explicitly (Olivia) or implicitly (Fanny)
               compare the women of their adoptive families to the “decadent” behavior of West Indian
               women.</p>
            <p>However, in both novels the authorial insistence on a moral tale to be made of plot
               and characters enables the Caribbean plantation system itself to be glossed over.
               In<span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> this gloss is effected through Olivia’s fond remembrances of life on her father’s
               plantation, her frequent remarks concerning her firm connection to her enslaved brethren
               and her fond descriptions of her maid Dido, whose race and pidgin English make clear
               her enslaved status. In <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, the masking is provided by Fanny’s translation of her uncle’s business concerns
               into a paternal treatment of his enslaved workers stemming from his moral rectitude.
               When triangulated with Leonora Sansay’s short novel <span style="font-style:italic">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo </span>(also 1808), this covering over is unmasked. The white American narrator Mary, visiting
               with her sister Clara in 1803, makes frequent criticisms of the behavior and regulation
               of different castes of women, from “coloured women” in general contrast to “white
               women,” to distinctions between “Mulatto” women (light-skinned biracial women), Creoles
               (white women born in St. Domingue, soon to be Haiti), French women (immigrants and
               visitors from France), and outsiders like Mary. Not only are women of Domingue castes
               regulated by sartorial distinctions, but “here every female virtue is blasted in the
               bud by the contagious influence of example” (Sansay 96).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Sansay presents it, the very Caribbean air taints moral choice since sexual attraction
                  alone determines women’s (limited) agency, so that “the mulatto women are the hated
                  but successful rivals of the Creole ladies,” for they not only appear to be sexier
                  but are also often wealthy: “before the revolution their splendor, their elegance,
                  their influence over the men, and the fortunes lavished on them by their infatuated
                  lovers, so powerfully excited the jealousy of the white ladies, that they complained
                  to the council of the ruin their [“mulatto” women’s] extravagance occasioned to many
                  [white] families, and a decree was issued imposing restrictions on their dress” (Sansay
                  95).

                  </div> Contrasted with the decadence of sexually explicit behavior is the novel’s real focus
                  on political revolution; Toussaint’s post-revolutionary reign is looked forward to
                  as utopian in comparison to the invading French forces, there to support the white
                  plantation owners. The armed forces’ destructive violence is mirrored in acts of male
                  sexual aggression, exemplified in the rape of Mary’s sister Clara by her abusive husband,
                  St. Louis.

                  into sexual aggression, the politics of race, and the loss of any moral compass when
                  wealth depends on the unacknowledged suffering of enslaved laborers.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To provide a real-life component to this fictional unit that ties it back to the real
               life narratives of Prince, Equiano and Toussaint, I include here the first chapter
               of Sharpe’s<span style="font-style:italic">In the Wake</span>.Sharpe’s meditations on, and theorization of, the historical effects of colonial
               schemes of skin color symbolism that Wynter analyzes yoke thedevelopment of colonial
               economies based on unpaid and enslaved labor. Sharpe’s reflections on her own and
               her family’s experience of the colonial symbolics of skin color (registered in Sansay’s
               delineation of the higher levels of St. Domingue’s caste system) illustrate so clearly
               how the colonial economy continues to mark the daily life of African Americans now.
               In the wake of the triangle slave trade, “the past that is not past reappears, always,
               to rupture the present” (Sharpe 9). Sharpe’s narrative, with its rhetorical insistence
               on the past’s ongoing harm, does more to make the connections between fiction and
               real-life narratives than news reports alone can do. As Sharpe notes, “Transatlantic
               slavery was and is the disaster” (5). Adding Sharpe’s critical reflections intermixed
               with personal narrative has the advantage of pulling the narrative and fictional units
               together because it enables further conversation about the economic and emotional
               risks of living in, and in the wake of, the triangle slave trade. This relates to
               Wynter’s analysis, which allows a conversation about colonial economies as a discourse
               concerning one’s relative worth. The question of personal versus fictionalized experience
               becomes a way to avoid simply comparing different encounters of slave and colonial
               life, racial prejudice, and degrees of gender violence; instead this comparison allows
               readers to triangulate and thus revisit/revise these three elements of the slave trade
               that the two units raise, allowing additional questions, such as one of inclusion/exclusion:
               who is an insider, we could ask, and who is excluded in the system of colonial economy?
               Prince, Equiano and Olivia present different kinds of outsider status, for instance.
               Moreover, female characters’ treatment at the hands of (usually white) men provides
               a quite different way to think about movement as well as of the stormy violence of
               the colonial economy, and requires thinking harder about the movement through the
               color caste system in both British and French colonial and post-colonial life.</p>

               <p>Regardless of the texts selected to teach students how to see the experience of enslaved
                  persons as belonging to lives that mattered, what has made the most difference in
                  teaching this topic has been to find ways to make historical texts relevant.In order
                  to move beyond that framework, I have begun working with current events and Afrofuturism.
                  A useful supplemental text for exploring Afrofuturism is an essay by the award-winning
                  novelist N.K. Jemisin, “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” which provides a quick
                  introduction to the main ideas of Afrofuturism.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                           (15)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This is also the title of a collection of short stories by Jemisin, who is best known
                           for her three-times Hugo-award winning Broken Earth trilogy.</span></div>
                  </div> Beginning with Octavia Butler (who coined the term Afrofuturism), science fiction
                  has been the main genre for Afrofuturist literature and film; these are texts that
                  recast enslavers and colonists through the sci-fi tradition of encounter narratives.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">

                           in the Moon (1901) established the tradition. Andre Norton’s 1960s series and Arthur
                           C. Clarke’s “Time Odyssey” series are well-known first encounter narratives.</span></div>
                  </div> An easily referenced text for teaching is the 2018 film <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther, </span>in which the imbrication of past, present and future is clearly dramatized. In the
                  film, the villain (Klaue) is depicted as an archetypal white adventurer despoiling
                  African resources, but rather than European he is clearly meant to suggest a heritage
                  from the two Boer states of colonial Africa, with their brutal treatment of those
                  inhabiting what is now South Africa. Black Panther’s (T’Challa) defeat of this despoiler
                  revises the historical first encounter with white enslavers; instead we have a failed
                  encounter that strengthens the progressive futurism of the Wakanda nation. This is
                  not the best example, however, since Klaue should have been colonized by the Wakandan
                  citizens, so asking students why Klaue’s death at the hands of T’Challa is a departure
                  from AfroFuturism helps them see how easy it is to accept more pasteurized versions
                  of Black narratives.</p>
            </div>
            <p>“First encounter” narratives, made standard through works such as H.G. Wells’s <span style="font-style:italic">The War of the Worlds</span>, merge with “second encounter” narratives so that the slave trade and colonial past
               is the pattern through which alien encounter is perceived, with the alien becoming
               the colonized victim of such thinking, and yet like the historical enslaved person,
               a victim who bears gifts (to historical enslaved people’s cultural and ideological
               gifts, these imagined aliens add technological and politically liberating gifts).
               Contrasting this model with the plot of <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> allowed my students to view Equiano’s representation of slavery, kind masters, and
               British political elites as pasteurized rather than simply self-serving (as students
               often read his narrative). Most importantly, connecting the texts they are studying
               with the regulative idea of Afrofuturism—that sovereign nations need the induction
               of alien life in order to become even more democratic, free, and at peace—allows students
               to consider the problem of both individual sovereignty and national sovereignty as
               the product of fluidity and movement. It is not a given, it can be taken away, and
               it must always be put into conversation with the interrelatedness of ocean and land.</p>
            <p>In revisiting Equiano’s narrative after the<span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> exercise, I focused class discussion on the plan for a free Black state in Sierra
               Leone that Equiano participates in near the very end of his narrative; my students
               were able to rethink the potential of such a scheme while also understanding it as
               a charity scheme rather than a utopian one (it is planned by “some philanthropic individuals,”
               [<span style="font-style:italic">Equiano, </span>242]). Pitting this scheme, devised by white politicians, against the utopian nation
               of Wakanda also helps us see why Equiano would have been so wary of the project: it
               lacks Wakanda’s self-determination arising from individual participation <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the necessary funding and resources (individual sovereignty <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> national sovereignty). Through the contextualizing lens of AfroFuturism, my students
               came to the recognition that any settlement, however utopian, displaces those who
               already inhabit the land, disturbing the eco-balance of lives lived for both the established
               inhabitants and for the newcomers. In other words, the past can’t be undone by charity
               and welfare schemes; the hard work has to be done here in this place, as both the
               Abolitionist materials and the lesson of Wakanda’s self-determination make clear.
               A useful discussion point is already provided here in thinking about our own future
               regarding territorialization practices versus Atlantic fluidity, the circulation and
               triangulations of persons and things versus the requirement for self-determination
               and lives well lived.</p>
            <p>Just as the slave trade fueled white liberationist politics in both Britain’s American
               colonies and Revolutionary France, so too has it grounded and set the stage for the
               more expansive empire through an increasingly laissez-faire liberally sanctioned world
               economy. Students begin to see the relation between things as they are and the horrifying,
               daily violence of the exchange in enslaved persons as mercantile objects, lives that
               simply did not matter. The necessity of teaching about the slave trade and the experience
               of enslavement alongside the heroized narratives of Abolitionist political labor,
               can be empowering in that it allows for the possibility of thinking about the future
               otherwise than in a traumatic and posthuman way. Certainly, we must ask what will
               prevail in the Atlantic world when environmental damage extols too much from the human
               habitations of the Caribbean? Or when the coastal cities and other human developments
               in the circum-Atlantic are submerged or simply destroyed? But a sense of play, of
               fluid thinking and boundaries allowsspace for students to imagine a different world-making
               from the one we have known and that currently goes on without our much noticing. It
               allows for thinking about different kinds of heroism, different ways of achieving
               self-determination against the apparently unstoppable weight of globalism. It allows
               for considering the ship in a stormy sea: fluidity and flexibility are the necessary
               survival skills, but they must be combined with a persistence to endure, a Mary Prince-like
               self-heroism, and a Toussaint-like tolerance. It seems to me that Atlanticism is poised
               to locate such an imagination, if we allow its triangulatory effects room to do this
               kind of work. </p>
