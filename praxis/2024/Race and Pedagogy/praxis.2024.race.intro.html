                  with an interdisciplinary group of scholars “attentive to the intersections and tensions

               <p>The 2018 pedagogy roundtable, held at Mount Holyoke College<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> built on these shared experiences and emerged from the community that these previous
                  discussions had created. Our group’s decision to organize the event stemmed from a
                  series of informal questions we had for each other during a seminar meeting in Amherst
                  in January 2016, and later, from more formal questions that followed the seminar’s
                  engagement with Brazilian scholar Paolo Freire's <span style="font-style:italic">Pedagogy of the Oppresed</span> (1970, 2004) as we began to think more closely about pedagogy. In that winter meeting,
                  we reflected on how national events in the previous eighteen months had impacted our
                  classrooms. As Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor describes that period of time: “Over the course
                  of ten months, spanning from the summer and fall of 2014 into the winter and spring
                  of 2015, the United States was rocked by mass protests, led by African Americans in
                  response to the police murder of a young Black man, Michael Brown. In the summer heat
                  of August, the people of Ferguson, Missouri, rose up and brought the world’s attention
                  to the crisis of racist policing practices in the United States” (2). A year after
                  the protests in Ferguson, in the fall of 2015, a series of student protests at the
                  University of Missouri, including a “Racism Lives Here rally,” spurred on a wave of
                  protests designed to open a dialogue about racism on university campuses across the
                  country, including our own.

                  in solidarity with students at Missouri and Yale spontaneously evolved into the “Amherst
                  Uprising,” a multi-day occupation of the college library. Several months of critical
                  dialogue within the Amherst College community, regarding the ways in which anti-Black
                  racism impacted student life on campus, followed.

            <p>In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and the violence that prompted it,
               it was clear that the words “freedom” and “abolition,” so often found on the syllabi
               of classes on Romantic literature, were now resounding in universities with new connotations.
               Students walking straight from campus protests to our classes encountered anti-slavery
               texts on the syllabi of our surveys on Romantic literature with a new interest in
               exploring the relationship between the moment these texts were written and the moment
               in which we were reading them. In a class on John Newton’s poem “Amazing Grace” that
               happened to be planned for the week following the Amherst Uprising, for instance,
               the atmosphere was understandably charged, since President Obama had only recently
               sung the hymn at Clementa Pinckney’s funeral, after he and eight members of the congregation
               at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church were murdered by a white supremacist
               in June 2015. After watching a video of his rendition of the hymn, students debated
               what different lines in the poem might mean. Several students questioned Obama’s decision
               to sing the hymn after learning about how Newton, the author of the poem that became
               the hymn, had profited from the trade of enslaved persons before his conversion to
               Christianity. During this conversation, students became more and more intrigued by
               how context conjugates the polyvalence of words. One student insisted on the importance
               of the hymn to her and to her family in moments where tragedy had touched their lives,
               and taught the class about the importance of the hymn in the Baptist Church. As the
               class learned about the way that Obama was building on Martin Luther King’s engagement
               with the hymn during the Civil Rights movement, the debate about what the history
               of this poem might do to its meaning in the present, and <span style="font-style:italic">vice versa</span>, intensified.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Conversations in our classrooms that semester awakened a variety of emotions in students
                  that we had not encountered as professors who had taught this material before. Or,
                  at least, many affective responses to texts were on display in classrooms that semester,
                  in a way that they hadn’t been before. In another class that centered on the sentimental
                  tradition in abolitionist verse, students intuited for themselves Alan Richardson’s
                  argument that “read less as literature than as political discourse or social commentary,
                  the anti-slavery poems of the era still fail to move beyond vapid sentiment, stock
                  description, stereotyped characters and situation.”

                  they had shown in ventriloquizing the suffering of enslaved people, and others questioned
                  the ethics of continuing to anthologize these poems. At other moments, professors
                  became the targets of another kind of anger, motivated by a defensive form of white
                  supremacy: one colleague in our seminar spoke about a student who had violently objected
                  to “being made” to read <span style="font-style:italic">The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano</span>, which detonated many of the varied feelings of the pain that racism in the classroom

                  </div> As these conversations continued, students and teachers alike became increasingly

               <p>Our decision to think about how to teach anti-slavery literature within the broader
                  purview of Romantic studies arose due to an organic synergy between the discussion
                  of the Black Lives Matter movement and the discussions happening in our classrooms.
                  Yet there are also structural reasons why the atmosphere in our classrooms was particularly
                  charged in moments when we were discussing this particular body of texts. As Eric
                  Williams revealed drawing on Marx, the system of Atlantic Slavery incubated Capitalism
                  in generating surplus value from the labor of enslaved persons while European expansionism
                  unfolded, and, like colonialism, is constitutive of the experience of modernity itself.
                  Williams’ argument has been revisited by Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo
                  alongside other historians, sociologists, and economists.

                  </div> Zakiyyah Iman Jackson writes, “Slavery and colonialism not only catalyzed the conscription
                  of black people into hegemonically imperialist and racialized conceptions of ‘modernity’
                  and ‘universal humanity’ but also inaugurated Western modernity’s condition of possibility”
                  (45). Simon Gikandi (who visited our <span style="font-style:italic">Five College Global Cultures </span>seminar in 2017) similarly argues, “The modern spirit seemed unable to incorporate
                  the difference that it nevertheless needed to imagine its modernity, and hence authorized
                  itself by inventing a hierarchical structure in which the whiteness of Europe would
                  be refracted by the shadows cast by others” (10). Avery Gordon suggests that this
                  heightens the urgency for action: “Slavery has ended, but something of it continues
                  to live on in the social geography of where peoples reside... in the veins of the
                  contradictory formation we call New World modernity, propelling, as it always has,
                  a something to be done” (139). A new generation of abolitionist scholars also remind
                  us that the symbolic afterlives of Atlantic Slavery must also be considered alongside
                  political economy and other systems of forced labor, neoslavery, and exploitation
                  that persist within the current permutation of capitalism.

               <p>We are keenly aware that our desire to make a record of a conversation at a particular
                  moment in time is in tension with the way in which this conversation continues to
                  evolve in real time as national and global events unfold. Since we held our panel
                  in 2018—and even since the authors sent the revised versions of their essays in early
                  2020 to the respondents—the stakes of the conversation about the relationship between
                  the Romantic period and the current moment continue to be amplified. The resurgence

                  as well as the violent and militarized responses to them we witnessed, provided a

                  2021. As Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, who founded the Black Lives
                  Matter Movement in 2013, describe the movement, “We are committed to working for a
                  world where Black lives are no longer systematically targeted for demise,” and “we
                  affirm our humanity, our contributions to society, and our resilience in the face

                  </div> For those who teach Romantic literature, it is necessary to continue to question not
                  only how the era we teach contributed to a system in which Black lives became “targeted
                  for demise,” but also to confront the question of how syllabi, classroom discussions
                  and other spaces of pedagogical inquiry might better affirm the humanity, contributions
                  and resilience of Black and Brown people, both in the nineteenth century and today.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. From roundtable to special issue</span></h2>
               <p>Returning to 2016: as we examined events on local campuses with each other, we wondered
                  what colleagues in other colleges and universities had been experiencing during this
                  time of mourning and redress. Mindful of the inherent limitations in our positionalities,
                  we sought to engage the collective wisdom of other colleages in a more formal and
                  generative dialogue that would create different possibilities for the classrom. In
                  dialogue with Kate Singer and Lily Gurton-Wachter, co-organizers of the seminar, we
                  resolved to bring together four scholars of race and literature—Frances Botkin, Kimberly
                  Juanita Brown, Sean Gordon, and Patricia A. Matthew—to create a safe and respectful
                  space in which faculty and graduate student instructors could engage in dialogue with
                  each other about how they were currently teaching anti-slavery texts from the Romantic
                  period, and how we might imagine teaching them in the future. Two of our speakers
                  were local, and two travelled from different East-Coast locations to be with us. The
                  roundtable was transatlantic in scope, with scholars representing Caribbean, American
                  and British literatures. In our invitation, we simply asked our colleagues to “speak
                  about approaches to teaching eighteenth or nineteenth-century anti-slavery literature
                  in the context of the Black Lives Matter Movement.” We asked them to share some moments
                  from their own recent experiences in the classroom, and their subsequent reflections
                  on them. We stressed that the emphasis would be on conversation with the audience,
                  whom we imagined would also find it useful to have a space to share their reflections
                  on classroom experience.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>An unusually large audience was in attendance at the pedagogy panel in Spring 2018:
                     it was clear that this subject was of interest to students at both the graduate and
                     undergraduate level, as well as to faculty members who more usually made up the audience
                     of the <span style="font-style:italic">Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century </span>seminar.

                              day meant that we decided to cancel it in solidarity, meaning that it had to be delayed
                              until all the speakers could reconvene, in 2018. Yet the topic only felt more urgent
                              by that time.</span></div>
                     </div> Several different pedagogical approaches were offered, but the panelists all shared
                     a desire to confront the violence contained in these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                     texts and the silences of the past and to share epistemologies of social justice,
                     speaking to the present with the future in mind. Though the speakers approached the
                     task of teaching different anti-slavery texts with different methodologies, they each
                     gave us an insight into classrooms where students are frequently invited to think
                     about how to connect the past with the present moment. As our panelists discussed
                     a range of approaches to teaching anti-slavery texts, the question of affect was clearly
                     a central concern, as it had been in the discussion that led to the event. Students
                     often have questions about the violence that these texts present them with, and in
                     turn, teachers themselves had many questions for each other about how to frame that
                     act of presentation. How do we support students through challenging readings, beyond
                     giving content warnings or making the readings optional? How does one manage the affect—the
                     emotions and feelings—that such triggering material is bound to bring into the room?
                     How can we make space for conversation in the classroom about how different students
                     might encounter anti-slavery literatures, because of the varied experiences they bring
                     to these texts?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Several important questions about what it means to teach anti-slavery literature in
                  the context of courses on Romanticism also emerged that day. We recall that Kimberly
                  Juanita Brown played music over her own speech as she discussed the power of African
                  American spirituals to invite students to connect to the “auditory dimensions” of
                  the archive, a concept she also explores in her book, <span style="font-style:italic">The Repeating Body: Slavery’s Visual Resonance in the Contemporary </span>(140); and indeed, many of our panelists asked us to attune their ears to listen for
                  multilayered channels of communication in anti-slavery texts. A central theme in our
                  discussion was the question of how to bring to light the things that the texts do
                  not say about the realities of slavery in the period, either because of the blindspots
                  of the authors, or because of the constraints placed upon them. As Saidiya Hartman
                  asks, where the archive is lacking, how can we “retrieve what remains dormant…without
                  committing further acts of violence” in our own acts of narration (2)?</p>
               <p>The essays that follow record various answers to these collective questions. Three
                  of the original speakers at the panel (Frances Botkin, Sean Gordon and Patricia A.
                  Matthew) have contributed essays to this collection. Although Kimberly Juanita Brown
                  was not able to engage in this iteration of the conversation, the impact of her contributions
                  to the panel in a talk on nonetheless remain. We are also pleased that the final collection
                  contains essays by participants who were at different stages in their university careers
                  at the time of the event: Sean Gordon was a graduate student at UMass Amherst at the
                  time of his original contribution to the panel, and Nick Blaisdell, now an high-school
                  teacher, adjunct professor, and activist, was an undergraduate when he attended our
                  seminar. As the project continued, we also decided to gesture towards the shared frame
                  of reference in the room that the <span style="font-style:italic">Global Cultures</span> seminar had produced, by inviting other participants to join the conversation about
                  pedagogy via the medium of print. Ivan Ortiz and Elizabeth Fay, who had spoken in
                  our series, graciously accepted our invitation. We are also grateful to Debbie Lee
                  and Alan Richardson for agreeing to offer responses to the collection. Eighteen years
                  after they worked together on the pioneering anthology <span style="font-style:italic">Early Black British Writing </span>(2003), Lee and Richardson not only offer a retrospective view of the shared insights
                  of this collection, but also of the changes that have occurred in the field since
                  2003.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The genre of writing we asked contributors to engage in as their arguments took shape—something
                     between argumentative prose, critical history, personal narrative, and a practical
                     guide—is one that we are rarely asked to engage in as academics, and we thank the
                     editors of the <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles Pedagogies</span> for the room they have made within the field for this kind of reflection. Following
                     the work of exemplary scholars and educators such as Paolo Freire, Stuart Hall, bell
                     hooks, and Edward Said, we are humbled by the task of approaching alongside our contributors
                     the question of how our teaching and scholarship can contribute to the advancement
                     of restorative justice in a global community where division and injustice towards
                     those structurally submitted to exclusionary regimes is increasing due to the fallout
                     from Covid 19, economic agendas that put profit over people, climate change, and geopolitical
                     conflict around the globe. As Hall sagely anticipated in his seminal “Teaching Race”
                     (1980): <span class="quote">‘The really crucial question is how do you begin to make that move away from the level
                        of prejudice and belief? One needs to undermine the obvious. One has to show that
                        these are social and historical processes and that they are not written in the stars,
                        they are not handed down. They are deep conditions which are not going to change if
                        we start tinkering around with them. We must not give our students that kind of illusion.
                        We can however begin the process of questioning what the structures are and how they
                        work. (127)’</span> This collection enters into the spirit of “beginning the process of questioning” with
                     the awareness that there are many more questions to be asked than can be answered
                     in one special issue, and the hopes that new work by colleagues and students will
                     continue to urgently ask them. Because it has arisen out of a call for colleagues
                     within a particular geographically-defined network to describe to us what they were
                     already teaching, rather than from an open call for work about the future of our field
                     at large, we cannot make claims for coverage. We regret that no essays address Romantic
                     anti-slavery literatures from Latin America, Brazil, Africa, Asia, or Australia, or
                     work with Indigenous literatures, translation or multilingualism. We also regret that
                     there is no essay here that addresses in detail the question of how to teach the Haitian
                     Revolution, which is clearly foundational in the study of anti-slavery in the Romantic
                     period. As Nick Nessbit writes in his new work drawing on Marx, it brings labor to
                     the forefront and its connection to Hegelian historical realization.

                     exercise, and the unanswered questions that the collection prompts, become springboards
                     for further inquiry. As the discourse of anti-racist approaches to teaching literature
                     of the Romantic period continues to broaden, we hope this collection—a record of one
                     localized conversation—will be a prompt to further discussion.</p>

               <p>Before we begin to describe in detail the interventions that the contributors to this
                  collection make, a brief review of the texts available for teaching the topic of anti-slavery
                  literature, as well as the history of its anthologization, may be useful to those
                  planning to embark on teaching it for the first time, as well as to those wishing
                  to think further about the relationship between how developments in research relate
                  to those in their own pedagogy. Indeed, a commitment to the continued and critical
                  self-examination of genealogies of primary and secondary texts about anti-slavery
                  literature is one that the current moment necessitates. Scholars have long been engaged
                  in the struggle to bring this material into classrooms. Thus, for example, Eva B.
                  Dykes, whose work, as Bakary Diaby has pointed out, should be reasessed, was the earliest
                  critic to call for an expansion of the Romantic canon to include anti-slavery writings
                  (Diaby “Black Women”). Her groundbreaking <span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought: Or a Study of Sympathy for the Oppressed </span>(1942), written in the midst of the Harlem Renaissance and also at the height of Jim
                  Crow segregation in the United States, drew attention to names such as Olaudah Equiano,
                  Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Mary Prince, not yet present in any anthologies
                  of Romantic-era literature. The reassessment of Dyke’s work seems particularly necessary
                  when one notes that a forty-year silence passed between her study in 1942 and 1985,
                  when Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates Jr. published their pivotal anthology
                  <span style="font-style:italic">The Slave’s Narrative </span>(1985), which printed excerpts from Equiano, Cugoano, Sancho and James Alberst Ukawsaw

Debbie Lee and Alan Richardson, and <span style="font-style:italic">Transatlantic Romanticism</span> (2006), eds. Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and Chris Koenig-Woodward, also made anti-slavery
                     texts more accessible than they had previously been. The republication of various
                     novels that pertain to this topic has also changed students’ classroom experiences
                     (for instance, many of our colleagues now use the Broadview edition of the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> (2008), ed Lyndon J. Dominique). Since it is not possible to anthologize novels in
                     the same way as other texts, A.A. Markley’s overview of lesser-taught novels and plays
                     is a useful resource for those wishing to teach novels that deal with the topic of
                     slavery.

                     in this period, we note that our respondents, Debbie Lee and Alan Richardson, not
                     only played key scholarly roles in producing anthologies of these literatures, but
                     also helped to define the critical conversation over the past two decades. Alan Richardson's
                     seminal “Romantic Voodoo: Obeah and British Culture, 1797-1807” (1993) opened the
                     field to Afro-British intertexts in the archive, those within textuality and beyond.
                     Debbie Lee’s <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery and the Romantic Imagination</span> (2002) is a fundamental text in any survey of this corpus. When considering developments
                     in the field, it is also important to note that, more recently, the “Bigger Six Collective”
                     has been formed in order to resist the narrative that, as they put it, “diversification”
                     or “going global” has done enough to change the field: instead, they have called for
                     the need “to make our field in the image of those whose access to Romanticism has
                     long been and continues to be actively restricted.”

                     the biases of twentieth-century criticism and editing of Romantic texts, the topic

                     in surveys of the period, are being asked to carry a heavy freight. Many and varied
                     obstacles have been put in the way of affirming the contributions of Black and Brown
                     writers from the period in the classroom. The presence of Mary Seacole and Ulawsaw
                     Gronniosaw in anthologies of Black British writers (for instance), does not guarantee
                     them a place on syllabi; neither do the names of African-American writers such as
                     Jupiter Hammon or John Marrant, or Plácido and Juan Manzano from the Hispanophone
                     Atlantic, appear very often on syllabi. In “Abolitionist Interruptions,” Patricia
                     Matthew and Manu Samriti Chander note their “shared frustration with how Olaudah Equiano
                     and his <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> have served too long as the single abolitionist/anti-slavery text in Romanticism”
                     (Chander and Matthew, 431); a discussion Matthew extends in her essay below. The tradition
                     that has elided subjects who historically were denied ontological value, and who were
                     silenced through enslavement and racism in the economic and geopolitical system that
                     was Atlantic Slavery, can still be observed today in this disconnect between research

               <h2><span class="head">IV. Contrapuntal Reading</span></h2>
               <p>Beyond simply adding texts to established syllabi, then, the contributors in this
                  collection imagine many different ways to center the question of how to disrupt pedagogical
                  traditions that have been handed down from past generations of scholars.These scholars
                  invite readers to examine the degree to which their own pedagogy reflects transformations
                  in the field, even as they push for further re-examination of the structures that
                  pedagogical attitudes to teaching anti-slavery have previously been built on. Our
                  contributors tend to agree that because Romantic era accounts of slavery were conditioned
                  by the period in which they were written, it’s “not enough,” as Frances Botkin puts
                  it, to ask them to speak on behalf of the enslaved without other sources to contextualize
                  them. Dykes poignantly draws attention to this paradox at the center of Romantic anti-slavery
                  literature in the opening pages of her text. “One of the salient features of the ‘Romantic
                  Movement’ of the latter eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was the love of
                  freedom” (1), she writes, paying tribute to Mary Prince’s famous line, “To be free
                  is very sweet” (27). However, she then immediately notes that Romantic writers could
                  also be “limited… by an adherence to traditional forms and conventions” (1), and notes
                  that anti-slavery writings did not always depose the hierarchical structure and racism
                  that authorized the triangular trade in the first place. Many scholars since Dykes
                  have complicated any simple celebration of the expansion of the Romantic canon to
                  include anti-slavery texts by exploring the capacity of these texts to sometimes “popularize
                  and codify racial prejudice,” despite their ethical and civic commitments to breaking
                  the Blakean “mind forg’d manacles” that sustained Atlantic Slavery (Lee and Richardson
                  7), and the contributors to this collection extend this project.</p>
               <p>It has been intriguing for us to see that the authors in this collection have arrived
                  at a shared methodology regarding how to approach teaching anti-slavery literatures
                  today organically, without a prompt from us and without reading drafts of each others’
                  essays. Many of them reframe and resituate eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts
                  in new constellations, not only in relation to each other and to art and artefacts
                  from the period, but also in relation to texts from Black Studies, and to twentieth
                  and twenty-first works of fiction and critical fabulation that seek to address the
                  silences of the past. In their commitment to this method, several contributors implicitly
                  employ contrapuntal reading, a method that since Fernando Ortiz's <span style="font-style:italic">Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el azúcar</span> (1944) and Edward Said’s <span style="font-style:italic">Culture and Imperialism</span> (1993), who independently of each other advanced the method, has influenced the work
                  of writers like Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier and critics such as Mary Louise Pratt
                  and Simon Gikandi.</p>
               <p>In the Anglo-American Academy, readers may be familiar with how Said theorizes the
                  importance of reading “not univocally but contrapuntally, with an awareness both of
                  the metropolitan history that is narrated and of those other histories against which
                  (and together with which) the dominating discourse acts” (Said 51). Drawing on music
                  to describe a form of attention to reading novels such as Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, he writes: <span class="quote">‘In the counterpoint of classical music, various themes play off one another, with
                     only a provisional privilege being given to any particular one; yet in the resulting
                     polyphony there is concert and order, an organized interplay that derives from the
                     themes, not from a rigorous melodic or formal principle outside of the work. In the
                     same way, I believe, we can read and interpret English novels, for example, whose
                     engagement (usually suppressed for the most part) with the West Indies or India, say,
                     is shaped and perhaps even determined by the specific history of colonization, resistance,
                     and finally native nationalism. (51)’</span> While Said's archive was “English novels,” Fernando Ortiz applied “contrapunteo”
                  in his anthropological analysis of sugar and tobacco written fifty years prior to
                  Said’s work, and in which he coined the word “transculturación”— transculturation—by
                  now familiar to critics through the work of Mary Louise Pratt. It should be noted
                  that Ortiz and his generation, which included Lydia Cabrera, the renown scholar of
                  <span style="font-style:italic">santería</span>, and Alejo Carpentier, who turned to the Haitian Revolution for inspiration, embarked
                  on a reassessment of the contributions of AfroCuban and African cultures to Cuban
                  identity. Ortiz emphasizes the musical roots of counterpoint at the same time that
                  he undercores the AfroCuban experience, one that incorporates both music <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the orality of verse in call and response rituals between griot and the audience.
                  “Recordemos en Cuba sus manifestaciones más floridas en las preces antifonarias de
                  las liturgias, así de blancos como de negros, en la controvertida erótica y danzarina
                  de la rumba, y en los contrapunteos versificados de la guajirada montuna y de la currería
                  afrocubana" (F. Ortiz 18). [Let us remember the elaborate manifestations [of counterpoint]
                  in Cuba, whether in the antiphonal liturgies of Blacks and whites, in the controversial
                  erotics of the movement of the rumba, and in the versified counterpoints in country
                  and Afrocuban peoples]. In his novel about the Haitian Revolution, <span style="font-style:italic">El siglo de las luces</span> (1962), Carpentier develops the aesthetics of the “<span style="font-style:italic">arbitrario contrapunto</span>” (“the arbitrary counterpoint”) by considering the different, yet simultaneous unfolding
                  of the lives of his protagonists (47), which shape and impact individual spheres of
                  action as well as the grand récit of history. Carpentier later extends in his essay
                  about "lo real maravilloso," the marvellous real, where he again returns to the Haitian
                  Revolution, Henri Cristophe’s opposition to Napoleon, and Mackandal, "que hace creer
                  a millares y millares de esclavos en Haití ... que puede transformarse en lo que quiera,
                  y promueve con ellos una de las primeras revoluciones auténticas del Nuevo Mundo"
                  [Mackandal, who convinces thousands and thousands of slaves in Haiti ... that he can
                  turn into anything, and promotes with them one of the first authentic revolutions

                     subjects as apparently disconnected as diarist Anna Larpent and Nealee, the enslaved
                     woman in Mungo Park’s narrative. In other chapters, he considers texts by Francis
                     Williams, Hume and Olaudah Equiano; Phillis Wheatley, William Beckford, and Thomas
                     Jefferson (among others) in contrapuntal relationship to each other. Gikandi accounts
                     for how “the criteria driving the aesthetic ideology in the eighteenth century—disinterest
                     and virtue, among others—had come to be haunted by slavery” (Gikandi 144). The effect
                     of this more deliberate counterpoint is to ensure “a dialectic between the visible
                     subjects of modernity and its invisible actors” (70), as he writes. Exegesis as an
                     act of resistance exposes the symbolic systems that mediate materiality, disturbing
                     the cognitive and symbolic separations between the violent system of the plantation
                     secured through empire, and the well-wrought tea set of the drawing room, holding

                  <p>Patricia A. Matthew draws attention to how her students themselves implicitly enacted
                     a contrapuntal method when they responded to the suppressed context of William Blake’s
                     “The Little Black Boy” in a class in 2006. Her essay offers a retrospective account
                     of howthis moment offered an invitationto continue to explore, in several different
                     settings (both undergraduate and graduate),the effects of centering the topic of race
                     and slavery in the classroom. Matthew invites makers of syllabi to look beyond the
                     question of which single texts to use in a self-contained “unit” of a syllabus on
                     slavery, to instead imagine how Romanticism looks whenone centers “race, abolition
                     and freedom” on the level of the syllabus as a whole. The essay criticizes the idea
                     that one can simply add a single text about slavery to a syllabus and expect that
                     the topic has been covered, as if a Romantic literature syllabus is a familiar recipe
                     one can add a new ingredient to. Rather than focusing a discussion about Atlantic
                     slavery on a single text in a syllabus, Matthew argues, it should be considered a
                     relevant context in discussions of all Romantic texts, even in texts where it seems
                     not to be present. Matthew describes two different courses which center anti-slavery
                     literatures and texts about race, including detailed discussions ofteaching Blake’s
                     poem, Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows of Yamba,” Amelia Opie’s “The
                     Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,” Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave
                     Trade,” and the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale, A Novel</span>(1808). Ivan Ortiz’ method can also be called contrapuntal, from several perspectives.
                     Ortiz puts Said’s argument about the silences in Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> (1814) in dialogue with Lynn Festa’s argument that Austen is also asking readers to
                     listen for “noise.” Ortiz begins by explaining how he uses this principle of “listening
                     for noise” as a method to teach abolition poetry written by white authors. He positions
                     this poetry in counterpoint with music, when he asks students to examine the complexity
                     of a situation in which both Hannah More’s version of “The Sorrows of Yamba” and William
                     Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” were sung to the well-known ballad “Admiral Hosier’s
                     Ghost,” a tune about white English sailors who had died at sea. He then turns to a
                     text that could be called contrapuntal in itself; M. NourbeSe Philip’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> (2008), which is “composed entirely from the words of the case report, <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson vs. Gilbert,</span> related to the murder of Africans on board a slave ship at the end of the eighteenth
                     century.”

                     </div> As students center their attention on the silences that this text exposes, they are
                     confronted with the question of “what the fragmentation of language accomplishes that
                     a ballad narrative cannot.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Sean Gordon also extends the contrapuntal method beyond the frame of synchronicity,
                  to ask how twentieth-century narratives might also inform students’ understandings
                  of nineteenth-century testimonies. He describes the project of “teaching contemporary
                  texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a speculative framework,” like Celu Amberstone’s
                  “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </span>(1995/2005), and Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>(1966), in relation to Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>. To frame his discussion of what it meant to discuss these texts on a campus responding
                  to a series of violently racist incidents in 2014, Gordon centers Fred Moten’s term
                  “dehiscence” (which describes a form of structural vulnerability that allows for productive
                  disordering), as well as the Afropessimism of Frank Wilderson, pointing toward another
                  speculative future, in which a conversation between scholars of Black Studies and
                  scholars of Romanticism will become more common. He also discusses how teaching Mat
                  Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> (2011) in dialogue with Edgar Allan Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span> (1838) allowed students to think through the issue of how structures of white privilege
                  are implicit not only in the archive, but in the university itself.</p>
               <p>Afrofuturism provides a site of conceptual resistance in several of the essays here.
                  Leading sociologist Alondra Nelson defines Afrofuturism as a mode which uplifts “‘African
                  American voices’ with ‘other stories to tell about culture, technology and things
                  to come,’” and often concerns “sci-fi imagery, futurist themes, and technological
                  innovation in the African diaspora” (9). Through her syllabus and classroom discussion,
                  Elizabeth Fay stages an innovative conversation between Afrofuturism, Romanticism,
                  and Atlantic Studies that juxtaposes past and present narratives of the legacies of
                  enslavement, and challenges students to reinterpret Atlantic history by engaging “future
                  history imagined” (13). When Fay asks students to compare Olaudah Equiano’s narrative
                  with the film <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther </span>(2018), and contextualizes this question in relation to N.K. Jemisin’s introduction
                  Afrofuturism in “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” she extends the possibilities
                  for the interpretation of “geographical space, conceptual space, and textual space”
                  (Dillon 31) in Black Atlantic narratives.</p>
               <p>In the broader sweep of her article, Fay emphasizes “the fluid movement of dynamic
                  relationality among multiple, and variable subjects” as she explores various exercises
                  designed to ask students to triangulate narratives of enslavement and post-enslavement.
                  For instance, Fay asks students to consider how Mary Prince’s nineteenth-century rhetorics
                  of suffering and resistance compare with those of Equiano, and then further complicates
                  the question by asking them to read the rhetoric of Toussaint L’Ouverture’s letters
                  in relation to C.L.R. James’ account of his life in <span style="font-style:italic">Black Jacobins</span>. (Sylvia Wynter’s article on C.L.R. James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,”
                  also offers students an argument about how James’ work helps to posit a theory of
                  “becoming Black” which is relevant “whether the year is 1800 or 2021.”) In another
                  unit of the syllabus, Fay triangulates Lenora Sansay’s <span style="font-style:italic">Secret History; or the Horrors of St. Domingo </span>(1808) and the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour </span>(1808) with Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park </span>(1814), as she asks students to compare fictionalized accounts of women’s experience
                  in the period, and further contextualizes this exercise with references to the work
                  of Christina Sharpe and Sylvia Wynter.</p>
               <p>Frances Botkin also offers many possibilities for students to read contrapuntally
                  when she insists that Romantic-era narratives cannot be taught without a serious commitment
                  to contextualization. Through a theorization of the practice of <span style="font-style:italic">tunyuhan,</span> Botkin uses what she terms an “undisciplined mode of assembly” to consider the value
                  of generative improvisation in teaching, and how contemporary art, film, music and
                  recordings of interviews with people in Jamaica “animate colonial textuality with
                  the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture that in revising the past, imagines
                  and nourishes future worlds.” She describes, for instance, how she presents students
                  with Lydia Maria Child’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna: An Emancipated Slave, of Suriname </span>(1834) (a narrative extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</span> [1796]), alongside John Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi; or the History of Three-Fingered Jack</span> (1800), a painting of Three-Fingered Jack by the Jamaican painter Omari “Afrikan”
                  Ra, and a documentary film by Roy Anderson called <span style="font-style:italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </span>(2015); a constellation which allows students to see how “Child almost entirely excludes
                  the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections.” When she asks students to read
                  Mary Prince’s <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave </span>(1831) alongside Marlon James’ <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span> (2009), she puts further pressure on the question of what nineteenth-century writers
                  do not say about the experiences of enslaved people, and particularly of enslaved
                  women.</p>
               <p>Another way in which the dialogic space can be transformed to create an anti-racist
                  classroom is through the acknowledgment of the tension between writing and speech,
                  foregrounding for students the incomplete nature of the anti-slavery archive. In her
                  focus on “doing the work” of travelling to Jamaica in order to better understand Maroon
                  history, Botkin brings centers the notion of orality in order to problematize the
                  hierarchy of knowledge that privileges the archive. Her field work and connection
                  to Maroon leader Gaa’ma Gloria Simms has enabled her to create a contact zone in the
                  classroom where the oral histories of Afro-Caribbean descendants of Maroon communities
                  expose asymmetries of power and the injustices encoded as silence in the written record.
                  The conference in Jamaica which she co-organizes with Paul Youngquist reconfigure
                  the spaces and possibilities of knowledge for Romanticists which brings the “archive”
                  into conversation with living indigenous knowledge.</p>
               <p>Nicholas Blaisdell elucidates how countepoint as exegesis awakens agency, as Carpentier
                  also discovered in <span style="font-style:italic">El siglo de las luces</span>, when Sofía, one of his protagonists, urges, "¡Hay que hacer algo!" [Something must
                  be done] (410). Blaisdell explores how anti-slavery writers like Cugoano indicte capitalism's
                  use of enslaved labor in the 19th century as a global system, anticipating the system's
                  accomodation of unfree labor through the present era. Drawing on Freire, he reflects
                  on how study of anti-slavery texts, abolitionist networks, and Marx informed his development
                  as a social justice activist and organizer of Black Lives Matter Protests in Peabody,
                  Massachusetts, his work as a high school teacher and Adjunct Professor of education.
                  His analysis illuminates how a Freirean pedagogy can translate into greater empowerment
                  for students in educational and civic settings.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">V. Some Future Directions</span></h2>
               <p>The project of articulating linkages that connect the teaching praxis of Romanticists
                  with histories of resistance, liberation, struggles against slavery, and the oppression
                  of people of color, goes far beyond the purview of a single special issue, and so
                  we wish to close by noting some of the areas for pedagogical inquiry that our contributors
                  have opened vistas onto. We hope that the pedagogical experiments detailed in this
                  collection will be useful in practical terms, as a guide for those teaching in universities
                  in how to begin to redesign their own syllabi and classroom discussions. The larger
                  aim, however, is for the collection to be useful in broader methodological terms,
                  as a prompt for readers to imagine their own contrapuntal arrangements of texts and
                  voices. The possibilities for new contrapuntal readings and new constellations of
                  texts go far beyond the specific texts or arrangements listed in these case studies.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Many of our contributors use specific examples to describe a method that could be
                     applied to various texts. The example Patricia A. Matthew gives, for example, of what
                     it means to read Blake’s work in dialogue with anti-slavery literatures, encourages
                     pedagogues to look more closely at how texts they have taught without reference to
                     the history of slavery might change when this context is brought to bear. Similarly,
                     Sean Gordon and Elizabeth Fay’s references to Afrofuturist texts invite readers to
                     conduct their own research in this field, and to imagine their own conversations between
                     the past and speculative futures. Another question that emerges from this focus on
                     Afrofuturism is whether there might be room for more opportunites for students to
                     encounter examples of Black resistance, humour, joy, and agency in the Romantic classroom.
                     New possibilities for dialogue with contemporary texts will continue to arise as new
                     works of critical fabulation appear (even during the time we have been editing this
                     collection, for instance, many of our colleagues have begun to teach Honorée Fanonne

               <p>Our work on this collecton has prompted us to imagine several future topics for <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles Pedagogies </span>collections on how to engage anti-slavery literatures in the classroom, which we would
                  be pleased to see responses to. While our contributors engage the question of affect
                  in passing, for instance, our field would benefit from a more sustained conversation
                  about how to acknowledge the range of emotions that the learning process might bring
                  up in classes that consider the history of slavery. From another perspective, both
                  Botkin and Ortiz encourage attention to the aural dimension of textuality and its
                  silences, which reveals how orality and the epistemologies it transmits is also major
                  component of the anti-slavery archive which could also be engaged further. Becoming
                  aware of the limitations that govern the textual archive<span style="font-style:italic">as text</span> with attention to the conditions of its production will allow for the introduction
                  of approaches with which Romanticists are familiar, such historicist, post-structuralist,
                  feminist, postcolonial, and neoformalist methodologies.</p>
               <p>The essays here also enjoin readers to consider important questions that remain on
                  the horizon of this collection, about how far discussions of anti-slavery texts have
                  been made to stand in for larger discussions about race in the Romantic period, and
                  how this tendency might be addressed in the future. This connects the work of the
                  collection with Marlon B. Ross’s call to “shift the focus momentarily away from the
                  important question of Romanticism’s self-conscious investment in or diversion from
                  slavery and colonialism to consider <span style="font-style:italic">race</span> itself as an economy of gut-instinctual, sensperceptual, socialpsychological, aesthetic-ideological,
                  and geopolitical commitments” in his essay “The Race of/in Romanticism: Notes Toward
                  a Critical Race Theory,” (26). As Bakary Diaby argues, “we must continue working on
                  slavery, but we should not let it be our only engagement with, again, the deeply quotidian,
                  socio-personal ordering of the world we inhabit and have inherited from the long Romantic
                  period” (“Black Women” 252). Diaby himself offers a rare example of what it means
                  to bring the topic of race to bear on texts that have not traditionally been grouped
                  under the heading of texts that address the topic of race in the Romantic period in
                  his reading of Wordworth's “We Are Seven” (“Counting the Bodies”). Although several
                  of our authors encourage a more open dialogue between Black Studies and Romanticism,
                  a more widespread and sustained dialogue between Romantic literature and critical
                  race theory is clearly necessary in the field at large.</p>

                  <p>We also wish to note that several conversations on the subject of antiracist pedagogy

                     as the relationship between a commitment to anti-racism and teaching anti-slavery
                     texts is nuanced further. In Fall 2020, Tita Chico convened a series on “Antiracism:

                     in our field. The series is ongoing, can be accessed online, and constitutes a rich

                  <p>In an era when zoom makes possible new kinds of collaboration, geographical distance
                     has become less of an obstacle to conversation since we began working on these questions,
                     but the field of Romanticism, and especially studies of slavery in the Romantic period,
                     still needs to do more to address the divisions it has historically instantiated between
                     Anglophone texts and texts in other languages. The Anglophone focus of the authors
                     examined throughout this collection points to multilingualism and Romanticism as a
                     related area for future research as the plurilingual nature of the histories of African
                     and indigenous resistance comes further into view. As Gillian Sankoff writes, <span class="quote">‘It is difficult to conceive of another situation where people arrived with such a
                        variety of native languages, where they were so cut off from their native language
                        groups; where the size of no language group was enough to ensure its survival; where
                        no second language was shared by enough people to serve as a useful vehicle of intercommunication;
                        and where the legitimate [=official-RM] language was inaccessible to almost everyone.
                        (qtd. in Mesthrie 230)’</span> For some of the writers in the archive of anti-slavery literatures, the process of
                     translation into English and language acquisition was also a process of living through
                     epistemic violence. Yet the governing assumption in Romantic era studies in approaching
                     the anti-slavery archive is that the language of Black British authors is English
                     (Almeida). A similar assumption governs the Indigenous archive, as Nikki Hessell shows
                     in <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Literature and the Colonised World: Lessons from Indigenous Translations </span>(2018). Hessell argues that Indigneous interpretations of canonical authors are more
                     than “novelties, nor simple evidence of the global power and reach of Romantic literature”
                     (229), but “simultaneous expressions of the value of Romantic literature and of the
                     experience of colonization” (230). While some might respond that as scholars of British
                     or American literature the field is Anglocentric by nature, this commitment to monolingualism
                     out of habit robs the field of depth and breadth, since the African diaspora was not
                     limited to English-speaking countries. During and even after the abolition of slavery
                     in 1833, Britain continued to trade with the Global South, as scholars such as Rebecca
                     Cole Heinowitz, Omar Miranda, César Soto, Juan Sánchez, Jesse Reeder, and Sara Medina
                     Calzada show, while at the same time making greater imperial incursions in Africa
                     and India. Even so, texts from this “second slavery,” as Dale Tomich has called it,
                     have a belated entrance into Romanticism, such as Juan Manzano’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Life and Poems of a Cuban Slave</span> (1840), translated by Richard Robert Madden, who also testified a trial that vindicated
                     the rights of enslaved persons to rise up against their enslavers, and was one of
                     the most international trials of its time: The Amistad. The biography of the enslaved
                     Brazilian, Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua (1848) is another useful starting point for those
                     wishing to expand their students’ reference points beyond texts written in English
                     (see Aljoe, “Testimonies” 111). Nicole Aljoe also challenges “the marginal status
                     of West Indian slave narratives within critical discourses of the slave narrative
                     genre, Caribbean and Black Atlantic literary histories,” and reveals how Abolitionist
                     groups in England, the United States, and the West Indies were in close contact with
                     one another.

                     were deprived of access in British colonies, not only to literacy, but also to the
                     judicial recognition of their oral testimony in colonial jurisdictions, further limiting

                     and considering that duality decenters the assumption of its naturality and the nationalist

                     denounces (“Warscapes¨). The creolizations of English and other European languages
                     in contact zones are also part of the Romantic aesthetic, as much as the standardization
                     of these languages in this period.

                     spaces of redress and also of transformation, Romanticist scholars must do more to
                     invite students to imagine new contact zones, not only between canonical and non-canonical
                     texts and between disciplines, but also between the past and the present; between

               <h2><span class="head">Concluding Openly (or An Open Conclusion)</span></h2>
               <p>The essays in this collection explore how recent history informs the way that students
                  might currently receive Romantic texts, clearing a space for further discussion about
                  how the conversation will continue to change the way that the Romantic texts signify.
                  As scholars and teachers, becoming conscious of not only how pedagogical praxis might
                  be shaped by developments in research and critical race theory, but also how events
                  in the classroom might reshape research is more than a matter of good teaching or
                  meeting the publish or perish expectations of the academy. Taken together, these essays
                  encourage scholars to reflect on how both instructor and students must consider the
                  relation between the classroom and the university, and its relationship to the imagined
                  community at the national and planetary levels. As Matthew, Gordon, Richardson, and
                  Lee elucidate, instructors and students have to grapple with how structures of white
                  privilege are implicit in the university, the archive, and in the discipline so that
                  together they can transform interpretation into a dialogic act of resistance as they
                  deconstruct racialist and exclusionary discourses, thereby creating alternative spaces
                  of true interrelational knowledge together. </p>
               <p>The co-creation of knowledge is one of the paths towards the the liberatory potential
                  of education that Paulo Freire, a major inspiration for the 2018 panel, describes.
                  Arguing against the “banking concept” of education, a system in which students merely
                  bank information they passively receive from their teacher, Freire challenges the
                  asymmetry of power central to the subject/object dichotomy that is also at the core
                  of the ontological negation racism relies on. As bell hooks writes in her meditation
                  on how Freire’s pedagogy informs her own, “Freire’s work affirmed that education can
                  only be liberatory when everyone claims knowledge as a field in which we all labor”
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">Teaching to Transgress</span> 14). Moments of first encounter are often formative: students are coming to texts
                  about slavery from a different historical perspective than their teachers, and this
                  means that students have the potential to teach their teachers things they have not
                  before seen, and which they may find hard to see.</p>
               <p>This conversation offers some specific practices in the attempt to create classroom
                  environments to create a place of “where both [professors and students] are simultaneously
                  teachers and students” while respecting the intersectionalities of race, gender, and
                  class in our increasingly diverse student body (Freire 72), but it is by no means
                  exhaustive. bell hooks also cautions that “teachers are often among that group most
                  reluctant to acknowledge the extent to which white-supremacist thinking informs every
                  aspect of our culture including the way we learn, the content of what we learn, and
                  the manner in which we are taught” (<span style="font-style:italic">Teaching Community </span>25). With this in mind, the discussions here respectfully offer multiple ways to reflect
                  on how we might more consciously acknowledge and evaluate how our own experiences
                  inflect our pedagogical practices, and how to work with students to create spaces
                  in our classrooms for this vital dialogue. At a time when events in the US have inspired
                  civic action and debate in countries across the world, the present moment can no longer
                  be kept outside the doors of a classroom in which Romantic literature is being read.
                  As scholars, it is useful to consider not only how pedagogical praxis might be reshaped
                  by developments in research, but also how events in the classroom might reshape research
                  practices.</p>
