               <p>My decision to design a class that focuses on Romantic-era abolitionist literature
                  was sparked by a student debate about how to interpret William Blake’s “The Little
                  Black Boy.” It was in the spring of 2006, the semester before my tenure file was due
                  and just a few years before the United States elected its first Black president. Students
                  were reading the poem in my fairly traditional Romanticism survey, one that focused
                  on canonical poets (the “Big Six”) along with Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Valperga</span>. The course paid very little attention to the debates about how these same writers
                  responded to debates about England’s participation in the transatlantic slave trade,
                  and for the first three years that I taught the poem, no student had challenged the
                  line that we ended up discussing for a full 75-minute class period: “And I am black,
                  but O! my soul is white” (l.2) On a handout that included the poem and a few warm-up
                  questions, a student circled the line and wrote: “WTF??!!?” next to it. A rambunctious
                  debate that I wasn’t quite prepared to moderate followed. As a specialist in regency
                  and romantic-era fiction, I knew enough about Black figures in eighteenth and nineteenth-century
                  literature to help them understand the presence of Black people in Romantic-era England.

                  </div> As a Black woman who spends a good amount of time navigating tense conversations about
                  racism with her students, I knew how to keep the conversation open, provocative, and
                  productive all at once. I did not, however, know enough about Blackness in Romanticism
                  to help my students think as carefully as I wanted them to about the line. Working
                  through what my students needed to contextualize the line and sorting out how to cultivate
                  the same analytical energy in response to their other readings lead to this “abolitionist
                  turn” in my teaching of Romanticism. In what follows I show how I made this transition
                  in my undergraduate and graduate courses. I discuss critical essays that have been
                  most useful for students and assignments that can potentially take the work of the
                  class beyond the university classroom. Threaded through this reflection is a consideration
                  of the question of how much of the success of these curricular revisions is because
                  they have responded to students’ curiosity and their unusually animated response to
                  Romantic-era questions about race and social justice that resonate as contemporary.
                  As I explain in my essay “Academic Freedom: Students and the Problem with Labels,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> I expend a great deal of energy preserving class discussions as a space where students
                  feel free to wrestle with complex ideas, free from expectations that they reflect
                  a specific political point of view. I aim for what bell hooks calls for, namely the
                  classroom as: “a democratic setting where everyone feels a responsibility to contribute
                  to a central goal of transformative pedagogy” (39). Teaching Romanticism with a focus
                  on abolitionist culture has made this goal easier to reach.I have found that in learning
                  about an abolitionist Romanticism, students are not only studying historical texts
                  and their connection to a movement, but are learning more about the intricacies of
                  society, protest, and revolution.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When I started this process, I faced two obstacles. First, my graduate training, which
               in 2006 was still the foundation for teaching Romanticism, did not bring questions
               of race or Blackness to bear on Romanticism. Additionally, as a new professor, I was
               anxious to teach Romantic poetry in a way that was legible to senior British faculty,
               especially those who looked askance at my decision to include novels in a course they
               believed should only focus on poetry. I was also facing a short tenure clock and an
               institutional environment hostile to faculty of color, realities that left me little
               time to substantially revise the course I was hired to teach. As a result, my first
               instinct was simply to add more texts that explicitly included mentions of Black figures
               or referred to slavery or abolition. This, however, felt like a superficial response
               to a pedagogical project that required nuance not only in texts I might add to the
               syllabus but how those additions would alter students understanding of the Romantic
               period. To put it simply, would it matter if I added Ottobah Cugoano without thinking
               about how to reframe “The Little Black Boy” or Blake and his contemporaries? In response
               to this set of concerns, my initial impulse was to gather articles and book chapters
               that focused on how the writers already on the syllabus thought about the slave trade,
               abolition, amelioration, and emancipation. I also experimented in the undergraduate
               classes I regularly taught (Introduction to Theory, Art of Fiction, and The Novel
               to 1900) by introducing new primary texts. I started with just a few texts (primarily
               fiction) and then planned short units that included abolitionist literature that reflected
               the overall themes of the courses. A course on women in nineteenth-century literature,
               for example, included a unit on marriage and chattel slavery. I then offered a “special
               topics” course that explicitly focused on abolition and the nineteenth century. By
               the time my department added a new required course, “Writing for the Major,” designed
               for students new to the English major in 2014, I had the materials to plan an entire
               course that focused on the writers included on my Romanticism syllabus and their contemporaries,
               and provided an opportunity for students to think about race, abolition, and freedom
               as essential to how we read literature regardless of the time period from which it
               emerges and not as a special course but as a matter of course. </p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">***</span></h2>
               <p>The student’s visceral response to “And I am black, but O! my soul is white” was because
                  they were shocked about what they interpreted as an exceptionally explicit affirmation
                  of white supremacy even given a time period they understood as less enlightened about
                  race. The debate that followed the WTF??!!?” mirrored tense exchanges I have seen
                  among Romanticists and scholars of pre-1900 British literature. Students who were
                  troubled by the line and those who read it as innocuous faced charges of either over
                  or under reading the line, with most Black students inclined to find it offensive
                  and many white students defending it as having emerged from a particular historical
                  moment and so exempt from contemporary ideas about what constitutes a racist moment
                  in art. In part because no one in class was committed to a defense of Blake, a poet
                  few if any of them had even read, students did not dwell on the either/or portion
                  of the debate. I also think students were willing to move beyond their initial disagreements
                  because in a diverse, multi-cultural class, in 2006 questions about racism in Romantic-era
                  literature felt largely theoretical and tied to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
                  Obama and the backlash to his candidacy had not entered their field of vision, and,
                  unlike students who studied abolitionist literature with me in the subsequent semesters,
                  they had not yet confronted the world of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, or the protests
                  in Ferguson, Missouri. Donald Trump was not yet legible to them as a political threat.
                  As I discuss below, Romanticism’s racism felt more contemporary near the end of Obama’s
                  presidency, but in 2006 they turned to historical context to interpret the line, information
                  about Blake and his contemporaries, and wanted to understand if the language in the
                  poem signified to eighteenth and nineteenth-century readers what it meant to them
                  in 2006. They also asked the same question about Blake that critics defensive of their
                  chosen authors ask when questions of race and racism arise: if the line is racist,
                  could we hold Blake responsible for ideas that were widely, uncritically circulating
                  in the 1800s but unacceptable now? They were also, then, intensely curious to see
                  how his contemporaries wrote about this—if Blake was in step, out of a step, or prescient.
                  When I explained that the poem was published at a particularly active time in Britain’s
                  abolitionist movement, students wanted to know which “side” he was on, leading to
                  what to my mind was and remains the most important critical point of discussing abolitionist
                  politics. As I explained in that debate and continue to discuss in my teaching, the
                  terms used in the discussion about the transatlantic slave trade—abolition, emancipation,
                  amelioration, freedom—do not necessarily correlate to notions of anti-racism, equality,
                  and equity. It is, I made clear, entirely possible for Blake to be opposed to slavery
                  and still cling to racial hierarchies.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>David Bindman’s “Blake’s Vision of Slavery Revisited” proved an especially useful
                     follow-up to these questions about the poem. Despite more recent readings of Blake
                     and race,

                     </div> Bindman’s work here offers a compelling, accessible history that answers students’
                     questions about Blake’s understanding of race and how consistent it is with the period.
                     Bindman points us to work by Christopher Miller about how ancient Greeks understood
                     skin color: “Among the living I was very black, darkened by the rays of the sun, but
                     my soul, ever blooming with white flowers, won my prudent master’s good will” (374).
                     The essay also models for them student what it requires to credibly reach the understanding
                     that Bindman offers near the end of his essay: <span class="quote">‘These two examples do not, of course, cast doubt on the sincerity of Blake’s opposition
                        to the slavery…They do, however, suggest that Blake was unable to free himself—<span style="font-style:italic">no more than anyone else at the time</span>—from the complex and often contradictory web of ancient and modern beliefs that had
                        settled around African and Africans in the late eighteenth century. (382; emphasis
                        mine)’</span> Where I might quibble with the aside I emphasized above—and I share my disagreement
                     with my students—I nonetheless have found Bindman’s essay exceptionally useful because
                     he models what students need to think about when considering nineteenth-century representations
                     of race. Bindman’s essay has been a mainstay whenever I teach Blake and I pair it
                     with Kwame Anthony Appiah’s “Race”—an essay that succinctly traces how race functions
                     as a social construct in the nineteenth century and clearly explains that despite
                     its constructedness, it still carries social weight: <span class="quote">‘For, however mythical the notion of race seems to be, we cannot deny the obvious fact
                        that having one set of heritable characteristics—dark skin, say—rather than another—blonde
                        hair, for example—can have profound psychological, economic, and other social consequences,
                        especially in societies where many people are not only racialists but racists. ’</span> Appiah’s assertations here, about “heritable characteristics” made some students uncomfortable,
                     those who felt implicated by the idea that the characteristics they were born with
                     have social capital and those who chafed against the idea that their characteristics
                     may not overcome the obstacles they believe can be dismantled with education. My students
                     are wary of the idea of “white privilege” because they associate it with economic
                     wealth, but Appiah in this moment articulates what the “privilege” looks like, quite
                     literally.

                     </div> Despite their discomfort, students responded well to the accessibility of Appiah’s
                     analogies in the essay and, as a result, were better prepared to do the more difficult
                     conceptual work it takes to understand how he lays out the consequent process of nation
                     building and understandings of race: <span class="quote">‘the dual connection made in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century thought between, on
                        the one hand, race and nationality, and, on the other, nationality and literature.
                        In short, the nation is the key middle term in understanding the relations between
                        the concept of race and the idea of literature. (282)’</span> Appiah also addresses the impact of the idea of race as a social construction, an
                     idea too many of my students have turned to as a way to dismiss racism. In “Writing
                     for the Major” students also watched <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEOQcVLvnKo)">his interview</a> with a Foreign Affairs correspondent. His observations in the interview prompts open
                     and productive conversations about race and racism where student curiosity about the
                     history of race and earnest desire to understand how racism work overcomes some of
                     the defensiveness and anxiety they felt about a topic that became increasingly fraught
                     as their understanding of the world as racially just was undermined by national events.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although the “Writing for the Major” course began with “The Black Boy” and the readings
                  included poetry and prose by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, the class was less
                  explicitly about Romanticism as literary period and more about the uses of literary
                  analysis and research to understand the relationship between literature and political
                  movements. The goal was for students to study how poets and novelists contribute to
                  and shape national debates by paying attention to the rhetoric abolitionists used
                  to persuade their fellow citizens to support abolition, amelioration, or emancipation.
                  I organized the course around a set of themes that often overlapped—consumer culture,
                  gender, and religious ideology. In addition to reading “The Little Black Boy,” the
                  course began with two exercises—a conversation about the various ways civic groups
                  try to effect broad change and a low-stakes free association exercise about the word
                  sugar. The free association regarding sugar initially struck them as odd because the
                  commodity they most associate with slavery is cotton, but, in addition to preparing
                  them for the way the sweetener was integral to abolitionist politics, the free association
                  exercise helped them understand the way that a consumable object morphs into the imaginary
                  and metaphoric. Without fail, each time I taught the class the free association began
                  with “honey” and invariably ended with students listing songs that reference “Sugar
                  Daddy” in their titles or lyrics. This conflation of commodity, commerce, and desire
                  prepared them for a discussion Tina Turner and Mick Jagger’s performance of “Brown
                  Sugar.” This is a song that was still familiar to most of them, one they grew up hearing.
                  They may never have seen the Turner-Jagger performance, but they recognize the opening
                  chords and know the start of the chorus. Students watched the video without the benefit
                  of having the lyrics in front of them, and then listened to the song again while reading
                  the lyrics. The conversation sparked by what the lines reveal is not as angry as the
                  debate about Blake, but it is intense: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields</div>
                  <div class="l">Sold in the market down in New Orleans</div>
                  <div class="l">Skydog slaver know he's doin' all right</div>
                  <div class="l">Hear him whip the women, just around midnight.</div>
               </div>
               <p> I want to be clear here that the point of this exercise was not to hunt for moments
                  of popular culture and vet them for their politics. Instead, I wanted to show students
                  the long reach of the tropes they were about to encounter. Still in each class some
                  sort of debate has ensued. Some students felt guilty for liking the song. In one class,
                  a few of the Black women tried to convince their classmates that Jagger is satirizing
                  and mocking English history, while others were unsure of what to make of Turner’s
                  full-throated participation in the performance. These early class exercises primed
                  students to push past any neat assumptions about race, abolition, visual culture,
                  and representations of Black women in literature, visual culture, and film. It also
                  prepared them to think along with Christina Sharpe when we listened to <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhHmHYBssMc">her response </a> to Kara Walker’s art installation “The Subtlety.” Sharpe not only provided a pointed
                  critique of Walker and her use of the Black female form but offered a model for students
                  about how to ask productive questions from the texts they read and see.</p>
               <p>In addition to “The Little Black Boy,” the primary texts in the class included: Coleridge’s
                  1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” Robert Southey’s six sonnet sequence “Poems on
                  the Slave Trade,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,” Wordsworth’s
                  “The Mad Mother” and Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows of Yamba”—a
                  poem students found particularly compelling when they were assigned an excerpt from
                  Alan Richardson’s essay about its authorship: “The Sorrows of Yamba,” by Eaglesfield
                  Smith and Hannah More: Authorship, Ideology, and the Fractures of Antislavery Discourse.”
                  The excerpts I used from Richardson’s essay were particularly generative. Students
                  read the poem over two class periods. In the first class, their work with the poem
                  was a mix of their initial reactions and my lecture on motherhood and infanticide.
                  On the second day students work with the poem, I used this excerpt from the essay
                  to take students back to the primary text and asked students to identity what in the
                  poem supports Richardson’s claim: </p>
               <p>In what follows, then, I will establish the dual authorship of the Cheap Repository
                  “Sorrows of Yamba” on the basis both of external evidence (including new evidence
                  that I discovered in the course of preparing a collection of British antislavery poems)
                  and internal evidence. Indeed, a crucial part of the argument—for the priority and
                  relative integrity of Smith's version of the poem—depends almost wholly on internal
                  evidence, but of an unusually persuasive kind. (para 4) </p>
               <p>This exercise was particularly rewarding for students who had completed the reading
                  before class and followed my recommendation to mark passages they found intriguing
                  and/or troubling. Those who read carefully reported the poem “feeling” different in
                  moments. Having Richardson affirm their initial thinking about the poem not only rewarded
                  their close reading but opened up a dialogue between students and Richardson that
                  didn’t require my guidance. Richardson’s analysis was also a useful way to show students
                  the limits of thinking of our primary texts as infallible, historical documents. One
                  risk of a course such as this, especially since most students started the semester
                  completely unaware of England’s connection to the slave trade, was to read the literary
                  as a historical account of the experiences of the enslaved. They tended to forget
                  this. This was especially important for students to understand as they read Equiano
                  and Mary Prince, narratives about slavery written for a white audience. </p>
               <p>These opening exercises gave students a set of signposts to look for as they read,
                  making it easier for their initial encounters with the readings. This made even the
                  most tedious poems like Opie’s <br/>“How to Make Sugar” manageable, but it didn’t help much with Coleridge’s “Lecture
                  on the Slave Trade.” It needs a great deal of glossing to help students understand
                  the many references to people and places they don’t know, and it is written to be
                  heard rather than read. I had to develop a rhetorical map to help students understand
                  it. Many of them believed that Coleridge’s recitation of pro-slavery arguments that
                  he later dismantles are actually his own beliefs and ideas, so we read the lecture
                  as much for the structure of his argument as for his thoughts about the slave trade.
                  Students studied the tonal shifts in the essay—from its bombastic opening to its almost
                  clinical recitation of the argument for slavery that he is challenging to its use
                  of poetry. I noted that he is preacher, parliamentarian, and poet all in one lecture,
                  and then asked them to identify which moments in the lecture fit under those categories.</p>
               <p>Coleridge provides a useful introduction Southey’s anti-slavery sonnet series. In
                  the preface to the six sonnets that grow increasingly violent in tone, Southey speculates
                  about the necessary conditions for the slave trade to end and points to what will
                  happen with sugar specifically. After referencing the 1792 anti-sugar campaigns, he
                  predicts: <span class="quote">‘There are yet two other methods remaining, by which this traffic will probably be
                     abolished. By the introduction of East-Indian or Maple Sugar, or by the just and general
                     rebellion of the Negroes; by the vindictive justice of the Africans, or by the civilized
                     Christians finding it in their interest to be humane. ’</span> Students read Coleridge and Southey about midway through the semester, and his predictions
                  about the conditions necessary for abolition offered a prompt for students to revisit
                  the question of what mechanisms are required for meaningful societal change.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When it came to student work in this course, I aimed to develop a series of assignments
                     that reflected how my students imagined their lives after college. When I was a new
                     professor, my writing assignments did not offer students enough options. But a course
                     titled “Writing for the Major” required me to reconsider new ways to think about what
                     the work of writing does for students and to imagine ways to encourage student agency
                     about their education. In “anassignment,” Fred Moten writes to his students about
                     the inherent contradiction of cultivating their intellectual work while imposing institutional
                     structures on them in the form of a series of assignments. The nature of assignments,
                     he explains, neutralizes whatever revolutionary ideals he might hold leaving him as
                     “nothing other than an overseer even if what [he teaches] appears, at the level of
                     its content, to resist the actually existing political-economic order” (229). He wants
                     to mitigate the tension between the coercive practices Moten sees himself as imposing
                     on his students and his belief that his primary job is to support them as they cultivate
                     and refine their intellectual practices. What this has meant for my praxis is to think
                     of assignments as preparing students to make a choice about how they present their
                     analytical work. Roughly a third of my students have plans to teach English, primarily
                     in high school. To work with them to develop a research-based lesson plan was a useful,
                     organic way to assess how they took primary readings, class discussions, journal articles,
                     and their earlier papers and restructured them parts for their future students. “The
                     Little Black Boy” lesson plans, for example, took what in a university classroom ends
                     up being two 30-minute class discussions and broke it down into three or four days
                     for younger students. It was also an instructive glimpse into how my students’ processed
                     material with an eye towards what they need from me. They tended to be more interested
                     in providing the “history” around the poem, and learned how important it was to spend
                     time debunking the myth that historians are simply offering a fixed report of the
                     past. Giving students choices about their work also amplified their interest in the
                     course readings. They understood assignments that at first glance felt like busy work
                     were actually helping think about their analytical processes for their final project.
                     The assignment that required them to read two refereed journal articles made more
                     sense to them because it was not simply offering them “context” but showing them how
                     to engage with complex representations and ideologies.

                              Writing in the 1790s (2005) was very popular, especially for students looking for
                              a way to understand what ungirds women’s participation in abolitionist discourse.

               <p>The graduate seminars I teach in my department’s MA program are a mix of students
                  planning for doctoral studies, teachers seeking the Master of Arts in Teaching, and
                  students interested in a graduate-level engagement with literature. The course I planned
                  for this group of students in 2018 provided an opportunity to bring primary texts
                  into dialogue with "Critical Race Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent
                  Romanticist critical discourses that reimagine the post-colonial project.”. Here is
                  the full description from the syllabus: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p>Students in this course will consider how our understanding of nineteenth-century
                     Britain shifts when we take into account how much of the culture that gave us Shelley,
                     Austen, and, eventually, the Brontës relied on the transatlantic slave trade. Our
                     work will focus on Romantic-era writers who shaped, reflected, and contributed to
                     England’s abolitionist movement.  We will read anti-slavery writing by canonical poets
                     (Blake, Coleridge, and Wordsworth); consider the rhetorical moves in Ottobah Cugoano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evils of Slavery </span> and Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>; and read novels and novel fragments that tell the story of mixed-race heroines,
                     including <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</span>. We will also read a few anti-slavery poems and lectures with an eye towards thinking
                     about how representations of people of color are shaped by generic conventions.</p> 
                  <p>The abolitionist movement is one of the first political events British white women
                     organized themselves around, so we will pay special attention to nineteenth-century
                     women writers including Jane Austen (<span style="font-style:italic">Sanditon</span>), Maria Edgeworth (“The Grateful Negro”), Amelia Opie (<span style="font-style:italic">Adeline Mowbray</span>), and Mary Wollstonecraft (excerpts from <span style="font-style:italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span>). In addition to these primary texts, we will also consider the period’s material
                     and visual culture and spend time thinking about how anti-slavery ideologies are reinterpreted
                     in popular culture. We’ll read these primary texts in the context of Critical Race
                     Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent Romanticist critical discourses
                     that reimagine the post-colonial project.</p>

               <p> In the first few classes, students reacted to this course in a number of ways, almost
                  all of which resisted its premise. Some of this was, I suspect, the natural performance
                  of skepticism that graduate students bring to courses as they feel their way through
                  the dynamics of the class. Some of the resistance was based on how much this course
                  differed from how they had been taught Romanticism as undergraduates. However much
                  they had read of the period before they took my course, these students tended to understand
                  it as a period where there are no Black people or people of color, no questions about
                  identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary activities took
                  place in France. Even students sympathetic to the idea of race and representation
                  in the period were skeptical about the seminar, thinking that my approach to our reading
                  was a theoretical or temporal sleight of hand. This was one of the reasons I didn’t
                  begin this with Wordsworth’s “To Toussaint L’Ouverture.” With its “whistling rustic”
                  and “common wind,” Wordsworth’s sonnet reads to students as consistent with Romantic
                  tropes in general and the aesthetics of his work. I followed up this sonnet with C.L.R
                  James’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Black Jacobins</span> and that helped reorient students to the geographies of slavery and abolition.For
                  students trained in African-American studies, this class was a revelation that invited
                  them to revisit the “Trans” in the Transatlantic Slave Trade. For so many of them
                  the history of the transatlantic slave trade has elided England’s role in it and the
                  hollowness of “emancipation.”</p>
               <p>The most animated class discussions were sparked by the 1808 <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale, A Novel</span>. Even though they preferred reading novels to poetry, graduate students loved and
                  hated the novel in equal measure. The novel, which tells the story about the daughter
                  of an enslaved Black woman and a planter with family in England, disrupts their expectations
                  of both the “tragic mulatto” narrative and the courtship novel. Many students confessed
                  that they wanted the novel’s heroine Olivia Fairfield to recover from her marriage
                  to a bigamist by marrying an early suitor in the novel and wrestled with their own
                  need for a happy ending that ends in nuptials rather than the independence that come
                  with being a wealthy woman who returns to with no master—chattel to no man, free from
                  her father’s bizarre will requiring her to marry a distant cousin in order to inherit,
                  emancipated from the racist strictures of British society—to her home in Jamaica.
                  In response to the revelation that Olivia’s husband August Merton already has a wife,
                  her servant Dido announces that she “has no master” after the biracial heroine discovers
                  that her husband is an accidental bigamist. Dido is not only furious about how her
                  mistress has been treated by her husband’s family but is also frustrated to find herself
                  demoted from a grand home to a more modest cottage. We thought about the idea of a
                  “master” in multiple registers—as the titular head of a wealthy English home and,
                  given that Dido is from Jamaica and marked linguistically as other, as man who bought
                  and sold captured African women and men or could claim legal ownership from birth.
                  We also thought about Dido’s body and the space she and Olivia occupy materially and
                  imaginatively in the novel. The novel’s inflections of marriage and/as slavery and
                  women and/as chattel underscored our discussions of all the fiction we read. We compared
                  Olivia to Wollstonecraft’s description of ideal women in <span style="font-style:italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </span>and considered the end of the novel in the context of the matriarchal utopia episode
                  of John Stedman’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</span>.</p>

                     idea, I find I am ambivalent about some of the projects that emerge from this stance.
                     Part of this is because of the way that such an approach is framed. Projects that
                     work to question our assumptions about Romanticism and its entanglements with race
                     and representation make sense. These interrogations tend to stay tightly focused,
                     and rely on the kind of archival thinking that a scholar like Rebecca Schneider deploys
                     in her <span style="font-style:italic">European Romantic Review</span> essay “‘He says he is free’: Narrative Fragments and Self-Emancipation in West Indian
                     Runaway Advertisements.” I worry about an approach that reads these works as ways
                     to “humanize” people of color by reading the primary texts (the literary and the historical)
                     as documentaries that teach us about the past. They don’t. They show us select representations
                     of the past. As Marcus Wood observes in <span style="font-style:italic">Blind Memory: Visual Representations of Slavery in England and America</span>: <span class="quote">‘“The experiences of millions of individuals who were the victims of slavery is not
                        collectable; it is unrecoverable as a set of relics. There can be no archeology of
                        the memory of slavery that corresponds to an emotional identification with a lost
                        reality” (7).’</span> Those representations certainly influence our contemporary notions of race, but Britain’s
                     abolitionist project feels too complex to be read as a template for what we can and
                     cannot do in the twenty-first century. It is a viewpoint that is appealing to students
                     who are less interested in literary analysis and more invested in sociological projects.
                     The problem with this approach is that it replicates the same problematic assumptions
                     about who we read so that writers are good or bad depending on how they feed into
                     our notions of social justice. As I discuss below by way of conclusion, this is different
                     than the connections my undergraduates make between abolitionist-era politics and
                     this contemporary moment. Despite reading many of the same texts, undergraduates tend
                     to identify structural similarities between the two periods, especially the way that
                     British abolitionist construct themselves in relationship to the Black figures they
                     claim to support. Graduate students, especially women of color and white women, tend
                     to see in the struggles of the past their own oppressive experiences.</p>
               </div>
               <p>One way this is evident is in reactions to Olivia Fairfield in<span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</span>. Whereas, as I note above, graduate students wrestle with wanting a traditional,
                  heteronormative ending for Olivia, undergraduates are exasperated with her for not
                  confronting the bigotry she encounters. They tend to have no interest in the idea
                  of her marrying. They see that legal and social contracts have failed Olivia, and
                  their focus tends to stay on that fact. The different responses certainly reflect
                  when and how students engage with this material. Undergraduates are still developing
                  the analytic skills that graduate students are refining on the way to planning longer
                  projects that will make critical interventions into existing discourse. Their different
                  reactions also reflect the readings students bring to the class. In this graduate
                  seminar, most of the students were very familiar with Regency-era literature and read
                  it by choice. I think that for them Olivia Fairfield was a brown version of the white
                  heroines they read for pleasure and for escape. Undergraduates encountered her in
                  the context of abolitionist debates. As a result they see her as yet another person
                  of color navigating nineteenth-century racism. Perhaps both groups, generally speaking,
                  are simply projecting their own values onto the text, and I prefer the projection
                  that aligns with my own thinking. I get excited when I see my students recognizing
                  patterns of structural violence and nervous when they individualize what they read
                  in my classes. The latter seems to me more a starting point than the end of an intellectual
                  project. This seems a good pedagogical problem to have; in both cases students are
                  animated about and engaged with the work of understanding and ecosystem that they
                  still see as operating today.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">***</span></h2>
               <p>For all that I want students to see my class discussions, indeed my class as a whole,
                  as a place to work out ideas, free from punitive critique and the pressure to perform
                  a particular politics, I have been gratified when they make connections between our
                  reading and the contemporary political landscape, and I have been relieved when they
                  feel they can talk about their political concerns in this class. What I admired about
                  the student’s “WTF?!?!” has happened in classes again, in more muted but no less intense
                  ways. After the 2016 election, many of the who students enrolled in my section of
                  “Writing for the Major” did so because they saw it as a space where they could talk
                  about the racist violence they saw in the country. The words “Black Lives Matter”
                  were never spoken. But Black students in the class were very open about the fear they
                  felt. I will always remember the Black woman who said, “I feel like I have to fight
                  the same battles my ancestors already won.” The white students around her were visibly
                  shocked by her candor. With no prompting from me students in the class were more likely
                  to choose research projects that connected representations of violence in abolitionist
                  culture to violence they were reading about in the news. One student, for example,
                  wrote a research essay about Equiano’s description of psychological violence and the
                  case of Kalief Browder, wrongly imprisoned after police suspected him of stealing
                  a backpack. Another student prepared a research presentation that traced depictions
                  of Black women’s bodies fromSarah Baartman to the present, revisiting Christina Sharpe’s
                  discussion of Kara Walker. Among themselves students started discussing the challenges
                  and risks of confronting racist moments in their lives away from school. Ave DuVernay’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">13<sup>th</sup></span>was released in 2016, and by 2017 some of my students had watched, and brought it
                  up enough in class discussions that their peers watched it too.</p>
               <p>There were difficult debates too. Smart, thoughtful students asked earnest questions
                  with racist overtones, and I had to walk a fine line. I had to moderate those discussions
                  without leaving students asking troubling questions feeling dismissed and while also
                  protecting the feelings of that students who would feel those questions most keenly
                  because of their “heritable characteristics.” In those discussions, Coleridge’s lecture
                  was quite helpful. He lays out five pro-slavery arguments and then debunks them. In
                  more than one class, skeptical students benefitted from our close attention to what
                  underscored the pro-slavery debates Coleridge references. </p>
               <p>In the scant ground of a course reading list, it can be particularly challenging to
                  include new authors, especially if one wants to go about the work with care. As Miriam
                  Wallace and I noted in our Romantic Pedagogy Commons issue, Annette Kolodny was right
                  when she describes the challenges of changing what and how we teach: “Radical breaks
                  are tiring, demanding, uncomfortable, and sometimes wholly beyond our comprehension”
                  (12). But I think the outcomes are worth the effort, and no one taking on this work
                  is doing so alone. There are so many resources available and models to follow. I am
                  thinking especially of the “<a class="link_ref" href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/index.html">Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom”</a> digital humanities project. The site is a repository of peer-reviewed syllabi, recorded
                  discussions about teaching, and sample units for faculty use. Similar projects are
                  in the works in eighteenth-century studies as well.An abolitionist Romanticism course
                  captures most students’ imaginations because they tend to think of slavery and abolition
                  as uniquely American. Thinking about race, racism, and slavery in a British context
                  gives them space to workout knotty, unnerving questions about these complex issues.
                  At the same time, it helps them read contemporary progressive movements in more nuanced
                  ways. I have found that in learning about an abolitionist Romanticism, students are
                  not only studying historical texts and their connection to a movement, but are learning
                  more about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.</p>

               what ungirds women’s participation in abolitionist discourse. By far, Matthew D. Brown’s
