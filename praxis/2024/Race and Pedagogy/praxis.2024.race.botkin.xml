            <p>Frances Botkin, Towson University</p>
            <p>Reading literature about slavery gives students a glimpse into Black lives in the
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but that’s not enough. Romantic era accounts of
                slavery can whitewash the harrowing realities of plantation life. The authors of
                these texts themselves acknowledge the ways their texts endure the interventions of
                their editors or imagined audiences. Whether excerpted, edited and “mard” (John
                Stedman), transcribed or “pruned” (Mary Prince), “styled” (Olaudah Equiano), or
                “soiled” (William Earle), these texts bear the marks of the literary and social
                institutions and cultures that produced them. My pedagogical approach relies upon
                introducing students to other kinds of texts beyond Romantic era narratives to
                animate colonial textuality with the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture
                that in revising the past, imagines and nourishes future worlds. Inspired by
                Afro-Jamaican “tun yuh han mek fashion” techniques of improvisation and
                sustainability, I work with these materials, often contemporary and often
                non-literary, to refashion Romanticism.</p>
            <p>Trelawny Maroon and Rastafarian, Ga’aama Gloria Simms (she goes by the honorific MaMa
                G), taught me about tunyuhan. The term refers to the Jamaican proverb, “tun yuh han
                (turn your hand) mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best use of any available
                resources to create something new.” Afrocentric and inherently revolutionary, as
                Kaiton Williams argues, tunyuhan “is tied up with<hi rend="color(#222222)"> the
                    multiple and evolving sources of income and pastimes” (Williams).</hi>
                <note xml:id="ftn1" place="end" n="1"> Kaiton Williams associates tun yuh han with
                    the “DIY mentality” that defines the Jamaican response to “material absence” as
                    well as “<hi rend="color(#222222)">a way to repair a break in the continuity of
                        people and culture sustained in the creation of our New World.” She writes:
                        “all those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence continue to
                        be as much about making our world as about remaking our relation to it,”
                        proposing also that Jamaican multiplicity “is central to our curious embrace
                        of freedom: our expression of our soul and its determination.”</hi></note>
                MaMa G’s “Tunyuhan Project,” for example, plans to create and market a line of
                clothing and accessories made from repurposed materials, and to establish small
                farms that provide jobs and sustenance, thereby empowering Jamaican women and their
                communities. In addition, MaMa G carries her social and intellectual work abroad
                (she has recently given lectures at several universities in the US), bringing home
                resources to benefit her community; she envisions opening a “borderless university,”
                rooted in Jamaica but developed online, to unite local and global communities in the
                growth and dissemination of indigenous knowledge. MaMa G’s financial
                circumstances—in part a rejection of modern capitalism—have inspired her to create
                alternative modes of economic survival that rely upon improvisation and
                adaptability. Intrigued by the concept of tunyuhan, I aspired to apply its
                inventive, integrative practices to my teaching and research. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Tunyuhan in the Field</hi></p>
            <p>I first met MaMa G through my research on the notorious fugitive, Three-Fingered
                Jack, as I tracked stories about the Maroons who killed him. Looking back, I realize
                that our first meeting taught me to (try to) relax into a kind of nonteleological,
                nonlinear methodology, very different from the structure and solipsism of archival
                pursuits. “Everyday life is our classroom,” MaMa G has explained to me, and “if you
                are not living it, you are so far from it [knowledge]” (interview). My “field work”
                in Jamaica has taught me to find knowledge everywhere, reveling in what Paul
                Youngquist calls “ambient knowledge” (“Accident,” 218).<note xml:id="ftn22"
                    place="end" n="2"> Shalani Puri has proposed that we consider what she calls
                    “field work in the Humanities” for access to “knowledge and expression
                    unavailable in print; to disallowed or delegitimized knowledges; to localized or
                    vernacular rather than globalized knowledge or memory” (59).</note> I have found
                it in the “yards” (homes) of contemporary Maroons, in conversations with taxi
                drivers, with fellow passengers on buses, in rum shops, at music events, on road
                trips, and etched in the landscape of the island; I’ve had conversations about
                Three-Fingered Jack in kitchens, in farmyards, on hiking trails, in rivers, on
                mountains, and in bat-filled caves. Cooperative, networked, improvisational, and
                dynamic, these perspectives have galvanized my research. </p>
            <p>The connections I’ve made in Jamaica took time and tunyuhan to evolve into
                collaboration. My field work began with the Maroons of Charles Town, when their
                remarkable colonel, the late Frank Lumsden, introduced me to his community and,
                indirectly, to MaMa G. Colonel Lumsden and I first met at Kingston’s Red Bones Blues
                Café in 2008, upon his delivery of one of his paintings to its proprietor and our
                mutual friend, Evan Williams. We had been hearing about each other for months. Over
                cold Red Stripes, I asked Colonel Lumsden if I might visit Charles Town to interview
                him and others about Three-Fingered Jack. As it happened, Colonel Lumsden had been
                looking for an academic to organize an international conference in Charles Town to
                fulfill his international vision of a global indigenous community without borders.
                We struck a deal, and this relationship continues to enrich and beautifully
                complicate my life, even after his death in 2015. I traveled to Portland, Jamaica to
                help with the first Charles Town International Maroon Conference in 2009, and in
                those summer months I spent time with Colonel Sterling of Moore Town, Kim Douglas
                (now Acting Colonel of Charles Town), Lynette Wilkes, Worries McCurbin, Brother
                Isaac Bernard, Keith Lumsden, and other Windward Maroons, building relationships
                that have grown since. It took another two years for me to meet MaMa G, entirely by
                chance, through Colonel Prehay of the Scots Hall Maroons. </p>
            <p>I met with Colonel Prehay in the temporary office of a visiting Maroon official in
                uptown Kingston. I found it in an official-looking residential building adjacent to
                the wedding-cake-shaped Devon House, an estate built in 1881 by Jamaica’s first
                black millionaire. In their distinctive coconut hats, Col. Prehay and MaMa G sat
                patiently in the waiting area amidst the pastel décor of the mysterious office.
                Neither had much to say about Jack Mansong. But MaMa G did have quite a bit to say
                about Indigenous Maroon women, the Trelawny Maroons, and the power of improvisation
                for sustainability. I didn’t get information for my book that day, but I decided to
                follow my instincts, realizing, when she invited me to her home, that from this wise
                woman I could learn something.</p>
            <p>A few days later and after some logistical mishaps, I arrived at MaMa G’s East
                Kingston home with what would become my customary offering: a pineapple, four Red
                Stripes, and an orange juice for her granddaughter, Cookie. MaMa G’s East Kingston
                yard provided a haven, with multiple signs of her community involvement in evidence.
                I wasn’t sure exactly what I was doing there, because MaMa G had expressed a marked
                lack of interest in Three-Fingered Jack. But I felt drawn to her energy, and our
                initial conversations focused on her departure from the social work program at the
                University of the West Indies and her subsequent commitment to grassroots community
                organizing. That afternoon MaMa G introduced me to the concept of tunyuhan as she
                carefully stitched an elaborate hat wrought with coconut husk and recycled thread, a
                creation she would proudly wear as she delivered a talk to the United Nations
                several years later. Instead of extricating facts about Three-Fingered Jack, I
                developed strategies for acquiring knowledge beyond the archive. I learned to slow
                down, listen, wait, and even let go of (or at least defer) my intended goals. I
                found that knowledge can be about exchange rather than extraction, and that it
                requires openness, creativity, and improvisation. These skills help in the
                classroom, too.</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Tunyuhan in the Classroom</hi></p>
            <p>I teach at a large public university, and despite our heavy teaching load, most
                English professors have limited opportunities to teach classes in their areas of
                specializations. Our department has been hemorrhaging English majors—a national
                trend—and we thus teach many general education courses and surveys. We rarely offer
                Romanticism or the long eighteenth century (maybe once every three or four
                semesters); when we do, we face extra pressure from students to keep it fresh and
                relevant to our increasingly diverse student population. I use tunyuhan methods to
                make available a more textured and topical understanding of Romantic antislavery
                texts. Motivated by my Jamaican research and the interdisciplinarity of the Maroon
                conference, I use the resources available to me, borrowing from other fields,
                experimenting with different genres, and branching into other centuries. <hi
                    rend="color(#000000)">I used this approach </hi>recently in an upper- level
                seminar for English majors that focused on eighteenth and nineteenth century
                representations of slavery. </p>
            <p>I designed the course to interweave colonial and postcolonial, literary and
                nonliterary texts. With tunyuhan’s multiplicity in mind, I incorporated interviews,
                images, and films to complement and challenge the conventions of literary
                historiography. Organized chronologically, the class began with travel writing
                (Lydia Maria Child’s extracted <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; an Emancipated
                    Slave, of Suriname: From Stedman's Narrative of a Five Year's Expedition Against
                    the Revolted Negroes of Suriname</hi>) and transitioned to Eurocentric fiction
                (John Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> and Victor Hugo’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bug-Jargal</hi>); we followed fiction with the voices of formerly enslaved
                peoples (Mary Prince’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi> and Olaudah Equiano’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi>); and we finished with contemporary
                Jamaican fiction (Marlon James’ <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi>). For
                the sake of this essay, I will discuss only my classroom use of Child, Earle,
                Prince, and James, situating these texts within larger cultural and creative
                contexts. The Maroons played a significant role in my course partly because Romantic
                period texts often elide them, but also because their cultural and spiritual
                practices emphasize the connections I want to make between past, present, and
                future. Each unit also included the creative expressions of contemporary
                Afro-Jamaicans, disrupting the timeline’s linearity to suggest the ways the past
                leaves its mark upon the present, as well as the ways that reimagining the past can
                inspire future generations.</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">The tunyuhan approach will vary in the hands of different
                    teachers and scholars, because it involves the creative pursuit of individual
                    interests and inspirations. One makes the best use of their available resources,
                    whatever they may entail for that person. Rather than following a list of
                    suggested texts, videos, or websites, the teacher/scholar will experiment with
                    unique combinations of texts or ideas. Dynamic and topical, tunyuhan opens up
                    possibilities and connections.</hi><hi rend="color(#000000)"><note
                        xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="3"> A reviewer of this essay thoughtfully
                        asked me what the tunyuhan approach would look like in different hands than
                        mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet people like MaMa G. In short,
                        every person will have a different approach based on their interests and
                            resources.<hi rend="color(#000000)">My collaboration with the Maroons
                            and MaMa G grew from my interest their history in relationship to my
                            Three-Fingered Jack project. It took years to cultivate these
                            relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led me to other
                            opportunites, too. The Charles Town Maroon Conference &amp; Festival,
                            for example, continues to offer opportunities for professors and
                            graduate students to engage with and learn about Maroon culture from
                            contemporary Maroons and Indigenous peoples and scholars from around the
                            world. </hi></note></hi></p>
            <p>My work with the Charles Town Maroon conference has increasingly informed my teaching
                as well as my research. Set in the Asafu Yard (once the communal space to prepare
                for battle), it combines academic panels with drumming, dancing, wellness workshops,
                and sacred ritual. Interdisciplinary, intergenerational, and collaborative, this
                event takes academics out of their comfort zone and creates connections with
                contemporary Maroons, local Jamaicans, and other international scholars. Researchers
                meet the descendants of the people they study and teach; they hear their voices,
                listen to their stories, and dance to their music. Literary scholars mingle with
                geographers, geneticists with poets, and Maroons with ethnomusicologists. </p>
            <p>Many of the visiting scholars fold archival time into this trip, and their research
                shifts as they move through experiences with people that, unlike archival records,
                speak to and with them. Experiencing alternative models for the production of
                knowledge, participants return to their campuses with more than the photocopies and
                facts that serve the archival imperative and its hierarchies. I’ve worked to bring
                this kind of knowledge into my classroom, <hi rend="color(#000000)">using (filmed,
                    digitized, or recorded) </hi>Maroon stories, songs, rituals, and artwork, for
                example, to enliven the print texts. This “undisciplined” mode of assembly responds
                to the call for what Christina Sharpe calls “wake work” and attends to the
                “largeness that is Black Life, Black life insisted from death” (17). These materials
                also can show the limitations, porousness, and vulnerabilities of logocentric
                knowledge.</p>
            <p>John Gabriel Stedman, author of <hi rend="color(#000000)italic">The Narrative of a
                    Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi><hi
                    rend="color(#000000)"> (1796),</hi> himself bemoaned the editorial intrusions
                that “mard” his narrative. An officer in the Scots Brigade deployed to Suriname to
                quell the revolt of the Maroons (1772), Stedman submitted his narrative to Joseph
                Johnson. The 1796 published version, much to Stedman’s dissatisfaction, differed
                significantly from his original account, particularly in its representation of
                Joanna (documented in Richard and Sally Price’s 1998 transcription of his 1790
                manuscript). I won’t rehearse here the fascinating intricacies of what Dustin
                Kennedy has termed the “Stedman Archive,” though I did begin there with my
                    students.<note xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="4"> See Dustin Kennedy’s “Going
                    Viral.” Also see Jenny Sharpe’s<hi rend="italic">Ghosts of Slavery</hi>, <hi

                chose for my course text, however, not Stedman’s narrative, but Lydia Maria Child’s
                extraction of it, <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna: An Emancipated Slave, of
                    Suriname,</hi> first published in the 1834 gift book, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Oasis. </hi>I wanted to track different kinds of mediations that characterize
                writings about slavery, even when produced by white men with a certain amount of
                power. <note xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="5"> The narrative first appeared in
                    London (1834) as<hi rend="italic">Joanna, or the Female Slave: A West Indian
                        Tale. </hi> In this her second version, Child replaced "female slave" with
                    "emancipated slave," though Joanna remained enslaved until her death.</note></p>
            <p>Child appropriated Stedman’s narrative for her own abolitionist purposes, but not
                without ideological contradictions. For example, she admires the domestic affections
                of Stedman and Joanna, yet insists that abolitionists do not “induce anyone to marry
                a mulatto, even if his life has been saved by such a one” (3). Her concerns with
                propriety and miscegenation extend to her visual choices, and she replaces
                Holloway’s image of a bare-breasted Joanna with Smith’s more modest one, prompting
                one irritated but engaged student to ask, “What’s up with her boobie?” A good
                question. It’s a cover up. Jenny Sharpe has suggested that covering Joanna’s breasts
                desexualizes and yet emphasizes her role as wife and mother, registering the gender
                politics of women abolitionists like Child (85). My students and I agreed that it
                also covers up the violence visited upon enslaved women, whitewashing the realities
                of sexual exploitation in the colonies. In addition, Child almost entirely excludes

                Stedman to Suriname in the first place. I had the students read a few Maroon-focused
                chapters from Stedman’s narrative with some Maroon historiography, which sparked
                their interest in the history of these self-emancipated Afro-Caribbean peoples.</p>
            <p>Applying tunyuhan and improvising, I gave the students some additional background on
                the Maroons of Suriname and Jamaica and showed them a video of MaMa G’s enstoolment
                by the Okanisi Maroons as the first woman Gaa’ma, the highest political position
                among the Maroons of Suriname.<note xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="6"> Also spelled

                Caribbean today. Because the ceremony took place at the Maroon conference, students
                saw the interactions between the local community and visiting scholars at this
                particularly moving event, showing them a different kind of scholarly method. (<ptr

            <p>Next, the class viewed a short docudrama about Nanny of the Maroons, <hi

                <hi rend="italic">Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </hi>(2015), featuring MaMa G
                in a dramatization of the title character. Overtly addressing the dearth of archival
                material about Nanny (only four sources), Roy Anderson’s film features oral
                histories, music, and dance as its mode of cultural transmission, and it includes
                interviews with Maroon leaders, Olympic athletes, politicians, and historians. My
                students especially liked the footage of a group of scholars and Maroons hiking to
                the remote former military stronghold of Nanny Town. As one student wrote: </p>
            <p>The expedition to Nanny Town up in the mountains shows that even now islanders still
                hold to these ancient places and honor the spirits of the past there. I was
                surprised to learn that many of the places in Jamaican folklore still exist such as
                Nanny Town to remember a leader who took down the British, a kick-butt woman who
                could catch bullets in her butt. (student response paper).<note xml:id="ftn22"

            <p>Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi; or the History of Three-Fingered Jack </hi>likewise
                elides the role of the Maroons in his epistolary account of the fugitive from
                slavery who was captured and killed by them in 1780. Earle’s novel falls short of
                its abolitionist reach, and though it confuses the status of Maroons, it does reveal
                the complex dynamics of a colonial state that pitted Afro-Jamaicans against one
                another. The weepy, unreliable narrator, however, inspires little confidence,
                especially in his repetition of the phrase, “I am no author” (118). Famously
                overwrought and ideologically incoherent, Earle’s “sentimentalist abolitionism,”
                though brilliantly edited and annotated by Srinivas Aravamudan, has never been a
                crowd-pleaser for my students (Aravamudan 8, 50).<note xml:id="ftn22" place="end"
                    n="10"> Aravamudan writes that Obi “is written with a view to eliciting the
                    feeling tear or melancholic sigh of the sentimentalist reader and the
                    abolitionist activist” (8).</note>
            </p>
            <p>I can’t blame the students for their frustration with Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi,
                </hi>against which we, much more to their interest, explored contemporary images of
                Jack and the Maroon who killed him. First, we studied Jamaican artist Omari
                “Afrikan” Ra’s extraordinary painting of Three-Fingered Jack (n.d.), and the class
                listened to my recorded interview with the artist, who spoke of the influences of
                revolutionaries Makandal and Dutty Boukman. The students used Ra’s image (and words)
                to imagine a more nuanced picture of the infamous outlaw. They commented on his
                hard, intense stare and the words etched around his neck, perhaps suggesting the
                ways he’s been imprisoned by print. The students also found it interesting to think
                about Jack’s relationship to Quashie (also called John Reeder), the Maroon who took
                off Jack’s fingers and later killed him. Colonel Lumsden’s stunning painting of
                Quashie, in white face paint and rendered in “ambush,” depicts the complexity of
                this underrepresented figure in Jack’s story.<note xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="11"

            <p>One student commented, “the depth and intricacy of Quashie’s eyes and the surrounding
                patterns of greenery remind us that, in the end, Quashie is still a Maroon and that
                he would make his own ruthless decisions”(Fig. 1). These Afrocentric images of Jack
                and his killer usefully trouble Eurocentric textual accounts of colonial Jamaica
                with their depictions of proud black warriors brought into opposition with one
                another by a brutal system. </p>
            <p>To conclude the Three-Fingered Jack unit, we watched clips of dance hall/reggae
                artist Buju Banton’s “Long Walk to Freedom Tour.” This self-identified Maroon was
                released from a US prison in December, 2018, reminding my students that the
                prison-industrial complex functions as an extension of plantation slavery (Kreps).
                Buju Banton also represents a potent expression of black agency, harnessing the
                legacy of the island’s first freedom-fighters. Putting Earle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Obi</hi> in conversation with contemporary Jamaican art and music amplifies
                Jack’s militant legacy of uncompromising resistance.</p>

            <p> The same year that Buju Banton was sentenced to ten years in a United States jail
                (2009), Marlon James published<hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women, </hi>a
                grisly reimagining of Jamaican plantation slavery that insists upon and complicates
                black agency in a system that rewards accommodation. James’ novel links thematically
                and geographically to Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> (and to Buju Banton), and

            <p>Much like Child’s <hi rend="italic">Joanna</hi>, Prince’s anti-slavery narrative

            </p>
            <p>Prince’s narrative alludes to sexual assault by her “indecent” enslaver but goes no
                further than describing his “ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked” and
                ordering her “to wash him in a tub of water” (21). When she would resist, he would
                beat her severely, once prompting her to run away until the next morning. Prince’s
                account interweaves silences about rape with acts of resistance. Yet, even as Prince
                censors her narrative to protect herself from allegations of promiscuity, Pringle
                included a letter in his supplement that refers to Prince’s sexual relationships
                with Capt.---, “connexions “so common . . . as to be universal.” Pringle’s
                ambiguating supplemental materials gave my students the tools to piece together a
                version of her experience that reveals black agency and exposes some of the truths
                (the “common connexions”) concealed by a white literary culture. But it was Marlon

                    >The Book of Night </hi><hi rend="italic">Women </hi>(2009) that students most
                fully engaged. In his riveting novel, James adapts Prince’s bathtub incident to
                foreground rather than silence the violence of rape on the plantation, imagining,
                too, how revenge might look. </p>
            <p> In the<hi rend="italic">Book of Night Women, </hi>the mixed-race protagonist Lilith
                spills hot soup on a visitor while serving dinner, enduring daily lashings and a
                gang rape as punishment until her enslaver sends her to be seasoned by his future
                parents-in-law. At her new post, Lilith’s rage boils over, and when Massa Roget
                demands his bath-time sexual servicing (clearly evoking Prince), Lilith drowns him
                and sets fire to the house to hide the evidence, killing all its inhabitants, adults
                and children, enslaved and free. Despite this act, Lilith resists joining plans for
                a multi-plantation rebellion engineered by the enslaved Homer, the head domestic,
                the head “house slave” and Lilith’s half-sisters, the titular “Night Women.”
                Instead, Lilith becomes mistress “concubine” to the new overseer, Quinn, because she
                needs his protection from her previous tormentors. Already scarred with a “quilt” on
                her back, Lilith fears the fate of Homer, who once ran away, and when caught by
                Maroons, underwent a public flogging: “<hi

                    suspects she can keep her own breasts intact and (like Joanna) covered.
                    Ambivalent and with divided loyalties, </hi>Lilith at once accommodates and
                undermines the plantation system, oblivious to the contradictions that link her to
                the Maroons, of whom the novel frequently criticizes for their collaboration with
                the British.<note xml:id="ftn22" place="end" n="16"><p> In a process that involved
                        written documents and the ritual oath of drinking blood mixed with rum, the
                        British treated with the Maroons in 1739. The British and Maroons held
                        completely different notions about the treaty. The British viewed it as the
                        means to control the Maroons, and the infamous ninth clause commits the
                        Maroons to returning fugitives and putting down island rebellions. For
                        Maroons, the treaty celebrated their victory over the English after eighty
                        years of war. Many non-Maroon Jamaicans view the Maroons as traitors because
                        of the treaty, not unreasonably, driving anti-Maroon sentiment in Jamaica
                        today. I view the treaty as another example of English methods of divide and
                        conquer, pitting Afro-Jamaicans against one another.</p><p>For accounts of

                guides the Night Women in African-descended rituals that challenge European systems
                of power and knowledge. Homer works the system, using all tools available, and she,

                            Plot and Plantation,” Wynter argues that the history of Caribbean
                            society “is that of a dual relation between the plantation (the elite)
                            and the plot (the folk), the two poles which originate in a single
                            process” (95). In doing so they created a folk culture that persists in
                            resistant “secretive” histories, expressed, for example, in folk songs,
                            Kumina practices, or Myal rituals (95). Wynter avers that Caribbean
                            literature registers the ambivalence between the plot and the plantation
                            but sees the ambivalence as at once the “root cause” of alienation” as
                            well as its “salvation” (95). In “Talking about a Little

                (426-7). Lovey documents the Night Women’s brave battles and violent deaths, learned
                through Homer and Lilith from songs devised and disseminated by Lilith’s half-sister
                Gorgon; these songs celebrated the Night Women and scorned the white creoles, who

                    “live like a free negro” though she’s not free (422). Injured almost to the
                    point of death, Homer survives to live in the shadow of the plantation, leaving
                    behind her scent of lemongrass, hiding forever after in the bush.</note> In
                large part a text about textual memory (as the title suggests) and its relationship
                to its folk counterpart, James’ narrative probes the complexities of telling stories
                about slavery, then and now. </p>
            <p>The inclusion of <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women </hi>on my syllabus raised
                some eyebrows. Indeed, contemporary debates about content warnings in the classroom
                have in some cases prompted institutional resistance to exposing the gruesome
                details and residues of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Yet the study of texts about
                slavery should, with all due respect and sensitivity toward the experiences or
                traumas of students, confront and illuminate the historical realities that have
                shaped the antiblackness and structural racism of current cultures. My “note on
                content” in my syllabus acknowledges that these texts touch on the lived experiences
                of some students more than others, demanding respect and tolerance as we move
                through difficult material. James’ unapologetically graphic language and violent
                imagery understandably disturbed the students, but it also extended and enriched our
                ongoing conversation about the sanitization of representations of slavery. </p>
            <p>Many of the students wrote their seminar papers about <hi rend="italic">The Book of
                    Night Women</hi>, because, they explained, they found it strangely compelling
                and unlike anything they’d ever read. Almost every page reveals some devastating
                detail of slavery as it harrowingly pursues the elisions and ambivalences sometimes
                found even in overtly antislavery texts. James has been <hi

                            relevance to Black British writing as it revises “the way British
                            history is understood and remembered [by exploring the continuing
                            legacies of slavery into twenty-first century realities—economic and
                            social inequity , racism, and the impossibility of social belong—which
                            suggests that it is only by the full avowal of the past of slavery that
                            the present might be understood and the future imagined” (2).</p><p

                    I find James’ novel a particularly useful though unsettling way to reconsider
                    the history of slavery and its Romantic period representations. Even</hi>
                arguably anti-slavery texts and politically aware interpretations of them reflect
                the structural racism of the institutions (nineteenth-century British plantation
                and/or literary culture and twenty-first century academia, for example) that
                participate in the cultural production of race. In <hi
                    rend="color(#1d2129) background-color(#ffffff)">putting the creative expressions
                    of contemporary black culture in conversation with eighteenth and nineteenth
                    century literary texts, I hope to move beyond glimpses of Black lives under
                    slavery into broader landscapes that privilege Black agency, resistance, and
                    critique.</hi></p>
            <p>Interweaving different kinds of texts in new combinations, I conjure the spirit of
                tunyuhan and its commitment to creating new things from old materials. This idea is
                not new to Romanticism. Mary Shelley, for example, writes in her Introduction to <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> that invention is borne out of chaos, and
                “consists in the power of moulding and <hi rend="italic">fashioning</hi> ideas
                suggested to it” (emphasis mine). As her novel shows, people tend to fear what they
                view to be “dark” or “shapeless,” but the modern academy generally and the field of
                Romanticism particularly could benefit from some creative if uncomfortable admixture
                to animate existing materials. Bakary Diaby has asked Romanticists to “do the work”
                to change the way we study Blackness in Romanticism (249).<hi

            <p>This past spring, I was going to take a group of students on a study abroad program
                to Jamaica, taking my classroom into the field. Like most research and all
                conference travel that year, “Histories of Resistance in Jamaica” was cancelled by
                Covid. Instead, my institution asked me to develop a four-week online course that
                would give my students the Jamaica experience (!). Improvising with the medley of
                materials available to me (some from the class I just described), I created the
                course, including a public event on Blackboard Collaborate Ultra that featured MaMa
                G. Instead of the activities she and I had planned for my 15 Jamaica-bound students,
                she gave an interactive workshop for 40 students and faculty titled “Re-awakening
                the Knowledge and Wisdoms of Indigenous Women in Times of Covid-19.” With the
                (occasionally blurry) Ultra phone app and the Blue Mountains misting over the Asafu
                Yard, MaMa G created a unique virtual space for student engagement. </p>
            <p>In a conversation that invoked the creative invention and adaptability of tunyuhan,
                MaMa G emphasized “Maroon principles of survival,” grafted from “knowledge [we]
                brought from Africa, learned from the [indigenous] Taino, and even now it continues”
                (1:22). Calling for a “shift in consciousness,” a “reawakening,” she urges a return
                to indigenous knowledge that values other cultures and respects the natural
                environment from which “we can always find a solution.” Wellness, she concluded,
                “comes from communication between body, earth, mind, spirit, and land—it’s all part
                of our healing.” </p>
            <p>As teachers of texts about slavery, we can show students that the problems of modern
                capitalism are ongoing and interrelated, as demonstrated by the racism, police
                brutality, and unrest during the 2020 COVID crisis, a public health catastrophe
                particularly critical for underserved black communities. The creative and exciting
                global responses to these events signal, as MaMa G suggests, an outcry and an
                opportunity for change. We can re-make Romanticism, changing our approach to texts
                about slavery to confront and illuminate their violence and amnesia, but also to
                incorporate and celebrate the “largeness that is Black life” (Sharpe 17). If we want
                our institutions and disciplines to survive, we need to work with the materials we
                have to create something new and sustainable. Tun yuh han mek fashion. </p>
