            <p>— Fred Moten, “Black Op” (2008a)</p>
         </section>
         <section class="essay" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2">
            <p>In the spring semester of 2014, eighteen months prior to the course I describe in
               this essay, I had begun to study Afropessimism during a graduate seminar on global
               modernism. The following summer—when officers of the New York Police Department killed
               Eric Garner; when police officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown; when a highly
               militarized police force intensified its occupation of Ferguson, Missouri; when Claudia
               Rankine published <span style="font-style:italic">Citizen; </span>when Black feminist activists founded the Movement for Black Lives; and Sandra Bland
               died in prison after her arrest following a pretextual traffic stop—Afropessimism
               offered an analytically rigorous and unflinching account of the paradigm of “ontological
               terror” in which these events had occurred, as well as a framework for reevaluating
               my fledgling pedagogical practices (Warren 2018). Emerging in part from the acknowledgment
               of a continuum that links racial slavery to the anti-Blackness of whiteness, policing,
               and the state, Afropessimism challenges conventional accounts of civic reason and
               historical progress and produces a conceptual break to think through the paradigmatic
               anti-Blackness of global modernity in “the afterlife of slavery” (Hartman 2006).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In Afropessimism, the paradigm of anti-Blackness explains the performance of anti-Black
                  racism in higher education as much as it explains the performance of anti-Black policing.
                  As context for the discussion on pedagogy that follows, I will briefly describe a
                  spate of anti-Black violence on the campus of University of Massachusetts Amherst
                  that took place in the fall of 2014. Content warning: though I describe some of the
                  language as it appeared on campus that fall, my purpose in doing so is not to transgress
                  the suffering of African Americans and other people of color, but to refuse a practice
                  so common to neoliberal institutionality by which systemic racism and structural violence
                  are hushed in the service of a recommitment to the institution. At the time, the anti-Black
                  language I reference here led to the organization of somber events about “standing
                  together against racism,” to sanctimonious acts of “reflection,” to repetitious commitments
                  to “diversity and tolerance,” and to administrative calls to “work together to reaffirm
                  our values of inclusion and respect for all.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>&gt; An event called “Standing Together Against Racism: A Week of Reflection, A Day of
                           Solidarity” was organized by The Anti-Racism Committee of English Students and Faculty
                           and featured a full-day “Solidarity Read-In” that I participated in on November 4,
                           2014. The phrase “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect for
                           all“ was published in a university-wide email by Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy, “Incidents
                           of Racist Vandalism,” on October 14, 2014.</span></div>
                  </div> There was little institutional recognition, however, of the well-documented history
                  of anti-Black violence as a longstanding tenet of the University at large, little
                  space or outlet for the expression of Black anger, suffering, or rage, and no answer
                  as to why incidents of anti-Black violence should lead the “community” to <span style="font-style:italic">come together</span> as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic">coming apart</span>. Christina Sharpe comments on how often “the note of a more perfect union, the note
                  of unhearable Black suffering” is struck by leaders on the occasion of anti-Black
                  violence: a striking note that “sutures Black suffering to romance and redemption”
                  (Sharpe 2016). It is a practice far too common that seeks by way of anti-Black institutions
                  solutions to the very problems they give rise to. I therefore refer to the following
                  language in the spirit of anti-romance and an anti-redemptive abolitionism. in the
                  service of an imperfect union.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In October 2014, amidst the cries and lamentations of protestors, a statement calling
               for the killing of two Black students in Harambee (a defined residential community
               for African and African American students) was written on their front door with a
               racial slur. One of the students directly targeted, an undergraduate, had recently
               returned from Ferguson, Missouri, where he had taken part in Ferguson October, a coalition-building
               social movement later known as Ferguson Action. It was written on his door during
               the fatefully named “Columbus Day” weekend (“#WrongDoor”). That same weekend, someone
               else had also written a racist message calling for the death of Hispanic students
               because of perceived linguistic otherness on the door of another dorm room, and the
               following week, several additional students were targeted by a person later identified
               as Devin Ayres, who was charged with property damage in the Eastern Hampshire District
               Court, thereby leaving a public record of his hate-speech (Vidales). According to
               testimony quoted in reports, Ayres wrote the n-word on the door of one student because
               he knew her to be African American, and used it a second time on the door of two white
               students because he knew one of them to be dating an African American man (“UMass
               student charged”). Viewed through an Afropessimist lens, the performance of anti-Black
               sexual racism is neither aberrant nor anomalous, but as banal and procedural as Ayres’s
               court testimony. In a university context, furthermore, the excuse of white ignorance
               should not be allowed its ordinarily stabilizing effect for a multicultural society
               where education is purported to be the antidote to (rather than the cause of) anti-Black
               racism. There was nothing unknowing or unintentional about these acts of violence.
               Their effect appears to have been to restore the order of institutional power.</p>
            <p>A year later, in the fall of 2015, I taught an introductory Ethnic American Literature
               course oriented toward transatlantic (anti)slavery literature whose emphasis on <span style="font-style:italic">legacies </span>engaged constructions of race, gender, and minoritization in narratives of slavery,
               colonialism, emancipation, and political awakening in a campus climate antagonized
               by anti-Black violence. Some of the texts, like Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative </span>(1789) and Edgar Allan Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span> (1838), were drawn from the era of Romanticism properly speaking, and animated our
               discussions of freedom, slavery, persuasion, and unselfpossessed gothic subjectivity.
               Most of them, however, were contemporary texts that take up Romantic-era concepts
               in a “speculative” framework, like Mat Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>(2011), Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </span>(1995/2005), and Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>(1966) — all texts that engage with race, racialization, and the rule of dominance
               in contemporary (anti)slavery. The course I was assigned to teach, “Ethnic American
               Literature,” is defined by the University of Massachusetts Amherst English Department
               as “American literature written by and about ethnic minorities, from the earliest
               immigrants through the cultural representations in modern American writing.” The course
               is traditionally taught as an introduction to immigrant literature, focusing either
               on historical breadth or on a particular literary tradition (e.g. Jewish American
               literature or Asian American literature). I decided to create a version of the course
               that would reckon with the apparent incompatibility of racial slavery with the “immigrant”
               experience. Thus two other themes drove my choice of the “sci-fi” texts on the syllabus,
               namely (time) travel and consciousness. The course aimed to provoke commentary on
               race and (anti)slavery through <span style="font-style:italic">bildungsroman</span> about characters who awaken to the realities of colonialism, conquest, and displacement
               by placing these texts in conversation with both (Critical) Ethnic Studies and Black
               Studies. Though the course I taught was not envisioned a course on Romanticism, then,
               I hope it will be useful to colleagues wishing to experiment with the dialogue between
               Romantic texts and more recent speculative fiction.</p>
            <p>In the initial course design, Afropessimism provided a framework for understanding
               the wave of anti-Black terror as a brief moment of disequilibrium in the hegemony
               of everyday violence held over from slavery, rather than some shocking set of events
               unrelated to the political structure of the University. I wanted students to engage
               with this continuum, to question their assumptions about the “pastness” of slavery,
               the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the postracialism of the contemporary.
               I wanted them to feel authorized to use the space of the classroom to acknowledge
               the profound suffering on campus and to partake of the unspeakable rage of its injustice.
               In the epigraphs above, Fred Moten speaks to a “dehiscence at the heart of the institution,”
               seizing on the ambiguity of that term to indicate how Black Studies attends to the
               structural vulnerability of critical thought in the University, where Black Studies
               is constantly vulnerable to regulation, defunding, and marginalization. A (wound)
               dehiscence is an opening in a plant that allows seeds to disperse as well as a gaping
               incision in a body (politic) prone to infection. I did not at the time conceive of
               my pedagogy as a “dehiscent” one, but upon reflection, I see how teaching (in) the
               epistemic and psychosocial wounds of slavery pushed my class toward shared vulnerability
               rather than inviolable strength, and how this shifted the goals of student learning
               from individual mastery of the subject toward “unthinking mastery” through expressions
               of humility, collectivity, and selflessness (Singh).</p>
            <p>As we moved from Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> to the text it annotates (Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span>), the first half of the course addressed what Johnson calls “the pathology of Whiteness,”
               a subject that animated a wide spectrum of student responses ranging from sheer delight
               and selfless auto-critique to reactionary defensiveness and other performances of
               tacit white supremacy. By producing a class that was vulnerable and conflicted, wounded
               and antagonistic, the prick and provocation of simply naming whiteness led us into
               the second half of the course, which focused on “<span style="font-style:italic">the Slave grammar of suffering</span>,” a phrase I adopt from the work of Frank B. Wilderson III. As I will go on to explain,
               “the Slave grammar of suffering” disrupts fantasies of social wholeness and historical
               redress from the vantage point of the enslaved subject within a field of structural
               antagonisms. Making a distinction between the oppression of subaltern positions and
               the suffering of “the Slave,” Wilderson’s political ontology induces unsettling disquiet
               and anger rather than sentimentality, positivity, or solution-oriented saviorism.
               Seizing on the double meaning of dehiscence as diaspora and wound, the essay then
               concludes with some afterthoughts on pedagogy: what do students learn and unlearn
               when asked to bear witness to the collective and enduring traumas of slavery?</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">The Pathology of Whiteness</span></h2>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, Mat Johnson’s third novel, follows protagonist Chris Jaynes, an Assistant Professor
                  of African American Literature, whose desire to uncover “how the pathology of Whiteness
                  was constructed” shapes his obsessive inquiry into the work of Edgar Allan Poe, particularly
                  <span style="font-style:italic">The Narrative of </span><span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</span>, Poe’s Antarctic expedition tale. Chris is the only Black professor at a small liberal
                  arts college in Manhattan, and as the only professor who specializes in African American
                  literature, he is denied tenure because in teaching courses like “Dancing with the
                  Darkies: Whiteness in the Literary Mind” (an allusion to Toni Morrison’s <span style="font-style:italic">Playing in the Dark: Whiteness in the Literary Imagination</span>), he refuses to play the part of “Professional Negro” (7). “You were hired to teach
                  African American literature,” explains the college President during a heated exchange.
                  “Not just American literature. You fought that. Simple” (13). Foregrounding the racial
                  politics of literary interpretation from the outset, <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> pits the institutional demand for minority representation (“We are a large literature
                  faculty, they can handle the majority of literature. You were retained to purvey the
                  minority perspective” [13]) against Chris’s heroic ambition to “[cure] America’s racial
                  pathology,” which “like all diseases… had to be analyzed at a microscopic level” (8).</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>staged a series of questions for us to consider at the outset of the course. Why does
                  the College President say “<span style="font-style:italic">Not just</span> American Literature”? Is African American Literature (or Ethnic American Literature)
                  <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> American Literature, per se? And if the latter category is in fact so specific as
                  to include these others, then why is it unmarked and unraced? Why not refer to it
                  as <span style="font-style:italic">White </span>American Literature? As the novel pursues such questions through a satirical travel
                  narrative that takes Chris and an ad hoc “Creole crew” to Antarctica in search of
                  the fabled island of Tsalal, that “great undiscovered African Diaspora homeland” referred
                  to in Poe’s text (“uncorrupted by Whiteness”) it also begins to answer them (39).
                  Whiteness is a “pathology and a mindset,” Chris thinks, not an “ethnic nomenclature”
                  (33, 31). It is “metaphorical” (30), an “ideology” (30), and a “strategy” (31). Above
                  all, “Whiteness isn’t about being something, it is about being no thing, nothing,
                  an erasure” (225), a claim that is confirmed symbolically when Chris and his crew
                  are enslaved by a “race” of culture-less “snow honkies” called Tekelians who rule
                  the white, windswept landscape of the South Pole (160). When their captivity among
                  the Tekelians appears to be inescapable, Chris’s uncle, Captain Booker Jaynes, tells
                  him, “You can’t run from Whiteness. You have to stand and engage it” (209). For Chris,
                  though, whiteness is not something “to stand.” From New York to Antarctica, whiteness
                  is the inescapable background of his every movement.</p>
               <p>To facilitate conversation between and among students, I assigned everyone to a small,
                  three- to four-person online writing group where they submitted short essays and reading
                  responses and provided each other with written feedback. In addition to my notes about
                  in-class presentations that were also required of every student, this online archive
                  of the course is where, with permission, I’ve drawn the direct quotations and paraphrased
                  commentary that appear throughout this essay.</p>
               <p>As disturbing as it is to see Chris denied tenure as a result of the racist institutional
                  politics that lead to his firing, students writing about <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> were, predictably, much more profoundly pained by his subsequent enslavement, and
                  by the gratuitous violence used by the Tekelians to maintain control over their captives.
                  One non-Black student of color wrote that they were saddened by the apparent “hopelessness”
                  of the novel, which seemed to suggest that “no matter how hard they [the crew] try,
                  whiteness cannot be escaped.” Yet several students, perhaps feeling uncomfortable
                  sharing this viewpoint with the whole class so early in the semester, confided that
                  they were refreshed by the novel’s reorientation of the “normal” routes of desire,
                  as <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> made the sniveling, nail-biting, blubber-eating white Tekelians repulsive, and the
                  Black Creole crew attractive. Indeed many students became more comfortable analyzing
                  whiteness while reading <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>; and after also reading Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span>, one student concluded that whiteness is an “idea of unity that, in the case of this
                  novel and perhaps in reality, only succeeds in destroying than bringing together.
                  It swallows only the ideas that perpetuate its image as salvation, purity, and goodness,
                  and erases all that would tarnish its brilliant color.” However, the criticism of
                  whiteness engendered by these books also led to reactionary defensiveness. In a response
                  essay submitted to an online writing group, one student wrote that Chris’s reference
                  to the indistinguishability of the Tekelians (“they all pretty much looked the same
                  to me” [131]) was effectively a form of reverse racism. This was addressed and, I
                  think, adequately corrected both in their peer group and in the classroom, where we
                  explained that an observer who is enslaved, and who therefore has no institutional
                  power, cannot be <span style="font-style:italic">racist</span>, even if that same observer can be provocative. To support the student’s understanding,
                  I shared Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s definition of racism as “the state-sanctioned or extralegal
                  production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerabilities to premature death”
                  (Gilmore 2007). In <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, the impossibility of reverse racism is made clear: Chris, a captive subject to the
                  institutional and interpersonal violence of the Tekelians, cannot possibly return
                  the same threat.</p>
               <p>The satirical tone and allegorical humor of <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> makes it an accessible index for critiquing whiteness and engendering generous if
                  sometimes painful (auto)critique. Having read it prior to Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative</span>, and along with excerpts from Morrison’s <span style="font-style:italic">Playing in the Dark</span>, students are presented with a persuasive case to study whiteness as what Johnson
                  terms a “pathology,” “strategy,” and “ideology.” What is additionally generative about
                  these texts is that although they are sometimes misrecognized as saying that “race”
                  is a biological signifier, they also prompt students to think about the evaluative
                  symbolism of “color.” Early on in <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, Chris comments on a passage of Poe’s novel where the narrator observes a river on
                  the island of Tsalal “made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue;
                  [whose] cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and
                  imperfect in regard to neighboring veins” (29). Chris suggests that the description
                  resembles the “racial fantasy” of Booker T. Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise,” a fantasy,
                  in other words, of functional segregation (29). I taught Poe’s imagery as an anti-Black
                  fantasy of (social) control over the distribution of color, however, pointing out
                  that this fantasy is represented repeatedly in both novels.</p>
               <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, for instance, there is Poe’s fictional “hybrid” Dirk Peters’ great-great-granddaughter,
                  Mahalia Mathis, who despite appearing to Chris as phenotypically Black, refuses African
                  heritage. Mathis heads the Native American Ancestry Collective of Gary, Indiana (NAACG),
                  a group that uses DNA testing to prove that their genes have “no kind of Africa”:
                  <span class="quote">‘I got lots of Indian in me. I got Irish and I got a little French too. I got some
                     German, or so I’m told. I even got a little Chinese in me, on my mother’s side. Matter
                     of fact, I’m sure I got more bloods in me that I knows. But I do knows this: I ain’t
                     got no kind of Africa in these bones. (49)’</span> This anti-Black fantasy, which plays itself out in the self-recognition of several
                  “colors” ostensibly excluding the color “black,” also plays out in the color symbolism
                  of Chris’s Antarctic expedition. After he and his best friend Garth escape their captivity
                  among the Tekelians, they flee to an Antarctic BioDome owned by the painter Thomas
                  Karvel (a parody of Thomas Kinkade), who provides them shelter while they work a small
                  plantation. True to his moniker, “the Master of Light” is a sovereign of <span style="font-style:italic">color</span>, a monarch over of a Disney-like “fantasy of Whiteness” marked by the monochromatic
                  oversaturation of the BioDome, where the animals are too-white, the grass too-green,
                  the river too-blue, but where nothing is Black except Chris and Garth, the ostensible
                  interlopers (185). Indeed, Chris complains to Garth that Karvel’s paintings never
                  have Black people in them; even worse, he suspects that in Karvel’s work, “black people
                  couldn’t exist, so thorough was its European romanticization” (184).</p>
               <p>In “The Case of the Blackness,” Fred Moten writes that “the cultural and political
                  discourse on black pathology has been so pervasive that it could be said to constitute
                  the background against which all representations of blacks, blackness, or (the color)
                  black take place,” arguing in sum that “blackness has been associated with a certain
                  sense of decay, even when that decay is invoked in the name of a certain (fetishization
                  of) vitality” (Moten 2008b). As if throwing their hands up, one student recognized
                  “the absurdity in our world’s thought process that anything, even things of the same
                  nature such as mice and birds, can be separated and classified into greater and lesser
                  categories just because of color.” But Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>and Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative</span> suggest a politics of chroma that goes beyond irrational absurdity. For if Black
                  is theoretically every color, and white is theoretically no-color, <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> suggests that “the pathology of Whiteness” lies precisely in Karvel’s desire to <span style="font-style:italic">master</span> color itself. Whiteness is an ideology and a strategy because it is an operation
                  that speciates every-color into veins of a river that do not “commingle,” turning
                  inward into monochromatic oversaturation or dividing up into “ethnic” varieties of
                  American literature. If blackness is the chromatic equivalent of refusing this violent
                  speciation through absorption, whiteness is by definition antagonistic to such a politics:
                  the refusal of every-color.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The “Slave Grammar of Suffering”</span></h2>
               <p>In the anti-Black environment in which my students took this course, I was not surprised
                  that some would perform whiteness by being defensive or by making discreditable claims
                  of “reverse racism.” I was heartened, however, that for the most part, white and non-Black
                  students of color in the course allied themselves with the interests of their Black
                  peers (which is to say, with Blackness) and seriously committed themselves to diagnosing
                  “America’s racial pathology.” Questioning the existential basis of one’s relationship
                  to whiteness can produce existential crises that overflow what a normative classroom
                  is able to hold, putting students in a position that may be analogous to the one occupied
                  by the person who asked Frank Wilderson, in an online interview, what a white person
                  could do to interpolate Afropessimism without succumbing to a form of reasoning that
                  would lead them to commit suicide: “As a white person who feels bad about all my race
                  does, what can I do to help besides killing myself?” Wilderson’s answer was swift
                  and to the point. Rather than “kill yourself,” the questioner should get angry and
                  “undo yourself.” Moreover, the questioner should develop “ways and means for your
                  speech and action to be authorized by a Black/slave grammar of suffering rather than
                  the grammar of suffering of subalterns.” Wilderson concluded the answer by remarking
                  on the radical potential of the questioner’s “undoing”: “You are far more dangerous
                  by being committed in this long, protracted struggle than you are or would be if you
                  just check out.” Thus, in the second half of the course, I aimed to give students
                  space to take up “the Slave grammar of suffering” as a pedagogy of “speech and action”
                  oriented toward “undoing” the pathology of whiteness.</p>
               <p>What is the difference between the subaltern grammar of suffering and the Slave grammar
                  of suffering, and what does it mean to be “authorized” by the latter? Wilderson defines
                  grammar as “the structure through which the labor of speech is possible,” arguing
                  that scripts which view “social turmoil through the rubric of conflict (i.e. a rubric
                  of problems that can be posed and conceptually solved)” represent a subaltern grammar
                  of suffering in which grievances are submitted and solutions proposed to return aggrieved
                  parties to a condition of prior wholeness. On the other hand, scripts that view social
                  turmoil through a “rubric of antagonism (an irreconcilable struggle between entities,
                  or positions, the resolution of which is not dialectical but entails the obliteration
                  of one of the positions)” represent a Slave grammar of suffering that disrupts the
                  dream of repair. Thus one of the primary distinctions between a Slave grammar of suffering
                  and a grammar of subaltern suffering concerns a text’s relationship to resolution.
                  From the vantage point of the Slave, whose exclusion from civil society is fundamental
                  to the freedom enjoyed by citizens (Wilderson’s terminology includes “Humans,” “Whites,”
                  and “Settlers”), inclusion is a form of “obliteration.” Being authorized by the Slave
                  grammar of suffering therefore begins with refusing the “prescriptive gesture” of
                  reconciliation. For Wilderson, it continues (through Fanon via Cesaire) with “the
                  end of the world… the only thing… worth the effort of starting” (337).</p>
               <p>As literary texts, Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees,” Octavia Butler’s “Amnesty” and “Bloodchild,”
                  Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span>, and Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> are all available to interpretation through the grammar of suffering: “Refugees”
                  through a colonizer/colonized dynamic on the fictional planet of Tallav’Wahir; “Amnesty”
                  and “Bloodchild” through the lens of captivity on earth and on the Tlic planet, respectively;
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span> through its plot to emancipate the enslaved Lll; and the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> through its autobiographical narrative of enslavement. Yet as a story about people
                  relocated from a post-apocalyptic earth, “Refugees” seems to engage the suffering
                  of the colonized or the migrant subject struggling to reestablish the customs of their
                  homeland; it does not engage the Slave grammar of suffering, since through “natal
                  alienation” such resolution is ultimately unavailable to the enslaved person (Patterson
                  1982). Similarly, by focusing on a human protagonist who translates between human
                  beings and an extraterrestrial lifeform that has colonized earth, Butler’s “Amnesty”
                  is more about structural adjustment and human de-exceptionalism than it is about slavery.
                  “Bloodchild” certainly <span style="font-style:italic">appears</span> to be about slavery, and many students were certain it was; they were therefore puzzled
                  that Butler herself disagreed, writing, “It amazes me that some people have seen ‘Bloodchild’
                  as a story of slavery” (30). However, as one student observed about the gender and
                  reproductive politics of the story, Butler was probably right to call her narrative
                  about the implantation of a male human named Gan with Tlic larvae her “pregnant man
                  story,” and a “love story,” rather than a “slave narrative”: <span class="quote">‘It is interesting that in a society where women get pregnant and have children all
                     the time, it is often called love, but when it is a man being impregnated in almost
                     the same exact way, it can be seen as slavery. Perhaps this happens because sci-fi
                     novels are seen as so drastically different in their own imagined worlds that it is
                     hard to see their similarity to the reality of life on Earth, or it is because of
                     the patriarchal views that have been instilled in the reader that affect how ‘Bloodchild’
                     is read.’</span> Prompted by such articulate student writing, I wonder, then, when I thought I was
                  teaching about slavery several years ago, if I was not, perhaps, teaching about something
                  else. Recognizing that not all of these texts are engaged with the grammar of Slave
                  suffering places pressure on how I would teach Romantic antislavery literature and
                  its legacies in the future, especially when the topic is “the slave narrative” (See
                  Matthew and Chander 2018).</p>
               <p>Of all the texts we read together, Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>gets nearest to representing what Wilderson calls “the suffering of the Slave,” as
                  it were, grammatically. At the center of the novella about slavery and emancipation
                  in a far-off galaxy is “the suffering of the Lll,” a race of world-building beings
                  whose emancipation is seemingly dependent on the delivery of a message to Empire Star
                  by the young Comet Jo. As students began to notice, however, the Lll never speak.
                  They are always described collectively, never individually. And their enslavement
                  seems to be constituted as much by their silence as through the garrulous verbosity
                  of everyone else with something to say about why the Lll should be or should not be
                  emancipated, which is to say, every other “free” character. “Their place in the book
                  is the un-speaking point of conflict,” wrote one student; indeed, “they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> conflict, not <span style="font-style:italic">character</span>, not <span style="font-style:italic">being</span>. And while they might achieve ‘emancipation,’ they are not free, but remain enslaved
                  to others with a voice.” The world of <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span> clearly depends upon the slavery of the Lll, making their emancipation a political
                  farce, their suffering an antagonism with no redress, pessimistic conclusions frankly
                  confirmed by <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span>’s circular, spiral, and “retrocausal” form (Shepard 2019). Treating the continuum
                  of slavery and emancipation as a formal element of the text, the novella ends exactly
                  where it began, with Comet Jo realizing he has been tasked with Lll emancipation perhaps
                  many times before.</p>
               <p>By contrast, Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> appears to end on a somewhat hopeful, solution-oriented note based on free market
                  liberalism, the British state’s capacity for “justice,” and the good will of “every
                  man of sentiment” (176). Yet if this prescriptive gesture lends itself to an interpretation
                  as a grammar of subaltern suffering, yet the book is undoubtedly a narrative that
                  grapples with exposing the grammar, or structure, of “Black/slave” suffering, in Wilderson’s
                  terms. In one class discussion of Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>, a conversation that continued in our online discussion forum, I introduced students
                  to the evidence compiled by Vincent Carretta suggesting that Equiano may have been
                  born in Carolina, even though his autobiography tells us he was born in Africa, that
                  he was captured as a child, and that he suffered the Middle Passage (Carretta 2005,
                  Youngquist 2016). I explained that Carretta’s evidence included the ship’s log for
                  Equiano’s Arctic voyage as well as the record of his baptism, both of which identified
                  Carolina as his place of birth. I also explained that Carretta’s intention was not
                  to cast doubt on Equiano’s narrative but to understand what literary and political
                  concerns may have motivated the decision, if it were indeed true — an intention I
                  therefore posed to the class as a question. Why would Equiano fabricate aspects of
                  his autobiography?</p>
               <p>Having posed the question, the ensuing conversation more or less followed Carretta’s
                  own conclusions: Equiano’s political motivation was to abolish slavery, and an account
                  of his capture and Middle Passage journey was the most likely way to provoke what
                  one non-Black student referred to as a “drama-driven English audience.” Elaborating
                  on a now-foundational connection between the liberal anti-slavery movement and spectacular
                  representations of Black suffering (Hartman 1997), some students were therefore content
                  to understand autobiography as a genre with certain formal needs and capabilities,
                  including “literary devices.” Abolition by any means necessary. Others went so far
                  as to suggest that it was “natural and unavoidable to lie when selling a story,” and
                  that lying “is practically part of the social contract” between writers and readers.</p>
               <p>This conversation was enormously productive for nuancing the understanding of at least
                  one non-Black student, who wrote online that before the full unfolding of our class
                  discussion he viewed Equiano’s potential fabrication as a way to disguise his status
                  as an otherwise “privileged slave” who was able to read, write, and build relationships
                  with free whites. “I thought that it seemed a bit ridiculous that he would make things
                  up and make [a narrative of his capture and the Middle Passage] sound like his own
                  life to rouse sympathy in the readers,” wrote the student, whose classmates were quick
                  to jump on the notion of “privilege” at play. One non-Black peer wrote that they would
                  “hesitate to call a[n enslaved person] privileged, especially since it is clear from
                  the text that Equiano does not define himself this way and consistently refers to
                  any good luck that comes his way as an aberration from a system that is built to deny
                  him any good fortune. He certainly considers himself blessed, mainly in retrospect
                  after being freed, but his narrative is demonstrating how the institution of slavery
                  blocks privilege based on race.” A good point — although it was ultimately not the
                  purpose of the first student to pursue the idea of “privilege.” Rather, in examining
                  why Equiano would fabricate aspects of his autobiography, the student had become interested
                  in whether it was Equiano’s intention “to voice stories of other [enslaved people]
                  that do not have the opportunity to.” In other words, was Equiano’s narrative more
                  of a social history than an autobiography?</p>
               <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">The Intimacies of Four Continents</span>, Lisa Lowe demonstrates how Equiano’s narrative, given voice through a genre of liberalism
                  (“In a sense, autobiography is the liberal genre par excellence” [46]), reveals a
                  connection between slavery, subjugation, and “the singular life” (71). In thinking
                  of the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> as a kind of polyvocal performance of himself and “other [enslaved people],” then,
                  my student was perhaps moving toward a critique of autobiography: Olaudah Equiano
                  was not only Equiano, he was also Gustavus Vassa, and he was born in multiple places.
                  In attempting to find a grammar requisite to the suffering of the enslaved, Equiano/Vassa
                  had to call the genre of the autobiography, the narrative of the singular life, into
                  profound question. Even though the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative </span>concludes with a predictable form of prescriptive redress, much of it nevertheless
                  strives toward a collective articulation of dispersed suffering and rather than a
                  selfish, self-made, or individual suffering. The internal differentiation of Equiano’s
                  narrative into that of Gustavus Vassa <span style="font-style:italic">as well as </span>“[enslaved people] that do not have the opportunity” leads us to think and imagine
                  antislavery everywhere.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Toward a Pedagogy of Dehiscence</span></h2>
               <p>In recent years, the field of Black Studies has become, perhaps more consciously than
                  ever before, an interdisciplinary mode, a fugitive method, and an intellectual itinerary
                  inseparable but nevertheless distinguishable from the disciplinary study of the color
                  black, Black people, or Black arts and culture — where the emphasis may fall on either
                  the first or the second term. While there are many descriptions of what Black study
                  is and does, I have adopted Fred Moten’s description of it as “a dehiscence at the
                  heart of the institution and at its edge.” This definition has animated these afterthoughts
                  on the pedagogy of dehiscence in and as a form of wounding that is also a plan of
                  and for dispersal. Dehiscence is a recurring concept in Moten’s work, where he mobilizes
                  uses of the phrase from Derrida, Levinas, and Lacan with a difference — as in “Refuge,
                  Refuse, Refrain,” an essay on Adrian Piper, where he further elaborates on dehiscence
                  as a “motif of selflessness” against the longstanding association of subjectivity
                  with the inviolability of the possessive individual, which echoes with questions,
                  raised above, about the singularity of autobiography: “To disagree with Piper’s account
                  of herself and her work is to depend upon the dehiscence of and within herself and
                  her work, the gravity of which is a matter of the field they occupy rather than fiction
                  of their particularity. In this dehsicence, this break, this differential inseparability,
                  other motives emerge; what emerges is another motif of selflessness” (Moten 2018,
                  118). My understanding of dehiscence as a marginal if animating premise and practice
                  of Black Studies postdates the Ethnic American Literature course I have described.
                  However, in our attention to the <span style="font-style:italic">Slave grammar of suffering</span> expressed in course materials, in the field of social relations, and on the UMass
                  Amherst campus circa 2014-15 in particular, we were, I think, working toward a pedagogy
                  of dehiscence — a learning environment that takes place in the <span style="font-style:italic">vulnus,</span> or psychosocial wounds of Atlantic slavery; when that “wound” is understood as an
                  atmosphere of violence which extends beyond the site of the original cut.</p>
               <p>My use of the word dehiscence to describe a method of teaching (anti)slavery literature
                  and its legacies thus weaves together Black studies pedagogy with the intellectual
                  and scholarly protocols of Afropessimism, which repeatedly express dissatisfaction
                  with the state of academic knowledge production as civic engagement, politically acceptable
                  modes of reform, and solution-oriented prescriptive gestures for addressing the continuum
                  of anti-Black violence. In the introductory Ethnic American Literature course that
                  I have described it was difficult to address <span style="font-style:italic">the pathology of Whiteness</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">the Slave grammar of suffering</span> in part because students are encouraged through education to think of themselves
                  as becoming productive individuals, “engaged” citizens, and masters of intellectual
                  property in a “meritocratic” context driven by competition against one another. Students
                  are not so accustomed to viewing these aspects of their education as a part of the
                  problem of racist institutions, or to <span style="font-style:italic">undoing</span> themselves through actions and speech authorized by suffering. There is nothing that
                  excludes radical forms of care and compassion from a classroom informed by these practices.
                  However, the feelings of woundedness and vulnerability in my class did not immediately
                  lend themselves, nor should they have, to being neatly, cleanly sutured.</p>
               <p>In a well-known passage of <span style="font-style:italic">Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom</span>, bell hooks shares an anecdote about the pain her students feel when they take her
                  classes: “We take your class. We learn to look at the world from a critical standpoint,
                  one that considers race, sex, and class. And we can’t enjoy life anymore” (42). hooks
                  concludes the passage by suggesting that modeling mutual respect for that pain reveals
                  its commonness among students “across race, sexual preference, and ethnicity,” and
                  she writes that through sharing this pain her classes “build community.” In the Ethnic
                  American Literature course I taught, students experienced similar feelings of pain,
                  confusion, remorse, anger, and defensiveness when sitting with the violence of whiteness
                  and the enduring suffering of slavery’s afterlives, and though I do not wish to disagree
                  with hooks’ optimistic comments about community-building, I do wish to question them.
                  To my mind, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not (at least not at first) end in a reformed
                  community. Instead, it opens up the possibility of ending “community.” Put another
                  way, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not seek simply to undermine the hierarchical relations
                  of the classroom and build community on disingenuous assertions of equality in the
                  afterlife of slavery. Rather, a pedagogy of dehiscence acknowledges that the classroom
                  continues to be structured by the social relations of conquest, colonialism, and slavery,
                  and accepts that the wound this causes ought to cause one (one? many? who? us?) to
                  pursue the abolitionist endeavor of ending <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> kind of world.</p>
