            <p>Reading literature about slavery gives students a glimpse into Black lives in the
               eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but that’s not enough. Romantic era accounts
               of slavery can whitewash the harrowing realities of plantation life. The authors of
               these texts themselves acknowledge the ways their texts endure the interventions of
               their editors or imagined audiences. Whether excerpted, edited and “mard” (John Stedman),
               transcribed or “pruned” (Mary Prince), “styled” (Olaudah Equiano), or “soiled” (William
               Earle), these texts bear the marks of the literary and social institutions and cultures
               that produced them. My pedagogical approach relies upon introducing students to other
               kinds of texts beyond Romantic era narratives to animate colonial textuality with
               the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture that in revising the past, imagines
               and nourishes future worlds. Inspired by Afro-Jamaican “tun yuh han mek fashion” techniques
               of improvisation and sustainability, I work with these materials, often contemporary
               and often non-literary, to refashion Romanticism.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Trelawny Maroon and Rastafarian, Ga’aama Gloria Simms (she goes by the honorific MaMa
                  G), taught me about tunyuhan. The term refers to the Jamaican proverb, “tun yuh han
                  (turn your hand) mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best use of any available resources
                  to create something new.” Afrocentric and inherently revolutionary, as Kaiton Williams
                  argues, tunyuhan “is tied up with the multiple and evolving sources of income and
                  pastimes” (Williams).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Kaiton Williams associates tun yuh han with the “DIY mentality” that defines the Jamaican
                           response to “material absence” as well as “a way to repair a break in the continuity
                           of people and culture sustained in the creation of our New World.” She writes: “all
                           those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence continue to be as much
                           about making our world as about remaking our relation to it,” proposing also that
                           Jamaican multiplicity “is central to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression
                           of our soul and its determination.”</span></div>
                  </div> MaMa G’s “Tunyuhan Project,” for example, plans to create and market a line of clothing
                  and accessories made from repurposed materials, and to establish small farms that
                  provide jobs and sustenance, thereby empowering Jamaican women and their communities.
                  In addition, MaMa G carries her social and intellectual work abroad (she has recently
                  given lectures at several universities in the US), bringing home resources to benefit
                  her community; she envisions opening a “borderless university,” rooted in Jamaica
                  but developed online, to unite local and global communities in the growth and dissemination
                  of indigenous knowledge. MaMa G’s financial circumstances—in part a rejection of modern
                  capitalism—have inspired her to create alternative modes of economic survival that
                  rely upon improvisation and adaptability. Intrigued by the concept of tunyuhan, I
                  aspired to apply its inventive, integrative practices to my teaching and research.</p>

                  <p>I first met MaMa G through my research on the notorious fugitive, Three-Fingered Jack,
                     as I tracked stories about the Maroons who killed him. Looking back, I realize that
                     our first meeting taught me to (try to) relax into a kind of nonteleological, nonlinear
                     methodology, very different from the structure and solipsism of archival pursuits.
                     “Everyday life is our classroom,” MaMa G has explained to me, and “if you are not
                     living it, you are so far from it [knowledge]” (interview). My “field work” in Jamaica
                     has taught me to find knowledge everywhere, reveling in what Paul Youngquist calls
                     “ambient knowledge” (“Accident,” 218).

                     </div> I have found it in the “yards” (homes) of contemporary Maroons, in conversations with
                     taxi drivers, with fellow passengers on buses, in rum shops, at music events, on road
                     trips, and etched in the landscape of the island; I’ve had conversations about Three-Fingered
                     Jack in kitchens, in farmyards, on hiking trails, in rivers, on mountains, and in
                     bat-filled caves. Cooperative, networked, improvisational, and dynamic, these perspectives
                     have galvanized my research.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The connections I’ve made in Jamaica took time and tunyuhan to evolve into collaboration.
                  My field work began with the Maroons of Charles Town, when their remarkable colonel,
                  the late Frank Lumsden, introduced me to his community and, indirectly, to MaMa G.
                  Colonel Lumsden and I first met at Kingston’s Red Bones Blues Café in 2008, upon his
                  delivery of one of his paintings to its proprietor and our mutual friend, Evan Williams.
                  We had been hearing about each other for months. Over cold Red Stripes, I asked Colonel
                  Lumsden if I might visit Charles Town to interview him and others about Three-Fingered
                  Jack. As it happened, Colonel Lumsden had been looking for an academic to organize
                  an international conference in Charles Town to fulfill his international vision of
                  a global indigenous community without borders. We struck a deal, and this relationship
                  continues to enrich and beautifully complicate my life, even after his death in 2015.
                  I traveled to Portland, Jamaica to help with the first Charles Town International
                  Maroon Conference in 2009, and in those summer months I spent time with Colonel Sterling
                  of Moore Town, Kim Douglas (now Acting Colonel of Charles Town), Lynette Wilkes, Worries
                  McCurbin, Brother Isaac Bernard, Keith Lumsden, and other Windward Maroons, building
                  relationships that have grown since. It took another two years for me to meet MaMa
                  G, entirely by chance, through Colonel Prehay of the Scots Hall Maroons. </p>
               <p>I met with Colonel Prehay in the temporary office of a visiting Maroon official in
                  uptown Kingston. I found it in an official-looking residential building adjacent to
                  the wedding-cake-shaped Devon House, an estate built in 1881 by Jamaica’s first black
                  millionaire. In their distinctive coconut hats, Col. Prehay and MaMa G sat patiently
                  in the waiting area amidst the pastel décor of the mysterious office. Neither had
                  much to say about Jack Mansong. But MaMa G did have quite a bit to say about Indigenous
                  Maroon women, the Trelawny Maroons, and the power of improvisation for sustainability.
                  I didn’t get information for my book that day, but I decided to follow my instincts,
                  realizing, when she invited me to her home, that from this wise woman I could learn
                  something.</p>
               <p>A few days later and after some logistical mishaps, I arrived at MaMa G’s East Kingston
                  home with what would become my customary offering: a pineapple, four Red Stripes,
                  and an orange juice for her granddaughter, Cookie. MaMa G’s East Kingston yard provided
                  a haven, with multiple signs of her community involvement in evidence. I wasn’t sure
                  exactly what I was doing there, because MaMa G had expressed a marked lack of interest
                  in Three-Fingered Jack. But I felt drawn to her energy, and our initial conversations
                  focused on her departure from the social work program at the University of the West
                  Indies and her subsequent commitment to grassroots community organizing. That afternoon
                  MaMa G introduced me to the concept of tunyuhan as she carefully stitched an elaborate
                  hat wrought with coconut husk and recycled thread, a creation she would proudly wear
                  as she delivered a talk to the United Nations several years later. Instead of extricating
                  facts about Three-Fingered Jack, I developed strategies for acquiring knowledge beyond
                  the archive. I learned to slow down, listen, wait, and even let go of (or at least
                  defer) my intended goals. I found that knowledge can be about exchange rather than
                  extraction, and that it requires openness, creativity, and improvisation. These skills
                  help in the classroom, too.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">Tunyuhan in the Classroom</span></h2>
               <p>I teach at a large public university, and despite our heavy teaching load, most English
                  professors have limited opportunities to teach classes in their areas of specializations.
                  Our department has been hemorrhaging English majors—a national trend—and we thus teach
                  many general education courses and surveys. We rarely offer Romanticism or the long
                  eighteenth century (maybe once every three or four semesters); when we do, we face
                  extra pressure from students to keep it fresh and relevant to our increasingly diverse
                  student population. I use tunyuhan methods to make available a more textured and topical
                  understanding of Romantic antislavery texts. Motivated by my Jamaican research and
                  the interdisciplinarity of the Maroon conference, I use the resources available to
                  me, borrowing from other fields, experimenting with different genres, and branching
                  into other centuries. I used this approach recently in an upper-level seminar for
                  English majors that focused on eighteenth and nineteenth century representations of
                  slavery. </p>
               <p>I designed the course to interweave colonial and postcolonial, literary and nonliterary
                  texts. With tunyuhan’s multiplicity in mind, I incorporated interviews, images, and
                  films to complement and challenge the conventions of literary historiography. Organized
                  chronologically, the class began with travel writing (Lydia Maria Child’s extracted
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; an Emancipated Slave, of Suriname: From Stedman's Narrative of
                     a Five Year's Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Suriname</span>) and transitioned to Eurocentric fiction (John Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi</span> and Victor Hugo’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bug-Jargal</span>); we followed fiction with the voices of formerly enslaved peoples (Mary Prince’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">History</span> and Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>); and we finished with contemporary Jamaican fiction (Marlon James’ <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span>). For the sake of this essay, I will discuss only my classroom use of Child, Earle,
                  Prince, and James, situating these texts within larger cultural and creative contexts.
                  The Maroons played a significant role in my course partly because Romantic period
                  texts often elide them, but also because their cultural and spiritual practices emphasize
                  the connections I want to make between past, present, and future. Each unit also included
                  the creative expressions of contemporary Afro-Jamaicans, disrupting the timeline’s
                  linearity to suggest the ways the past leaves its mark upon the present, as well as
                  the ways that reimagining the past can inspire future generations.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The tunyuhan approach will vary in the hands of different teachers and scholars, because
                     it involves the creative pursuit of individual interests and inspirations. One makes
                     the best use of their available resources, whatever they may entail for that person.
                     Rather than following a list of suggested texts, videos, or websites, the teacher/scholar
                     will experiment with unique combinations of texts or ideas. Dynamic and topical, tunyuhan
                     opens up possibilities and connections.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A reviewer of this essay thoughtfully asked me what the tunyuhan approach would look
                              like in different hands than mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet people like
                              MaMa G. In short, every person will have a different approach based on their interests
                              and resources. My collaboration with the Maroons and MaMa G grew from my interest
                              their history in relationship to my Three-Fingered Jack project. It took years to
                              cultivate these relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led me to other
                              opportunites, too. The Charles Town Maroon Conference &amp; Festival, for example, continues
                              to offer…</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>My work with the Charles Town Maroon conference has increasingly informed my teaching
                  as well as my research. Set in the Asafu Yard (once the communal space to prepare
                  for battle), it combines academic panels with drumming, dancing, wellness workshops,
                  and sacred ritual. Interdisciplinary, intergenerational, and collaborative, this event
                  takes academics out of their comfort zone and creates connections with contemporary
                  Maroons, local Jamaicans, and other international scholars. Researchers meet the descendants
                  of the people they study and teach; they hear their voices, listen to their stories,
                  and dance to their music. Literary scholars mingle with geographers, geneticists with
                  poets, and Maroons with ethnomusicologists. </p>
               <p>Many of the visiting scholars fold archival time into this trip, and their research
                  shifts as they move through experiences with people that, unlike archival records,
                  speak to and with them. Experiencing alternative models for the production of knowledge,
                  participants return to their campuses with more than the photocopies and facts that
                  serve the archival imperative and its hierarchies. I’ve worked to bring this kind
                  of knowledge into my classroom, using (filmed, digitized, or recorded) Maroon stories,
                  songs, rituals, and artwork, for example, to enliven the print texts. This “undisciplined”
                  mode of assembly responds to the call for what Christina Sharpe calls “wake work”
                  and attends to the “largeness that is Black Life, Black life insisted from death”
                  (17). These materials also can show the limitations, porousness, and vulnerabilities
                  of logocentric knowledge.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>John Gabriel Stedman, author of The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the
                     Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796), himself bemoaned the editorial intrusions that
                     “mard” his narrative. An officer in the Scots Brigade deployed to Suriname to quell
                     the revolt of the Maroons (1772), Stedman submitted his narrative to Joseph Johnson.
                     The 1796 published version, much to Stedman’s dissatisfaction, differed significantly
                     from his original account, particularly in its representation of Joanna (documented
                     in Richard and Sally Price’s 1998 transcription of his 1790 manuscript). I won’t rehearse
                     here the fascinating intricacies of what Dustin Kennedy has termed the “Stedman Archive,”
                     though I did begin there with my students.

                     extraction of it, <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna: An Emancipated Slave, of Suriname,</span> first published in the 1834 gift book, <span style="font-style:italic">The Oasis. </span>I wanted to track different kinds of mediations that characterize writings about slavery,
                     even when produced by white men with a certain amount of power.

               <p>Child appropriated Stedman’s narrative for her own abolitionist purposes, but not
                  without ideological contradictions. For example, she admires the domestic affections
                  of Stedman and Joanna, yet insists that abolitionists do not “induce anyone to marry
                  a mulatto, even if his life has been saved by such a one” (3). Her concerns with propriety
                  and miscegenation extend to her visual choices, and she replaces Holloway’s image
                  of a bare-breasted Joanna with Smith’s more modest one, prompting one irritated but
                  engaged student to ask, “What’s up with her boobie?” A good question. It’s a cover
                  up. Jenny Sharpe has suggested that covering Joanna’s breasts desexualizes and yet
                  emphasizes her role as wife and mother, registering the gender politics of women abolitionists
                  like Child (85). My students and I agreed that it also covers up the violence visited
                  upon enslaved women, whitewashing the realities of sexual exploitation in the colonies.
                  In addition, Child almost entirely excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family
                  connections and whose rebellions brought Stedman to Suriname in the first place. I
                  had the students read a few Maroon-focused chapters from Stedman’s narrative with
                  some Maroon historiography, which sparked their interest in the history of these self-emancipated
                  Afro-Caribbean peoples.</p>

                     from slavery who was captured and killed by them in 1780. Earle’s novel falls short
                     of its abolitionist reach, and though it confuses the status of Maroons, it does reveal
                     the complex dynamics of a colonial state that pitted Afro-Jamaicans against one another.
                     The weepy, unreliable narrator, however, inspires little confidence, especially in
                     his repetition of the phrase, “I am no author” (118). Famously overwrought and ideologically

                     and the Maroon who killed him. First, we studied Jamaican artist Omari “Afrikan” Ra’s
                     extraordinary painting of Three-Fingered Jack (n.d.), and the class listened to my
                     recorded interview with the artist, who spoke of the influences of revolutionaries
                     Makandal and Dutty Boukman. The students used Ra’s image (and words) to imagine a
                     more nuanced picture of the infamous outlaw. They commented on his hard, intense stare
                     and the words etched around his neck, perhaps suggesting the ways he’s been imprisoned
                     by print. The students also found it interesting to think about Jack’s relationship
                     to Quashie (also called John Reeder), the Maroon who took off Jack’s fingers and later
                     killed him. Colonel Lumsden’s stunning painting of Quashie, in white face paint and
                     rendered in “ambush,” depicts the complexity of this underrepresented figure in Jack’s

                     he would make his own ruthless decisions”(Fig. 1). These Afrocentric images of Jack
                     and his killer usefully trouble Eurocentric textual accounts of colonial Jamaica with
                     their depictions of proud black warriors brought into opposition with one another

                  complex functions as an extension of plantation slavery (Kreps). Buju Banton also
                  represents a potent expression of black agency, harnessing the legacy of the island’s
                  first freedom-fighters. Putting Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi</span> in conversation with contemporary Jamaican art and music amplifies Jack’s militant

                     resists joining plans for a multi-plantation rebellion engineered by the enslaved
                     Homer, the head domestic, the head “house slave” and Lilith’s half-sisters, the titular
                     “Night Women.” Instead, Lilith becomes mistress “concubine” to the new overseer, Quinn,
                     because she needs his protection from her previous tormentors. Already scarred with
                     a “quilt” on her back, Lilith fears the fate of Homer, who once ran away, and when
                     caught by Maroons, underwent a public flogging: “She cover up in scar big like animal
                     stripe, her titties chop up and scar up so that is only nipple left to tell you that
                     she born to suckle” (382). Under Quinn’s protection, Lilith suspects she can keep
                     her own breasts intact and (like Joanna) covered. Ambivalent and with divided loyalties,
                     Lilith at once accommodates and undermines the plantation system, oblivious to the
                     contradictions that link her to the Maroons, of whom the novel frequently criticizes
                     for their collaboration with the British.

                     slavery, a system that rewards accommodation. Even the rebellious Homer wrangles considerable
                     power as the head domestic, a position from which she gained access to literacy. When
                     she teaches young Lilith to read, she explains, “Every time you open this [a book]
                     you free” (57). Skilled in the spiritual as well as the literary arts, Homer practices
                     obeah and myal, and she guides the Night Women in African-descended rituals that challenge
                     European systems of power and knowledge. Homer works the system, using all tools available,
                     and she, like Lilith, has become entangled with the power structure they resist.

               </div>
               <p>The inclusion of <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women </span>on my syllabus raised some eyebrows. Indeed, contemporary debates about content warnings
                  in the classroom have in some cases prompted institutional resistance to exposing
                  the gruesome details and residues of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Yet the study of texts
                  about slavery should, with all due respect and sensitivity toward the experiences
                  or traumas of students, confront and illuminate the historical realities that have
                  shaped the antiblackness and structural racism of current cultures. My “note on content”
                  in my syllabus acknowledges that these texts touch on the lived experiences of some
                  students more than others, demanding respect and tolerance as we move through difficult
                  material. James’ unapologetically graphic language and violent imagery understandably
                  disturbed the students, but it also extended and enriched our ongoing conversation
                  about the sanitization of representations of slavery.</p>

                  <p>Many of the students wrote their seminar papers about <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span>, because, they explained, they found it strangely compelling and unlike anything
                     they’d ever read. Almost every page reveals some devastating detail of slavery as
                     it harrowingly pursues the elisions and ambivalences sometimes found even in overtly
                     antislavery texts. James has been dubbed the “literary Tarantino” (the class also
                     watched Tarantino’s <span style="font-style:italic">Django Unchained</span>). As a gay, Black Jamaican, James explains that he tries to complicate rather than
                     ignore the island’s past and present violence, writing instead about “a Jamaica that
                     never gets written” (Arifa Akbar). As an academic (a professor at Macalester College)
                     and Booker Prize winning author, James occupies the space of the archive, but he uses
                     that access to disrupt it, fully and critically aware of the contradictions therein.

                     </div> I find James’ novel a particularly useful though unsettling way to reconsider the
                     history of slavery and its Romantic period representations. Even arguably anti-slavery
                     texts and politically aware interpretations of them reflect the structural racism
                     of the institutions (nineteenth-century British plantation and/or literary culture
                     and twenty-first century academia, for example) that participate in the cultural production
                     of race. In putting the creative expressions of contemporary black culture in conversation
                     with eighteenth and nineteenth century literary texts, I hope to move beyond glimpses
                     of Black lives under slavery into broader landscapes that privilege Black agency,
                     resistance, and critique.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Interweaving different kinds of texts in new combinations, I conjure the spirit of
                  tunyuhan and its commitment to creating new things from old materials. This idea is
                  not new to Romanticism. Mary Shelley, for example, writes in her Introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> that invention is borne out of chaos, and “consists in the power of moulding and
                  <span style="font-style:italic">fashioning</span> ideas suggested to it” (emphasis mine). As her novel shows, people tend to fear what
                  they view to be “dark” or “shapeless,” but the modern academy generally and the field
                  of Romanticism particularly could benefit from some creative if uncomfortable admixture
                  to animate existing materials. Bakary Diaby has asked Romanticists to “do the work”
                  to change the way we study Blackness in Romanticism (249). Until we have a new system
                  (and I’m not holding my breath), we can experiment with and refashion the one we have.</p>

               <p>This past spring, I was going to take a group of students on a study abroad program
                  to Jamaica, taking my classroom into the field. Like most research and all conference
                  travel that year, “Histories of Resistance in Jamaica” was cancelled by Covid. Instead,
                  my institution asked me to develop a four-week online course that would give my students
                  the Jamaica experience (!). Improvising with the medley of materials available to
                  me (some from the class I just described), I created the course, including a public
                  event on Blackboard Collaborate Ultra that featured MaMa G. Instead of the activities
                  she and I had planned for my 15 Jamaica-bound students, she gave an interactive workshop
                  for 40 students and faculty titled “Re-awakening the Knowledge and Wisdoms of Indigenous
                  Women in Times of Covid-19.” With the (occasionally blurry) Ultra phone app and the
                  Blue Mountains misting over the Asafu Yard, MaMa G created a unique virtual space
                  for student engagement. </p>
               <p>In a conversation that invoked the creative invention and adaptability of tunyuhan,
                  MaMa G emphasized “Maroon principles of survival,” grafted from “knowledge [we] brought
                  from Africa, learned from the [indigenous] Taino, and even now it continues” (1:22).
                  Calling for a “shift in consciousness,” a “reawakening,” she urges a return to indigenous
                  knowledge that values other cultures and respects the natural environment from which
                  “we can always find a solution.” Wellness, she concluded, “comes from communication
                  between body, earth, mind, spirit, and land—it’s all part of our healing.” </p>
               <p>As teachers of texts about slavery, we can show students that the problems of modern
                  capitalism are ongoing and interrelated, as demonstrated by the racism, police brutality,
                  and unrest during the 2020 COVID crisis, a public health catastrophe particularly
                  critical for underserved black communities. The creative and exciting global responses
                  to these events signal, as MaMa G suggests, an outcry and an opportunity for change.
                  We can re-make Romanticism, changing our approach to texts about slavery to confront
                  and illuminate their violence and amnesia, but also to incorporate and celebrate the
                  “largeness that is Black life” (Sharpe 17). If we want our institutions and disciplines
                  to survive, we need to work with the materials we have to create something new and
                  sustainable. Tun yuh han mek fashion. </p>

               response to “material absence” as well as “a way to repair a break in the continuity
               of people and culture sustained in the creation of our New World.” She writes: “all
               those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence continue to be as much
               about making our world as about remaking our relation to it,” proposing also that
               Jamaican multiplicity “is central to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression
               of our soul and its determination.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Shalani Puri has proposed that we consider what she calls “field work in the Humanities”
               for access to “knowledge and expression unavailable in print; to disallowed or delegitimized
               knowledges; to localized or vernacular rather than globalized knowledge or memory”

               like in different hands than mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet people like
               MaMa G. In short, every person will have a different approach based on their interests
               and resources. My collaboration with the Maroons and MaMa G grew from my interest
               their history in relationship to my Three-Fingered Jack project. It took years to
               cultivate these relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led me to other
               opportunites, too. The Charles Town Maroon Conference &amp; Festival, for example, continues
               to offer opportunities for professors and graduate students to engage with and learn
               about Maroon culture from contemporary Maroons and Indigenous peoples and scholars
               from around the world. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               mixed with rum, the British treated with the Maroons in 1739. The British and Maroons
               held completely different notions about the treaty. The British viewed it as the means
               to control the Maroons, and the infamous ninth clause commits the Maroons to returning
               fugitives and putting down island rebellions. For Maroons, the treaty celebrated their
               victory over the English after eighty years of war. Many non-Maroon Jamaicans view
               the Maroons as traitors because of the treaty, not unreasonably, driving anti-Maroon
               sentiment in Jamaica today. I view the treaty as another example of English methods
               of divide and conquer, pitting Afro-Jamaicans against one another. For accounts of

               writing was available as a technology in Africa since the 7<sup>th</sup> C. With this in mind, she suggests, one could argue that Homer is reclaiming the
               written word from an African tradition and not a western one, complicating the binary

               society “is that of a dual relation between the plantation (the elite) and the plot
               (the folk), the two poles which originate in a single process” (95). In doing so they
               created a folk culture that persists in resistant “secretive” histories, expressed,
               for example, in folk songs, Kumina practices, or Myal rituals (95). Wynter avers that
               Caribbean literature registers the ambivalence between the plot and the plantation
               but sees the ambivalence as at once the “root cause” of alienation” as well as its
               “salvation” (95). In “Talking about a Little Culture.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of the plantation and after she remains in the house and “live like a free negro”
               though she’s not free (422). Injured almost to the point of death, Homer survives
               to live in the shadow of the plantation, leaving behind her scent of lemongrass, hiding

               always-constitutive “production” (8). Their introduction (and the issue itself) nicely
               theorizes and performs the power of the neo-slavery genre, calling attention to its
               particular relevance to Black British writing as it revises “the way British history
               is understood and remembered [by exploring the continuing legacies of slavery into
               twenty-first century realities—economic and social inequity , racism, and the impossibility
               of social belong—which suggests that it is only by the full avowal of the past of
