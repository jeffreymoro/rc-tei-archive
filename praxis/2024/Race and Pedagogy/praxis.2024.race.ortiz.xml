            <p rend="center">Listening to Noise in Antislavery Poetry</p>
            <p>I. Listening for Noise </p>
            <p> For those of us who study and teach the literature of slavery and abolition,
                listening for silences as attentively as voices is a matter of ethical urgency.
                Since the publication of Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern Speak?” (1988), critics
                who write about the colonial and postcolonial world have been faced with the
                challenge of listening beyond voice, which, in the texts we tend to teach, is so
                essentially constructed by and for the Western subject. The problem with voice is
                its privilege—only few can speak, and even fewer are actually heard. Silence too
                poses its own interpretive challenges. We find the critical limitations of silence
                in Edward Said’s well known interrogation of Jane Austen’s<hi rend="italic"
                    >Mansfield Park</hi>, a novel that notoriously dials down the volume on the
                subject of slavery and empire that haunts its geographic and fictional borders.
                Critics have taken turns defending Austen’s evident reserve on the slavery question
                in the novel. <note xml:id="ftn1" place="end" n="1"><p> For a few excellent defenses
                        of Austen on this front, see George E. Boulukos, “The Politics of
                            Silence:<hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> and the Amelioration of
                        Slavery,” <hi rend="italic">NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction</hi> 39:3 (Summer,
                        2006): 361-383; Moira Ferguson, “<hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>:
                        Slavery, Colonialism, and Gender,” <hi rend="italic">Oxford Literary
                            Review</hi> 13:1/2 (1991): 181-139; and Susan Fraiman, “Jane Austen and
                        Edward Said: Gender, Culture and Empire,” <hi rend="italic">Critical Inquiry
                        </hi>21 (1995): 805-21. </p></note> Many have insisted that, if it is
                silent, Austen’s novel faithfully captures the taboo nature of the theme in its own
                historical context and assumes an implicit contemporary understanding of and
                sensitivity to the moral crisis at the center of the Bertram estate.</p>
            <p>Most recently, however, Lynn Festa has proposed that in <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Park</hi> Austen may not so much be asking us to listen for the omissions that
                fill the novel’s silences so much as urging us to listen for what its <hi
                    rend="italic">noise</hi> might tell us: “For we may hear, but we do not <hi
                    rend="italic">listen</hi> to noise . . . who listens to noise? We moderns
                consider having a voice as fundamental to social and political representation, and
                silence is often equated with oppression” (155). As Festa distinguishes here,
                listening for noise means paying attention to sounds we would otherwise block out
                because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient. And, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, many things are noisy—the urbane Crawfords,
                the staging of <hi rend="italic">Lover’s Vows</hi>, and, of course, Fanny’s
                questions about the slave trade at the dinner table. Though Fanny’s timid inquiries
                about slavery threaten to disrupt the tranquility of Mansfield Park, they hardly
                amount to the kind of political voice Spivak problematizes, nor do they qualify as
                silence within the terms of Said’s famous critique, even if she is in fact silenced.
                If Fanny’s questions fall on deaf ears, it is not because they do not echo in the
                room, but because they travel at an inconvenient frequency. “When Austen asks us to
                listen to noise,” Festa observes, “she is asking us to recognize that noise is <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> simply what needs to be blocked out to hear the ‘real’
                message, like the static that makes the radio hard to hear. It may be something—in
                this respect, noise is like Fanny—that we need to listen <hi rend="italic"
                >for</hi>.” (153). In other words, listening for noise means being alert to the
                static in the soundscape of the imperial world that so often escapes representation.
                Pondering the marked noisiness of <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, Festa
                concludes that Austen implores us to open our ears to precisely this kind of
                imperial static. </p>
            <p>In this essay I propose that we accept Festa’s invitation to listen for noise in the
                literature of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world. Instead of attending to
                fiction, however, I invite us to listen to the poetry that fills the archive. Poetry
                is obviously rich in sound—meter, rhyme, alliteration, etc.—but its <hi
                    rend="italic">noise</hi>, as Festa has defined it, is not always something that
                is heard or listened for. Fortunately for us, the archive of slavery contains plenty
                of poetry, primarily because abolitionists understood verse as a powerful medium
                that arouses the moral sentiments. One of the most popular forms embraced by
                antislavery poets was the ballad, a poetic genre that is particularly noisy because
                it reverberates a national history and an oral tradition <hi rend="color(#ff0000)"
                    >that is only rarely attended to</hi>. While balladeers construct a voice (or
                voices) in their ballads, other historical noises haunt the form, including a
                musical tradition. When I teach ballads by abolitionist poets like William Cowper
                and Hannah More in my classroom, I begin by asking my students to examine the formal
                and rhetorical strategies that these white writers used to construct enslaved Black
                voices. Part of this exercise, however, requires that we listen beyond the
                constructed voice found on the surface of the poem to the musical history that today
                only comes through as static, or, as Festa proposes, as noise. Rarely do teachers of
                poetry pay attention to ballad tune, but doing so can sometimes help clarify the
                political stakes of a poem. In Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” and More’s “The
                Sorrows of Yamba” this musical dimension allows us to access a British imperial
                history through tune that enriches our political sense of these poems. For
                contemporaries of Cowper and More, old ballad tunes might affect listeners given
                their own familiarity with national songs, but for today’s readers of poetry tunes
                are more often than not meaningless static. In what follows I consider the ballad’s
                media history as a kind of meaningful noise that, in the context of British slavery
                and abolition, raises important questions about the limits of political
                representation and voice for enslaved subjects. </p>
            <p>I teach eighteenth and early nineteenth-century British antislavery ballads alongside
                M. NourbeSe Philip’s astounding collection of poems, <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>
                (2008), which taps into a related, but altogether distinct form of static—the noise
                in the law. Philip’s title refers to the infamous eighteenth century slave ship that
                became the subject a horrific and historic British legal case, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> (1783). The <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> witnessed the
                intentional mass drowning of over one hundred African slaves in order to claim an
                insurance policy on its human cargo, a great fraction of which had become sick at
                sea from disease or malnourishment. When the insurance company refused to pay out
                the claim on the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>’s enslaved cargo, William Gregson and
                his syndicate brought the case to trial. While technically tried as a disagreement
                about an insurance policy, the case opened up a host of ethical questions regarding
                the treatment of slaves at sea. Lord Mansfield, who presided over several landmark
                cases devoted to the slave trade, ultimately ruled against the owners of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong</hi> on a technicality—evidence arose in the ship’s log that
                rainfall had ameliorated the water shortage that Gregson and his crew claimed made
                the cargo disposable. Philip’s extraordinary project in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>
                is to listen for the noise of slavery in the legal documents of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> and to reconstruct poems using only that language to
                offer testimony that was inadmissible at the time of the trial, testimony that could
                only be dismissed as legal noise. My aim in pairing antislavery and contemporary
                poems in this class is to underscore the precarity of political voice in the slavery
                archive. To this end I engage my students in a conversation about the limits of
                poetic justice in verse about transatlantic slavery by uncovering the profound
                historical and interpretive potential of what I have outlined here as noise. </p>
            <p>II. Ballad Noise</p>
            <p>The task of listening for noise in antislavery ballads is perhaps more challenging
                than in a study of fiction because, of course, poetry is so noisy. At the same time,
                critics and teachers of poetry are used to being attentive to sounds that students
                or lay readers may not listen for. Beyond listening to narrative or voice in poetry,
                there is also meter, rhythm, rhyme, and alliteration, frequent topics of discussion
                in any class on poetry. In the case of the ballad, however, there is also tune.
                Music is often overlooked because the literary study of the ballad tradition since
                the nineteenth century deprioritized tune in favor of qualities like lyric voice, a
                shift that all but rendered tune an inconsequential noise. Prior to the nineteenth
                century, however, printed ballads were understood as lyrics accompanied by a musical
                score that functioned as a deeply meaningful dimension to any ballad. Music works on
                us in a way that precedes cognition and can possess us like a spirit from without.
                In the ballad tradition tunes were recycled for new poems, which meant that modern
                ballads often carried a tune from a much older song. This detail in the ballad’s
                media history places the genre in a special category in the poetic tradition because
                ballads carry a musical past that is now commonly ignored as <hi rend="italic"
                    >noise</hi>.</p>
            <p>Two canonical eighteenth century antislavery ballads carry an old tune that we should
                listen for: William Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and Hannah More’s “The
                Sorrows of Yamba” (1797). The old song these poems echo is Richard Glover’s “Admiral
                Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), a naval ballad written during the Walpole era that
                celebrates a military victory in the Spanish West Indies and mourns the tragic and
                avoidable loss of thousands of English sailors to yellow fever on those waters. In
                Glover’s political ballad, the ghosts of these sailors call out to the reader to be
                remembered for their service and sacrifice. In my classroom I invite my students to
                listen to Glover’s song, and I ask them what it might mean that the Black enslaved
                voices constructed by Cowper and More are mediated and amplified by a tune about
                thousands of white English sailors who perished at sea. Why would Cowper and More
                make such a formal decision? And, what are some of the challenges that this decision
                poses for the political and literary representation of African slaves during the
                abolition debate? In other words, I ask how we might read “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                as a kind of meaningful noise.</p>
            <p> All of these questions stem from a common problem—<hi rend="italic">mediation</hi>.
                Fortunately for us the thematic ghostliness of Glover’s ballad allows us to bring
                all of the ways in which mediation is in play into clear focus. The most obvious
                starting point is thinking about the ballad as a poetic medium, not only in terms of
                the layered musical and lyrical richness I’ve already described, but also as an oral
                form that migrated into print culture in the late eighteenth century as collections
                like Thomas Percy’s <hi rend="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi> (1765)
                were assembled. In fact, Percy included Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” in
                his popular compendium of national songs. As Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan have
                observed, poets of Cowper’s generation participated in finding a middle ground
                between oral and printed ballad forms in crafting new ballads during a period of
                media transition (242). Indeed Cowper and More are members of the last generation of
                poets to seriously and intentionally engage the musical dimension of the ballad. </p>
            <p>Another way to think about mediation in these poems is in spiritual terms. Mediums,
                after all, are those persons who channel spirits from another world to our own. In
                “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover performs the task of giving voice to the sailors
                haunting that poem. In the later antislavery ballads that carry its tune, the
                enslaved speakers function as another kind of medium altogether in their
                reverberation of the older naval song. These enslaved subjects both echo and jar
                against the voices of the sailors in Glover’s poem because their historical
                situations couldn’t be more different.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="end" n="2"><p> This
                        conflation between sailor and slave may recall Robert Southey’s “The Sailor
                        who had Served in the Slave Trade” (1798). See his<hi rend="italic"
                            >Poems</hi>, 2 vols. (Bristol, 1799), II, pp. 107-119. In this ballad
                        narrative, a sailor returns to England from the “slave coast” traumatized by
                        having been forced to beat a female slave to death. Southey’s narrative
                        exposes the communal trauma suffered by everyone who participates in the
                        institution of slavery, but he also reveals the extent to which men like
                        this sailor may similarly be deprived of their will. While in Cowper and
                        More’s ballads, the slave speakers are haunted by music expressing the
                        plaints of dead sailors in Glover’s song, Southey’s sailor is haunted by the
                        enslaved victim he was compelled to torture. </p></note> Further still,
                Cowper and More act as mediums for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Black voices they
                represent <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the ghosts of Glover’s ballad. When I present
                the layered and haunted quality of these ballads in my classroom, my students are
                often surprised and provoked by the racial complexity of the voices they hear—the
                enslaved African speakers are politically mediated by both white poets and the
                spirits of white British sailors.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="end" n="3"> The relaying
                    of voice found in Cowper and More’s ballads offers a related, but contrasting
                    example of what Maureen McLane has identified in the remediation of songs by
                    Africans and Native Americans collected from imperial borders. In ballads like
                    Mungo Park’s “Negro’s Song” and Anne Home Hunter’s “Cherokee Death Song,”
                    published in Joseph Ritson’s<hi rend="italic">Select Collection of English
                        Songs</hi> (1783), McLane considers occasions of authentic African and
                    American ditties returned to England where they are versified and set to music.
                    This process of remediation traces the migration of the song as it crosses
                    imperial boundaries, where the musical instruments and poetic forms of polite
                    society transform it for the English ear. See Maureen McLane, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of Romantic Poetry</hi> (New York:
                    Cambridge University Press, 2011): 108. Unlike these cases in which English
                    lyricists bring home tunes from imperial territories for remediation, Cowper and
                    More’s ballads are English songs dispatched across the Atlantic and placed in
                    the mouths of African slaves. But, this dispatch, oddly enough, returns to the
                    scene of Hosier’s tragedy. Thus, “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” which experienced its
                    own transatlantic vocalization, uncannily wanders back to its place of
                    origin—the Atlantic—only to be re-vocalized by a foreign, racialized body for
                    new political purposes. I discuss this distinction in my own essay on this
                    subject, see Ortiz, “Lyric Possession in the Abolition Ballad,” <hi
                        rend="italic">Eighteenth-Century Studies</hi> 51:2 (Winter 2018): 197-218.
                    In teaching antislavery ballads, one may emphasize this history of problematic
                    international musical dialogue and appropriation across the British
                    Empire.</note> Understanding these layers, they are more fully aware of the
                rhetorical strategies and stakes involved in the ballad form in the abolition
                context. </p>
            <p>What becomes clear in this triad of ballads is that haunting is both formal and
                political. “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” functions as a kind of historical white noise
                resounding in the later soundscapes of “The Negro’s Complaint” and “The Sorrows of
                Yamba.” In media studies, the term <hi rend="italic">white noise</hi> refers to
                static in excess of the intended signal or message being transmitted. In the
                antislavery ballad tradition, I’m interested in thinking not only about music or
                tune as white noise in academic studies of the ballad, but in the racial
                implications of this music—the whiteness of the voices amplifying Black, enslaved
                speakers. Beyond this ghostly musical mediation, these poems also exhibit a kind of
                possession that is intrinsic to the ballad form. As Susan Stewart argues in her
                essay “Lyric Possession,” poets who write ballads are implicitly possessed by a
                national history as they broadcast an oral tradition in their revision older songs.
                “Of all the singers of the Western lyric,” Stewart writes, “the ballad singer is the
                one most radically haunted by others, for he or she presents the gestures, the
                symptoms of a range of social actors, and he or she presents those gestures as
                symptoms of a previous action” (41). In other words, haunting is a formal process
                native to the very composition of ballads. The poet functions as a medium for
                historical action in their embodied composition of a new song according to an older
                musical and metrical schema. Stewart calls this the “submersion of will within
                convention” (40). In the poems we are dealing with, however, possession is just as
                political as it is formal insofar as they condemn an institution that supports the
                deprivation of human will. Bound by the formal imperatives of the ballad tradition,
                Cowper and More become strange mediums and precarious political representatives in
                their attempts to embody the experience of enslaved persons while conjuring a formal
                and national history. Moreover, the voices we find ringing in the ballads form a
                strange and spectral chorus of competing political pleas. </p>
            <p>As scholars like Simon Gikandi, Laura Doyle, and Ian Baucom argue, the archive of
                Atlantic Slavery is hauntological and generically marked by the gothic. One of the
                Afro-Caribbean spiritual practices that I share with my students in our discussion
                of lyric possession is <hi rend="italic">obeah</hi>, a common ritual among early
                slave communities in the West Indies. As Alan Richardson has revealed, obeah was a
                slave practice that struck fear among the British in the Caribbean and in England
                after it began to appear in popular fiction and poetry in the late eighteenth
                century, as we find in William Earle’s sensational novel, <hi rend="italic">Obi; or
                    the History of Three-Fingered Jack </hi>(1800).<note xml:id="ftn7" place="end"
                    n="4"><p> As Richardson proposes, representations of obeah increased anxiety and
                        agitation in the wake of slave uprisings. See Alan Richardson, “Romantic
                        Voodoo: Obeah and British Culture 1797-1807,”<hi rend="italic">Studies in
                            Romanticism</hi> 32:1 (1993): 3-28. See also William Earle’s sensational
                        1800 novel about obeah and Jamaican folk hero Jack Mansong, <hi
                            rend="italic">Obi; or the History of Three-Fingered Jack</hi>, ed.
                        Srinivas Aravamudan (Ontario, CA: Broadview, 2005). The politics of lyric
                        possession we find in the antislavery ballad seems in dialogue with charged
                        spiritual practices like obeah.</p></note> Accounts of obeah rituals also
                filled popular histories of the West Indies, including Edward Long’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Jamaica</hi> (1774). These representations amplified
                colonial anxiety in the wake of slave rebellions in the West Indies, and exacerbated
                national tensions generated by political revolutions in France, Haiti, and America.
                For our purposes, however, obeah might be considered as one form of imperial noise
                that echoed within British cultural production about slavery at this time. In its
                investment in ritual and incantation, we might also think about obeah as an
                Afro-Caribbean analogue to lyric possession, as we see in William Shepherd’s poem
                “The Negro Incantation” (1797). In this poem, Shepherd parrots an obi priest via the
                ode form as he calls for “the white man’s doom” by spurring a slave insurgency using
                material rituals and lyric conjuring:</p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">Haste! the magic shreds prepare—<lb/>Thus the white man's
                    corse we tear.<lb/>Lo! feathers from the raven's plume,<lb/>That croaks our
                    proud Oppressor's doom.<lb/>Now to aid the potent spell,<lb/>Crush we next the
                    brittle shell—<lb/>Fearful omen to the foe,<lb/>Look! the blanched bones we
                    throw (ll. 25-32).</hi></p>
            <p>If the lyric possession we find in ballads by Cowper and More summons the specters of
                British imperial history through music, Shepherd invokes the spirit of obeah to
                craft a political ode designed to raise alarm about racial and imperial tensions in
                the West Indies. Discussing obeah alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s own incantatory
                poetics raises fascinating questions about the limits of Western poetic forms like
                the ballad or the ode when framing historical Black voices. As Philip argues in her
                essay “Notanda,” the project of rescuing enslaved Black voices from the history of
                British law required a poetic approach that exceeded the rationality of Western
                forms. The poems generated by Philip’s “irrational” approach to historical texts
                seem to echo the radical shamanistic practice of obeah in colonial life in ways that
                feel historically authentic and politically effective. Form, Philip teaches us, can
                sometimes speak so loudly as to drown out the voices poetry is meant to broadcast. I
                will return to obeah in the third section. </p>
            <p>By reading British antislavery and naval ballads together with my students, I aim to
                accomplish several things. First, I demonstrate how a Black voice is constructed in
                an antislavery ballad and generate discussion around the politics of that
                construction with special attention to the rhetoric of voice in each poem. Second, I
                teach my students about ballad form and its media history, including the element of
                music so often overlooked in the study of the ballad. Next, I share the political
                history of Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” and comment on how it intersects with
                British transatlantic slavery. My goal at the end of these exercises is to invite
                students to think critically about what it means for Cowper and More to have chosen
                Glover’s song as a tune and a spirit for the voices of enslaved Black subjects in
                their poems. </p>
            <p>My approach to these complex poems in the classroom is that I first invite my
                students to close read Cowper and More’s ballads together and to pay close attention
                to voice. Whose voice(s) are we hearing? And, who is listening? I remind them that
                these are lyric poems by white, English writers who construct an African subject and
                voice for an English audience. Our first exercise is to deconstruct that voice to
                understand the rhetorical strategies at work in the two poems, which are distinct in
                both message and approach. We find that Cowper’s African speaker makes a rational
                plea for liberation and challenges the reader to examine his or her own sense of
                justice in the face of the appeal. More’s Yamba, on the other hand, offers a much
                more sentimental and sympathetic voice whose tragic story is designed to appeal to
                our moral feelings. Moreover, Yamba echoes an Evangelical narrative in her turning
                to a missionary to find solace in a Christian life and its teachings. To shed light
                on each poet’s rhetorical strategy, I offer up biographical details about Cowper and
                More that give us some insight, including Cowper’s religious mania and isolation and
                More’s commitment to practical and religious teachings for the working class public
                in writings like the <hi rend="italic">Cheap Repository Tracts</hi> (where Yamba
                appeared). These biographical details help students understand that there are
                personal traces of Cowper and More in the Black voices they construct.<note
                    xml:id="ftn7" place="end" n="5"><p> Hannah More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba”
                        introduces new complications to the political voice constructed in the
                        abolition ballad. Alan Richardson has exposed a fascinating conflict of
                        authorial voice in the poem’s textual history. According to Richardson, the
                        poem was originally penned by minor Scottish poet, Eaglesfield Smith, and
                        first published in<hi rend="italic">Universal Magazine</hi>, and
                        subsequently expanded by More under an anonymous re-publication in the
                        highly popular <hi rend="italic">Cheap Repository Tracts</hi>, which
                        promoted middle-class values of religious and social obedience. Such mixed
                        and unstable authorship underscores the plurality of voices native to the
                        ballad form; it also highlights an Anglo-Scottish colonial ideological
                        problem that plays itself out in the poem’s variants. What was, in Smith’s
                        hands, an outright critique of imperial commerce parroted by an African
                        voice, turns into a much less censorious narrative about Christian
                        conversion and Yamba’s forgiveness of her masters in More’s version. See
                        Alan Richardson, “'The Sorrows of Yamba,' by Eaglesfield Smith and Hannah
                        More: Authorship, Ideology and the Fractures of Antislavery Discourse,” <hi

                        1992). </p></note> One of the awkward attunements we find in More’s poem is
                that it displays an attempt at Afro-Caribbean dialect. This is common among ballads
                in the abolition archive and significant because ballads must also adhere to the
                genre’s metrical patterns. What does it mean, I ask my students, that poets
                attempted dialect while at the same time accommodating the voice to English ballad
                meter? Finally, I contextualize the poems in the wider historical landscape,
                pointing out the More’s poem was composed after the beginning of the French and
                Haitian Revolutions, which may account for its more conservative tone and narrative.
                I often generate discussion around the political efficacy of each ballad by asking
                students to compare their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <p> Because these poems were distributed as broadsides and our attention is on ballad
                media, I share images of both broadsides with my students. As popular forms,
                broadsides were inexpensive literature and news media that circulated widely in town
                centers (coffee houses, taverns, etc.), and eventually migrated out into the
                country. As historian of abolition Brycchan Carey has shown, a ballad reproduced on
                broadsheets could circulate rapidly, particularly if the ballad were set to a
                recognizable form and tune (100). Abolitionists working with the Society for
                Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade understood the importance of inexpensive
                print materials as they sought to reach a wide popular audience, and the broadside
                was an ideal vehicle for their message. The broadsides printed for Cowper and More’s
                ballads usually advertise “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as the tune for their poems
                underneath the title. Glover’s song was a popular tune that one might hear played in
                an eighteenth century drawing room, and so I make sure to play a recording of the
                song, accessible to everyone on YouTube, in my classroom (<ptr
                    target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uudj1au2H9M"/>). The purpose of this
                demonstration is to immerse my students in the ballad’s media history. In the past I
                have even printed the ballads on single sheets so that students might read the poem
                as the tune plays. Once students hear the tune, they are immediately struck by the
                awkwardness of framing a slave voice in the tunes and metrical frameworks of polite
                society. A productive conversation can emerge from reflecting on the aesthetic
                effects of these formal choices when students are reminded of the intended British
                audience, and the sensitive political debate around slavery happening at the time.
                In order for a British public to connect and sympathize with an enslaved African
                subject, he or she needed to sound as British as possible. </p>
            <p>Next we turn to the broadside for “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), which features a
                striking political cartoon of maritime specters rising from the Caribbean Sea. I
                offer my students an account of the dynamic political climate surrounding Richard
                Glover’s poem, and some details about Glover himself. Descended from the merchant
                class in London, Glover supported the financial interests of trading companies that
                trafficked across the Atlantic, including companies that bought and sold African
                slaves (<hi rend="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi>, “Richard
                Glover”). In the early eighteenth century British trading vessels were routinely
                attacked and raided by Spanish ships. Because Robert Walpole was reluctant to go to
                war with Spain at this time, London merchants heavily criticized his lack of
                aggression against Spanish interference in the West Indies (Rodger, 234). When
                Walpole sent Vice-Admiral Francis Hosier and his fleet to conduct a blockade along
                the mosquito-infested waters of Porto Bello in 1726, over 3,000 sailors contracted
                yellow fever and died. Seeing his opportunity to criticize Walpole, Glover drafted
                “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” to remind the British public of the fatal consequences of
                Walpole’s refusal to simply overtake the Spanish port. In the poem, Hosier’s spirit
                rises from the waters of Porto Bello to relate his melancholy tale to Admiral
                Vernon, who successfully sacked Porto Bello twelve years later in 1739. The ballad
                thus mourns the lives of the sailors lost in Porto Bello due to Walpole’s military
                failure, while celebrating Vernon’s later victory for Britain. </p>

            <p rend="center">National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London.</p>
            <p>In “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover’s strategy is to exhume recent history from the
                sea for political purposes, which is also the strategy employed by Cowper and More
                in their later antislavery ballads. When we read the poem in the classroom, I ask
                students to consider the dead sailors’ spectral plea to be remembered for their
                sacrifice in the midst of imperial triumph. Hosier’s ghost rises from the waters and
                addresses the victorious Vernon on behalf of his crew:</p>
            <p>See these mournful Spectres sweeping,<lb/>Ghastly, o’er this hated wave,<lb/>Whose
                wan Cheeks are stain’d with weeping:<lb/>These were English Captains brave:<lb/>Mark
                those Numbers pale and horrid,<lb/>Who were once my sailors bold,<lb/>Lo, each hangs
                his drooping Forehead,<lb/>While his dismal Fate is told. (ll. 32-40)</p>
            <p>I ask my students to think about what this plea for remembrance means when the tune
                of Glover’s poem transfers the sentiment to the tongue of the enslaved speaker in
                Cowper and More’s later ballads. As a way to think through this question, I offer
                more historical context to Porto Bello, the port where Hosier and his men perished.
                In the early eighteenth century Porto Bello was a major Spanish outpost for the
                slave trade, and historians reveal that many slaves in the region suffered and died
                of the very yellow fever that claimed Hosier and his men (Lohse, 74-109). While it
                is not at all surprising that these African voices are not heard in Glover’s ballad,
                it is significant that Cowper and More later give voice to their own enslaved
                speakers by echoing, at least musically, the voices of the sailors from that
                original ballad. In other words, the noise of slavery ringing in Porto Bello was
                muted in Glover’s ballad and only becomes audible in the antislavery ballads that
                recycle its tune decades later. One other important detail to emphasize in
                discussing the poem is that, while Glover’s song is elegiac in tone, it actually
                celebrates Vernon’s victory and imperial expansion in the Caribbean, and implicitly
                supports the trading interests of companies trafficking in enslaved bodies at that
                time. In this light, “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” seems out of tune with the political
                message of the later antislavery ballads that echo its music. Discussing Cowper and
                More’s potential motivation for this awkward decision with students is a generative
                exercise. While the melancholy tone and maritime context certainly seems
                appropriate, the actual politics of Glover’s song—the zeal for the expansion of
                empire—seems dissonant with that of the antislavery lyrics. One explanation that may
                be offered is that the poets sought to reform the imperial economic impulse of
                Glover’s song by purging it of the moral stain of slavery and overwriting its voices
                with those of the disenfranchised. </p>
            <p>Coming back to the question of voice can help students understand the real
                limitations of political sympathy in this context. Whose voice(s) do we hear in
                these poems, and why does it matter? The white noise we hear in antislavery ballads
                by Cowper and More is, after all, the spectral chorus of Glover’s song. It is likely
                that these poets chose Glover’s tune in order to strengthen sympathy for their
                African subjects. However, as Saidiya Hartman has proposed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scenes of Subjection</hi>, sympathy in the literature of slavery and abolition
                can be as destructive a mechanism as it is humanizing. While we typically understand
                sympathy as our best means of human connection, it can often obliterate otherness in
                the process because it “fails to expand the space of the other and merely places the
                self in its stead” (20). The abolitionist project is often criticized for the ways
                in which the literature it produced whitewashed its African subjects, a
                transformation that seemed necessary for political reform at the time. Choosing
                Glover’s tune for their ballads, Cowper and More hoped to tap into a well of
                melancholy about the loss of English sailors during a major event in English
                imperial history. In doing so, they sought to facilitate as much sympathy as
                possible, but that mediation certainly comes at the cost of an authentic encounter
                with human otherness. To encounter otherness more directly would require a
                recognition of the limitations of sympathy given our <anchor type="bookmark-start"

                />national, racial, and gendered identity. It would also require an understanding of
                the limitations of the British abolitionist archive, which might be supplemented by
                West African or Caribbean texts that may have seemed alien to the British public,
                particularly those less mediated by abolitionist leaders, such as African music and
                song. </p>
            <p>Another complication with respect to sympathy is the difference in situation between
                an encounter with one voice as opposed to many. While it seems natural to feel a
                more powerful sympathy for an individual, these sonically layered poems do in fact
                conjure a chorus of voices. M. NourbeSe Philip’s contemporary poetry collection <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong!</hi> develops this problem by refusing to construct
                individual voices altogether. Instead, her poems about slavery are fragments of
                voices rescued from the language of history and the law. White noise thus forms the
                polyphonic text of the <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection, allowing Philip to
                foreground the absence of enslaved voices in the archive while preserving the
                language of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. Engaging these cacophonous
                and irrational poems, sympathy seems impossible, and perhaps beside the point. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> Philip transforms the noise in the law surrounding
                the horrific Zong Massacre into a kind of poetry whose aim is not to generate
                sympathy, but to stage an ethical encounter with the victims of history that is as
                irrational as the event itself. </p>
            <p>III. Listening for Noise in the Law</p>
            <p>When I turn to M. NourbeSe Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection with my
                students, I ask them to think about noise and formal haunting in a slightly
                different way about a similar scene and situation. Both the Zong Massacre and the
                deadly plague in Porto Bello featured in “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” are tragic and
                melancholy episodes in British imperial history. However, Philip’s poetic approach
                to history is vastly different from that of Cowper and More. As an Afro-Canadian
                attorney as well as a poet, Philip’s shared interests in the history of
                transatlantic slavery and the law drew her to the Zong Massacre. Philip’s project in
                    <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is to listen to the noise in the legal documents of
                    <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>, and to make that noise available to
                readers as poetic language. This involves mutilating the text of Lord Mansfield’s
                decision in that case and using it as a repository of language to reconstitute
                traces of the voices of the slaves muzzled by the legal proceedings using only that
                language. While Mansfield famously expressed personal disgust with the institution
                of slavery, the conventions of the law prevented him from writing a decision that
                recognized the African slaves under question as legal or political subjects. Part of
                Philip’s challenge in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>, then, is to use that same
                language to attempt to give voice and reconstitute subjectivity, even if only in a
                fragmentary way. </p>
            <p>Understanding that the task of mediating individual voices is impossible and perhaps
                ethically problematic, Philip allows testimony to come through as linguistic noise.
                We might say she is attempting to reconstruct historical subjectivity <hi
                    rend="italic">as noise</hi>. She explains her process in an essay called
                “Notanda” included at the end of the collection in which she tracks her difficult
                journey making sense of the case. Philip begins her essay with this statement:
                “There is no telling this story; it must be told.” What she means is that to render
                the story of the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> in poetic narrative would be impossible
                because it absolutely resists narration. And yet, it must be told. The problem as
                Philip sees it is that the horrors of the Zong Massacre resist logic and
                rationality, and no sense could possibly be made from a mere accounting of the
                details of the story, or from listening to any one historical perspective. Her
                solution is to commit herself to the irrational because the event itself was
                irrational. Only by “not-telling,” then, can the story be told. The “not-telling”
                involves fragmenting the story told by the law and letting the noise in the legal
                archive come through <hi rend="italic">as noise</hi> instead of potentially
                meaningful silence. Because Philip is not interested a single voice or testimony (as
                Cowper and More are), I ask my students to consider what the fragmentation of
                language accomplishes that a ballad narrative cannot. Ultimately, I am interested in
                what kinds of justice, poetic or otherwise, emerge in each of these poems and what
                obstacles lie in the way of that justice. </p>
            <p>Aside from assigning the first section of Philip’s collection called “Os,” I also ask
                my students to read Philip’s essay describing the project (“Notanda”), as well as
                Lord Mansfield’s brief decision in <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> (1783),
                both of which are included at the end of Philip’s collection. The form noise takes
                in Philip’s collection is the violent disordering of legal language: “I murder the
                text, literally cut it into pieces, castrating verbs, suffocating adjectives,
                murdering nouns, throwing articles, prepositions, conjunctions overboard,
                jettisoningnouns…create semantic mayhem” (“Notanda,” 193). The poems reconstructed
                from this mutilated language are spare and wild word arrangements on the page,
                liberated entirely from the restrictions of grammar and form. They can be read
                horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, either from top to bottom or the reverse.
                The thoughts and ideas the word arrangements generate are not only specters of the
                transatlantic slave trade, they are also the dark matter of the law. If the law
                employs language to create order and meaning in the realm of human action, poetry
                can, Philip suggests, “engage language that is neither rational, logical,
                predictable, or ordered” (197). By subverting the legal language of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert </hi>in an act of poetic violence, Philip
                conjures the shadows surrounding the Zong Massacre to access the human sounds
                obscured by the trial: “<hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> bears witness to the
                ‘resurfacing of the drowned and the oppressed’ and transforms the dessicated, legal
                report into a cacophony of voices—wails, cries, moans, and shouts that had earlier
                been banned from the text” (203). Unlike the singular voices constructed in the
                abolition ballads by Cowper and More, Philip’s voices are plural, fragmented, and
                just barely articulate. They do not tell a story as those ballads do; instead, they
                echo the senselessness of the Zong Massacre in language that never really settles
                into a coherent account. Philip’s poems are thus fragments of voices that bubble up
                to the surface from the sea of history. </p>
            <p>Because Philip’s poems begin from a place of abstraction, they pose many interpretive
                challenges for scholars and students alike. As spare word arrangements floating on
                the white page, Philip encourages a kind of reading that breaks free from tradition.
                Instead of following a narrative thread, or even one channel of abstract thought
                along a single verse, the language of the poem surfaces at random as ideas, images,
                and concepts catch the reader’s attention. There is no order or story to discern in
                the poems, only fragments of voice and thought rescued from the restrictive legal
                documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. While the poems are
                challenging in their abstraction, they also present teachers with a rich opportunity
                for conversation in the classroom. Breaking the class into small groups each of
                which spends time with one poem can be especially productive. The groups might spend
                10-15 minutes to linger with one poem and take notes. Students make a collective
                list of the words, phrases, statements or ideas that come through the language on
                the page. Each group then considers and discusses what the poem wants the reader to
                receive. After the exercise, come back together as a class and project each poem on
                the screen for everyone to see, one at a time. Individual groups review their notes
                with the class and report on what the poem spoke to them. </p>
            <p>Before each group reports back to the whole class, I like to revisit Philip’s journal
                entry from July, 12, 2002, which she includes in “Notanda”. Reading this entry
                informs our understanding of the element of haunting involved in Philip’s process of
                composition, which complicates my students’ sense of poetic agency:</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Some—all the poems—need a great deal of space around them—as if
                    there is too much cramping around them, as if they need to breathe…</hi></p>

            </list>
            <p>This journal entry describes a conjuring. Philip’s process recalls a form of lyric
                possession described by Susan Stewart, but one that is markedly different as well.
                While the possession Stewart describes involves submitting one’s will to convention
                and to the irrationality of tune and meter, Philip is not plugging into the poetic
                tradition of the balladeer. She has a much more difficult task—to listen to the
                noise beyond the medium of the law for the voices silenced by the law as if she were
                listening to voices under water. Philip burns incense, prepares herself for a
                visitation, and allows the words to “suggest how to work with them.” In listening
                for this kind of noise, Philip becomes a scribe for a story that can’t be told.
                Moreover, by submitting herself to ritual practice—burning incense—while listening
                to the British legal texts for the words to “leap out” at her, Philip’s process
                recalls the conjuring involved in obeah incantation. What makes this ritual unique,
                however, is its application of spiritual conjuring to the interpretation of British
                law. In this context, as an Afro-Canadian poet, Philip mediates the hauntological
                much like Cowper or More. It might be productive during this exercise to introduce
                William Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation,” which adopts the ode form to frame a
                Black obi voice, to underscore the radical significance of Philip’s approach. While
                Shepherd’s poem does capture the voice of Black colonial resistance, that voice is
                clearly bound by a white Western formal poetics. In Philip’s poems, however, Black
                voices are conjured and allowed to float freely on the page to make their own kind
                of noise, resisting the demands of a unified and coherent Western lyric
                subjectivity. This approach does justice to the historical denial of testimony by
                enslaved Black peoples in the discourse of the law while offering them a different
                kind of testimony, one that falls short of political voice, but transcends legal
                silence. </p>
            <p>What students may realize during their own reading experience is that it resembles
                Philip’s process of composition. That is, just as the words suggested their own
                arrangement to the poet, they also offer up bits of meaning in dynamic
                configurations in the process of reading. Moreover, students may observe that the
                poems do not only echo slave voices crying out, they also offer up concepts from the
                legal texts that are up for critique or condemnation. Such configurations, when
                framed by the blinding whiteness of the page, arouse a horror that would be
                difficult to recognize if embedded in the original context. The work of making noise
                available to readers, Philip seems to suggest, sometimes involves dialing down the
                message of most of the original document(s) to make more audible those parts that we
                should linger on. </p>
            <p>After each group presents their reflections to the class, I ask my students to
                critique Philip’s project and her creative/destructive dialogue between poetry and
                the law. I ask them what poetic justice means in a project like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!.</hi> Does it matter that there is no single voice, or testimony, or
                point of view? Does abstraction get in the way of the story that “can’t be told”? I
                also ask them to compare the kinds of justice achieved by Cowper and More in their
                antislavery ballads. Those poems are unified voices and narratives and communicate a
                message that is intelligible and digestible for readers. Moreover, they allow the
                reader to engage in (or at least perform) acts of sympathy with the speakers in the
                poems. At the same time, they feature other voices (the sailors in Glover’s song) by
                way of music—is sympathy possible there? Or is music so subliminal that it bypasses
                sympathy? The most important question to ask about <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is
                whether sympathy is possible in such fragmented language? If sympathy can’t be
                generated, what is achieved by Philip? Whatever it is, is it more powerful than
                sympathy? If so, why? </p>
            <p>One of the memorable classroom conversations that has emerged from this series of
                questions is one about the similarities between sympathy and haunting. If, as Adam
                Smith famously theorized, sympathy is the imaginative mechanism whereby we place
                ourselves in the place of the other, it is by its very nature a kind of possession.
                In Cowper and More’s poems, the performance of sympathy in connecting to the African
                slave experience may seem like haunting, but it may also be read as another form of
                colonization where English sensibilities inhabit the bodies of others. At the same
                time, their use of Glover’s tune reminds us how unavoidably intertwined our
                histories are in a colonial narrative. In Philip’s project, however, haunting could
                never function as sympathy, for sympathy requires a coherent narrative or
                representation with which to identify. How do we connect to a story that can’t be
                told? The <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> poems facilitate a haunting in the reading
                experience that does not require the exchange of subjectivity we find in sympathy.
                We could never, after all, embody the experience of the Zong Massacre. Instead of
                hearing voices or testimonies from the sea of history, we can only listen to noise.
                Being attentive to that noise offers us, according to Philip, a more expansive
                ethical relationship to our traumatic past.</p>
            <p>IV. Visual Noise</p>
            <p>As a final exercise, one may introduce a group reflection devoted to visual noise by
                examining the political cartoon presented in Glover’s broadside alongside J.M.W.
                Turner’s famous painting, <hi rend="italic">The Slave Ship</hi> (1840), which Ian
                Baucom considers at length in his landmark study, <hi rend="italic">Specters of the
                    Atlantic</hi> (2005). Both images capture melancholy scenes in Britain’s
                maritime history and both are commentaries on empire. Moreover, they are both
                haunting seascapes that conjure the dead from below the water’s surface. Perhaps the
                most significant difference, however, is the representation of the dead. While
                Glover’s broadside gives clear individuality and outline to the spirits of the
                sailors who perished during Hosier’s blockade of Porto Bello, Turner’s drowned
                slaves dissolve in the sea. Pictorially, the slaves in Turner’s picture lack
                distinction, and the eye must strain to identify individual persons in the obscure
                detailing in the painting. Turner could have chosen to capture a scene of the Zong’s
                slaves being thrown overboard, as his original title suggests, but he chose instead
                to eliminate identifiable human bodies from his work altogether. Human life is
                hauntingly signaled by red and orange color in the water.<note xml:id="ftn7"
                    place="end" n="6"><p> Baucom writes, “Turner ... manages both to acknowledge the
                        unevenness of time, to admit the uncanny, repetitive presentness of the past
                        within the present,<hi rend="italic">and</hi> to smooth time out, to contain
                        the massacre within ‘past’ time by appearing to enjoin a choice between the
                        past and en emergent modernized present while indicating that there really
                        is no choice, only an occasion for disinterested sympathy and a decent
                        burial (of the dead, of the slave trade) that the living might live on

                <p>What does it mean, one could ask the class, that the sailors of Hosier’s
                    expedition receive individuality and voice as they address the victorious
                    Admiral Vernon, who triumphantly captures Porto Bello with ships that proudly
                    display the flag of Britannia? And, what does it mean that in Turner’s painting
                    the slaves thrown overboard become one with the sea in a horrifying, swelling
                    tide of color and light? What is the power of Turner’s decision to abstract the
                    human bodies in the water beyond recognition? After a conversation about this
                    pictorial distinction, one could observe that these two images strikingly
                    reflect the differences in representation we find between the abolition ballads
                    by Cowper and More and Philip’s fragmented voices in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zong!</hi>. In the latter, there is no lyric voice or identity to be
                    distinguished in the text, only traces of subjectivity floating on the page.
                    Visually, Turner found abstraction to be appropriate for an event so lacking in
                    humanity. Why is that? While a clear picture of the atrocity is unavailable to
                    us in Turner’s painting, the vibrant fragments in the water certainly come
                    through as an alarming form of noise. </p>
