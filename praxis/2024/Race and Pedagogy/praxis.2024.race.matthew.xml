            <p><note place="foot" resp="author"> I am grateful to Amelia Worsley and Joselyn M. Almeida for their work on this essay and to
                            Manu Chander, Tina Iemma, and Deanna Koretsky for reading

            <p>My decision to design a class that focuses on Romantic-era abolitionist literature
                was sparked by a student debate about how to interpret William Blake’s “The Little
                Black Boy.” It was in the spring of 2006, the semester before my tenure file was due
                and just a few years before the United States elected its first Black president.
                Students were reading the poem in my fairly traditional Romanticism survey, one that
                focused on canonical poets (the “Big Six”) along with Mary Shelley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valperga</hi>. The course
                paid very little attention to the debates about how these same writers responded to
                debates about England’s participation in the transatlantic slave trade, and for the
                first three years that I taught the poem, no student had challenged the line that we
                ended up discussing for a full 75-minute class period: “And I am black, but O! my soul is white”
                    (l.2) On a handout that included the poem and a few
                    warm-up questions, a student circled the line and wrote: “WTF??!!?” next to it.
                    A rambunctious debate that I wasn’t quite prepared to moderate followed. As a
                    specialist in regency and romantic-era fiction, I knew enough about Black
                    figures in eighteenth and nineteenth-century literature to help them understand the presence of Black people in Romantic-era
                    England.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See also: Gretchen, Gerzina, <hi rend="italic">Black

                                Forgotten History.</hi> Macmillan 2016. </note> As a Black woman
                    who spends a good amount of time navigating tense conversations about racism
                    with her students, I knew how to keep the conversation open, provocative, and
                    productive all at once. I did not, however, know enough about Blackness in
                    Romanticism to help my students think as carefully as I wanted them to about the
                    line. Working through what my students needed to contextualize the line and sorting out how to cultivate the same analytical energy in response to
                    their other readings lead to this
                    “abolitionist turn” in my teaching of Romanticism. In what follows I show how I
                    made this transition in my undergraduate and graduate courses. I
                    discuss critical essays that have been most useful for students and assignments
                    that can potentially take the work of the class beyond the university classroom.
                    Threaded through this reflection is a consideration of the question of how much
                    of the success of these curricular revisions is because they have responded to
                    students’ curiosity and their unusually animated response to Romantic-era
                    questions about race and social justice that resonate as contemporary. As I explain in my essay “Academic
                    Freedom: Students and the Problem with Labels,”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Matthew, Patricia A. “Academic Freedom:
                            Students and the Problem with Labels,”
                        <hi rend="italic">Profession</hi> Winter 2019.</note> I expend a great deal of energy preserving
                    class discussions as a space where students feel free to wrestle with complex
                    ideas, free from expectations that they reflect a specific political point of
                    view. I aim for what bell hooks calls for, namely the classroom as: “a democratic setting where everyone feels a responsibility
                    to contribute to a central goal of transformative pedagogy” (39). Teaching Romanticism with a focus on abolitionist
                    culture has made this goal easier to reach.I have found that in learning about an abolitionist Romanticism, students are
                not only studying historical texts and their connection to a movement, but are
                learning more about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution. </p>
                
            <p>When I started this process, I faced two
                    obstacles. First, my graduate training, which in 2006 was still the foundation
                    for teaching Romanticism, did not bring questions of race or Blackness to bear
                    on Romanticism. Additionally, as a new professor, I was anxious to teach
                    Romantic poetry in a way that was legible to senior British faculty, especially
                    those who looked askance at my decision to include novels in a course they
                    believed should only focus on poetry. I was also facing a short tenure clock and an
                    institutional environment hostile to faculty of color, realities that left me
                    little time to substantially revise the course I was hired to teach. As a
                    result, my first instinct was simply to add more texts that explicitly included
                    mentions of Black figures or referred to slavery or abolition. This, however,
                    felt like a superficial response to a pedagogical project that required nuance
                    not only in texts I might add to the syllabus but how those additions would
                    alter students understanding of the Romantic period. To put it simply, would it
                    matter if I added Ottobah Cugoano without thinking about how to reframe “The
                    Little Black Boy” or Blake and his contemporaries? In response to this set of
                    concerns, my initial impulse was to gather articles and
                    book chapters that focused on how the writers already on the syllabus thought
                    about the slave trade, abolition, amelioration, and emancipation. I also
                    experimented in the undergraduate classes I regularly taught (Introduction to
                    Theory, Art of Fiction, and The Novel to 1900) by introducing new primary texts.
                    I started with just a few texts (primarily fiction) and then planned short units
                    that included abolitionist literature that reflected the overall themes of the
                    courses. A course on women in nineteenth-century literature, for example,
                    included a unit on marriage and chattel slavery. I then offered a “special
                    topics” course that explicitly focused on abolition and the nineteenth century.
                    By the time my department added a new required course, “Writing for the Major,”
                    designed for students new to the English major in 2014, I had the materials to
                    plan an entire course that focused on the writers included on my Romanticism
                    syllabus and their contemporaries, and provided an opportunity for students to
                    think about race, abolition, and freedom as essential to how we read literature
                    regardless of the time period from which it emerges and not as a special course
                    but as a matter of course. </p>

                <p>The student’s visceral response to “And I
                        am black, but O! my soul is white” was because they were shocked about
                    what they interpreted as an exceptionally explicit affirmation of white
                    supremacy even given a time period they understood as less enlightened about
                    race. The debate that followed the WTF??!!?” mirrored tense exchanges I have seen among Romanticists and
                    scholars of pre-1900 British literature. Students who were troubled by the line
                    and those who read it as innocuous faced charges of either over or under reading
                    the line, with most Black students inclined to find it offensive and many white
                    students defending it as having emerged from a particular historical moment and
                    so exempt from contemporary ideas about what constitutes a racist moment in art.
                    In part because no one in class was committed to a defense of Blake, a poet few
                    if any of them had even read, students did not dwell on the either/or portion of
                    the debate. I also think students were willing to move beyond their initial
                    disagreements because in a diverse, multi-cultural class, in 2006 questions
                    about racism in Romantic-era literature felt largely theoretical and tied to the
                    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Obama and the backlash to his candidacy had
                    not entered their field of vision, and, unlike students who studied abolitionist
                    literature with me in the subsequent semesters, they had not yet confronted the
                    world of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, or the protests in Ferguson, Missouri.
                    Donald Trump was not yet legible to them as a political threat. As I discuss
                    below, Romanticism’s racism felt more contemporary near the end of Obama’s
                    presidency, but in 2006 they turned to historical context to interpret the line,
                    information about Blake and his contemporaries, and wanted to understand if the
                    language in the poem signified to eighteenth and nineteenth-century readers what
                    it meant to them in 2006. They also asked the same question about Blake that
                    critics defensive of their chosen authors ask when questions of race and racism
                    arise: if the line is racist, could we hold Blake responsible for ideas that
                    were widely, uncritically circulating in the 1800s but unacceptable now? They
                    were also, then, intensely curious to see how his contemporaries wrote about
                    this—if Blake was in step, out of a step, or prescient. When I explained that
                    the poem was published at a particularly active time in Britain’s abolitionist
                    movement, students wanted to know which “side” he was on, leading to what to my
                    mind was and remains the most important critical point of discussing
                    abolitionist politics. As I explained in that debate and continue to discuss in
                    my teaching, the terms used in the discussion about the transatlantic slave
                    trade—abolition, emancipation, amelioration, freedom—do not necessarily
                    correlate to notions of anti-racism, equality, and equity. It is, I made clear,
                    entirely possible for Blake to be opposed to slavery and still cling to racial
                    hierarchies.</p>
                  
                <p>David Bindman’s “Blake’s Vision of Slavery Revisited” proved an especially useful
                    follow-up to these questions about the poem. Despite more recent readings of

                    here offers a compelling, accessible history that answers students’ questions
                    about Blake’s understanding of race and how consistent it is with the period.
                    Bindman points us to work by Christopher Miller about how ancient Greeks
                    understood skin color: “Among the living I was very black, darkened by the rays
                    of the sun, but my soul, ever blooming with white flowers, won my prudent
                    master’s good will” (374). The essay also models for them student what it
                    requires to credibly reach the understanding that Bindman offers near the end of
                    his essay:
                    
                <quote>These two examples do not, of course, cast doubt on the sincerity of Blake’s
                    opposition to the slavery…They do, however, suggest that Blake was unable to
                    free himself—<hi rend="italic">no more than anyone else at the time</hi>—from
                    the complex and often contradictory web of ancient and modern beliefs that had
                    settled around African and Africans in the late eighteenth century. (382;
                    emphasis mine)</quote>
                    
                Where I might quibble with the aside I emphasized above—and I share my
                    disagreement with my students—I nonetheless have found Bindman’s essay
                    exceptionally useful because he models what students need to think about when
                    considering nineteenth-century representations of race. Bindman’s essay has been
                    a mainstay whenever I teach Blake and I pair it with Kwame Anthony Appiah’s
                    “Race”—an essay that succinctly traces how race functions as a social construct
                    in the nineteenth century and clearly explains that despite its constructedness,
                    it still carries social weight: 
                    
                <quote>For, however mythical the notion of race seems to be, we cannot deny the obvious
                    fact that having one set of heritable characteristics—dark skin, say—rather than
                    another—blonde hair, for example—can have profound psychological, economic, and
                    other social consequences, especially in societies where many people are not
                    only racialists but racists. </quote>
                    
                Appiah’s assertations here, about “heritable characteristics” made some students
                    uncomfortable, those who felt implicated by the idea that the characteristics
                    they were born with have social capital and those who chafed against the idea
                    that their characteristics may not overcome the obstacles they believe can be
                    dismantled with education. My students are wary of the idea of “white privilege”
                    because they associate it with economic wealth, but Appiah in this moment
                    articulates what the “privilege” looks like, quite literally.<note

                    their discomfort, students responded well to the accessibility of Appiah’s
                    analogies in the essay and, as a result, were better prepared to do the more
                    difficult conceptual work it takes to understand how he lays out the consequent
                    process of nation building and understandings of race: 
                    
                <quote>the dual connection made in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century thought between, on
                    the one hand, race and nationality, and, on the other, nationality and
                    literature. In short, the nation is the key middle term in understanding the
                    relations between the concept of race and the idea of literature. (282)</quote>
                    
               Appiah also addresses the impact of the idea of race as a social construction, an
                    idea too many of my students have turned to as a way to dismiss racism. In
                    “Writing for the Major” students also watched <ref
                        target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEOQcVLvnKo)">his interview</ref> with a
                        Foreign Affairs correspondent. His observations in the interview
                    prompts open and productive conversations about race and racism where student
                    curiosity about the history of race and earnest desire to understand how racism
                    work overcomes some of the defensiveness and anxiety they felt about a topic
                    that became increasingly fraught as their understanding of the world as racially
                    just was undermined by national events. </p>
                    
                <p>Although the “Writing for the Major” course began with “The Black Boy” and the
                    readings included poetry and prose by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, the
                    class was less explicitly about Romanticism as literary period and more about
                    the uses of literary analysis and research to understand the relationship
                    between literature and political movements. The goal was for students to study
                    how poets and novelists contribute to and shape national debates by paying
                    attention to the rhetoric abolitionists used to persuade their fellow citizens
                    to support abolition, amelioration, or emancipation. I organized the course
                    around a set of themes that often overlapped—consumer culture, gender, and
                    religious ideology. In addition to reading “The Little Black Boy,” the course
                    began with two exercises—a conversation about the various ways civic groups try
                    to effect broad change and a low-stakes free association exercise about the word
                    sugar. The free association regarding sugar initially struck them as odd because
                    the commodity they most associate with slavery is cotton, but, in addition to
                    preparing them for the way the sweetener was integral to abolitionist politics,
                    the free association exercise helped them understand the way that a consumable
                    object morphs into the imaginary and metaphoric. Without fail, each time I
                    taught the class the free association began with “honey” and invariably ended
                    with students listing songs that reference “Sugar Daddy” in their titles or
                    lyrics. This conflation of commodity, commerce, and desire prepared them for a
                    discussion Tina Turner and
                        Mick Jagger’s performance of “Brown Sugar.” This is a song that was still
                        familiar to most of them, one they grew up hearing. They may never have seen
                        the Turner-Jagger performance, but they recognize the opening chords and
                        know the start of the chorus. Students watched the video without the benefit
                        of having the lyrics in front of them, and then listened to the song again
                        while reading the lyrics. The conversation sparked by what the lines reveal
                        is not as angry as the debate about Blake, but it is intense:
                        
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields</l>
                        <l>Sold in the market down in New Orleans</l>
                    <l>Skydog slaver know he's doin' all
                        right</l>
                        <l>Hear him whip the women, just around midnight.</l>
                </lg>
                    
               I want to be clear here that
                        the point of this exercise was not to hunt for moments of popular culture
                        and vet them for their politics. Instead, I wanted to show students the long
                        reach of the tropes they were about to encounter. Still in each class some
                        sort of debate has ensued. Some students felt guilty for liking the song. In
                        one class, a few of the Black women tried to convince their classmates that
                        Jagger is satirizing and mocking English history, while others were unsure
                        of what to make of Turner’s full-throated participation in the performance.
                        These early class exercises primed students to push past any neat
                        assumptions about race, abolition, visual culture, and representations of
                        Black women in literature, visual culture, and film. It also prepared them
                        to think along with Christina Sharpe when we listened to <ref
                        target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhHmHYBssMc">her response </ref> to Kara Walker’s art
                            installation “The Subtlety.” Sharpe not
                        only provided a pointed critique of Walker and her use of the Black female
                        form but offered a model for students about how to ask productive questions
                        from the texts they read and see. </p>
                  
                <p>In addition to “The Little Black Boy,” the primary texts in the class included:
                    Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” Robert Southey’s six sonnet
                    sequence “Poems on the Slave Trade,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or,
                    How to Make Sugar,” Wordsworth’s “The Mad Mother” and Hannah More and
                    Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows of Yamba”—a poem students found particularly
                    compelling when they were assigned an excerpt from Alan Richardson’s essay about
                    its authorship: “The Sorrows of Yamba,” by
                        Eaglesfield Smith and Hannah More: Authorship, Ideology, and the Fractures
                        of Antislavery Discourse.”
                    The excerpts I used from Richardson’s essay
                        were particularly generative. Students read the poem over two class periods.
                        In the first class, their work with the poem was a mix of their initial
                        reactions and my lecture on motherhood and infanticide. On the second day students work with the
                        poem, I used this excerpt from the essay to take students back to the
                        primary text and asked students to identity what in the poem supports
                        Richardson’s claim: </p>
                  
                <p>In what follows, then, I will establish the
                        dual authorship of the Cheap Repository “Sorrows of Yamba” on the basis both
                        of external evidence (including new evidence that I discovered in the course
                        of preparing a collection of British antislavery poems) and internal
                        evidence. Indeed, a crucial part of the argument—for the priority and
                        relative integrity of Smith's version of the poem—depends almost wholly on
                        internal evidence, but of an unusually persuasive kind. (para 4) </p>
                  
                <p>This exercise was particularly rewarding for
                        students who had completed the reading before class and followed my
                        recommendation to mark passages they found intriguing and/or troubling.
                        Those who read carefully reported the poem “feeling” different in moments.
                        Having Richardson affirm their initial thinking about the poem not only
                        rewarded their close reading but opened up a dialogue between students and
                        Richardson that didn’t require my guidance. Richardson’s analysis was also a
                        useful way to show students the limits of thinking of our primary texts as
                        infallible, historical documents. One risk of a course such as this,
                        especially since most students started the semester completely unaware of
                        England’s connection to the slave trade, was to read the literary as a
                        historical account of the experiences of the enslaved. They tended to forget
                        this. This was especially important for students to understand as they read
                        Equiano and Mary Prince, narratives about slavery written for a white
                        audience. </p>
                <p>These opening exercises gave students a set of signposts to look for as they
                    read, making it easier for their initial encounters with the readings. This made
                    even the most tedious poems like Opie’s <lb/>“How to Make Sugar” manageable, but
                    it didn’t help much with Coleridge’s “Lecture on the Slave Trade.” It needs a great deal of
                        glossing to help students understand the many references to people and
                        places they don’t know, and it is written to be heard rather than read. I
                        had to develop a rhetorical map to help students understand it. Many of them
                        believed that Coleridge’s recitation of pro-slavery arguments that he later
                        dismantles are actually his own beliefs and ideas, so we read the lecture
                    as much for the structure of his argument as for his thoughts about the
                    slave trade. Students studied the tonal shifts in the essay—from its bombastic
                    opening to its almost clinical recitation of the argument for slavery that he is
                    challenging to its use of poetry. I noted that he is preacher, parliamentarian,
                    and poet all in one lecture, and then asked them to identify which moments in
                    the lecture fit under those categories. </p>
                  
                <p>Coleridge provides a useful introduction Southey’s anti-slavery sonnet series. In
                    the preface to the six sonnets that grow increasingly violent in tone, Southey
                    speculates about the necessary conditions for the slave trade to end and points
                    to what will happen with sugar specifically. After referencing the 1792
                    anti-sugar campaigns, he predicts: 
                    
                <quote>There are yet two other methods remaining, by which this traffic will probably be
                    abolished. By the introduction of East-Indian or Maple Sugar, or by the just and
                    general rebellion of the Negroes; by the vindictive justice of the Africans, or
                    by the civilized Christians finding it in their interest to be humane. </quote>
                    
                Students read Coleridge and Southey about midway through the semester, and his
                    predictions about the conditions necessary for abolition offered a prompt for
                    students to revisit the question of what mechanisms are required for meaningful
                    societal change. </p>
                    
                <p>When it came to student work in this course, I aimed to develop a series of
                    assignments that reflected how my students imagined their lives after college.
                    When I was a new professor, my writing assignments did not offer students enough
                    options. But a course titled “Writing for the Major” required me to reconsider
                    new ways to think about what the work of writing does for students and to
                    imagine ways to encourage student agency about their education. In
                    “anassignment,” Fred Moten writes to his students about the inherent
                    contradiction of cultivating their intellectual work while imposing
                    institutional structures on them in the form of a series of assignments. The
                    nature of assignments, he explains, neutralizes whatever revolutionary ideals he
                    might hold leaving him as “nothing other than an overseer even if what [he
                    teaches] appears, at the level of its content, to resist the actually existing
                    political-economic order” (229). He wants to mitigate the tension between the
                    coercive practices Moten sees himself as imposing on his students and his belief
                    that his primary job is to support them as they cultivate and refine their
                    intellectual practices. What this has meant for my praxis is to think of
                    assignments as preparing students to make a choice about how they present their
                    analytical work. Roughly a third of my
                    students have plans to teach English, primarily in high school. To work with
                    them to develop a research-based lesson plan was a useful, organic way to assess
                    how they took primary readings, class discussions, journal articles, and their
                    earlier papers and restructured them parts for their future students. “The
                    Little Black Boy” lesson plans, for example, took what in a university classroom
                    ends up being two 30-minute class discussions and broke it down into three or
                    four days for younger students. It was also an instructive glimpse into how my
                    students’ processed material with an eye towards what they need from me. They
                    tended to be more interested in providing the “history” around the poem, and
                    learned how important it was to spend time debunking the myth that historians
                    are simply offering a fixed report of the past. Giving students choices about
                    their work also amplified their interest in the course readings. They understood
                    assignments that at first glance felt like busy work were actually helping think
                    about their analytical processes for their final project. The assignment that
                    required them to read two refereed journal articles made more sense to them
                    because it was not simply offering them “context” but showing them how to engage
                    with complex representations and ideologies.<note place="foot"

                <p>The graduate seminars I teach in my department’s MA program are a mix of students
                    planning for doctoral studies, teachers seeking the Master of Arts in Teaching,
                    and students interested in a graduate-level engagement with literature. The
                    course I planned for this group of students in 2018 provided an opportunity to
                    bring primary texts into dialogue with "Critical Race
                        Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent Romanticist critical
                        discourses that reimagine the post-colonial project.”. Here is the full
                    description from the syllabus:
                    
                <quote>
                    <p>Students in this course will consider how our
                        understanding of nineteenth-century Britain shifts when we take into account
                        how much of the culture that gave us Shelley, Austen, and, eventually,
                        the Brontës relied on the transatlantic slave trade. Our work will focus on
                        Romantic-era writers who shaped, reflected, and contributed to England’s
                        abolitionist movement.  We will read anti-slavery writing by canonical poets
                        (Blake, Coleridge, and Wordsworth); consider the rhetorical moves in Ottobah Cugoano’s <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evils of Slavery
                        </hi> and Olaudah Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi>; and read novels and novel fragments that tell the
                        story of mixed-race heroines, including <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </hi> and <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of
                        Surinam</hi>. We will also read a few anti-slavery
                        poems and lectures with an eye towards thinking about how representations of
                        people of color are shaped by generic conventions.</p>
                    
                <p>The abolitionist movement is one of the first political
                        events British white women organized themselves around, so we will pay
                        special attention to nineteenth-century women writers including Jane Austen
                        (<hi rend="italic">Sanditon</hi>), Maria Edgeworth (“The Grateful Negro”), Amelia Opie (<hi rend="italic">Adeline Mowbray</hi>),
                        and Mary Wollstonecraft (excerpts from <hi rend="italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi>). In
                        addition to these primary texts, we will also consider the period’s material
                        and visual culture and spend time thinking about how anti-slavery ideologies
                        are reinterpreted in popular culture. We’ll read these primary texts in the
                        context of Critical Race Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent
                        Romanticist critical discourses that reimagine the post-colonial
                        project.</p></quote>
                    
                In the first few classes, students reacted to this course in a number of ways,
                    almost all of which resisted its premise. Some of this was, I suspect, the
                    natural performance of skepticism that graduate students bring to courses as
                    they feel their way through the dynamics of the class. Some of the resistance
                    was based on how much this course differed from how they had been taught
                    Romanticism as undergraduates. However much they had read of the period before
                    they took my course, these students tended to understand it as a period where
                    there are no Black people or people of color, no questions about identity, race,
                    and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary activities took place in
                    France. Even students sympathetic to the idea of race and representation in the
                    period were skeptical about the seminar, thinking that my approach to our
                    reading was a theoretical or temporal sleight of hand. This was one of the
                    reasons I didn’t begin this with Wordsworth’s “To Toussaint L’Ouverture.” With
                    its “whistling rustic” and “common wind,” Wordsworth’s sonnet reads to students
                    as consistent with Romantic tropes in general and the aesthetics of his work. I
                    followed up this sonnet with C.L.R James’s <hi rend="italic">The Black Jacobins</hi> and that helped reorient students to the
                    geographies of slavery and abolition.For students
                    trained in African-American studies, this class was a revelation that invited
                    them to revisit the “Trans” in the Transatlantic Slave Trade. For so many of
                    them the history of the transatlantic slave trade has elided England’s role in
                    it and the hollowness of “emancipation.” </p>
                    
                <p>The most animated class discussions were sparked by the 1808 <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Woman of Colour, A Tale, A Novel</hi>. Even
                    though they preferred reading novels to poetry, graduate students loved and
                    hated the novel in equal measure. The novel, which tells the story about the
                    daughter of an enslaved Black woman and a planter with family in England,
                    disrupts their expectations of both the “tragic mulatto” narrative and the
                    courtship novel. Many students confessed that they wanted the novel’s heroine
                    Olivia Fairfield to recover from her marriage to a bigamist by marrying an early
                    suitor in the novel and wrestled with their own need for a happy ending that
                    ends in nuptials rather than the independence that come with being a wealthy
                    woman who returns to with no master—chattel to no man, free from her father’s
                    bizarre will requiring her to marry a distant cousin in order to inherit,
                    emancipated from the racist strictures of British society—to her home in
                    Jamaica. In response to the revelation that Olivia’s husband August Merton
                    already has a wife, her servant Dido announces that she “has no master” after
                    the biracial heroine discovers that her husband is an accidental bigamist. Dido
                    is not only furious about how her mistress has been treated by her husband’s
                    family but is also frustrated to find herself demoted from a grand home to a
                    more modest cottage. We thought about the idea of a “master” in multiple
                    registers—as the titular head of a wealthy English home and, given that Dido is
                    from Jamaica and marked linguistically as other, as man who bought and sold
                    captured African women and men or could claim legal ownership from birth. We
                    also thought about Dido’s body and the space she and Olivia occupy materially
                    and imaginatively in the novel. The novel’s inflections of marriage and/as
                    slavery and women and/as chattel underscored our discussions of all the fiction
                    we read. We compared Olivia to Wollstonecraft’s description of ideal women in
                        <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </hi>and considered the
                    end of the novel in the context of the matriarchal utopia episode of John
                    Stedman’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna;
                        An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</hi>.
                </p>
                
                    
                <p>Student resistance to the course’s central goal diminished as the course
                    progressed, but it was replaced by an intellectual sentimentalism that I found
                    reductive. In my essay on a similar subject (“Jane Austen and the Abolitionist
                        Turn”<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Matthew, Patricia A. Jane
                        Austen and the Abolitionist Turn”<hi rend="italic">Texas Studies in
                            Literature and Language. </hi>61.4 (Winter 2019):345-61</note>), I talk
                    about the collegial but earnest tug-of-war I have with graduate students who
                    want to make the work of reading about race and representation in eighteenth and
                    nineteenth-century Britain into a cause. While I admire the intentions behind
                    this idea, I find I am ambivalent about some of the projects that emerge from
                    this stance. Part of this is because of the way that such an approach is framed.
                    Projects that work to question our assumptions about Romanticism and its
                    entanglements with race and representation make sense. These interrogations tend
                    to stay tightly focused, and rely on the kind of archival thinking that a
                    scholar like Rebecca Schneider deploys in her <hi rend="italic">European
                        Romantic Review</hi> essay “‘He says he is free’: Narrative Fragments and
                    Self-Emancipation in West Indian Runaway Advertisements.” I worry about an
                    approach that reads these works as ways to “humanize” people of color by reading
                    the primary texts (the literary and the historical) as documentaries that teach
                    us about the past. They don’t. They show us select representations of the past.
                    As Marcus Wood observes in <hi rend="italic">Blind Memory: Visual Representations
                        of Slavery in England and America</hi>:
                    <quote>
                        “The experiences of millions of individuals who were the victims of slavery
                        is not collectable; it is unrecoverable as a set of relics. There can be no
                        archeology of the memory of slavery that corresponds to an emotional
                        identification with a lost reality” (7).</quote> 
                    
                    Those representations
                    certainly influence our contemporary notions of race, but Britain’s abolitionist
                    project feels too complex to be read as a template for what we can and cannot do
                    in the twenty-first century. It is a viewpoint that is appealing to students who
                    are less interested in literary analysis and more invested in sociological
                    projects. The problem with this approach is that it replicates the same
                    problematic assumptions about who we read so that writers are good or bad
                    depending on how they feed into our notions of social justice. As I discuss
                    below by way of conclusion, this is different than the connections my
                    undergraduates make between abolitionist-era politics and this contemporary
                    moment. Despite reading many of the same texts, undergraduates tend to identify
                    structural similarities between the two periods, especially the way that British
                    abolitionist construct themselves in relationship to the Black figures they
                    claim to support. Graduate students, especially women of color and white women,
                    tend to see in the struggles of the past their own oppressive experiences.</p>
                    
                <p> One way this is evident is in reactions to Olivia Fairfield in<hi rend="italic"
                        >The Woman of Colour, A Tale</hi>. Whereas, as I note above, graduate
                    students wrestle with wanting a traditional, heteronormative ending for Olivia,
                    undergraduates are exasperated with her for not confronting the bigotry she
                    encounters. They tend to have no interest in the idea of her marrying. They see
                    that legal and social contracts have failed Olivia, and their focus tends to
                    stay on that fact. The different responses certainly reflect when and how
                    students engage with this material. Undergraduates are still developing the
                    analytic skills that graduate students are refining on the way to planning
                    longer projects that will make critical interventions into existing discourse.
                    Their different reactions also reflect the readings students bring to the class.
                    In this graduate seminar, most of the students were very familiar with
                    Regency-era literature and read it by choice. I think that for them Olivia
                    Fairfield was a brown version of the white heroines they read for pleasure and
                    for escape. Undergraduates encountered her in the context of abolitionist
                    debates. As a result they see her as yet another person of color navigating
                    nineteenth-century racism. Perhaps both groups, generally speaking, are simply
                    projecting their own values onto the text, and I prefer the projection that
                    aligns with my own thinking. I get excited when I see my students recognizing
                    patterns of structural violence and nervous when they individualize what they
                    read in my classes. The latter seems to me more a starting point than the end of
                    an intellectual project. This seems a good pedagogical problem to have; in both
                    cases students are animated about and engaged with the work of understanding and
                    ecosystem that they still see as operating today. </p>

                <p> For all that I want students to see my class discussions, indeed my class as a
                    whole, as a place to work out ideas, free from punitive critique and the
                    pressure to perform a particular politics, I have been gratified when they make
                    connections between our reading and the contemporary political landscape, and I
                    have been relieved when they feel they can talk about their political concerns
                    in this class. What I admired about the student’s “WTF?!?!” has happened in
                    classes again, in more muted but no less intense ways. After the 2016 election,
                    many of the who students enrolled in my section of “Writing for the Major” did
                    so because they saw it as a space where they could talk about the racist
                    violence they saw in the country. The words “Black Lives Matter” were never
                    spoken. But Black students in the class were very open about the fear they felt.
                    I will always remember the Black woman who said, “I feel like I have to fight
                    the same battles my ancestors already won.” The white students around her were
                    visibly shocked by her candor. With no prompting from me students in the class
                    were more likely to choose research projects that connected representations of
                    violence in abolitionist culture to violence they were reading about in the
                    news. One student, for example, wrote a research essay about Equiano’s
                    description of psychological violence and the case of Kalief Browder, wrongly
                    imprisoned after police suspected him of stealing a backpack. Another student
                    prepared a research presentation that traced depictions of Black women’s bodies
                        fromSarah Baartman to the present,
                    revisiting Christina Sharpe’s discussion of Kara Walker. Among themselves
                    students started discussing the challenges and risks of confronting racist
                    moments in their lives away from school. Ave DuVernay’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >13<hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>was released in
                    2016, and by 2017 some of my students had watched, and brought it up enough in
                    class discussions that their peers watched it too. </p>
                    
                <p>There were difficult debates too. Smart, thoughtful students asked earnest
                    questions with racist overtones, and I had to walk a fine line. I had to
                    moderate those discussions without leaving students asking troubling questions
                    feeling dismissed and while also protecting the feelings of that students who
                    would feel those questions most keenly because of their “heritable
                    characteristics.” In those discussions, Coleridge’s lecture was quite helpful.
                    He lays out five pro-slavery arguments and then debunks them. In more than one
                    class, skeptical students benefitted from our close attention to what
                    underscored the pro-slavery debates Coleridge references. </p>
                    
                <p>In the scant ground of a course reading list, it can be particularly challenging
                    to include new authors, especially if one wants to go about the work with care.
                    As Miriam Wallace and I noted in our Romantic Pedagogy Commons issue, Annette
                    Kolodny was right when she describes the challenges of changing what and how we
                    teach: “Radical breaks are tiring, demanding, uncomfortable, and sometimes
                    wholly beyond our comprehension” (12). But I think the outcomes are worth the
                    effort, and no one taking on this work is doing so alone. There are so many
                    resources available and models to follow. I am thinking especially of the “<ref
                        target="https://undiscipliningvc.org/index.html">Undisciplining the Victorian
                            Classroom”</ref> digital
                        humanities project. The site is a repository of peer-reviewed syllabi,
                        recorded discussions about teaching, and sample units for faculty use. 
                    Similar projects are in the works in eighteenth-century studies as well.An
                    abolitionist Romanticism course captures most students’ imaginations because
                    they tend to think of slavery and abolition as uniquely American. Thinking about
                    race, racism, and slavery in a British context gives them space to workout
                    knotty, unnerving questions about these complex issues. At the same time, it
                    helps them read contemporary progressive movements in more nuanced ways. I have
                    found that in learning about an abolitionist Romanticism, students are not only
                    studying historical texts and their connection to a movement, but are learning
                    more about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.</p>
