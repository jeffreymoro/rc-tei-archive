            <p>I like the word: emerge. What it conjures: Motion.
                    Risk-taking. Ideas on the verge. </p>
                       
            <p>adrienne maree brown wasn’t the first to highlight
                    emergence for me, but her 2017 book <hi rend="italic">Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds</hi> rooted me in the concept’s importance to teaching,
                    writing, and being in these charged times. Emergent strategy originated as a
                    business model in the 1970s meaning “a pattern of
                    action that develops over time in an organization in the absence of a specific
                    mission and goals.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        <ref target="https://interactioninstitute.org/emergent-strategy/">Interaction Institute</ref></note>
                     brown says that her engagement with the concept began
                    with her reading of Black science fiction author Octavia Butler’s notion of
                    change as small, decentralized, and intentional. In brown’s introduction to
                    “intentional adaptation,” she quotes Butler: “We are Earthseed / The life that
                    perceives itself Changing” (46). From there, brown grew the idea to describe
                    myriad forms of brokenness and transformation needed for a more just
                world.</p>
                       
            <p>“Emergent” also aptly describes the pedagogical
                    interventions in this volume, where scholar-teachers take risks and adapt as
                    they develop new curriculums. Like the resourceful practice of “tunyuhan”
                    suggested by Fran Botkin. The word, Botkin tells us, comes from a Jamaican
                    proverb: “tunyuhan (turn your hand) and mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best
                    use of any available resources to create something new.” Or Ivan Ortiz’s
                    evocation of literary séance to make Black voices audible. Ortiz uses texts as
                    mediums and mediations, especially those that
                    crack open history like M. NourbeSe Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> poems broken
                    across pages and centuries. There is also Elizabeth Fay’s emphasis on the
                    violent movement of bodies and selves across the Atlantic, as well as Nicholas
                    Blaisdell’s ability to link eighteenth and nineteenth-century scholarship “to
                    our present.” And, Sean Gordon’s amplification of “dehiscence,” a practice
                    described by Fred Moten as a Black studies “emergent poetics” (1743). </p>
                       
            <p>Clearly, these examples show how emergent strategy can
                    vitalize the teaching of romantic literature in 2021 and beyond. In the years
                    before I read brown, I was drawn to anthropologist Kathleen Stewart’s idea of
                    emergence aligned with the changes in my scholarly work and my teaching some
                    years ago. In her 2007 book <hi rend="italic">>Ordinary
                    Affects</hi>, Stewart wrote about the “emergent
                    present,” the shifting, fragmented, heightened moments of the everyday. Her book indexes potent encounters that we can’t quite
                    categorize, intimate moments that merge with public issues and then evaporate
                    like a mist only to reappear later in another form. Such moments, she says,
                    “will shift people’s life trajectories in some small way, change them by
                    literally changing their course for a minute or a day” (12). More often than
                    not, I will add, emergent moments change us as they remake the ghostly past in
                    the embodied present. </p>

            <p>In June 2013, I was at a house party in Chicago’s Belmont
                    district, mingling with people in the leafy backyard. These were people I didn’t
                    see at my university; founders of arts programs and alternative newspapers and
                    activist organizations. A little Scotty dog dashed around. Everyone except me
                    knew his name. Wearing mismatched stockings and skirts, asymmetrical hemlines,
                    and bright earrings, the guests were hip and creative. They seemed cool and I
                    wanted to join in, but when I edged into a circle, people spoke past me. Hot
                    dampness hung in the air, evoking a longing feeling, an ache for the experiences I didn’t have with these people
                    but which they had with one another. </p>
                                
            <p>The yard was crowded and sweaty and I moved inside. Only
                    one other person sat in the dimly lit living room where a melancholy tune of
                    trombones and violins played. I drifted over and sat next to Marvin, as he later
                    introduced himself. He raised his beer and smiled. The heat inside was
                    suffocating yet Marvin wore a long black leather jacket and blower cap, as if
                    he’d come from a distant country where it was always cold. I didn’t want to
                    bring up the weather because my eyes kept drifting to his cap, so I asked where
                    he worked. “I don’t work now,” he said. There was something about this party
                    that suppressed my normal social instincts. In any other context I would have
                    talked about my job and family. But all I seemed to be able to do was
                    listen.</p>
                                
            <p>While Black and white people mingled, I connected with
                    Marvin as a parent. I noticed he had a way of smiling that seemed new, as if
                    he’d just rediscovered those muscles around his mouth. He’d had a hard time
                    finding a job since he got out of prison, he said. It was hard when you’d been
                    in prison for so long. You had to toughen yourself up, and that made you awkward
                    around people. He told me how his daughter grew up while he was locked up, how
                    he was getting to know her for the first time. He rubbed his eyebrow shyly. He
                    had just bought her a house with the compensation he received for being
                    wrongfully accused. </p>
                                
            <p>I thought of my own daughter as Marvin talked. She and I
                    were estranged at the time. I had desperately tried to contact her to no avail.
                    Forced alienation from a daughter, one of the deepest human hurts—it was a
                    feeling I could touch. But as I looked into Marvin’s intense eyes, my internal
                    screen went blank. How could I know wrongful conviction and forced separation
                    from a child, from an entire family, in the context of the experience he related
                    to me? I couldn’t. But he was telling me his story, and I listened.</p>

            <p>One of the most striking features of this volume is how the
                    pastness of the British slave trade, abolition, and emancipation emerge in
                    current poems, novels, plays, songs and movies, across the internet, on the
                    streets, and, crucially, within schools and classrooms. Patricia A. Matthew
                    acknowledges that although early abolitionist texts are not “ documentaries
                that teach us about the past,” they can speak to current race issues. Her students discuss slavery and abolition at a historic
                    and geographic remove and yet feel the issues press closely on their lives as
                    they learn to adapt one era’s practices to their own. </p>
                                
            <p>Adaptation is central to Botkin’s method as well. She puts
                    Marlon James’s contemporary novel <hi rend="italic">The Book
                    of Night Women</hi> in dialogue with romantic
                    literature. James’s dizzying historical remix, Botkin says, features graphic
                    scenes of trauma, which unsettles what students think they know about enslavement. At the same time it informs their
                    current experience. Likewise, Fay reveals that for her students, the Black Lives
                    Matter protests give writers like Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince “a new
                    legitimacy” unheard of in previous generations of students. And Gordon boldly
                    leads students to question their assumptions about “the ‘pastness’ of slavery,
                    the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the post-racialism of the
                    contemporary.”</p>
                                
            <p>Surely my conversation with Marvin held so much import for
                    me because of how the past emerged in the present. For twelve of the years
                    Marvin was in prison, I spent almost every waking moment steeped in literature
                    of the slave trade, abolition, and emancipation during the British romantic
                    period. I wrote about that history in neat explications, complete with
                    historical contexts and pages of citations, and bound in scholarly journals and
                    books. But it was only when I stepped away from literary criticism and all I had
                    learned that the meaning of that awful history started to emerge in a different
                    way, rushing into my life in fleeting, transitory moments, informing and
                    complicating the present. The 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Amendment abolished slavery with one major exception:
                    slavery remained appropriate punishment for a crime. The Virginia Supreme Court
                    defined convicts as synonymous with enslaved people. <note place="foot" resp="author">

            <p>I set upon the topic of the slave trade, abolition, and
                    emancipation through a chance encounter with Henry Louis Gates Jr., when I was a
                    meek graduate student at the University of Arizona. I had read Gates’s book,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Signifying Monkey, </hi> which had recently come out, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince</hi> in a postcolonial literature course, and was excited that
                    he was giving a talk at the university. Gates spoke about race and the literary
                    canon and about recovering texts written by formerly enslaved men and women.
                    There was a dinner after the talk, and to my astonishment, I ended up seated
                    elbow-to-elbow with the great scholar with the smiling eyes. He was casual and
                    friendly, fluffing out his napkin and pouring me a glass of water before filling
                    his own. </p>
                                
            <p> I’d never read anything like <hi
                    rend="italic">The Signifying Monkey.</hi> I still recall being mesmerized by how Gates harnessed the African American
                    vernacular tradition and the double-voiced Yoruba trickster Esu to develop the
                    “signifyin’ figure” who danced through the pages of African American literature.
                    “To rename is to revise,” Gates wrote, “and to revise is to Signify” (xxiii).
                    Revise the method for my project, and maybe even shift the canon a bit, was what
                    I wanted to do. The book emerged from the hundreds of others on my PhD reading
                    lists, not just because of Gates’s ideas, brilliant as they were, but because of
                    how he himself had written a scholarly work so alive, multiplicious, and full of
                    intellectual trickery. It struck me as, well, not entirely academic in style.
                    How did he do it?</p>
                                
            <p>In my eyes Gates may as well have been a movie star (and he
                    would go on to become a TV celebrity and witness in free speech court
                    proceedings). I was too nervous to utter a word, so I just stared at his nice
                    old-fashioned wrist watch that fit the persona of someone with schedules to
                    keep. But Gates must have asked what I was working on, because I distinctly
                    remember telling him, in a stumbling monologue full of ums and ahs, about
                    romantic literature and how only a shred of scholarship about the slave trade
                    and abolition had been produced. I had pored over Eva Beatrice Dyke’s 1942
                    book<hi rend="italic"> The Negro in English Romantic
                    Thought</hi>. I had attended Alan Richardson’s 1990
                    MLA panel. I was drawn to the topic, I told him, but I confessed my worry. As a
                    non-Black person, did I have a right to pursue this research? Was it my story to
                    tell? Perhaps I was also afraid to confront the culpability of my own European
                    ancestry.</p>
                                
            <p>Gates’s eyes grew serious through huge glasses resting on
                    his cheeks. “Absolutely!” he said. I must “absolutely choose this topic” for my
                    dissertation. Was I going to the archive? Texts, voices, needed to be brought to
                    light. Though my work might never “signify,’” I understood, it could have
                    significance. Or that maybe that as a white woman writing about the atrocities
                    of Europeans, my work could signify on early white men and women. </p>

            <p>A few months after I met Marvin, I had lunch with Alice,
                    the woman who had hosted the house party. I told her about my conversation with
                    Marvin. Though it lasted an hour at most, he kept surfacing in my thoughts. Was
                    he okay? What had happened? </p>
                                
            <p>Chicago cops were the worst, she said through frowning eyes
                    and pursed lips. Some twenty years earlier, two women and three children were
                    found dead in what appeared to be a house fire. The police questioned suspects,
                    and their evidence suggested a family member had committed the murders and
                    started the fire as a cover up. Instead of pursuing that lead, the police
                    arrested Marvin and another man, Ronald Kitchen, who happened to live nearby.

            <p>Alice pointed me to some online articles, and I later found
                    more on my own.<note place="foot"> See Andrew Baer's recent Beyond the Usual Beating: The Jon Burge
                        Police Torture Scandal and Social Movements for Police Accountability in
                        Chicago (University of Chicago Press, 2021).</note> Marvin and Ronald’s injustice started with Chicago police
                    detective and commander Jon Burge, who spent eighteen years leading a campaign
                    against innocent Black men. Before his crimes were exposed in 1990, Burge
                    targeted some 200 Black men, torturing, imprisoning, and killing many them for
                    crimes they did not commit. Burge learned his craft in the Army during the
                    Korean war, first as a military policeman and then in combat, facing a foe of a
                    different race (Conroy). Burge unleashed his crimes unchallenged and even
                    received numerous honors, including a Bronze Star. Today his career stands as
                    one of the most egregious examples of serial police violence against Black men
                    in U.S. history.</p>
                                
            <p>When Marvin was exonerated in 2009, media stories emerged.
                    In an interview with Marlene Martin of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty,
                    Marvin told how police broke down the door to his sister’s house, kidnapped him,
                    and then beat him. I felt the intensity of the injustice when Marvin related
                    tender stories of his formative years growing up in a housing project. Though
                    the buildings are now gone, he recalled a courtyard of flowers where he used
                    hang out. His favorite memory was a camping trip. A local pastor had organized
                    the trip for him and a bunch of neighborhood kids. “He made sure we went on this
                    weekend camping trip to show us another side of life,” Marvin said. “I'll never
                    forget that—it made such an impression on me” (Martin). </p>
                                
            <p>I’ll never forget how at the lunch meeting, when I
                    mentioned Marvin’s name, Alice smiled so wide, the lines around her eyes
                    sprawled across her temples and down the sides of her face. Her face drew me in
                    like a force. She nodded and peeked cautiously from over her glasses, as if the
                    thought of him gave her a feeling of deep fondness with agony mixed in. Even
                    after we parted, her expression appeared before me, slowly gathered resonance
                    rather than settling something.</p>

            <p>The authors of the essays in this volume rightly champion
                    first-hand accounts. Fay argues that “for some
                    students of color . . . first-hand accounts can be empowering.” Ortiz shows how
                    ballads are oral forms migrated to print, and how these forms now act as mediums
                    for Black voices. Yet even in canonical literary works by non-Black writers,
                    Black voices can be heard, as Toni Morrison points out in <hi rend="italic">Playing in the Dark</hi>,
                    giving expression to “social decay and economic division” of white culture

            <p>I spent what felt like a lifetime examining the documents
                    of British antislavery, following trails, uncovering metaphors, reading works by
                    mostly non-Black authors—the court cases, the
                    tracts and polemics, the debates, the newspaper articles, the dubious scientific
                    theories, the iconography, the mounds of antislavery poetry and plays and novels
                    and the thousands of travel texts. I was tireless in my research, mesmerized by
                    how one source led to another and then another, by the physical act of filling
                    out the request forms in the British Library, the Cambridge University Library,
                    the University of London, and farther flung archives in cities like Liverpool,
                    Bristol, and Hull.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This archival work became the basis of the 8-volume <hi rend="italic"

            <p>I remember the feeling of heaviness created by the sheer
                    number of documents in dark rooms guarded by stone-faced librarians, and I often
                    fell ill thinking about how antislavery writings
                    and contemporary literary theory rarely let the people taken from Africa or born
                    into the system of enslavement speak for themselves. I became increasingly concerned with finding those voices,
                    even if they were sometimes mediated through white institutions and scribes. I
                    read the letters of the Sierra Leone settlers, which were scattered in libraries
                    across England and the US. In one collection, I stumbled upon a small account of enslaved women—mothers and daughters—wresting
                    control of a plantation. In London a series of
                    slave complaints emerged from the House of Commons Parliamentary papers dating
                    to 1816. In select colonies including Berbice and Demerara, as I learned, the
                    enslaved could report abuses to a British officer—called a Fiscal—who took down
                    their words and filed them with the House of Commons. These complaints highlight
                    aspects of Black culture hidden from most other accounts. I learned about
                    working conditions, living quarters, the amount of food, clothing, and other
                    supplies people had access to, and about their resistances and
                rebellions. </p>
                                
            <p>One afternoon in the British Library I found myself reading
                    the account of Tommy again and again, a story that stays with me to this
                    day:
                    
            <quote>February 19, 1819. Negro Tommy, belonging to William
                    Fraser:--Says, he is a cooper by trade, and employed as such by his master on
                    plantation Goldstone Hall; that on Friday morning last he went in the
                    boiling-house for nails, and there saw another cooper heading up sugars; Tommy
                    went to one of the casks and took a lump of sugar for the purpose of sweetening
                    three gallons of hot water; did not hide the same, but proceeded with it in his
                    hand from the boiling-house; was met by his master, Mr. Fraser, who inquired
                    where he got the sugar, Tommy informed him of his having taken it, and for what
                    purpose, his master immediately ordered him to be
                    laid down, tied to stakes, put two drivers over him, and one hundred lashes
                    inflicted upon him. Mr. Fraser went to Tommy’s house and searched it, found in
                    his tool chest a quantity of old nails, among which were also a very few new
                    ones; Mr. Fraser went to the trouble of weighing them, there were fourteen
                    pounds.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The
                        full account of Tommy is republished in the volume I co-edited with Alan
                            Richardson,<hi rend="italic">Early Black British Writing: Olaudah
                            Equiano, Mary Prince, and Others</hi> in 2014 with Houghton Mifflin. I’m
                        especially grateful to Richardson for his pioneering work on antislavery and
                        Black writers during the romantic period, and for mentoring me during my
                        career.</note></quote>
            
            It took years to unravel the meaning of this account, but I
                    couldn’t let it go. Tommy’s actions replayed in my imagination until I saw
                    Tommy’s self-determination in every word of this
                    complaint. By stealing sugar—the product of his own labor—Tommy was subverting
                    capitalism, which slave labor made possible. Subverting but also using. By
                    collecting a great quantity of nails, Tommy was exploiting capitalism. The fact
                    that Fraser weighed the nails implied he suspected Tommy was selling
                them.</p>
                                
            <p>The account continues beyond the segment I’ve included
                    here. In it, Tommy complains of not enough food and clothing, and of being
                    harassed by Fraser, but his primary objection is the 100 lashes, when the legal
                    limit was 41. The court interviewed various witnesses, each claiming Tommy
                    received a different number of lashes. Finally, the court asked Tommy to
                    “exhibit his posterior,” and he had very little sign of being lashed. Tommy
                    explains: “I was favored by the drivers who threw the whips over me.” </p>
                                
            <p>Between the lines, I saw, Tommy was complaining to the
                    court about harassment and torture, but he was also announcing agency over the
                   plantation system. When he said he was favored by
                    the drivers, he was issuing a warning. Drivers
                    were enslaved men who received larger food and clothing rations. They commanded
                    other enslaved people, which made it dangerous for planters to upset a driver’s
                    authority once it was established. Drivers could
                    be mediators, cops, or potential rebel leaders. </p>
                                
            <p>For me, what mattered most
                    about Tommy’s story was how his first-hand account bubbled up through the
                    testimony recorded by colonists. Although, at first glance, the court’s
                order for Tommy to remove his clothing might seem degrading, it also offers Tommy a
                chance to reveal how he has been able to retain his agency. Tommy proved how the drivers favored him by
                    “exhibiting his posterior.” With that act, he was
                    literally mooning them (and mooning was a word and concept dating back to 1600).
                    “Kiss my ass,” he was saying. Most importantly, although Tommy was probably illiterate,
                    he staged his action in a way that would be recorded in the colonial discourse
                    for centuries to come. In other words, by showing the court his backside and
                    letting them know he wasn’t powerless, he was signifying on the institution that
                    sought to oppress him. </p>

            <p>My years of research across continents piecing together
                    Britain’s antislavery project and searching for voices like Tommy’s and
                    listening to stories like Marvin’s changed me. At Washington State University, I
                    taught entire courses on the subject, highlighting the rebellions and
                    revolutions in Jamaica, Saint Domingue, and
                    elsewhere, as well as the many ways the enslaved survived, resisted, and
                    overturned. I stood over photocopy machines and heavy-duty staplers creating
                    handmade booklets for my students of these defiant texts. In the geometry of my
                    classroom, we stood in a perfect circle and read them aloud. As students took
                    the words inside their bodies and made them live, we heard power shift from the
                    institution of slavery to a group of Black women taking charge of a plantation
                    or to a household servant poisoning an abusive white man. </p>
                                
            <p>But my old-school ways were not nearly as inventive as the
                    methods adopted in this volume. Methods like Botkin’s Zoom dialogue with Maroons
                    or Fay’s triangulations, a practice she adapted from nautical strategy and
                    scholar Christina Sharpe. Blaisdell also triangulates his work—reading
                Cugoano, Prince, and Engels together help him understand the relationship between
                nineteenth century problems of unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism.</p>
                                
            <p>“Emergence,” brown writes, “is our inheritance as part of
                    this universe; it is how we change” (3). She consults nature for lessons on
                    teaching, organizing, and taking care of one another and oneself: birds
                    flocking, earthworms burrowing, leaves decaying, roots going deep offer
                    different instructions. But one of nature’s most fascinating forms—the
                    fractal—is for brown the geometry of transformation. “What we do on a small
                    scale reverberates on a large scale,” she reminds us. I found this self-similar,
                    iterative process evident across the essays of this volume, each piece unfolding like an offering for how to teach an
                    abolitionist romanticism.</p>

                   <head>Emergent: and abolition;</head>
                   
            <p>A few months ago, I read a review by Carvell Wallace in the
                    <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> about “The Good Lord Bird,” a TV miniseries about the
                    19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century
                    American abolitionist John Brown, produced by Ethan Hawke. “Can a white person
                    ever usefully tell a slave story,” Wallace asked, “or, more specifically, can
                    they tell a story that is useful to the descendants of the enslaved, rather than
                    to their own egos or cinematic fantasies?” (Wallace).</p>
                   
            <p>I felt a bright sting. Though the great Henry Louis Gates
                    Jr. had once encouraged me to tell the stories of Black lives, I continue to
                    wonder—can I? I sometimes doubt my right to write about the stories of enslaved
                    people by romantic-era authors. I decided I would not watch the
                series. </p>
                   
            <p>Yet I kept returning to the fact that abolition was the
                    most pressing topic of the British romantic period. At the time I started my
                    research and writing, nothing could have been clearer to me. Several authors in
                    this collection cite Coleridge’s sermon on abolition in 1795 on the steps of the
                    Bristol docks in the heart of that city’s slave business; Equiano’s and
                    Cugoano’s fierce agitation for abolition; and Mary Prince’s narrative told to
                    the London Anti-Slavery Society. Not to mention the millions of pages of
                    antislavery writings by Black and white activist men and women.</p>
                   
            <p>Antislavery was pursued with such intensity, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to find
                abolition, albeit much transformed since the Romantic period, emergent among some
                young activists today. Syrus Marcus Ware, a transgender
                    scholar and artist, urges academics, writers, poets, activists,
                    performers—everyone—to “approach abolition as the most loving thing that we can
                    do for one another” (Ware). Last year I attended Ware’s workshop on abolition,
                    in which participants listened to Angela Davis while we imagined futures full of
                    love and freedom and justice. As Petra Kuppers, the workshop organizer, put it:
               
                   
            <quote>This personal sensation of a white cis queer disabled women
                    feels far away from the project of ending slavery’s long reach, I know, and I
                    feel immediately the concern of projecting my own sense of unfreedom, being
                    denied access to my range-giving wheelchair, onto the experiences of people
                    racialized as Black. But that’s what Syrus is offering to me here: charting my
                    experience, my sense, from wherever I come from. Grounding a sense of justice in
                    a personal felt, lived experience, in connection. So I let it stand, that moment
                    of loosening the armor, and I touch into it to be present” (Kuppers).</quote>
                   
           The experience was visceral, uncomfortable, on the verge of
                    something new. </p>
                   
            <p>Many of the teacher-scholars in this volume embrace
                    abolition. I see a wonderful, complementary rhythm between Ortiz’s call to
                    listen to romantic “sounds we would
                otherwise block out because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient” and
                    Ware’s invitation to embody the sounds of a world
                    rooted in liberation and self-determination. I’m moved by Matthew’s account of how when students learn an
                    “abolitionist Romanticism” they are also learning “about the intricacies of society, protest, and
                    revolution.” As Alan Richardson observes in his response here, I too am
                    heartened by how Blaisdell's report of being inspired by Granville Sharp working
                    shoulder-to-shoulder with Olaudah Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano. Such
                    collaborative abolitionism prompted Blaisdell to found a community tutoring
                    center. Reading about his actions also brought to mind Ware’s words: The
                    “abolitionist struggle that is 500 years strong,”
                    he writes, and “now is a time to reflect on the history of the abolition
                    movement and what the future could look like if we reach abolition in our
                    lifetime” (Ware). </p>
                   
            <p>I’ve also understood that the backward glances, missteps,
                    doubts, and mistakes I make when writing and speaking about abolition are part
                    the fractal nature of learning. Shortly after I read the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review about
                    “The Good Lord Bird,” one of my African American students who writes eloquently
                    about <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince</hi> called me by Zoom and said, completely unsolicited, “You
                    should watch that series!” The coincidence captured meant I had to respond.
              
            <quote>
                    <p>“But can a white person really tell that story?” I told her
                    about the review.</p>
            <p>She shrugged. “Different people have different views,” she
                    said. “I like it.”</p>

            <p>“What does it mean to function as a group in a changing
                    environment?” asks Alexis Pauline Gumbs in <hi rend="italic">
                    >Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Animals</hi>, part of the Emergent Strategy series (51). Gumbs
                    consults sea life, animals adept at fluidity, for teachable moments and
                    parallels to the current work of abolition. Mothering and gathering in super
                    pods are dolphin strategies just as communities of care and cooperatives have
                    been part of the Black Diaspora for centuries. </p>
                                
            <p>Caregiving. Collectivity. These ancient principles are
                    emergent in this volume’s classroom practices. For instance, the way Matthew
                    begins her courses with “a conversation about the various ways civic groups
                try to effect broad change and a low-stakes free association exercise about the word
                sugar.” The way Gordon encourages crosstalk by assigning
                    student support groups for writing and responding. How Blaisdell had his
                    students enact a letter-writing campaign against unjust school dress codes,
                where they learned “that the power of social change begins and is sustained through
                collective civic action.” And how MaMa G, the elder
                    featured in Botkin’s essay, envisions opening a “borderless university,” rooted
                    in Jamaica but developed online, to unite local and global communities in the
                    growth and dissemination of indigenous knowledge. </p>
                                
            <p> Young Black feminist theorists and embodiment scholars
                    like Gumbs, brown, Ware, and Kuppers—poets, memoirists, artists, scholars, and
                    activists—also offer new cooperative models. Gumbs, for instance, collaborates
                    with sperm whales—breathing, stretching, finding intentionality. Further, her
                    brilliant book <hi rend="italic">Spill</hi> is a cross-generation, trans-temporal partnership with
                    Hortense Spillers that calls to mind collaborations with history like Philip’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Zong! </hi>poems,
                    where meaning is “not to be ‘made’ but, rather, felt” (Wah), and the <hi rend="italic">Lost Privilege Company, or the book of

            <p>Marvin, the man I met at the Chicago house party, spent
                    twenty-one years in prison while his friend Ronald Kitchen was sentenced to
                    death. I never saw Marvin again, and I lost touch with Alice, but I didn’t
                    forget them. The tangle of connections and resonances remained emergent for me,
                    demanding my continuing attention.</p>
                                
            <p>I learned that while Ronald was in prison, he became one of
                    the “Death Row 10,” Black men tortured and wrongfully accused by Burge and his
                    gang of corrupt cops. Ronald went on to write his story in his 2018 book
                    <hi rend="italic">My Midnight Years: Surviving Jon Burge’s
                    Police Torture Ring and Death Row</hi>. In a 2019
                    interview, he and one of his coauthors, Thai Jones, spoke about the police brutality that called to mind so many
                    descriptions in British antislavery writing. They also spoke about importance of
                    storytelling.</p>
                                
            <p>Marvin and Ronald may never have been exonerated if
                    activists on the outside, including Ronald’s mother, and, it turns out, Alice
                    and some of the people at her house party in June 2013, had not made their
                    innocence a major story in Chicago. The activists’ work centered on building
                    narratives around Martin and Ronald and other wrongly convicted Black men. “It
                    was storytelling that really did work this amazing revolution in people’s
                    consciousness,” said Jones (Kitchen). The stories eventually engaged the news
                    media, lawmakers, and people like Jesse Jackson, finally forcing Chicago to a
                    pass a reparations package, the first of its kind on the country. The
                    legislation provides compensation, restitution and rehabilitation services for
                    those tortured by Jon Burge. </p>
                                
            <p>Recently, Marvin joined Alice for a presentation of Alice’s
                    co-edited book, <hi rend="italic">The Long Term: Resisting
                    Life Sentences, Working Toward Freedom</hi>. The book
                    contains an essay by adrienne maree brown, among many others. Ronald is now an
                    activist speaking out against police brutality and corruption. Even so, police
                    continue to harass him. Whenever he’s back in Chicago visiting relatives, as he
                    explained in the 2019 interview, police stop him numerous times, a reminder of
                    the ruthless stop and frisk policies he grew up with on the South Side.
                </p>
                                
            <p>Now, however, the routine is different. When the police
                    pull him over, Ronald signifies. He always says, “Officer, why are you pulling
                    me over?” The officer will reply: “Your
                    seatbelt.” But Ronald has tinted windows, and he points this out. Finally, the
                    officer says, “Is this your car?” “Yes it is,” Ronald says in a calm, steady
                    voice. “Where did you get this Mercedes Benz?” the officer demands. “Well,
                    officer,” Ronald says, “you all bought this for me” (Kitchen).</p>

            <p>What does the future of romantic pedagogy look like? The
                    essays in this volume offer some direction. In
                    the spirit of multiplicity and nonlinearity, Botkin reports, “I incorporated
                    interviews, images, and films to complement and challenge the conventions of
                    literary historiography.” Gordon includes the speculative mode, teaching authors
                    like Mat Johnson, Celu Amberstone, and Octavia Butler, while Fay focuses on
                    Afrofuturism with the film <hi rend="italic">Black Panther</hi> and N.K.
                    Jemisin’s “How Long ’til Black Future Month?” Such texts, she says, present a
                    way of talking about the future in terms other than intergenerational trauma and
                    posthumanism. </p>
                                
            <p> I am grateful to Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley for
                    editing this powerful constellation of essays and for inviting me to respond and
                    giving me room to offer a few of my own pedagogical practices. To begin with, I
                    want to advocate for new ways of writing scholarship and assigning student work.
                    Part of the power of brown’s <hi rend="italic">>Emergent
                    Strategy</hi>, after all, is its form. An assemblage
                    of narratives, memories, theories, spells, poetry, lists, assessment sheets,
                    oral histories, questions, anecdotes, guiding quotations, icons, images, and Afro-futures. Such an approach to romantic
                    scholarship and classroom work can help liberate the field. I wholly support
                    Kathleen Stewart’s argument that language like “neoliberalism, advanced
                capitalism, and globalization . . . do not in themselves begin to describe the
                situation we find ourselves in. The notion of a totalized system, of which
                everything is always already somehow a part, is not helpful (to say the least) in
                the effort to approach a weighted and reeling present” (5). Equally, I’m in line
                with brown’s recommendation that we need to “give each
                    other more time to feel, to be in our humanity” (105). </p>
                                
            <p>The center of my pedagogical practice today compels
                    students to experiment with modes of expression and to co-create with whatever
                    texts we’re discussing. I present them with dozens of forms, written and
                    otherwise: letters, manifestos, photo essays, short films, fragments, artist
                    books, mixed media collages, erasure poetry, assemblage poetry, catalogs,
                    almanacs, and indexes, to name a few. I ask them to experiment. I also encourage
                    them to feel. I value experience over explication of literary works, ordinary affects over totalizing systems. In my own
                    writing, I’ve pursued an emergent scholarship, one mixed up and messy, nonlinear
                    and adaptive, rooted in feeling and imagining as much as thinking. Which is why,
                    these last years, I’ve been compiling a catalog of emotions to use as a
                    resource. Not big, singular emotions like fear or shock or sudden love, but the
                    complex, contradictory, ambivalent churning inside us as we try to find stability in an unstable universe, as we try to put past
                    and present in place, as we try to find new forms and expressions for the
                    emergent present.</p>
                                
            <p>And then, suddenly, some appear from a corner of the world,
                    and we are moved, as when Amanda Gorman stood at the podium during Presidential
                    Inauguration on January 20, 2021, and her words, emerging, held us all—not just
                    America, but the world:
