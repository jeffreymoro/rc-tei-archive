                    writing, and being in these charged times. Emergent strategy originated as a
                    business model in </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)">the 1970s meaning “a pattern of
                    action that develops over time in an organization in the absence of a specific

                    rend="color(#000000)"> brown says that her engagement with the concept began
                    with her reading of Black science fiction author Octavia Butler’s notion of
                    change as small, decentralized, and intentional. In brown’s introduction to
                    “intentional adaptation,” she quotes Butler: “We are Earthseed / The life that
                    perceives itself Changing” (46). From there, brown grew the idea to describe
                    myriad forms of brokenness and transformation needed for a more just
                world.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">“Emergent” also aptly describes the pedagogical
                    interventions in this volume, where scholar-teachers take risks and adapt as
                    they develop new curriculums. Like the resourceful practice of “tunyuhan”
                    suggested by Fran Botkin. The word, Botkin tells us, comes from a Jamaican
                    proverb: “tunyuhan (turn your hand) and mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best
                    use of any available resources to create something new.” Or Ivan Ortiz’s
                    evocation of literary séance to make Black voices audible. Ortiz uses texts as
                    mediums and mediations, especially </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)">those that
                    crack open history like M. NourbeSe Philip’s </hi><hi

                    across pages and centuries. There is also Elizabeth Fay’s emphasis on the
                    violent movement of bodies and selves across the Atlantic, as well as Nicholas
                    Blaisdell’s ability to link eighteenth and nineteenth-century scholarship “to
                    our present.” And, Sean Gordon’s amplification of “dehiscence,” a practice
                    described by Fred Moten as a Black studies </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)"
                    >“emergent poetics” (1743). </hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">Clearly, these examples show how emergent strategy can
                    vitalize the teaching of romantic literature in 2021 and beyond. In the years
                    before I read brown, I was drawn to anthropologist Kathleen Stewart’s idea of
                    emergence aligned with the changes in my scholarly work and my teaching some
                    years ago. In her 2007 book </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)italic">Ordinary
                    Affects</hi><hi rend="color(#000000)">, Stewart wrote about the “emergent

                    >moments of the everyday. Her book indexes potent encounters that we can’t quite
                    categorize, intimate moments that merge with public issues and then evaporate
                    like a mist only to reappear later in another form. Such moments, she says,
                    “will shift people’s life trajectories in some small way, change them by
                    literally changing their course for a minute or a day” (12). More often than
                    not, I will add, emergent moments change us as they remake the ghostly past in
                    the embodied present. </hi></p>

            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">In June 2013, I was at a house party in Chicago’s Belmont
                    district, mingling with people in the leafy backyard. These were people I didn’t
                    see at my university; founders of arts programs and alternative newspapers and
                    activist organizations. A little Scotty dog dashed around. Everyone except me
                    knew his name. Wearing mismatched stockings and skirts, asymmetrical hemlines,
                    and bright earrings, the guests were hip and creative. They seemed cool and I
                    wanted to join in, but when I edged into a circle, people spoke past me. Hot
                    dampness hung in the air, evoking a longing feeling, an </hi><hi
                    rend="color(#000000)">ache for the experiences I didn’t have with these people
                    but which they had with one another. </hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">The yard was crowded and sweaty and I moved inside. Only
                    one other person sat in the dimly lit living room where a melancholy tune of
                    trombones and violins played. I drifted over and sat next to Marvin, as he later
                    introduced himself. He raised his beer and smiled. The heat inside was
                    suffocating yet Marvin wore a long black leather jacket and blower cap, as if
                    he’d come from a distant country where it was always cold. I didn’t want to
                    bring up the weather because my eyes kept drifting to his cap, so I asked where
                    he worked. “I don’t work now,” he said. There was something about this party
                    that suppressed my normal social instincts. In any other context I would have
                    talked about my job and family. But all I seemed to be able to do was
                    listen.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">While Black and white people mingled, I connected with
                    Marvin as a parent. I noticed he had a way of smiling that seemed new, as if
                    he’d just rediscovered those muscles around his mouth. He’d had a hard time
                    finding a job since he got out of prison, he said. It was hard when you’d been
                    in prison for so long. You had to toughen yourself up, and that made you awkward
                    around people. He told me how his daughter grew up while he was locked up, how
                    he was getting to know her for the first time. He rubbed his eyebrow shyly. He
                    had just bought her a house with the compensation he received for being
                    wrongfully accused. </hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">I thought of my own daughter as Marvin talked. She and I
                    were estranged at the time. I had desperately tried to contact her to no avail.
                    Forced alienation from a daughter, one of the deepest human hurts—it was a
                    feeling I could touch. But as I looked into Marvin’s intense eyes, my internal
                    screen went blank. How could I know wrongful conviction and forced separation
                    from a child, from an entire family, in the context of the experience he related
                    to me? I couldn’t. But he was telling me his story, and I listened.</hi></p>

            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">One of the most striking features of this volume is how the
                    pastness of the British slave trade, abolition, and emancipation emerge in
                    current poems, novels, plays, songs and movies, across the internet, on the
                    streets, and, crucially, within schools and classrooms. Patricia A. Matthew
                    acknowledges that although early abolitionist texts are not “</hi>documentaries
                that teach us about the past,” they can speak to current race issues. <hi

            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">Adaptation is central to Botkin’s method as well. She puts
                    Marlon James’s contemporary novel </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)italic">The Book
                    of Night Women</hi><hi rend="color(#000000)"> in dialogue with romantic
                    literature. James’s dizzying historical remix, Botkin says, features graphic
                    scenes of trauma, which unsettles what students think they know </hi><hi
                    rend="color(#000000)">about enslavement. At the same time it informs their
                    current experience. Likewise, Fay reveals that for her students, the Black Lives
                    Matter protests give writers like Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince “a new
                    legitimacy” unheard of in previous generations of students. And Gordon boldly
                    leads students to question their assumptions about “the ‘pastness’ of slavery,
                    the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the post-racialism of the
                    contemporary.”</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">Surely my conversation with Marvin held so much import for
                    me because of how the past emerged in the present. For twelve of the years
                    Marvin was in prison, I spent almost every waking moment steeped in literature
                    of the slave trade, abolition, and emancipation during the British romantic
                    period. I wrote about that history in neat explications, complete with
                    historical contexts and pages of citations, and bound in scholarly journals and
                    books. But it was only when I stepped away from literary criticism and all I had
                    learned that the meaning of that awful history started to emerge in a different
                    way, rushing into my life in fleeting, transitory moments, informing and
                    complicating the present. The 13</hi><hi rend="sup color(#000000)">th</hi><hi

                    emancipation through a chance encounter with Henry Louis Gates Jr., when I was a
                    meek graduate student at the University of Arizona. I had read Gates’s book,

                    he was giving a talk at the university. Gates spoke about race and the literary
                    canon and about recovering texts written by formerly enslaved men and women.
                    There was a dinner after the talk, and to my astonishment, I ended up seated
                    elbow-to-elbow with the great scholar with the smiling eyes. He was casual and
                    friendly, fluffing out his napkin and pouring me a glass of water before filling
                    his own. </hi></p>

                    “signifyin’ figure” who danced through the pages of African American literature.
                    “To rename is to revise,” Gates wrote, “and to revise is to Signify” (xxiii).
                    Revise the method for my project, and maybe even shift the canon a bit, was what
                    I wanted to do. The book emerged from the hundreds of others on my PhD reading
                    lists, not just because of Gates’s ideas, brilliant as they were, but because of
                    how he himself had written a scholarly work so alive, multiplicious, and full of
                    intellectual trickery. It struck me as, well, not entirely academic in style.
                    How did he do it?</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="color(#000000)">In my eyes Gates may as well have been a movie star (and he
                    would go on to become a TV celebrity and witness in free speech court
                    proceedings). I was too nervous to utter a word, so I just stared at his nice
                    old-fashioned wrist watch that fit the persona of someone with schedules to
                    keep. But Gates must have asked what I was working on, because I distinctly
                    remember telling him, in a stumbling monologue full of ums and ahs, about
                    romantic literature and how only a shred of scholarship about the slave trade
                    and abolition had been produced. I had pored over Eva Beatrice Dyke’s 1942

                    non-Black person, did I have a right to pursue this research? Was it my story to
                    tell? Perhaps I was also afraid to confront the culpability of my own European

                    light. Though my work might never “signify,’” I understood, it could have
                    significance. Or that maybe that as a white woman writing about the atrocities
                    of Europeans, my work could signify on early white men and women. </hi></p>

                    detective and commander Jon Burge, who spent eighteen years leading a campaign
                    against innocent Black men. Before his crimes were exposed in 1990, Burge
                    targeted some 200 Black men, torturing, imprisoning, and killing many them for
                    crimes they did not commit. Burge learned his craft in the Army during the
                    Korean war, first as a military policeman and then in combat, facing a foe of a
                    different race (Conroy). Burge unleashed his crimes unchallenged and even
                    received numerous honors, including a Bronze Star. Today his career stands as
                    one of the most egregious examples of serial police violence against Black men
                    in U.S. history.</hi></p>

                    In an interview with Marlene Martin of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty,
                    Marvin told how police broke down the door to his sister’s house, kidnapped him,
                    and then beat him. I felt the intensity of the injustice when Marvin related
                    tender stories of his formative years growing up in a housing project. Though
                    the buildings are now gone, he recalled a courtyard of flowers where he used
                    hang out. His favorite memory was a camping trip. A local pastor had organized
                    the trip for him and a bunch of neighborhood kids. “He made sure we went on this
                    weekend camping trip to show us another side of life,” Marvin said. “I'll never
                    forget that—it made such an impression on me” (Martin). </hi></p>

                    like a force. She nodded and peeked cautiously from over her glasses, as if the
                    thought of him gave her a feeling of deep fondness with agony mixed in. Even

                    collecting a great quantity of nails, Tommy was exploiting capitalism. The fact
                    that Fraser weighed the nails implied he suspected Tommy was selling

                    here. In it, Tommy complains of not enough food and clothing, and of being
                    harassed by Fraser, but his primary objection is the 100 lashes, when the legal
                    limit was 41. The court interviewed various witnesses, each claiming Tommy
                    received a different number of lashes. Finally, the court asked Tommy to
                    “exhibit his posterior,” and he had very little sign of being lashed. Tommy
                    explains: “I was favored by the drivers who threw the whips over me.” </hi></p>
