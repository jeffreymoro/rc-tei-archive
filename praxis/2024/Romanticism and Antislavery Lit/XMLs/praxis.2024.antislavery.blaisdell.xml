                <p>This essay analyzes the powerful nexus between antislavery pedagogy, recognizing
                one’s own historical agency, and engaging in civic action in the context of the
                Black Lives Matter movement. I explore my own role as a pre-service teacher, social
                justice activist, and emerging scholar in the field of education in the context of
                the antislavery archive that shaped my undergraduate research and study. I place the
                work of Ottobah Cugoano and other Romantic-era and long-nineteenth-century authors
                in dialogue with Marxist theory, as well as with the work of Paulo Freire, to
                explore how unexpected interconnections between these texts emerge in the contexts
                of teaching, scholarship, and activism.</p>

            <p>When my fellow Black Lives Matter activists and I arrived at the corner of Lowell
                Street and Russell Street in West Peabody, Massachusetts in order to stage a
                counterprotest in July 2020, we were immediately approached by members of the town’s
                police department and told that we had to relocate down the street to a marked-off
                location. Allegedly, the corner of the public sidewalk where we intended to rally
                had been reserved by a group under the organization of Dianna Ploss, a former radio
                host who had lost her job at a New Hampshire station after filming herself
                “berat[ing] landscape workers for speaking Spanish” (Taylor and Waller). When we
                informed one of the police officers that we were not moving to the designated zone
                down the street and that our counterprotest would continue as planned, the situation
                intensified. Our small group was quickly surrounded by seven officers, and after a
                conversation about our right to occupy this public space, we were told, “The
                debate’s over.” Yet the end of the debate about which space we should occupy would
                also have meant an end to the counterprotest itself, since that too was a form of
                debate.</p>
                    
            <p>Fortunately, I know that a permit is not needed to protest in the city of Peabody,
                and that public sidewalks cannot be reserved without proper documentation. At that
                point, a friend of mine signaled to one of our legal observers for assistance and
                began recording on her phone. In an attempt to de-escalate the situation, I told the
                police captain that we would not antagonize the rally, while also asserting that we
                had an equal, legal right to the public sidewalk. Perhaps due to the presence of the
                camera and the National Lawyers Guild observers, the police backed away from us, and
                we proceeded to successfully carry out our counterdemonstration. We received several
                signs that debate was not welcome that day; the police captain’s sentiment was
                mirrored in reactions we received from some of the city’s residents, who shouted
                profanities at us as they drove by. Yet the interaction with the city’s police
                department was instructive because it revealed that the act of protest could legally
                continue, even when we had been told that it could not. More importantly, it also
                revealed the need for persistence and for more sustained efforts in organizing for
                Black lives in my hometown.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on this moment in which the police tried to quell our protest with the
                phrase “the debate’s over” has led me to examine the powerful effect that
                antislavery pedagogy has had on my understanding of my own historico-political
                agency. Throughout this essay I will detail my trajectory in engaging with
                antislavery literature and pedagogy, first as an undergraduate student, then as a
                pre-service teacher, and finally as a scholar in the field of education and a social
                justice activist. I will also explain how my ever-shifting relationship with
                antislavery literature and pedagogy—a source of continual intellectual and affective
                debate—has informed my identity, experiences, and civic activity in each of these
                social roles. Overall, I aim to situate my experiences with antislavery curriculum,
                both as a student and as a teacher, within Paulo Freire’s concept of <hi
                    rend="italic">praxis</hi>, or as he defines it, “reflection and action upon the
                world in order to transform it” (<hi rend="italic">Pedagogy,</hi> 51).</p>

            <div type="section">
                <head>Reading Antislavery Discourse at the Undergraduate Level</head>
            
                    
            <p>My initial contact with antislavery pedagogy began in Professor Joselyn Almeida’s
                “Introduction to British Literature” course when I was a first-year student at the
                University of Massachusetts Amherst. Over the course of the semester, we read the
                work of many prominent abolitionists and other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                authors. For me, the three most powerful readings from this course for realizing my
                own potential for civic action through writing were Ottobah Cugoano’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery</hi> (1787); Mary
                Prince’s <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave, Related
                    by Herself</hi> (1831); and Friedrich Engels’s <hi rend="italic">The Condition
                    of the Working Class in England</hi> (1845). In his fiery exhortation, Cugoano
                forcefully chastises the practice of slavery while simultaneously merging its
                history into that of the developing capitalist economic system. For example, one of
                the central aims of
                <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments </hi>is to locate the
                individuals and corporations who “steal, kidnap, buy, sell, and enslave” other
                humans, or as Cugoano dubs them the “merchandisers of the human species,” into the
                larger economic framework of capitalism, which permits and rewards these cruel and
                exploitative practices (51). In critiquing these “infamous ways of getting rich,”
                Cugoano splices together the despicable history of slavery and that of capitalism
                (70), anticipating the work of scholars such as Eric Williams, Ian Baucom, and
                Walter Mignolo.</p>
                    
            <p>Prince makes a similar point while describing her own experiences working as an
                enslaved person in the salt ponds of the Turks Islands. Prince notes how slave
                owners “received a certain sum for every slave that worked upon [their] premises”
                and how their profits derived from this unpaid labor (10). The force of Prince’s
                autobiography is how she goes on to elaborate the disturbing material conditions and
                details through which slave owners extracted labor from their captives. Furthermore,
                just as Cugoano decried the buying, selling, and merchandising of “the human
                species” for profit, Prince illustrates these horrors through her own personal
                testimony of being offered “for sale like sheep or cattle” (4). Even as her “heart
                throbbed with grief and terror so violently” at the reality of being ripped away
                from her mother and sisters, Prince clearly recognized that for those who bought and
                sold them, tearing apart this family was simply a matter of maximizing their profit
                margin. In other words, for the slave traders who “examined and handled [Prince] in
                the same manner that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was about to purchase,”
                Prince’s enslavement, the separation of her family, and the sale of her body and
                labor power could be reduced to being “knocked down to the highest bidder” (4).</p>
                    
            <p>Cugoano’s powerful critique of capitalism and Prince’s vivid depiction of the
                conditions of slavery connect with the work of Engels in unexpected ways. Only a
                decade after Prince published her <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, Engels delineates
                the brutal indifference of the ruling class and the relationship between the
                exploitation of the English proletariat and capitalism in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Condition of the Working Class</hi>. For Engels, capitalists can only generate
                profit in the form of surplus value through the “surplus labour” of the proletariat,
                which “costs the capitalist nothing, yet goes into his pocket” (314). Part of the
                power of Engels’s work relies on his depiction of workers with “[knees] bent inward
                and backwards,” “ankles deformed and thick,” “deformities of the pelvis,” and
                inhalation of “excessive dust, powder smoke, carbonic acid gas” (162, 253, 249).
                Although it is indisputable that the English working class were “far better off than
                slaves” (Prince 23), and the atrocious exploitation of the free laborers hardly
                approached the inhuman mistreatment of unfree laborers in all ways, reading Cugoano,
                Prince, and Engels together led me to interrogate the complex relationship between
                unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism unfolding in the nineteenth century.</p>
                    
            <p>This inquiry resulted in a term paper, which challenged me, as a student at the time,
                to reflect on ways I could deploy my writing against oppressive institutions and
                resulted in a more focused independent study with Professor Almeida on free and
                unfree labor. At the outset, the core question guiding the independent study focused
                on the dialectical relationship between the condition of enslaved laborers in the
                Global South (e.g., Cuba and Brazil), the condition of the working class in the
                Global North (e.g., United States and Britain), and capitalism as an international
                politico-economic system. In the syllabus we planned together, I aimed to deepen my
                knowledge of writers from the introductory course as well as to read other
                lesser-known figures, such as Thomas Spence and Robert Wedderburn. In addition, we
                sought to include more contemporary scholarship on the topic of slavery, such as
                texts by C. L. R. James, Eric Williams, David Brion Davis, Sidney Mintz, and David
                Eltis.</p>
                    
            <p>In reading these authors and scholars, it soon became more evident to me that the
                relationship between capitalism and slavery in the nineteenth century encompassed
                what Cugoano acutely established in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and
                    Sentiments</hi>. It confirmed Karl Marx’s famous assertion in the first volume
                of <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> (1867) that “the veiled slavery of the
                wage-earners in Europe needed, for its pedestal, slavery pure and simple in the new
                world” (833). It underscored Williams’s revolutionary and groundbreaking proposition
                that the profits of the transatlantic slave trade “fertilized the entire productive
                system of [Britain]” (105). By the end of the independent study, I argued in my term
                paper that capitalism as an economic force not only accommodated transatlantic
                slavery but also shared in a deep-rooted and fundamental relationship with slavery’s
                nineteenth-century development.</p>
                    
            <p>This idea became the basis for my undergraduate honors thesis the following academic
                year. Learning about the field of nineteenth-century antislavery literature led me
                to analyze the structural relationship between capitalism and unfree labor in the
                twenty-first century. To be more precise, I became interested in exploring Marx’s
                (triggering) assertion that not only did “the turning of Africa into a warren for
                the commercial hunting” of Black people signal “the rosy dawn of the era of
                capitalist production” but also his recognition that unfree labor was inextricably
                and structurally intertwined with an economic system whose sole purpose is to “force
                the cost of labor back towards . . . zero” in order to maximize profits (823, 657).
                I wanted to apply my previous research to the project of exposing
                twenty-first-century forms of unfree labor structurally produced by the capitalist
                mode of production. As I examined specific examples of contemporary unfree labor and
                provided readers with direct action steps to advocate for unfree laborers today, I
                began to become more deeply aware of my own historical agency.</p>
                    
            <p>Drawing on the research of modern scholars across numerous disciplines, the three
                major forms of unfree labor in the twenty-first century that I explored in my thesis
                were unfree prison labor, unfree migrant labor, and unfree international labor. By
                reading Angela Davis’s <hi rend="italic">Are Prisons Obsolete?</hi> (2003) alongside
                Michelle Alexander’s <hi rend="italic">The New Jim Crow</hi> (2010) and Dennis
                Childs’s <hi rend="italic">Slaves of the State </hi>(2015), I
                was able to trace the racialized history of prisoners’ economic unfreedom from being
                legally designated as “slaves of the state” via the 1871 Virginia Supreme Court
                decision in <hi rend="italic">Ruffin v. Commonwealth</hi> (as cited by Alexander,
                31) to the hundreds of millions of dollars in profits generated by grossly
                underpaid, predominantly Black and Latinx prison laborers directly or indirectly in
                the production line of the federal government and a vast array of private companies
                including “Dell computers, the Parke­Davis and Upjohn pharmaceutical companies,
                Toys’R’Us, Chevron, IBM, Motorola, Compaq, Texas Instruments, Honeywell, Microsoft,
                Victoria’s Secret, Boeing, Nintendo, and Starbucks,” as well as TransWorld Airlines
                and Honda (Mosher et al. 95). On the topic of unfree migrant laborers, my thesis
                synthesized the research of immigration and slavery scholars Nicholas De Genova,
                Kevin Bales, Ron Soodalter, and Tanya Maria Golash-Boza to elucidate how U.S.
                immigration policy routinely converts already vulnerable migrant laborers into an
                illegal and, therefore, a highly docile and exploitable unfree workforce. For
                instance, one of the main areas of investigation of this portion of my thesis was
                the method through which major corporations like Exxon, John Deere, and Monsanto,
                along with large agribusinesses and the supermarkets and fast-food chains that buy
                from them, could profit from the inexcusable conditions of enslaved, coerced, and
                unpaid labor of migrant workers (Bales and Soodalter 47–8). The last section focused
                on how the structural tendency of capitalism, as embodied by massive multinational
                companies, routinely colludes with governments and financial institutions to produce
                and exploit unfree international workers for the production, accumulation, and
                maximization of surplus value. For example, my explanation of unfree international
                labor directly linked Apple’s 2019 market value of $1.8 trillion (“Apple”) to the
                countless Chinese workers who are reportedly being forced to “hand[le] noxious
                chemicals sometimes without proper gloves or masks” while standing “10 hours a day
                in hot workshops slicing and blasting iPhone casings” (Gao and Webb).</p>
                    
            <p>Ultimately, the overarching claim of my undergraduate honors thesis was that the
                production and exploitation of maximally vulnerable and exploitable unfree laborers
                in the twenty-first century is the result of a structural tendency inextricable from
                the framework of capitalism itself. This structural tendency, or “directing motive,
                the end and aim of capitalist production,” immediately derives from capital’s
                insatiable need to produce, accumulate, and most of all, extract “the greatest
                possible amount of surplus­value,” which is achieved by continuously attempting to
                “force the cost of labor back towards . . . zero” (Marx 363, 657). In my conclusion
                I suggested that capital in the twenty-first century continues to commandeer a
                panoply of state institutions and functions responsible for incarceration,
                immigration, and international trade in order to realize its structural impetus for
                producing, accumulating, and maximizing its share of surplus value.</p>

                The author’s presentation at the Undergraduate Research Conference, UMass Amherst,
                April 2018. &gt;</p>
                    
            <p>Overall, with my focus now shifted toward uncovering and critiquing manifestations of
                slavery today, I soon began to recognize the relationship between my research in
                antislavery literature and the contemporary need to dismantle the political and
                economic institutions continuing to produce unfree laborers. My research and writing
                became a moment for me to link my investigations from the eighteenth and nineteenth
                centuries to our present, while simultaneously exploring ways to discern my place in
                impacting the historical and material conditions of the twenty-first century. At
                this point, I began to experience the way that, as Michel Foucault describes,
                “discourse transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but also undermines and
                exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it” (101). However,
                in reflecting upon Freire’s notion that “the process of problematization implies a
                critical return to action,” my ambitions in regard to antislavery pedagogy again
                shifted: rather than merely focusing on finishing my thesis, I also developed a
                growing desire to engage in more direct civic action (<hi rend="italic"

            <head>Translating Antislavery Discourse into Action as an
                    Undergraduate</head>
                    
            <p>One of the first methods I explored for participating in civic engagement was
                petitioning the state. The murder of Heather Heyer at the white supremacist “Unite
                the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 moved me to action.
                That year, I started a petition to remove the state of Massachusetts’s only
                Confederate memorial, on Georges Island in Boston Harbor. The importance of
                understanding the history of antislavery movements to the present moment was made
                explicit by the way that white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and many Donald Trump
                supporters had utilized pro-slavery symbols, like Confederate flags and Southern
                Nationalist flags, when they all marched together at the “Unite the Right” rally.
                Since my education had focused on narratives of antislavery from the era of the
                Confederacy, I understood the historical relevance of nationwide protests aimed at
                removing public statues commemorating Confederate soldiers in response to the rise
                of far-right extremism and violence.</p>
                    
            <p>I was also led by my studies to engage with my local and state government in more
                direct modes of action. After my examination of prison labor in my thesis, I began
                drafting public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act and the
                Massachusetts Public Records Law. Even though I always had the legal right and
                capability to issue public records requests, it was only after being inspired by the
                canny ways that nineteenth-century abolitionists manipulated the existing legal
                system to advocate for their antislavery agenda that I began to realize how I might
                put this freedom to best use. I recalled how the various abolitionist societies that
                emerged across England in this period were able to organize unprecedented petitions,
                protests, legal proceedings, and other forms of civic action. For instance, in the
                four weeks following a proposal at the Congress of Vienna to “renew the rights of
                French slave-merchants,” English abolitionists were able to get “a higher proportion
                of the population” to sign antislavery petitions than any other petition of the
                time, including the massively popular Chartist petition of 1848 (Fryer 213). I was
                also profoundly inspired by the work of Granville Sharp, who won the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Somerset v. Stewart</hi> case (1772) that outlawed the forcible
                removal of slaves from England. Sharp also fought vigorously alongside Olaudah
                Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano in the
                <hi rend="italic">Zong </hi>case (1781) to hold accountable the
                slave traders who massacred over 130 enslaved people in order to fraudulently
                collect insurance money.</p>
                    
            <p>Filing public records requests in Massachusetts also allowed me to find more specific
                data regarding the potential collusion between the state, prisons, and capital in
                relation to the production and exploitation of unfree prison laborers. The outcome
                of these records requests revealed that the city of Boston had contracts for prison
                labor, despite the Massachusetts law establishing that “no contract shall be made
                for the labor of prisoners” (M.G.L. Chapter 127, Section 51). I also uncovered the
                fact that prison laborers from the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department were excluded
                from the living-wage agreement that vendors contracting with the city of Boston must
                sign, meaning that there was legally no minimum wage for prison workers contracted
                to the city. In some instances, contracts I obtained through public records requests
                showed how prisoners working through a Massachusetts Department of Correction
                program called “MassCor” earned as little as 40 cents per hour while producing a
                wide range of products, including “certificates, beds, binders, padfolios, clothing,
                decals, embroidered garments, flags, janitorial supplies, mattresses, pillows,
                chairs, desks, and tables, office signs, name tags, street signs, park benches,
                picnic tables, fire pits, bike racks, trash receptacles, engraved wood, brick,
                granite and stone, sheets, and towels” for purchase by both public and private
                entities (MA DOC 3).</p>
                    
            <p>The principles I garnered from reading and analyzing abolitionist and Marxist
                literature also led me toward other avenues for realizing my potential as an agent
                of social change, specifically in the field of education. During the summer of 2016,
                I founded the Peabody Volunteer Tutoring Organization (PVTO), which has since
                partnered with the Peabody public school system to provide free summer tutoring
                every year to hundreds of students ranging from grades one through twelve in
                mathematics, science, English, history, and test preparation. My desire to grant
                students and families of disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds access to the
                additional levels of summer support that have been routinely reserved for their more
                privileged counterparts, and modestly to contribute to an atmosphere of community
                empowerment and solidarity in the city of Peabody, stemmed from my yearning to
                disrupt what the Marxist scholar David Harvey identifies as “accumulation by
                dispossession,” specifically within the realm of public education (<hi rend="italic"
                    >New Imperialism,</hi> 144). With a wide range of scholarship documenting the
                horrific inequities in American schooling from Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Schooling in Capitalist America</hi> (1976) to Jonathan
                Kozol’s <hi rend="italic">Savage Inequalities</hi> (1991) to Pedro Noguera’s
                <hi rend="italic">City Schools and the American Dream </hi>(2003),
                the need for immediate individual and community action to subvert these systems that
                regularly dispossess students of marginalized racial and economic backgrounds of
                access to quality educational experiences became my top priority that summer. For
                me, it was clear that this wide-scale educational inequity was a process deeply
                rooted historically in the rise and expansion of capitalism and the Atlantic slave
                trade.</p>

                        Dispossession in the Classroom</head>
                    
            <p>Upon graduating from UMass Amherst with my bachelor’s degree in English, I began more
                directly to witness the “accumulation by dispossession” process firsthand while
                entering a high-poverty urban school district in western Massachusetts as part of
                the residency portion of my graduate program to earn a master’s degree in the field
                of education. During my time as a pre-service student-teacher in this school, I was
                exposed to the harsh material conditions of education in the United States, a system
                that routinely works to effect the dispossession I described above, which in turn
                limits future economic and social mobility. Before elaborating on the relationship
                between my own undergraduate work and my experiences in this particular school
                district, I will first detail the contexts of student learning in this setting.</p>
                    
            <p>The school itself, formerly a Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance corporate building,
                was located across the street from a brand new MassMutual location. In a stark
                contrast to the $39.2 billion that MassMutual earned in revenue during the previous
                year (“Massachusetts Mutual”) and the statewide median household income of $77,378
                (United States Census), some students attending the school came from neighborhoods
                in which the median annual family income was estimated to be a meager $15,311
                (FFIEC). Moreover, with “segregation along racial, ethnic or other lines” being
                “notoriously pervasive features of all capitalist social formation” (Harvey, <hi
                    rend="italic">Seventeen Contradictions</hi> 68) and “a higher percentage of
                Black children” attending “segregated schools now than in 1968” (Knopp 27), the
                demographics of the school mirrored this reality and were not at all proportional to
                the demographics of the state of Massachusetts. According to data from the state’s
                Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 17.6 percent of students at the
                school identified as African American, 70.8 percent as Hispanic, and 8.5 percent as
                white (MA DESE). For purposes of comparison, 71.1 percent of all residents in the
                state of Massachusetts identify as white (United States Census). In other words,
                compared to the rest of the state, the school was clearly segregated along lines of
                race and class, despite the <hi rend="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</hi>
                (1953) Supreme Court ruling declaring that “separate educational facilities are
                inherently unequal” nearly seventy years before (Warren 495).</p>
                    
            <p>The staff of this school wielded a disproportionate amount of power over students.
                The teachers and administrators were mostly white and of upper-middle-class
                backgrounds, making it clear to me that this school was the embodiment of what
                linguist Mary Louise Pratt identifies as a “contact zone,” or a social space “where
                cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly
                asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths
                as they are lived out in many parts of the world today” (34). As a student with a
                background in antislavery and resistance pedagogy, entering this contradictory
                contact zone as a pre-service teacher meant that I understood I had the potential to
                either “reproduce socioeconomic and racial inequalities” or “[build] critical
                consciousness . . . and revolutionary resistance” (Au 90). This awareness led me to
                design a pedagogical unit that aimed to dismantle one particular instance of a
                racialized and classist school policy harming my new students: the school dress
                code.</p>
                    
            <p>The district’s dress code policy, which banned any article of clothing with a hood,
                was firmly entrenched in a history of anti-Black and anti-Brown racism in the United
                States. Under the guise of promoting public safety, Black and Brown children were
                being targeted. The underlying logic maintaining the dress code policy was the
                misguided and racist belief that these children are more dangerous than other
                children and therefore should not be allowed to wear anything that could potentially
                conceal their identities in schools. Ideologically, this was the same belief system
                that allowed the murderer of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black
                student, to be found innocent of second-degree murder and even of the lesser charge
                of manslaughter (Alvaraz and Buckley). In practice, the enforcement of the
                district’s dress code meant that the school’s predominantly white teachers and
                administrators would waste valuable class time stripping Black and Brown students of
                their winter clothing, whether a hoody or a hooded jacket or coat. I can vividly
                recall sitting in the back of a math class when the school’s principal halted the
                lesson by entering the room with a grocery cart and making students take off their
                jackets one by one and put them in the cart. After the principal left, I remember
                watching one student shivering at his desk in a T-shirt for the remainder of class.
                On another cold fall morning, I heard an assistant principal boast in the hallway
                how he “snagged another one,” referring to a student’s hoody. On this particular
                day, it was so cold that it hurt my hands to type: how must the student have been
                feeling, without his sweater? More shockingly, the enforcement of the dress code
                continued all through the harsh New England winter, even as outdoor temperatures
                fell well below zero and even as some of the school’s defective HVAC systems blasted
                freezing outdoor air directly into classrooms.</p>

                The school’s hoody cart&gt;</p>
                    
                    
            <p>The racialized, institutional violence and dispossession that the school’s dress code
                inflicted on my new students prompted me to consider ways I could leverage my
                curriculum to ignite student-based civic action. More specifically, after reflecting
                on the potential power that petitioning against and publicly exposing injustice had,
                I decided to base my “Persuasive Writing” unit on changing the dress code.
                Throughout the course of the unit, students composed argumentative letters addressed
                to the district’s school committee. I also wanted students to use these letters to
                participate in a speak-out event that the school committee had planned in the spring
                of that school year to publicly reveal the true and disturbing reality of the dress
                code policy. Working with students to write these letters was by far one of the most
                transformative experiences in my career as a teacher. In an approach that was based
                on synthesizing research and their specific day-to-day material conditions, my
                students wrote cogent and powerful arguments for why the dress code should be
                changed.</p>
                    
            <p>It came as no great surprise that these arguments were quickly censored by the
                school’s administrators. When they learned that I was working with students to
                present our case to the school committee, a number of administrators visited my
                classroom with the aim of disrupting our plan to disseminate the letters. My
                students were falsely told that their constitutional right to freedom of speech and
                expression could not be exercised at a school-run event. Although this was counter
                to the 1969 <hi rend="italic">Tinker v. Des Moines</hi> Supreme Court decision that
                established that neither “students [nor] teachers shed their constitutional rights
                to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate” (Fortas 506), my
                students were legitimately afraid to say anything that might upset the school’s
                administration, especially because it was common practice to detain students through
                in-school suspension for even very minor violations of school policy. For myself, I
                remember being told in no uncertain terms that being vocal about this issue could
                potentially impact my future career prospects as an educator because “principals and
                superintendents talk.”</p>
                    
            <p>In the end, we were unable to send the letters. But despite this repression of
                student and teacher resistance, the instructional unit still had a tremendous impact
                on my students’ historical and political conceptions of themselves. In a post-unit
                reflection, one of my students wrote: “Having gone through this unit, I would want
                you to teach your future students this lesson. You taught us that we must stand up
                against the people of power and that it’s wrong for them to be holding us back. This
                lesson taught me that we have rights that are being taken away and changed just
                because the color of our skin and because [of] our ages. You told us to fight
                against the system because the system is corrupt.”<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> The student quoted has given permission
                            to share his response.</note> Overall, my students’ powerful
                remarks indicated that the unit succeeded in promoting their awareness of their
                historical agency and capacity for civic action. By the end of the unit, students
                recognized that there will always be pathways for resistance and subversion and that
                they must always continue fighting for their rights regardless of the systemic
                barriers that powerful institutions will leverage against them. Students also
                learned that the power of social change begins and is sustained through collective
                civic action. In short, my unit was able to teach students the core values I
                internalized from studying antislavery pedagogy, all through the framework of a
                curriculum of praxis.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding experiences that could have derailed me from the path toward becoming
                an educator, the lesson of resilience allows me to conclude this essay with a
                reflection on what I have learned in my latest role as a teacher in the city of
                Revere, Massachusetts, alongside my continuing role as a social justice activist in
                Peabody. After the murder of George Floyd, a few colleagues and I formed a community
                organization called “Peabody for Social Justice.” Our main focus has been raising
                awareness of the ways through which the United States systematically attacks the
                lives of Black Americans and people of color, whether through the militant policing
                of Black and Latinx neighborhoods, the chronic underfunding of public education
                systems that primarily serve students of color, the perpetuation of racialized and
                class-based inequities in the healthcare industry, the unfair criminalization and
                imprisonment of people of color, the grotesque exploitation of workers in
                predominantly Black and Brown communities, or by any other means. In the words of
                our mission statement, we seek to “promote the values of liberty, equality, and
                justice for all in our city, regardless of any individual’s race, ethnicity,
                religion, cultural background, linguistic background, gender, sexuality, ability,
                economic class, immigration status, or nationality.” To achieve this goal, we began
                by leading a series of antiracism and anti–police brutality protests and rallies
                across our predominantly white, middle-class suburban city. Next, we were able to
                arrange a meeting with the city’s mayor to discuss more concrete and long-term
                political changes to make Peabody more equitable and socially just. Some of the
                activities we proposed included conducting thorough reviews of city policies,
                ordinances, and services for race- or class-based biases; collecting and publishing
                data regarding the day-to-day operations of city institutions; and organizing
                rallies and other events to promote the need for social justice.</p>
                    
            <p>In the spring of 2020, activists in Boston beheaded the statue of Christopher
                Columbus that faced the waterfront in the city’s North End. Such events demonstrate
                that the ongoing wave of civic action across the United States can be clearly traced
                back to the continuous work of fighting against the legacy of slavery and
                contemporary manifestations of white supremacy. When I returned to school after my
                summer of activism, I continued to develop more robust civically-motivated lessons
                and antiracist curricula to spark my students’ understanding of their own historical
                agency. For example, one instructional unit I devised asked students to investigate
                and analyze current Massachusetts legislation that involves the rights of
                marginalized socioeconomic groups and learn how they can fight for social change at
                the state level by lobbying their elected officials. I also continue to support
                students by incorporating the skills I learned from my early activism to help them
                lobby for political changes that
                <hi rend="italic">they </hi>want to see in the city, state, and
                beyond. In alignment with the principles of antislavery pedagogy and Freire’s theory
                of praxis, I expect my students to utilize their ability to read, analyze, and
                produce sustained discourse to influence social change, as well as participate in
                more physical events of civic action.</p>
                    
            <p>Now more than ever, we must embrace this emancipatory praxis promulgated by Freire.
                As critical educators, we are constantly reminded that our roles and
                responsibilities to our students extend far beyond the dominant “banking” concept of
                education, through which “the students are the depositories [of knowledge] and the
                teacher is the depositor” (Freire, <hi rend="italic">Pedagogy</hi> 72). Instead, we
                must actively encourage students critically to examine the structures of power and
                exploitation in their surrounding material conditions. By consistently integrating
                theory and praxis in the classroom and offering students alternative visions of the
                future, we can tap into their emerging conceptions of justice, equality, and
                fairness. In my classroom, this looks like students conducting individually led,
                sustained-action research projects based on social justice issues related to the
                course’s theoretical frameworks.</p>
                    
            <p>One project that encapsulates these ideas is the final project for my “World
                Revolutions” unit. After students have learned about the conditions, beliefs, and
                triggers of some of the world’s most significant revolutions, I ask them to research
                a country or place they believe is ripe for a revolution today. In this project,
                students are invited to integrate their understanding of the social, political, and
                economic causes of earlier revolutions with the current historical moment. Rather
                than acting as a “depositor” of information, my role in the classroom is to
                facilitate, challenge, and offer support as students explore the material conditions
                of the past and present and the various theoretical frameworks for interrogating it,
                such as Cugoano, Engels, Marx, Prince, Williams, and others. Through self-directed,
                sustained-inquiry projects like the ones I’ve described, we can ignite students’
                passion for a better world, a world free of slavery, exploitation, and oppression.
                As the story of my experiences with antislavery pedagogy demonstrates, it was
                ultimately this kind of undertaking at various stages of my development that guided
                and critically informed my trajectory from student to researcher to educator to
                social activist and back.</p>
                    
            <p>Although the challenges and institutional powers before us today in the twenty-first
                century are unprecedented and complex, we cannot forget the historical importance of
                the spirit of resilience to the project of abolition and social justice. As Cugoano
                wrote:
            <quote>This must appear evident, that for any man to carry on a traffic in the merchandize
                of slaves, and to keep them in slavery; or for any nation to oppress, extirpate and
                destroy others; that these are crimes of the greatest magnitude, and a most daring
                violation of the laws and commandments of the Most High, and which, at last, will be
                evidenced in the destruction and overthrow of all the transgressors. And nothing
                else can be expected for such violations of taking away the natural rights and
                liberties of men. (61)</quote>
                
            The abolitionists of the nineteenth century were up against some of the most
                powerful, vicious, and despicable institutions of modern human history. Yet in their
                fight against the transatlantic slave trade—the cradle of capitalism and present-day
                neo-slavery—the abolitionists, radicals, and revolutionaries never ceased to
                envision a world in which transgressors were overthrown and the rights and liberties
                of all people were upheld. Antislavery pedagogy in the era of Black Lives Matter
                reminds us of the work that we must do to keep ourselves united and organized to
                promote freedom and equality for all. Claiming our own historical agency and the
                field for civic action means insisting that debate must persist, even when
                authorities tell us it cannot.</p>
