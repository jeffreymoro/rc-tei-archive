            <div type="abstract">
                <p>In her recent essay about Mansfield Park (1814), Lynn Festa defines noise in Jane Austen’s novel as those sounds 
                    that we can hear but may not be linguistically legible, such as the cries of the Atlantic slave trade. This essay 
                    invites us to listen for noise in the soundscape of antislavery poetry. Focusing on the commonly overlooked tunes of 
                    ballads, I reveal the complicated politics of musical haunting in two canonical antislavery ballads: William Cowper’s 
                    “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and Hannah More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba” (1797). These ballads were set to the tune of an 
                    older song, Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), which mourns the deaths of thousands of English sailors from 
                    yellow fever in the Spanish West Indies. I model an exercise that invites readers to open their ears to the white noise in 
                    poetry about slavery and to think critically about the politics of formal, racial, and historical possession.

            <p>For those of us who study and teach the literature of slavery and abolition,
                listening for silences as attentively as voices is a matter of ethical urgency.
                Since the publication of Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern Speak?” (1988), critics
                who write about the colonial and postcolonial world have been faced with the
                challenge of listening beyond voice, which, in the texts we tend to teach, is so
                essentially constructed by and for the Western subject. The problem with voice is
                its privilege—only few can speak, and even fewer are actually heard. Silence too
                poses its own interpretive challenges. We find the critical limitations of silence
                in Edward Said’s well-known interrogation of Jane Austen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mansfield Park</hi> (1814), a novel that notoriously dials down the volume on
                the subject of slavery and empire that haunts its geographic and fictional borders.
                Critics have taken turns defending Austen’s evident reserve on the slavery question
                in the novel.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                            Ferguson, “<hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>”; and
                        Fraiman.</note> Many have insisted that, if it is silent, Austen’s
                novel faithfully captures the taboo nature of the theme in its own historical
                context and assumes an implicit contemporary understanding of and sensitivity to the
                moral crisis at the center of the Bertram estate.</p>
                        
            <p>More recently, however, Lynn Festa has proposed that in <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Park</hi> Austen may not be asking us to listen for the omissions that fill the
                novel’s silences so much as urging us to listen for what its <hi rend="italic"
                    >noise</hi> might tell us: “For we may hear but we do not usually <hi
                    rend="italic">listen</hi> to noise. . . . For who listens to noise? We moderns
                consider having a voice as fundamental to social and political representation, and
                silence is often equated with oppression” (152, 154). As Festa distinguishes here,
                listening for noise means paying attention to sounds we would otherwise block out
                because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient. And in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, many things are noisy—the urbane Crawfords,
                the staging of <hi rend="italic">Lover’s Vows</hi>, and, of course, Fanny Price’s
                questions about the slave trade at the dinner table. Though Fanny’s timid inquiries
                about slavery threaten to disrupt the tranquility of Mansfield Park, they hardly
                amount to the kind of political voice that Spivak problematizes, nor do they qualify
                as silence within the terms of Said’s famous critique, even if she is in fact
                silenced. If Fanny’s questions fall on deaf ears, it is not because they do not echo
                in the room but because they travel at an inconvenient frequency. “When Austen asks
                us to hear noise,” Festa observes, “she is asking us to recognize that noise is <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> simply what needs to be blocked out to hear the ‘real’
                message, like the static that makes the radio hard to hear. It may be something—in
                this respect, noise is like Fanny—that we need to listen <hi rend="italic">for</hi>”
                (153). In other words, listening for noise means being alert to the static in the
                soundscape of the imperial world that so often escapes representation. Pondering the
                marked noisiness of <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, Festa concludes that
                Austen implores us to open our ears to precisely this kind of imperial static.</p>
                        
            <p>In this essay I propose that we accept Festa’s invitation to listen for noise in the
                literature of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world. Instead of attending to
                fiction, however, I invite us to listen to the poetry that fills the archive. Poetry
                is obviously rich in sound—meter, rhyme, alliteration, and so forth—but its <hi
                    rend="italic">noise</hi>, as Festa has defined it, is not always something that
                is heard or listened for. Fortunately for us, the archive of slavery contains plenty
                of poetry, primarily because abolitionists understood verse as a powerful medium
                that arouses the moral sentiments. One of the most popular forms embraced by
                antislavery poets was the ballad, a poetic genre that is particularly noisy because
                it reverberates a national history and an oral tradition that is only rarely
                attended to. While balladeers construct a voice (or voices) in their ballads, other
                historical noises haunt the form, including a musical tradition. When I teach
                ballads by abolitionist poets like William Cowper and Hannah More in my classroom, I
                begin by asking my students to examine the formal and rhetorical strategies that
                these white writers used to construct enslaved Black voices. Part of this exercise,
                however, requires that we listen beyond the constructed voice found on the surface
                of the poem to the musical history that today only comes through as static, or, as
                Festa proposes, as noise. Rarely do teachers of poetry pay attention to ballad tune
                (or melody) but doing so can sometimes help clarify the political stakes of a poem.
                In Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba” (1797),
                this musical dimension allows us to access a British imperial history through a
                melody that enriches our political sense of these poems. For contemporaries of
                Cowper and More, old ballad tunes might affect listeners given their own familiarity
                with national songs, but for today’s readers of poetry tunes are more often than not
                meaningless static. In what follows I consider the ballad’s media history as a kind
                of meaningful noise that, in the context of British slavery and abolition, raises
                important questions about the limits of political representation and voice for
                enslaved subjects.</p>
                        
            <p>I teach eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British antislavery ballads
                alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s astounding collection of poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> (2008), which taps into a related but altogether distinct form of
                static—the noise in the law. Philip’s title refers to the infamous
                eighteenth-century slave ship that became the subject of a horrific and historic
                British legal case, <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> (1783). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong</hi> witnessed the intentional mass drowning of over one
                hundred enslaved Africans in order to claim an insurance policy on its human cargo,
                a great fraction of which had become sick at sea from disease or malnourishment.
                When the insurance company refused to pay out the claim on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi>’s enslaved cargo, William Gregson and his syndicate brought the case
                to trial. While technically tried as a disagreement about an insurance policy, the
                case opened up a host of ethical questions regarding the treatment of the enslaved at sea.
                The chief justice, Lord Mansfield, who presided over several landmark cases devoted
                to the slave trade, ultimately ruled against the owners of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> on a technicality—evidence arose in the ship’s log that rainfall had
                ameliorated the water shortage that Gregson and his crew claimed made the cargo
                disposable. Philip’s extraordinary project in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is to
                listen for the noise of slavery in the legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson
                    v. Gilbert</hi> and to reconstruct poems using only that language to offer
                testimony that was inadmissible at the time of the trial, testimony that could only
                be dismissed as legal noise. My aim in pairing antislavery and contemporary poems in
                this class is to underscore the precarity of political voice in the slavery archive.
                To this end I engage my students in a conversation about the limits of poetic
                justice in verse about transatlantic slavery by uncovering the profound historical
                and interpretive potential of what I have outlined here as noise.</p>

            <head>II. Ballad Noise</head>
            <p>The task of listening for noise in antislavery ballads is perhaps more challenging
                than in a study of fiction because, of course, poetry is so noisy. At the same time,
                critics and teachers of poetry are used to being attentive to sounds that students
                or lay readers may not listen for. Beyond listening to narrative or voice in poetry,
                there is also meter, rhythm, rhyme, and alliteration, frequent topics of discussion
                in any class on poetry. In the case of the ballad, however, there is also tune.
                Music is often overlooked because the literary study of the ballad tradition since
                the nineteenth century deprioritized tune in favor of qualities like lyric voice, a
                shift that all but rendered tune an inconsequential noise. Prior to the nineteenth
                century, however, printed ballads were understood as lyrics accompanied by a musical
                score that functioned as a deeply meaningful dimension to any ballad. Music works on
                us in a way that precedes cognition and can possess us like a spirit from without.
                In the ballad tradition tunes were recycled for new poems, which meant that modern
                ballads often carried a tune from a much older song. This detail in the ballad’s
                media history places the genre in a special category in the poetic tradition because
                ballads carry a musical past that is now commonly ignored as <hi rend="italic"
                    >noise</hi>.</p>
                        
            <p>Two canonical eighteenth-century antislavery ballads carry an old tune that we should
                listen for: Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” and More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba.” The
                old song these poems echo is Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), a
                naval ballad written during the Walpole era that celebrates a military victory in
                the Spanish West Indies and mourns the tragic and avoidable loss of thousands of
                English sailors to yellow fever on those waters. In Glover’s political ballad, the
                ghosts of these sailors call out to the reader or listener to be remembered for
                their service and sacrifice. In my classroom I invite my students to listen to
                Glover’s song, and I ask them what it might mean that the enslaved Black voices
                constructed by Cowper and More are mediated and amplified by a tune about thousands
                of white English sailors who perished at sea. Why would Cowper and More make such a
                formal decision? And what are some of the challenges that this decision poses for
                the political and literary representation of enslaved Africans during the abolition
                debate? In other words, I ask how we might read “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as a kind
                of meaningful noise.</p>
                        
            <p>All of these questions stem from a common problem—<hi rend="italic">mediation</hi>.
                Fortunately for us, the thematic ghostliness of Glover’s ballad allows us to bring
                all of the ways in which mediation is in play into clear focus. The most obvious
                starting point is thinking about the ballad as a poetic medium, not only in terms of
                the layered musical and lyrical richness I’ve already described but also as an oral
                form that migrated into print culture in the late eighteenth century as collections
                like Thomas Percy’s <hi rend="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi> (1765)
                were assembled. In fact, Percy included Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” in his
                popular compendium of national songs. As Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane have
                observed, poets of Cowper’s generation participated in finding a middle ground
                between oral and printed ballad forms in crafting new ballads during a period of
                media transition (242). Indeed, Cowper and More are members of the last generation
                of poets that seriously and intentionally engage the musical dimension of the
                ballad.</p>
                        
            <p>Another way to think about mediation in these poems is in spiritual terms. Mediums,
                after all, are those persons who channel spirits from another world to our own. In
                “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover performs the task of giving voice to the sailors
                haunting that poem. In the later antislavery ballads that carry its tune, the
                enslaved speakers function as another kind of medium altogether in their
                reverberation of the older naval song. These enslaved subjects both echo and jar
                against the voices of the sailors in Glover’s poem because their historical
                situations couldn’t be more different.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This conflation between sailor and slave may
                            recall Robert Southey’s “The Sailor who had Served in the Slave Trade”
                            (1798). In this ballad narrative, a sailor returns to England from the
                            “slave-coast” (110) traumatized by having been forced to beat a female
                            slave to death. Southey’s narrative exposes the communal trauma suffered
                            by everyone who participates in the institution of slavery, but he also
                            reveals the extent to which men like this sailor may similarly be
                            deprived of their will. While in Cowper’s and More’s ballads the slave
                            speakers are haunted by music expressing the plaints of dead sailors in
                            Glover’s song, Southey’s sailor is haunted by the enslaved victim he was
                            compelled to torture.</note> Further still, Cowper and More act
                as mediums for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Black voices they represent <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> the ghosts of Glover’s ballad. When I present the layered
                and haunted quality of these ballads in my classroom, my students are often
                surprised and provoked by the racial complexity of the voices they hear—the enslaved
                African speakers are politically mediated by both white poets and the spirits of
                white British sailors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The relaying of voice found in Cowper’s and More’s
                            ballads offers a related but contrasting example of what Maureen McLane,
                            in <hi rend="italic">Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of
                                Romantic Poetry</hi> (2011), has identified in the remediation of
                            songs by Africans and Native Americans collected from imperial borders
                            (108). McLane examines ballads like Mungo Park’s “Negro’s Song” and Anne
                            Home Hunter’s “Cherokee Death Song,” published in Joseph Ritson’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Select Collection of English Songs</hi> (1783), as
                            examples of authentic African and American ditties returned to England,
                            where they are versified and set to music. This process of remediation
                            traces the migration of the song as it crosses imperial boundaries,
                            where the musical instruments and poetic forms of polite society
                            transform it for the English ear. Unlike these cases of English
                            lyricists bringing home tunes from imperial territories for remediation,
                            Cowper’s and More’s ballads are English songs dispatched across the
                            Atlantic and placed in the mouths of African slaves. But this dispatch,
                            oddly enough, returns to the scene of Hosier’s tragedy. Thus “Admiral
                            Hosier’s Ghost,” which experienced its own transatlantic vocalization,
                            uncannily wanders back to its place of origin—the Atlantic—only to be
                            revocalized by a foreign, racialized body for new political purposes. I
                            discuss this distinction in my own essay on this subject, “Lyric
                            Possession in the Abolition Ballad.” In teaching antislavery ballads,
                            one may emphasize this history of problematic international musical
                            dialogue and appropriation across the British Empire.</note>
                Understanding these layers, they are more fully aware of the rhetorical strategies
                and stakes involved in the ballad form in the abolition context.</p>
                        
            <p>What becomes clear in this triad of ballads is that haunting is both formal and
                political. “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” functions as a kind of historical white noise
                resounding in the later soundscapes of “The Negro’s Complaint” and “The Sorrows of
                Yamba.” In media studies, the term <hi rend="italic">white noise</hi> refers to
                static that exceeds the intended signal or message being transmitted. In the
                antislavery ballad tradition, I’m interested in thinking not only about music or
                tune as white noise in academic studies of the ballad but also in the racial
                implications of this music—the whiteness of the voices amplifying Black, enslaved
                speakers. Beyond this ghostly musical mediation, these poems also exhibit a kind of
                possession that is intrinsic to the ballad form. As Susan Stewart argues in her
                essay “Lyric Possession,” poets who write ballads are implicitly possessed by a
                national history as they broadcast an oral tradition in their revision of older
                songs. “Of all the singers of Western lyric,” Stewart writes, “the ballad singer is
                the one most radically haunted by others, for he or she presents the gestures, the
                symptoms, of a range of social actors, and he or she presents those gestures as
                symptoms of a previous action” (41). In other words, haunting is a formal process
                native to the very composition of ballads. The poet functions as a medium for
                historical action in their embodied composition of a new song according to an older
                musical and metrical schema. Stewart calls this “the submersion of will within
                convention” (40). In the poems we are dealing with, however, possession is just as
                political as it is formal insofar as they condemn an institution that supports the
                deprivation of human will. Bound by the formal imperatives of the ballad tradition,
                Cowper and More become strange mediums and precarious political representatives in
                their attempts to embody the experience of enslaved persons while conjuring a formal
                and national history. Moreover, the voices we find ringing in the ballads form a
                strange and spectral chorus of competing political pleas.</p>
                        
            <p>As scholars like Simon Gikandi, Laura Doyle, and Ian Baucom argue, the archive of
                Atlantic slavery is hauntological and generically marked by the gothic. One of the
                Afro-Caribbean spiritual practices that I share with my students in our discussion
                of lyric possession is <hi rend="italic">obeah</hi>, a common ritual among early
                slave communities in the West Indies. As Alan Richardson reveals in “Romantic
                Voodoo,” obeah was a slave practice that struck fear among the British in the
                Caribbean and in England after it began to appear in popular fiction and poetry in
                the late eighteenth century, as we find in William Earle’s sensational novel about
                obeah and the Jamaican folk hero Jack Mansong,
                    <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack </hi>(1800).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Alan
                            Richardson proposes, representations of obeah increased anxiety and
                            agitation in the wake of slave uprisings (“Romantic Voodoo”). The
                            politics of lyric possession we find in the antislavery ballad seems in
                            dialogue with charged spiritual practices like obeah.</note>
                Accounts of obeah rituals also filled popular histories of the West Indies,
                including Edward Long’s <hi rend="italic">History of Jamaica</hi> (1774). These
                representations amplified colonial anxiety in the wake of slave rebellions in the
                West Indies and exacerbated national tensions generated by political revolutions in
                France, Haiti, and America. For our purposes, however, obeah might be considered as
                one form of imperial noise that echoed within British cultural production about
                slavery at this time. In its investment in ritual and incantation, we might also
                think about obeah as an Afro-Caribbean analogue to lyric possession, as we see in
                William Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation” (1797). In this poem, Shepherd parrots an
                obi priest via the ode form as he calls for “the white man’s doom” by spurring a
                slave insurgency using material rituals and lyric conjuring:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                    
                
            <l>Haste! the magic shreds prepare—</l>
            <l>Thus the white man’s corse we tear.</l>
            <l>Lo! feathers from the raven’s plume,</l>
            <l>That croaks our proud Oppressor’s doom.</l>
            <l>Now to aid the potent spell,</l>
            <l>Crush we next the brittle shell—</l>
            <l>Fearful omen to the foe,</l>
            <l>Look! the blanched bones we throw. (lines 25–32)</l>
                </lg>
                
                
           If the lyric possession we find in ballads by Cowper and More summons the specters of
                British imperial history through music, Shepherd invokes the spirit of obeah to
                craft a political ode designed to raise alarm about racial and imperial tensions in
                the West Indies. Discussing obeah alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s own incantatory
                poetics raises fascinating questions about the limits of Western poetic forms like
                the ballad or the ode when framing historical Black voices. As Philip argues in her
                essay “Notanda” (included in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>), the project of rescuing
                enslaved Black voices from the history of British law required a poetic approach
                that exceeded the rationality of Western forms. The poems generated by Philip’s
                “irrational” approach to historical texts seem to echo the radical shamanistic
                practice of obeah in colonial life in ways that feel historically authentic and
                politically effective. Form, Philip teaches us, can sometimes speak so loudly as to
                drown out the voices that poetry is meant to broadcast. I will return to obeah in
                the next section.</p>
                        
            <p>By reading British antislavery and naval ballads together with my students, I aim to
                accomplish several things. First, I demonstrate how a Black voice is constructed in
                an antislavery ballad and generate discussion around the politics of that
                construction with special attention to the rhetoric of voice in each poem. Second, I
                teach my students about ballad form and its media history, including the element of
                music so often overlooked in the study of the ballad. Next, I share the political
                history of Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” and comment on how it intersects with
                British transatlantic slavery. My goal at the end of these exercises is to invite
                students to think critically about what it means for Cowper and More to have chosen
                Glover’s song as a tune and a spirit for the voices of enslaved Black subjects in
                their poems.</p>
                        
            <p>My approach to these complex poems in the classroom is first to invite my students to
                close-read Cowper’s and More’s ballads together while paying close attention to
                voice. Whose voice(s) are we hearing? And, who is listening? I remind them that
                these are lyric poems by white English writers who construct an African subject and
                voice for an English audience. Our first exercise is to deconstruct that voice to
                understand the rhetorical strategies at work in the two poems, which are distinct in
                both message and approach. We find that Cowper’s African speaker makes a rational
                plea for liberation and challenges the reader to examine his or her own sense of
                justice in the face of the appeal. More’s Yamba, on the other hand, offers a much
                more sentimental and sympathetic voice whose tragic story is designed to appeal to
                our moral feelings. Moreover, Yamba echoes an Evangelical narrative in her turning
                to a missionary to find solace in a Christian life and its teachings. To shed light
                on each poet’s rhetorical strategy, I offer up biographical details about Cowper and
                More that give us some insight, including Cowper’s religious mania and isolation and
                More’s commitment to practical and religious teachings for the working-class public
                in writings like the Cheap Repository Tracts series (where “Yamba” appeared). These
                biographical details help students understand that there are personal traces of
                Cowper and More in the Black voices they construct<note place="foot" resp="author"> More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba”
                            introduces new complications to the political voice constructed in the
                            abolition ballad. Richardson has exposed a fascinating conflict of
                            authorial voice in the poem’s textual history. According to Richardson,
                            the poem was originally penned by a minor Scottish poet, Eaglesfield
                            Smith, and first published in <hi rend="italic">Universal Magazine</hi>
                            in 1797; it was subsequently expanded by More in an anonymous
                            republication in the highly popular Cheap Repository Tracts series,
                            which promoted middle-class values of religious and social obedience.
                            Such mixed and unstable authorship underscores the plurality of voices
                            native to the ballad form; it also highlights an Anglo-Scottish colonial
                            ideological problem that plays itself out in the poem’s variants. What
                            was, in Smith’s hands, an outright critique of imperial commerce
                            parroted by an African voice turns into a much less censorious narrative
                            about Christian conversion and Yamba’s forgiveness of her masters in
                            More’s version (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). For a discussion of
                            the centrality of gender in the construction of the slave voice in the
                            literature of sensibility, see Mellor; see also Ferguson, <hi
                                rend="italic">Subject to Others</hi> (1992).</note> One of
                the awkward attunements we find in More’s poem is that it displays an attempt at
                Afro-Caribbean dialect. This is common among ballads in the abolition archive and
                significant because ballads must also adhere to the genre’s metrical patterns. What
                does it mean, I ask my students, that poets attempted dialect while at the same time
                accommodating the voice to English ballad meter? Finally, I contextualize the poems
                in the wider historical landscape, pointing out that More’s poem was composed after
                the beginning of the French and Haitian revolutions, which may account for its more
                conservative tone and narrative. I often generate discussion around the political
                efficacy of each ballad by asking students to compare their strengths and
                weaknesses.</p>
                        
            <p>Because these poems were distributed as broadsides and our attention is on ballad
                media, I share images of both broadsides with my students. As popular forms,
                broadsides were inexpensive literature and news media that circulated widely in town
                centers (coffee houses and taverns, for example) and eventually migrated out into
                the country. As the historian of abolition Brycchan Carey has shown, a ballad
                reproduced on broadsheets could circulate rapidly, particularly if the ballad was
                set to a recognizable form and tune (100). Abolitionists working with the Society
                for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade understood the importance of
                inexpensive print materials as they sought to reach a wide popular audience, and the
                broadside was an ideal vehicle for their message. The broadsides printed for
                Cowper’s and More’s ballads usually advertised “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as the tune
                for their poems underneath the title. Glover’s song was a popular tune that one
                might hear played in an eighteenth-century drawing room, and so I make sure to play
                a recording of the song, accessible to everyone on YouTube (Craig), in my classroom.
                The purpose of this demonstration is to immerse my students in the ballad’s media
                history. In the past I have even printed the ballads on single sheets so that
                students might read the poems as the tune plays. Once students hear the tune, they
                are immediately struck by the awkwardness of framing an enslaved voice in the tunes
                and metrical frameworks of polite society. A productive conversation can emerge from
                reflecting on the aesthetic effects of these formal choices when students are
                reminded of the intended British audience and the sensitive political debate around
                slavery happening at the time. In order for the British public to connect and
                sympathize with an enslaved African subject, that subject needed to sound as British
                as possible.</p>
                        
            <p>Next, we turn to the broadside for “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” which features a
                striking political cartoon of maritime specters rising from the Caribbean Sea. I
                offer my students an account of the dynamic political climate surrounding Glover’s
                poem and some details about Glover himself. Descended from the merchant class in
                London, Glover supported the financial interests of trading companies that
                trafficked across the Atlantic, including companies that bought and sold African
                slaves (Baines). In the early eighteenth century, British trading vessels were
                routinely attacked and raided by Spanish ships. Because Robert Walpole was reluctant
                to go to war with Spain at this time, London merchants heavily criticized his lack
                of aggression against Spanish interference in the West Indies (Rodger 234). When
                Walpole sent Vice-Admiral Francis Hosier and his fleet to conduct a blockade along
                the mosquito-infested waters off Porto Bello, a Spanish settlement in what is now
                Panama, in 1726, over three thousand sailors contracted yellow fever and died.
                Seeing his opportunity to criticize Walpole, Glover drafted “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                to remind the British public of the fatal consequences of Walpole’s refusal simply
                to overtake the Spanish port. In the poem, Hosier’s spirit rises from the waters
                near Porto Bello to relate his melancholy tale to Admiral Edward Vernon, who
                successfully sacked Porto Bello twelve years later, in 1739. The ballad thus mourns
                the lives of the sailors lost at Porto Bello due to Walpole’s military failure,
                while celebrating Vernon’s later victory for Britain.</p>

                Hosier’s Ghost,” by Richard Glover (1740), colored etching by C. Mosley (1740).
                National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London.&gt;</p>
                        
            <p>In “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover’s strategy is to exhume recent history from the
                sea for political purposes, which is also the strategy employed by Cowper and More
                in their later antislavery ballads. When we read the poem in the classroom, I ask
                students to consider the dead sailors’ spectral plea to be remembered for their
                sacrifice in the midst of imperial triumph. Hosier’s ghost rises from the waters and
                addresses the victorious Vernon on behalf of his crew:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                    
                
            <l>See these mournful Spectres sweeping,</l>
            <l>Ghastly, o’er this hated wave,</l>
            <l>Whose wan Cheeks are stain’d with weeping:</l>
            <l>These were English Captains brave:</l>
            <l>Mark those Numbers pale and horrid,</l>
            <l>Who were once my sailors bold,</l>
            <l>Lo, each hangs his drooping Forehead,</l>
            <l>While his dismal Fate is told. (lines 32–40)</l>
                    
                </lg>
                
            I ask my students to think about what this plea for remembrance means when the tune
                of Glover’s poem transfers the sentiment to the tongue of the enslaved speaker in
                Cowper’s and More’s later ballads. As a way to think through this question, I offer
                more historical context on Porto Bello. In the early eighteenth century, Porto Bello
                was a major Spanish outpost for the slave trade, and historians reveal that many
                slaves in the region suffered and died of the very yellow fever that claimed Hosier
                and his men (Lohse 74–109). While it is not at all surprising that these African
                voices are not heard in Glover’s ballad, it is significant that Cowper and More
                later give voice to their own enslaved speakers by echoing, at least musically, the
                voices of the sailors from that original ballad. In other words, the noise of
                slavery ringing in Porto Bello was muted in Glover’s ballad and only becomes audible
                in the antislavery ballads that recycle its tune decades later. One other important
                detail to emphasize in discussing the poem is that while Glover’s song is elegiac in
                tone, it actually celebrates Vernon’s victory and imperial expansion in the
                Caribbean and implicitly supports the trading interests of companies trafficking in
                enslaved bodies at that time. In this light, “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” seems out of
                tune with the political message of the later antislavery ballads that echo its
                music. Discussing Cowper’s and More’s potential motivation for this awkward decision
                with students is a generative exercise. While the melancholy tone and maritime
                context certainly seem appropriate, the actual politics of Glover’s song—the zeal
                for the expansion of empire—seems dissonant with that of the antislavery lyrics. One
                explanation that may be offered is that the poets sought to reform the imperial
                economic impulse of Glover’s song by purging it of the moral stain of slavery and
                overwriting its voices with those of the disenfranchised.</p>
                        
            <p>Coming back to the question of voice can help students understand the real
                limitations of political sympathy in this context. Whose voice(s) do we hear in
                these poems, and why does it matter? The white noise we hear in antislavery ballads
                by Cowper and More is, after all, the spectral chorus of Glover’s song. It is likely
                that these poets chose Glover’s tune to strengthen sympathy for their enslaved
                African subjects. However, as Saidiya Hartman has proposed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scenes of Subjection</hi> (1997), sympathy in the literature of slavery and
                abolition can be as destructive a mechanism as it is humanizing. While we typically
                understand sympathy as our best means of human connection, it can often obliterate
                otherness in the process because it “fails to expand the space of the other and
                merely places the self in its stead” (20). The abolitionist project is often
                criticized for the ways in which the literature it produced whitewashed its enslaved
                African subjects, a transformation that seemed necessary for political reform at the
                time. Choosing Glover’s tune for their ballads, Cowper and More hoped to tap into a
                well of melancholy about the loss of English sailors during a major event in English
                imperial history. In doing so, they sought to facilitate as much sympathy as
                possible, but that mediation certainly comes at the cost of an authentic encounter
                with human otherness. To encounter otherness more directly would require a
                recognition of the limitations of sympathy, given our own national, racial, and
                gendered identity. It would also require an understanding of the limitations of the
                British abolitionist archive, which might be supplemented by West African or
                Caribbean texts that may have seemed alien to the British public—and particularly
                genres less mediated by abolitionist leaders, such as African music and song.</p>
                        
            <p>Another complication with respect to sympathy is the difference in situation between
                an encounter with one voice as opposed to many. While it seems natural to feel a
                more powerful sympathy for an individual, these sonically layered poems do in fact
                conjure a chorus of voices. Philip’s contemporary poetry collection <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong!</hi> develops this problem by refusing to construct
                individual voices altogether. Instead, her poems about slavery are fragments of
                voices rescued from the language of history and the law. White noise thus forms the
                polyphonic text of the <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection, allowing Philip to
                foreground the absence of enslaved voices in the archive while preserving the
                language of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. Engaging these cacophonous
                and irrational poems, sympathy seems impossible and perhaps beside the point. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong!</hi> Philip transforms the noise in the law surrounding the
                horrific <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> massacre into a kind of poetry whose aim is not
                to generate sympathy but to stage an ethical encounter with the victims of history
                that is as irrational as the event itself.</p>

            <p>I ask my students to think about noise and formal haunting in a slightly different
                way when we turn to Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection, which was
                inspired by a similar scene and situation. Both the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre and the deadly plague in Porto Bello featured in “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                are tragic and melancholy episodes in British imperial history. However, Philip’s
                poetic approach to history is vastly different from that of Cowper and More. As an
                Afro-Canadian attorney as well as a poet, Philip’s shared interests in the history
                of transatlantic slavery and the law drew her to the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre. Philip’s project in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is to listen to the noise
                in the legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> and to make that
                noise available to readers as poetic language. This involves mutilating the text of
                Lord Mansfield’s decision in that case and using it as a repository of language to
                reconstitute traces of the voices of the enslaved muzzled by the legal proceedings.
                While Mansfield famously expressed personal disgust with the institution of slavery,
                the conventions of the law prevented him from writing a decision that recognized the
                enslaved Africans in question as legal or political subjects. Part of Philip’s
                challenge in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>, then, is to use that same language to
                attempt to give voice and reconstitute subjectivity, even if only in a fragmentary
                way.</p>
                        
            <p>Understanding that the task of mediating individual voices is impossible and perhaps
                ethically problematic, Philip allows testimony to come through as linguistic noise.
                We might say she is attempting to reconstruct historical subjectivity <hi
                    rend="italic">as noise</hi>. In “Notanda,” she explains her process and tracks
                her difficult journey making sense of the case. She begins with this statement:
                “There is no telling this story; it must be told” (189). What she means is that to
                render the story of the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> in poetic narrative would be
                impossible because it absolutely resists narration. And yet, it must be told. The
                problem as Philip sees it is that the horrors of the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre resist logic and rationality, and no sense could possibly be made from a
                mere accounting of the details of the story or from listening to any one historical
                perspective. Her solution is to commit herself to the irrational because the event
                itself was irrational. Only by “not-telling,” then, can the story be told. The
                “not-telling” involves fragmenting the story told by the law and letting the noise
                in the legal archive come through <hi rend="italic">as noise</hi> instead of as
                potentially meaningful silence. Because Philip is not interested in a single voice
                or testimony (as Cowper and More are), I ask my students to consider what the
                fragmentation of language accomplishes that a ballad narrative cannot. Ultimately, I
                am interested in what kinds of justice, poetic or otherwise, emerge in each of these
                poems and what obstacles lie in the way of that justice.</p>
                        
            <p>Aside from assigning the first section of Philip’s collection, called “Os,” I also
                ask my students to read her essay “Notanda,” as well as Lord Mansfield’s brief
                decision in <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>, both of which are included at
                the end of Philip’s collection. The form that noise takes in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> is the violent disordering of legal language: “I murder the text,
                literally cut it into pieces, castrating verbs, suffocating adjectives, murdering
                nouns, throwing articles, prepositions, conjunctions overboard, jettisoning adverbs:
                . . . [I] create semantic mayhem,” she writes (193). The poems reconstructed from
                this mutilated language are spare and wild word arrangements on the page, liberated
                entirely from the restrictions of grammar and form. They can be read horizontally,
                vertically, and diagonally, either from top to bottom or the reverse. The thoughts
                and ideas that the word arrangements generate are not only specters of the
                transatlantic slave trade, they are also the dark matter of the law. If the law
                employs language to create order and meaning in the realm of human action, poetry
                can, Philip suggests, “engage language that is neither rational, logical,
                predictable, or ordered” (197). By subverting the legal language of
                <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert </hi>in an act of poetic
                violence, Philip conjures the shadows surrounding the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre to access the human sounds obscured by the trial: “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> bears witness to the ‘resurfacing of the drowned and the oppressed’
                and transforms the desiccated legal report into a cacophony of voices—wails, cries,
                moans, and shouts that had earlier been banned from the text” (203). Unlike the
                singular voices constructed in the abolition ballads by Cowper and More, Philip’s
                voices are plural, fragmented, and just barely articulate. They do not tell a story
                as those ballads do; instead, they echo the senselessness of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre in language that never really settles into a coherent
                account. Philip’s poems are thus fragments of voices that bubble up to the surface
                from the sea of history.</p>
                        
            <p>Because Philip’s poems begin from a place of abstraction, they pose many interpretive
                challenges for scholars and students alike. As spare word arrangements floating on
                the white page, Philip’s text encourages a kind of reading that breaks free from
                tradition. Instead of following a narrative thread, or even one channel of abstract
                thought along a single verse, the language of the poem surfaces at random as ideas,
                images, and concepts catch the reader’s attention. There is no order or story to
                discern in the poems—only fragments of voice and thought rescued from the
                restrictive legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. While the
                poems are challenging in their abstraction, they also present teachers with a rich
                opportunity for conversation in the classroom. Breaking the class into small groups,
                each of which spends time with one poem, can be especially productive. The groups
                might spend ten or fifteen minutes lingering with one poem and taking notes.
                Students make a collective list of the words, phrases, statements, or ideas that
                come through the language on the page. Each group then considers and discusses what
                the poem wants the reader to receive. After the exercise, we come back together as a
                class and project each poem on the screen, one at a time, for everyone to see.
                Individual groups review their notes with the class and report on what the poem
                spoke to them.</p>
                        
            <p>Before each group reports back to the whole class, I like to revisit Philip’s journal
                entry from July 12, 2002, which she includes in “Notanda.” Reading this entry
                informs our understanding of the element of haunting involved in Philip’s process of
                composition, which complicates my students’ sense of poetic agency:

                    eyes skimming the text for phrases, words, feelings, as one would cast one’s

            This journal entry describes a conjuring. Philip’s process recalls a form of lyric
                possession described by Susan Stewart, but one that is markedly different as well.
                While the possession Stewart describes involves submitting one’s will to convention
                and to the irrationality of tune and meter, Philip is not plugging into the poetic
                tradition of the balladeer. She has a much more difficult task—to listen to the
                noise beyond the medium of the law for the voices silenced by the law, as if she
                were listening to voices under water. Philip burns incense, prepares herself for a
                visitation, and allows the words to “suggest how to work with them.” In listening
                for this kind of noise, Philip becomes a scribe for a story that can’t be told.
                Moreover, by submitting herself to ritual practice—burning incense—while listening
                to the British legal texts for the words to “leap out” at her, Philip’s process
                recalls the conjuring involved in obeah incantation. What makes this ritual unique,
                however, is its application of spiritual conjuring to the interpretation of British
                law. In this context, as an Afro-Canadian poet, Philip mediates the hauntological
                much like Cowper or More. It might be productive during this exercise to introduce
                Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation,” which adopts the ode form to frame a Black obi
                voice, to underscore the radical significance of Philip’s approach. While Shepherd’s
                poem does capture the voice of Black colonial resistance, that voice is clearly
                bound by a white Western formal poetics. In Philip’s poems, however, Black voices
                are conjured and allowed to float freely on the page to make their own kind of
                noise, resisting the demands of a unified and coherent Western lyric subjectivity.
                This approach does justice to the historical denial of testimony by enslaved Black
                peoples in the discourse of the law while offering them a different kind of
                testimony, one that falls short of political voice but transcends legal silence.</p>
                        
            <p>What students may realize during their own reading experience is that it resembles
                Philip’s process of composition. That is, just as the words suggested their own
                arrangement to the poet, they also offer up bits of meaning in dynamic
                configurations in the process of reading. Moreover, students may observe that the
                poems do not only echo slave voices crying out but also offer up concepts from the
                legal texts that are up for critique or condemnation. Such configurations, when
                framed by the blinding whiteness of the page, arouse a horror that would be
                difficult to recognize if embedded in the original context. The work of making noise
                available to readers, Philip seems to suggest, sometimes involves dialing down the
                message of most of the original document(s) to make more audible those parts that we
                should linger on.</p>
                        
            <p>After each group presents their reflections to the class, I ask my students to
                critique Philip’s project and her creative/destructive dialogue between poetry and
                the law. I ask them what poetic justice means in a project like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> Does it matter that there is no single voice, or testimony, or point
                of view? Does abstraction get in the way of the story that “can’t be told”? I also
                ask them to compare the kinds of justice achieved by Cowper and More in their
                antislavery ballads. Those poems are unified voices and narratives and communicate a
                message that is intelligible and digestible for readers. Moreover, they allow the
                reader to engage in (or at least perform) acts of sympathy with the speakers in the
                poems. At the same time, they feature other voices (the sailors in Glover’s song) by
                way of music—is sympathy possible there? Or is music so subliminal that it bypasses
                sympathy? The most important question to ask about <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is
                whether sympathy is possible in such fragmented language. If sympathy can’t be
                generated, what is achieved by Philip? Whatever it is, is it more powerful than
                sympathy? If so, why?</p>
                        
            <p>One of the memorable classroom conversations that has emerged from this series of
                questions is one about the similarities between sympathy and haunting. If, as Adam
                Smith famously theorized, sympathy is a projective mechanism whereby we imagine
                ourselves in the place of the other, it is by its very nature a kind of possession.
                In Cowper’s and More’s poems, the performance of sympathy in connecting to the
                enslaved African experience may seem like haunting, but it may also be read as
                another form of colonization in which English sensibilities inhabit the bodies of
                others. At the same time, their use of Glover’s tune reminds us how unavoidably
                intertwined our histories are in a colonial narrative. In Philip’s project, however,
                haunting could never function as sympathy, for sympathy requires a coherent
                narrative or representation with which to identify. How do we connect to a story
                that can’t be told? The <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> poems facilitate a haunting in
                the reading experience that does not require the exchange of subjectivity we find in
                sympathy. We could never, after all, embody the experience of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre. Instead of hearing voices or testimonies from the sea of
                history, we can only listen to noise. Being attentive to that noise offers us,
                according to Philip, a more expansive ethical relationship to our traumatic
                past.</p>

            <head>IV. Visual Noise</head>
                        
            <p>As a final exercise, one may introduce a group reflection devoted to visual noise by
                examining the political cartoon presented in Glover’s broadside alongside J. M. W.
                Turner’s famous painting <hi rend="italic">The Slave Ship</hi> (1840), which Ian
                Baucom considers at length in his landmark study, <hi rend="italic">Specters of the
                    Atlantic</hi> (2005). Both images capture melancholy scenes in Britain’s
                maritime history, and both are commentaries on empire. Moreover, they are both
                haunting seascapes that conjure the dead from below the water’s surface. Perhaps the
                most significant difference, however, is the representation of the dead. While
                Glover’s broadside gives clear individuality and outline to the spirits of the
                sailors who perished during Hosier’s blockade of Porto Bello, Turner’s drowned
                slaves dissolve in the sea. Pictorially, the slaves in Turner’s picture lack
                distinction, and the eye must strain to identify individual persons in the obscure
                detailing in the painting. Turner could have chosen to capture a scene of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong</hi>’s slaves being thrown overboard, as his original title
                suggests, but he chose instead to eliminate identifiable human bodies from his work
                altogether. Human life is hauntingly signaled by red and orange color in the
                    water.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Baucom writes, “Turner . . . manages both to acknowledge the unevenness
                            of time, to admit the uncanny, repetitive presentness of the past within
                            the present, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to smooth time out, to contain
                            the massacre within ‘past’ time by appearing to enjoin a choice between
                            the past and an emergent, modernized present while indicating that there
                            really is no choice, only an occasion for disinterested sympathy and a
                            decent burial (of the dead, of the slave trade) that the living might
                            live on unhaunted by these specters of the Atlantic”

            <p>What does it mean, one could ask the class, that the sailors of Hosier’s expedition
                receive individuality and voice as they address the victorious Admiral Vernon, who
                triumphantly captures Porto Bello with ships that proudly display the flag of
                Britannia? And what does it mean that in Turner’s painting the slaves thrown
                overboard become one with the sea in a horrifying, swelling tide of color and light?
                What is the power of Turner’s decision to abstract the human bodies in the water
                beyond recognition? After a conversation about this pictorial distinction, one could
                observe that these two images strikingly reflect the differences in representation
                we find between the abolition ballads by Cowper and More and Philip’s fragmented
                voices in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> In the latter, there is no lyric voice or
                identity to be distinguished in the text, only traces of subjectivity floating on
                the page. Visually, Turner found abstraction to be appropriate for an event so
                lacking in humanity. Why is that? While a clear picture of the atrocity is
                unavailable to us in Turner’s painting, the vibrant fragments in the water certainly
                come through as an alarming form of noise.</p>
