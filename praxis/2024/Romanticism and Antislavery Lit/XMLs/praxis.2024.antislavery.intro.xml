                <p>
                    Urgent questions remain regarding what it means to teach anti-slavery and abolitionist texts in the current moment, 
                    despite the field of Romanticism’s reassessment of its complicity in and resistance to Atlantic slavery and its global repercussions. 
                    The introduction offers some context for the 2018 roundtable on teaching Romantic abolitionist and anti-slavery literatures amidst the 
                    Black Lives Matter movement that gave rise to this essay collection. In Romanticism and Anti-Slavery Literatures: Pedagogies and Contexts, 
                    Patricia Mathew, Ivan Ortiz, Elizabeth Fay, Sean Gordon, Frances Botkin, and Nicholas Blaisdell explore various approaches to teaching 
                    abolitionist and anti-slavery literature of the long nineteenth century, and directly describe their experiences in the classroom with a 
                    series of case studies. Many of them argue that it is not enough to teach abolitionist texts from the period without also engaging contemporary 
                    perspectives on the legacies of slavery. Others articulate linkages that connect their teaching praxis with histories of resistance and 
                    liberation, even as they also seek to problematize this linkage. Drawing of the work of scholars such as Simon Gikandi, Edward Said, and 
                    Fernando Ortíz, the editors offer a meditation on 'contrapuntal reading' as theoretical framework that further elucidates what the contributors 
                    collectively achieve. The responses by Alan Richardson and Debbie Lee consider this intervention within the larger pedagogical conversation of 
                    the last thirty years and the directions of inquiry it suggests for scholars and teachers.

              <p> Many crucial developments have emerged in the field of Romanticism since the
                2018 roundtable event on "Romantic Abolition Literatures: Pedagogies and Contexts" that prompted this collection.<note place="foot" resp="author"> We must acknowledge, in fairness
                            to our contributors, that the collection was in stasis while the <hi
                                rend="italic">Romantic Circles</hi> website was rebuilt and
                            concurrent projects were under way. Although some contributors have
                            added references to more recent work for the purpose of citational
                            justice, the majority of these essays were drafted in 2019 and
                        2020.</note> One particularly salient example of this
                field-changing work is the series “Race, Blackness, and Romanticism: Dialogues,”
                cosponsored in spring 2021 by the Boston Area Romanticist Colloquium and the
                University at Buffalo, hosted by Patricia A. Matthew, one of the contributors to
                this volume.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                                Pedagogy as Ethical

                Yet many questions remain about how to recalibrate classroom praxis in light of
                urgent historical events.</p>
                
            <p>To the degree that the essays gathered here posit contrapuntal strategies in the
                teaching and reading of the archive of Romanticism and its multiple relations to
                slavery and to abolitionist and antislavery literatures, they are expanding the turn
                to contrapuntal reading, a method that Fernando Ortiz, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el azúcar</hi> (1940), and Edward Said, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Culture and Imperialism</hi> (1993), advanced independently of
                each other. In turn, this approach has influenced the work of writers like the Cuban
                novelist Alejo Carpentier as well as critics such as Mary Louise Pratt and Simon
                Gikandi. In <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the Culture of Taste</hi>
                (2011), Gikandi uses contrapuntal
                reading to advance epistemologies and pedagogies that pluralize received hierarchies
                of knowledge and decenter the hegemony of an archive and its exclusionary categories—an approach to which
                our contributors are also committed.</p>
                
            <p>In the Anglo-American academy, scholars and students may be familiar with how Said
                theorizes the importance of reading “not univocally but <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrapuntally</hi>, with a simultaneous awareness both of the metropolitan
                history that is narrated and of those other histories against which (and together
                with which) the dominating discourse acts”
                (<hi rend="italic">Culture and Imperialism</hi>51). Drawing on music to
                describe a way of reading novels such as Jane Austen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> (1814), he writes:
                
            <quote>In the counterpoint of Western classical music, various themes play off one another,
                with only a provisional privilege being given to any particular one; yet in the
                resulting polyphony there is concert and order, an organized interplay that derives
                from the themes, not from a rigorous melodic or formal principle outside the work.
                In the same way, I believe, we can read and interpret English novels, for example,
                whose engagement (usually suppressed for the most part) with the West Indies or
                India, say, is shaped and perhaps even determined by the specific history of
                colonization, resistance, and finally native nationalism. (51)</quote>
                
            While Said’s archive was “English novels,” Ortiz applied <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrapunteo</hi> in his anthropological analysis of sugar and tobacco (written
                roughly fifty years prior to Said’s work) and coined the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >transculturación</hi> (transculturation) by now familiar to critics through the
                work of Pratt. It should be noted that Ortiz and his generation, which included
                Lydia Cabrera, the renowned scholar of <hi rend="italic">santería</hi>, and
                Carpentier, who turned to the Haitian Revolution for inspiration, embarked on a
                reassessment of the contributions of Afro-Cuban and African cultures to Cuban
                identity. Counterpoint becomes both metaphor and method for Ortiz, who emphasizes
                the musical roots of the contrapuntal while he underscores the Afro-Cuban
                experience, one that incorporates both music <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the orality
                of verse in call-and-response rituals between griot and audience. He writes,
                “Recordemos en Cuba sus manifestaciones más floridas en las preces antifonarias de
                las liturgias, así de blancos como de negros, en la controversia erótica y danzarina
                de la rumba, y en los contrapunteos versificados de la guajirada montuna y de la
                currería afrocubana” (Let us remember the elaborate manifestations [of counterpoint]
                in Cuba, in the antiphonal liturgies of Blacks and whites, in the controversial
                erotics of the movement of the rumba, and in the versified counterpoints of country
                and Afro-Cuban peoples) (18).</p>
                
            <p>In his novel about the Haitian Revolution, <hi rend="italic">El siglo de las
                    luces</hi> (1962), Carpentier develops the aesthetics of the “arbitrario
                contrapunto de vidas” (the arbitrary counterpoint of lives) by considering the
                different, yet simultaneous, unfolding destinies of his protagonists, which shape
                and impact individual spheres of action as well as the grand récit of history (47).
                Carpentier later extends this idea in “Lo barroco y lo real maravilloso,” his essay
                about the marvelous real, where he again returns to the Haitian Revolution, Henri
                Christophe’s opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte, and François Mackandal, “que hace
                creer a millares y millares de esclavos en Haití . . . que puede transformarse en lo
                que quiera, y promueve con ellos una de las primeras revoluciones auténticas del
                Nuevo Mundo” (who convinces thousands and thousands of slaves in Haiti . . . that he
                can turn into anything, and promotes with them one of the first authentic
                revolutions of the New World) (84).</p>
                
            <p>Gikandi further develops the contrapuntal method when he applies it to reading the
                archive of Atlantic slavery and antislavery in <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the
                    Culture of Taste</hi> (2011) (xiii). He synchronizes the spatial, temporal,
                and interior dimensions of the lives of subjects as apparently disconnected as
                diarist Anna Larpent and Nealee, the enslaved woman in Mungo Park’s narrative. In
                other chapters, he considers texts by Francis Williams, David Hume, and Olaudah
                Equiano, and by Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Beckford, and Thomas Jefferson
                (among others) in contrapuntal relationship to each other. Gikandi accounts for how
                “the criteria driving the aesthetic ideology in the eighteenth century—disinterest
                and virtue, among others—had come to be haunted by slavery” (144). The effect of
                this more deliberate counterpoint, he observes, is to ensure “a dialectic between
                the visible subjects of modernity and its invisible actors” (70). Exegesis as an act
                of resistance exposes the symbolic systems that mediate materiality, disturbing the
                cognitive and symbolic separations between the violent system of the plantation,
                secured through empire, and the well-wrought tea set of the drawing room. Thus, it
                holds actors accountable for their complicity with such violence.</p>
                
            <p>The oral call-and-response underlying contrapuntal reading moreover gestures to this
                collection’s origins in a roundtable conversation on “Anti-Slavery Literature, Its
                Legacies, and the Future of Teaching,” organized in 2018 by members of the Five
                College Faculty Seminar on Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The Global
                            Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century seminar was founded in 2012 by
                            Joselyn M. Almeida (then UMass Amherst), Gülru Çakmak (University of
                            Massachusetts Amherst) and Kate Singer (Mount Holyoke College). Daniel
                            Block (then Hampshire College), later became a co-organizer. By 2018 it was
                            being led by Almeida, Singer, Lily Gurton-Wachter (Smith College), and
                            Amelia Worsley (Amherst College). The seminar was conceived as a venue
                            in which faculty from five colleges in the Amherst area of western
                            Massachusetts could collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of
                            scholars attentive to the intersections and tensions among the
                            constellations of globalization, cosmopolitanism, migration, and border
                            studies in the nineteenth century. Over the years, faculty from the Five
                            Colleges have met to share their work in progress and have also hosted
                            lectures from colleagues from the surrounding area, which have
                            illuminated the multiple intersections and tensions of colonialism and
                            globalization, Atlantic slavery, cosmopolitanism, migration, border
                            studies, and the digital humanities. Our conversation at the panel in
                            2018 was shaped by seminars with Simon Gikandi, Manu Samriti Chander,
                            Grégory Pierrot, Laura Doyle, Ron Welburn, Roberto Márquez, Orrin Wang,
                            Joel Pace, Elizabeth Maddock Dillon, and Jared Hickman. Because of
                            funding limitations, our invitations were restricted to colleagues
                            located on the East Coast of the United States, or those traveling
                            through the area. The 2018 pedagogy roundtable, held at Mount Holyoke
                                College, built on these shared experiences
                            and emerged from the community that these previous discussions had
                            created. </note> At that moment in time, many of us had been
                negotiating classroom conversations to which students brought issues raised by the
                Black Lives Matter movement. In dialogue with Kate Singer and Lily Gurton-Wachter,
                co-organizers of the seminar, we resolved to bring together four scholars of race
                and literature—Frances Botkin, Kimberly Juanita Brown, Sean Gordon, and Patricia A.
                Matthew—to create a safe and respectful space in which faculty and graduate student
                instructors could engage in dialogue with each other about how they were currently
                teaching antislavery texts from the Romantic period and how we might imagine
                teaching them in the future. Two of our speakers were local, and two traveled from
                different East Coast locations to be with us. The roundtable was transatlantic in
                disciplinary scope, with scholars representing Caribbean, American, and British
                literatures. In our invitation, we simply asked our colleagues to speak about
                approaches to teaching eighteenth- or nineteenth-century antislavery literature in
                the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. We asked them to share some moments
                from their own recent experiences in the classroom as well as their subsequent
                reflections on them. We stressed that the emphasis would be on conversation with the
                audience, whom we imagined would also find it useful to have a space to share their
                thoughts on classroom experience.</p>
                
            <p>An unusually large audience was in attendance at the pedagogy panel in the spring of
                2018; it was clear that this subject was of interest to students at both the
                graduate and undergraduate level, as well as to faculty members who more usually
                made up the audience of the Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century
                    seminar. Several different pedagogical
                approaches were offered, but the panelists all shared a desire to confront the
                violence contained in these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts and the
                silences of the past and to share epistemologies of social justice, speaking to the
                present with the future in mind. Though the speakers approached the task of teaching
                different antislavery texts with different methodologies, each of them gave us an
                insight into classrooms where students are frequently invited to think about how to
                connect the past with the present moment. As our panelists discussed a range of
                approaches to teaching antislavery texts, the question of affect was clearly a
                central concern, as it had been in the discussion that led to the event. Students
                often have questions about the violence that these texts present them with, and, in
                turn, professors and instructors participating in the event had many questions for
                each other about how to frame that act of presentation. How should one prepare
                students for the affective responses—the emotions and feelings—that such triggering
                material is bound to bring into the room? How might we make space for conversation
                in the classroom about the various ways students might encounter antislavery
                literatures because of the varied experiences they bring to these texts? How do we
                support students through challenging readings beyond giving content warnings or
                making the readings optional?</p>
                
            <p>Several important questions about what it means to teach antislavery literature in
                the context of courses on Romanticism also emerged that day. As Saidiya Hartman asks
                in her 2008 essay “Venus in Two Acts,” where the archive is lacking, how can we
                retrieve “what remains dormant . . . without committing further acts of violence” in
                our own acts of narration (2)? Kimberly Juanita Brown played music over her own
                speech as she discussed the power of African American spirituals to invite students
                to connect to the “auditory dimensions” of the archive, a concept she also explores
                in her book
                <hi rend="italic">The Repeating Body: Slavery’s Visual Resonance in the Contemporary </hi>(2015)
                (140). Indeed, many of our panelists asked us to attune their ears to detect
                multilayered channels of communication in antislavery texts. A central theme in our
                discussion was the question of how to bring to light the things that the texts do
                not say about the realities of slavery in the period, either because of the blind
                spots of the authors or because of the constraints placed upon them.</p>
                
            <p>The essays that follow record various answers to these collective questions, and
                although they arose out of in-person conversations we had in a particular time and
                place, we hope they will continue to have relevance to a wider audience in the
                present moment. Three of the original speakers at the panel (Frances Botkin, Sean
                Gordon, and Patricia A. Matthew) have contributed essays. Although Kimberly Juanita
                Brown was not able to engage in this iteration of the conversation, the impact of
                her contributions to the panel nonetheless remains. We have also purposely included
                essays by participants who were at different stages in their university careers at
                the time of the event: Sean Gordon was a graduate student at the University of
                Massachusetts Amherst at the time of his original contribution to the panel, and he
                is now a professor at Fresno State University. Nick Blaisdell, now Ed.D., was an
                undergraduate when he attended our seminar. By inviting other participants to join
                the conversation about pedagogy via the medium of print, we gesture toward the
                shared frame of reference that the Global Cultures seminar had produced when we met
                in person. Ivan Ortiz and Elizabeth Fay, who had also spoken in our series,
                graciously accepted our invitation. We are also grateful to Debbie Lee and Alan
                Richardson for agreeing to offer responses to the essays. Two decades after they
                worked together on
                <hi rend="italic">Early Black British Writing </hi>(2004), Lee
                and Richardson offer a retrospective view not only of the shared insights of this
                collection but also of the changes that have occurred in the field since their
                groundbreaking critical anthology appeared.</p>

            <p>It has been intriguing for us to see that our contributors arrived at a shared
                methodology regarding how to approach teaching antislavery literatures today
                organically without a prompt from us and without reading drafts of one another’s
                essays. Each of them reframes and resituates eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                texts in new constellations, not only in relation to each other and to art and
                aesthetics from the period, but also in relation to texts from Black studies and to
                twentieth- and twenty-first-century works of fiction and criticism that
                seek to address the silences of the past. By asking students to
                listen to what remains unsaid in the texts they examine, several authors implicitly
                convey their commitments to contrapuntal reading.</p>
                
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew draws attention to how her students themselves implicitly enacted
                a contrapuntal method when they responded to the suppressed context of William
                Blake’s poem “The Little Black Boy.” Her essay presents a retrospective account of
                how this moment offered an invitation to continue to explore, in several different
                settings (both undergraduate and graduate), the effects of centering the topic of
                race and slavery in the classroom. Matthew invites makers of syllabi to look beyond
                the question of which single texts to use in a self-contained “unit” of a syllabus
                on slavery and instead to imagine how Romanticism looks when one centers race,
                abolition, and freedom on the level of the syllabus as a whole. She criticizes the
                idea that one can just add a single text about slavery to a syllabus and expect that
                the topic has been covered, as if a Romantic literature syllabus is a familiar
                recipe to which one can simply add a new ingredient. Rather than focusing a
                discussion about Atlantic slavery on a single text in a syllabus, Matthew argues, it
                should be considered a relevant context in discussions of all Romantic texts, even
                in texts where it seems not to be present. Matthew describes two different courses
                that center antislavery literatures and texts about race, including detailed
                discussions of teaching Blake’s poem, Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The
                Sorrows of Yamba,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,”
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” and the anonymous novel
                    <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</hi> (1808).</p>
                
            <p>Ivan Ortiz’s method can also be called contrapuntal from several perspectives. Ortiz
                puts Said’s argument about the silences in Austen’s <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Park</hi> in dialogue with Lynn Festa’s argument that Austen is also asking
                readers to listen for “noise.” Ortiz begins by explaining how he uses this principle
                of “listening for noise” as a method to teach abolition poetry written by white
                authors. He positions this poetry in counterpoint with music when he asks students
                to examine the complexity of a situation in which both More’s version of “The
                Sorrows of Yamba” and William Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” were sung to the
                well-known ballad “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” a tune about white English sailors who
                had died at sea. He then turns to a text that could itself be called contrapuntal,
                M. NourbeSe Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> (2008), which is “composed
                entirely from the words of the case report <hi rend="italic">Gregson vs.
                    Gilbert,</hi> related to the murder of Africans on board a slave ship at the end
                of the eighteenth century. <note place="foot" resp="author"> Description taken from <ref
                                target="http://www.nourbese.com/poetry/zong-3"
                                >www.nourbese.com/poetry/zong-3</ref>.</note> As students
                center their attention on the silences that this text exposes, Ortiz writes, they
                are confronted with the question of “what the fragmentation of language accomplishes
                that a ballad narrative cannot.”</p>
                
            <p>Sean Gordon extends the contrapuntal method beyond the frame of synchronicity to ask
                how twentieth-century narratives might also inform students’ understandings of
                nineteenth-century testimonies. He describes the project of “teaching contemporary
                texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a ‘speculative’ framework,” like Celu
                Amberstone’s “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s
                <hi rend="italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </hi>(1995), and
                Samuel Delany’s <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>(1966), in
                relation to
                <hi rend="italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano </hi>(1789).
                To frame his discussion of what it meant to discuss these texts on a campus
                responding to a series of violently racist incidents in 2014, Gordon centers Fred
                Moten’s term “dehiscence,” which describes a form of structural vulnerability that
                allows for productive disordering, as well as the Afropessimism of Frank Wilderson,
                pointing toward another speculative future, one in which a conversation between
                scholars of Black studies and scholars of Romanticism will become more common. He
                also discusses how teaching Mat Johnson’s novel
                <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>(2011) in dialogue with Edgar Allan
                Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi> (1838) allowed students
                to think through the issue of how structures of white privilege are implicit not
                only in the archive but also in the university itself.</p>
                
            <p>Afrofuturism provides a site of conceptual resistance in several of the essays here.
                As Terence Dean and Dale P. Andrews explain, “Afrofuturism is an evolving field of
                study in Black cultural studies. Its theories and scholarship are heavily influenced
                with particularities in science fiction, speculative fiction, new media, digital
                technology, the arts, and Black aesthetics all situated and focused on the continent
                of Africa, the Diaspora, and its imaginaries” (2). Through her syllabus and
                classroom discussion, Elizabeth Fay stages an innovative conversation between
                Afrofuturism, Romanticism, and Atlantic studies and challenges students to
                reinterpret Atlantic history by juxtaposing past and present narratives of the
                legacies of enslavement. When Fay asks students to compare Olaudah Equiano’s
                narrative with the film
                <hi rend="italic">Black Panther </hi>(2018) and contextualizes
                this question in relation to N. K. Jemisin’s introduction to Afrofuturism in her
                essay “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” she extends the possibilities for the
                interpretation of “geographical space, conceptual space, and textual space” in Black
                Atlantic narratives (Dillon 31).</p>
                
            <p>In the broader sweep of her essay, Fay emphasizes “the fluid movement of dynamic
                relationality among multiple and variable subjects” as she explores various
                exercises designed to ask students to triangulate narratives of enslavement and
                post-enslavement. For instance, Fay invites students to consider how Mary Prince’s
                nineteenth-century rhetorics of suffering and resistance compare with those of
                Equiano, and then she further complicates the question by asking them to read the
                rhetoric of Toussaint L’Ouverture’s letters in relation to C. L. R. James’s account
                of his life in <hi rend="italic">The Black Jacobins</hi> (1938). Sylvia Wynter’s
                article on James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,” also offers
                students an argument about how James’s work helps to posit a theory of “becoming
                Black” that, in Fay’s words, is relevant “whether the year is 1800 or 2024.” In
                another unit of the syllabus, Fay triangulates Lenora Sansay’s
                <hi rend="italic">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo </hi>(1808)
                and the anonymous
                <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </hi>with
                Austen’s <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, as she asks students to compare
                fictionalized accounts of women’s experiences in the period, and she further
                contextualizes this exercise with references to the work of Christina Sharpe and
                Wynter.</p>
                
            <p>Frances Botkin also offers many possibilities for students to read contrapuntally
                when she insists that Romantic-era narratives cannot be taught without a serious
                commitment to contextualization. Through a theorization of the practice of <hi
                    rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi> (“to make the best use of available resources to
                create something new and sustainable”), Botkin uses what she terms an “undisciplined
                mode of assembly” to consider the value of generative improvisation in teaching, and
                she explores how contemporary art, film, music, and recordings of interviews with
                people in Jamaica “animate colonial textuality with the creative expressions of
                Afro-Caribbean culture that, in revising the past, imagines and nourishes future
                worlds.” She describes, for instance, how she presents students with Lydia Maria
                Child’s
                <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam </hi>(1834)
                (extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Five Years
                    Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> [1796]), alongside John
                Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</hi> (1800), a
                painting of Three-Fingered Jack by the Jamaican painter Omari “Afrikan” Ra, and a
                documentary film by Roy Anderson called
                <hi rend="italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </hi>(2015).
                This constellation of works allows students to see how “Child almost entirely
                excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections.” When she asks
                students to read Mary Prince’s
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave </hi>(1831)
                alongside Marlon James’s <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> (2009), she
                puts further pressure on the question of what nineteenth-century writers do not say
                about the experiences of enslaved people and particularly of enslaved women.</p>
                
            <p>Another way in which the dialogic space can be transformed to create an antiracist
                classroom is through the acknowledgment of the tension between writing and speech,
                foregrounding for students the incomplete nature of the antislavery archive. In her
                focus on “doing the work” of traveling to Jamaica in order to better understand
                Maroon history, Botkin centers the notion of orality in order to problematize the
                hierarchy of knowledge that privileges the archive. Her fieldwork and connection to
                the Maroon leader Gaama Gloria Simms has enabled her to create a contact zone in the
                classroom where the oral histories of Afro-Caribbean descendants of Maroon
                communities expose asymmetries of power and the injustices encoded as silence in the
                written record. The annual conference in Jamaica that she co-organizes with Paul
                Youngquist, the Charles Town International Conference on Maroons and Indigenous
                People, reconfigures the spaces and possibilities of knowledge for Romanticists,
                which brings the “archive” into conversation with living indigenous knowledge.</p>
                
            <p>Nicholas Blaisdell elucidates how counterpoint as exegesis awakens agency, as
                Carpentier also discovered in <hi rend="italic">El siglo de las luces</hi>, when
                Sofía, one of his protagonists, urges, “¡Hay que hacer algo!” (Something must be
                done!) (410). Blaisdell explores how antislavery writers like Ottobah Cugoano indict
                capitalism’s use of enslaved labor in the nineteenth century as a global system,
                anticipating the system’s accommodation of unfree labor through the present era.
                Drawing on Paulo Freire, he reflects on how the study of antislavery texts,
                abolitionist networks, and Karl Marx informed not only his development as a social
                justice activist and organizer of Black Lives Matter protests in Peabody,
                Massachusetts, but also his work as a high school teacher and an adjunct professor
                of education. His analysis illuminates how a Freirean pedagogy can translate into
                greater empowerment for students in educational and civic settings.</p>

            <head>II. Beyond the Anthology</head>
                
            <p>A brief review of the texts available for teaching the topic of antislavery
                literature, as well as the history of its anthologizing, may be useful to those
                planning to embark on teaching it for the first time, as well as to those wishing to
                think further about the relationship between how developments in research relate to
                those in their own pedagogy. Indeed, the current moment necessitates a commitment to
                the continued and critical self-examination of genealogies of antislavery
                literature. Scholars have long been engaged in the struggle to bring this material
                into classrooms. Thus, for example, Eva B. Dykes, whose work, as Bakary Diaby has
                pointed out, should be reassessed, was the earliest critic to call for an expansion
                of the Romantic canon to include antislavery writings (Diaby, “Black Women”).
                Dykes’s groundbreaking
                <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought; or, A Study of Sympathy for the Oppressed </hi>(1942),
                written in the twilight of the Harlem Renaissance and also at the height of Jim Crow
                segregation in the United States, drew attention to names such as Olaudah Equiano,
                Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Mary Prince, writers not yet present in any
                anthologies of Romantic-era literature at the time. The reassessment of Dykes’s work
                seems particularly necessary when one notes that a forty-year silence passed between
                the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</hi> in
                1942 and 1985, when Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates Jr. published their
                pivotal anthology
                <hi rend="italic">The Slave’s Narrative </hi>(1985), which
                presented excerpts by Equiano, Cugoano, Sancho, and James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw,
                among others.</p>
                
            <p>It was not until the 1990s that access to antislavery literature became more
                widespread. Inspired by both the historicist and postcolonial turns in Romantic-era
                scholarship, scholars in the United States and Britain worked to incorporate Black
                Atlantic authors into the Anglo-American canon throughout this period.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Romantic

                poems available on the web. Anne K. Mellor and Richard Matlak were the first editors
                of a broader anthology to grant a section to “Slavery, the Slave Trade, and
                Abolition in Britain” when they included it in their <hi rend="italic">British
                    Literature, 1780–1830</hi> (1996).</p>
                
            <p>The scholarly recovery of Romanticism’s implication in antislavery and the struggle
                for abolition was also enormously facilitated by the publication of Peter J. Kitson
                and Debbie Lee’s eight-volume <hi rend="italic">Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation:
                    Writings in the British Romantic Period</hi> (1999). Following from this,
                collections such as James G. Basker’s <hi rend="italic">Amazing Grace: An Anthology
                    of Poems about Slavery, 1660–1810</hi> (2002), Marcus Wood’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Poetry of Slavery: An Anglo-American Anthology, 1764–1866 </hi>(2003),
                    <hi rend="italic">Early Black British Writing</hi> (2004), edited by Alan
                Richardson and Debbie Lee, and <hi rend="italic">Transatlantic Romanticism</hi>
                (2006), edited by Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and Chris Koenig-Woodward, also made
                antislavery texts more accessible than they had previously been. The republication
                of various novels that pertain to this topic has similarly changed students’
                classroom experiences. For instance, many of our colleagues now use the Broadview
                Press edition of the anonymous <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</hi>
                (2008), edited by Lyndon J. Dominique. Since it is not possible to anthologize
                novels in the same way as other texts, A. A. Markley’s overview of lesser-taught
                novels and plays is a useful resource for those wishing to teach novels that deal
                with the topic of slavery.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For instance,
                        Markley suggests that Anna Maria Mackenzie’s <hi rend="italic">Slavery; or,

                aesthetics of the period has also led to an increased access to primary texts for
                use in the classroom. We note, for example, the publication of Marcus Rainsford’s

                of the scholarly literature in this period, we note that our respondents, Debbie Lee
                and Alan Richardson, not only played key scholarly roles in producing anthologies of
                these literatures but also helped to define the critical
                conversation. Richardson’s
                seminal 1993 article “Romantic Voodoo: Obeah and British Culture, 1797–1807” opened the field to Afro-British intertexts in the
                archive, those within textuality and beyond. Lee’s <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the
                    Romantic Imagination</hi> (2002) is a fundamental text in any survey of this
                corpus.</p>
                
            <p>Having said all of this, it is important to acknowledge that course syllabi have been
                in many cases slow to change—both during the 1990s and today. Zadie Smith and
                Paterson Joseph have each described the way that their education in the United
                Kingdom failed to take account of Black history. In a September 2022 article in
                <hi rend="italic">The Guardian </hi>written in connection with
                her foreword to a new edition of Gretchen Gerzina’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Black England: A Forgotten Georgian History </hi>(2022), Smith remembers the effect that finding Gerzina’s book had
                on her. She writes, “It’s incredible to think of now, but by 1999 I’d gone through
                15 years of formal education, including a three-year English degree, without ever
                being given a book to study that made any reference whatsoever to the presence of
                individuals like me in the country in which I was born.” Joseph has also described
                his encounter with Gerzina’s book as a life-changing one (Sulcis).</p>
                
            <p>The “Bigger Six Collective” was formed in 2017 to resist the narrative that
                “diversification” or “going global” has done enough to change the field; instead,
                they have called for the need “to make our field in the image of those whose access
                to Romanticism has long been and continues to be actively restricted” (140).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the
                            collective’s origins and aims, see <ref
                                target="https://www.bigger6.com/"
                            >https://www.bigger6.com/</ref>.</note> More recently, Deanna
                Koretsky has offered a searing indictment of the field’s continuing intransigence:
                “Scholars of romanticism in its current configuration are all white men, which is to
                say, we work in a field that was not only built around white bodies and sustained
                through white critical perspectives but that has explicitly and deliberately been
                used to maintain fictions of whiteness as transparent and thus universal” (31).
                Moreover, many critiques of Romanticism remain firmly within the Anglo-American
                academy, precluding methodologies that reveal alternative positionalities and
                epistemes. Antislavery literatures—even aside from the larger and more neglected
                topic of race and Romanticism—still occupy a marginal position in the undergraduate
                curriculum.</p>
                
            <p>Despite the efforts of many scholars to join in the work of recovery and to redress
                the biases of twentieth-century criticism and editing of Romantic texts, the topic
                of slavery and abolition is still frequently framed as an addition to the
                anthologies that undergraduate classes rely on and in syllabi themselves. Digital
                searches of databases of online syllabi suggest that a handful of texts, especially
                in surveys of the period, are being asked to carry a heavy freight. Many and varied
                obstacles have been put in the way of affirming the contributions of Black and Brown
                writers from the period in the classroom. The presence of Mary Seacole and Ukawsaw
                Gronniosaw in anthologies of Black British writers, for instance, does not guarantee
                them a place on syllabi. Additionally, neither African American writers, such as
                Jupiter Hammon and John Marrant, nor Plácido and Juan Manzano, from the Hispanophone
                Atlantic, appear often on syllabi. In “Abolitionist Interruptions,” Chander and
                Matthew note their “shared frustration with how Olaudah Equiano and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> have served too long as the single
                abolitionist/antislavery text in Romanticism” (431), a discussion that Matthew
                extends in her essay for the present volume. The tradition that has elided subjects
                who historically were denied ontological value and who were silenced through
                enslavement and racism in the economic and geopolitical system of Atlantic slavery
                can still be observed today in this disconnect between research and pedagogy.</p>

            <p>The project of articulating linkages that connect the teaching praxis of Romanticists
                with histories of resistance, liberation, struggles against slavery and for the rights of the oppressed, goes far beyond the purview of a single volume, and
                so we wish to note some of the areas for pedagogical inquiry within which our
                contributors have opened vistas. We hope that the pedagogical experiments detailed
                in this collection will be useful in practical terms for instructors as a guide to
                how to begin redesigning their own syllabi and classroom discussions. The larger
                aim, however, is for the collection to be useful in broader methodological terms as
                a prompt for readers to imagine their own contrapuntal arrangements of texts and
                voices. The possibilities for new contrapuntal readings and new constellations of
                texts go far beyond the specific texts or arrangements listed in these case
                studies.</p>
                
            <p>Beyond simply adding texts to established syllabi, then, our contributors imagine how
                to disrupt pedagogical traditions that have been handed down from past generations
                of scholars. These scholars invite readers to examine the degree to which their own
                pedagogy reflects transformations in the field, even as they push for further
                re-examination of the structures on which pedagogical attitudes to teaching
                antislavery have previously been built. Our contributors tend to agree that because
                Romantic-era accounts of slavery were conditioned by the period in which they were
                written, it is “not enough,” as Frances Botkin puts it, to ask them to speak on
                behalf of the enslaved without other sources to contextualize them. Dykes poignantly
                draws attention to this paradox at the center of Romantic antislavery literature in
                the opening pages of <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</hi>.
                “One of the salient features of the ‘Romantic Movement’ of the latter eighteenth and
                early nineteenth centuries was the love of freedom” (1), she writes, paying tribute
                to Mary Prince’s famous line, “To be free is very sweet” (27). However, she then
                immediately notes that Romantic writers could also be “limited . . . by an adherence
                to traditional forms and conventions,” and notes that antislavery writings did not
                always depose the hierarchical structure and racism that authorized the triangular
                trade in the first place (1). Many scholars since Dykes have complicated any simple
                celebration of the expansion of the Romantic canon to include antislavery texts by
                exploring the capacity of these texts to sometimes “popularize stereotyped,
                simplified, patronizing, and (often) degrading images of Africa, its peoples, and
                their descendants in the Americas and Britain” despite their ethical and civic
                commitments to breaking the Blakean “mind forg’d manacles” that sustained Atlantic
                slavery (Richardson and Lee 7). The contributors to this collection build on their
                project.</p>
                
            <p>Many of our contributors use specific examples to describe a method that could be
                applied to various texts. The example Matthew gives, for instance, of what it means
                to read William Blake’s work in dialogue with antislavery literatures encourages
                pedagogues to look more closely at how canonical texts they have taught without
                reference to the history of slavery might change when this crucial and yet often
                sidelined context is brought to bear on them. Similarly, Gordon’s and Fay’s
                references to Afrofuturist texts invite readers to conduct their own research in
                this field and to imagine their own conversations between the past and speculative
                futures. Another question that emerges from this focus on Afrofuturism is whether
                there might be room for more opportunities for students to encounter examples of
                Black resistance, humor, joy, and agency in the Romantic classroom. New
                possibilities for dialogue with contemporary texts will continue to arise as new
                works of critical fabulation appear. Since we first began to gather this collection,
                for instance, many of our colleagues have begun to teach texts such as Honorée
                Fanonne Jeffers’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Age of Phillis </hi>(2020) and Joseph’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius Sancho </hi>(2022),
                alongside Wheatley Peters’s poetry and Sancho’s letters.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In the British Museum event “An
                            Era of Reclamation | Beyond Bridgerton,” also recorded online,
                            participants questioned the effects of the erasure of the history of
                            slavery. See <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_fqH2t0x1U0"

            <p>Our work on this set of essays has prompted us to imagine several future topics for
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles </hi>collections on how to
                engage antislavery literatures in the classroom, for which we would be pleased to
                see responses. While our contributors engage the question of affect in passing, for
                instance, our field would benefit from a more sustained conversation about how to
                acknowledge the range of emotions that the learning process might bring up in
                classes that consider the history of slavery. Critical work that addresses the
                personal experience of critics themselves can offer crucial models for students: we
                eagerly await the publication of Mathelinda Nabugodi’s <hi rend="italic">The
                    Trembling Hand: Reflections of a Black Woman in the Romantic Archive,</hi> for
                instance. From another perspective, both Botkin and Ortiz encourage attention to the
                aural dimension of textuality and its silences, which reveals how orality and the
                epistemologies it transmits are also major components of the antislavery archive
                that could be engaged further. Becoming aware of the limitations that govern the
                textual archive<hi rend="italic"> as text,</hi> with attention
                to the conditions of its production, will allow for the interrogation of approaches
                with which Romanticists are familiar, such as historicist, post-structuralist,
                feminist, postcolonial, and neo-formalist methodologies.</p>
                
            <p>The essays here also enjoin readers to consider important questions that remain on
                the horizon of this collection about the extent to which discussions of antislavery
                texts have been made to stand in for larger discussions about race in the Romantic
                period and how this tendency might be addressed in the future. This connects the
                work of the collection with Marlon B. Ross’s call to “shift the focus momentarily
                away from the important question of Romanticism’s self-conscious investment in or
                diversion from slavery and colonialism to consider <hi rend="italic">race</hi>
                itself as an economy of gut-instinctual, senseperceptual, socialpsychological,
                aesthetic-ideological, and geopolitical commitments,” in his essay “The Race of/in
                Romanticism: Notes Toward a Critical Race Theory” (26). As Diaby argues, “we must
                continue working on slavery, but we should not let it be our only engagement with,
                again, the deeply quotidian, socio-personal ordering of the world we inhabit and
                have inherited from the long Romantic period” (“Black Women” 252). Diaby himself
                offers a rare example of what it means to bring the topic of race to bear on texts
                that have not traditionally been grouped under the heading of those that address the
                topic of race in the Romantic period in his reading of William Wordsworth’s “We Are
                Seven” (“Counting the Bodies”). Although several of our authors encourage a more
                open dialogue between Black studies and Romanticism, a more widespread and sustained
                dialogue between Romantic literature and critical race theory is clearly necessary
                in the field at large.</p>
                
            <p>The field of Romanticism, and especially the study of slavery in the Romantic period,
                still needs to do more to address the divisions it has historically instantiated
                between Anglophone texts and texts in other languages. The Anglophone focus of the
                authors examined throughout this collection points to multilingualism and
                Romanticism as a related area for future research as the plurilingual nature of the
                histories of African and indigenous resistance comes further into view. As Gillian
                Sankoff writes, “It is difficult to conceive of another situation where people
                arrived with such a variety of native languages, where they were so cut off from
                their native language groups; where the size of no language group was enough to
                ensure its survival; where no second language was shared by enough people to serve
                as a useful vehicle of intercommunication; and where the legitimate language was
                inaccessible to almost everyone” (24).</p>
                
            <p>For some of the writers in the archive of antislavery literatures, the process of
                translation into English and language acquisition was also a process of living
                through epistemic violence. Yet the governing assumption in Romantic-era studies in
                approaching the antislavery archive is that the language of Black British authors is
                English (Almeida 114). A similar assumption governs the indigenous archive, as Hessell
                shows in
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Literature and the Colonised World: Lessons from Indigenous Translations </hi>(2018).
                Hessell argues that indigenous interpretations of canonical authors are more than
                “novelties, nor [are they] simple evidence of the global power and reach of Romantic
                literature” (228) but are “simultaneous expressions of the value of Romantic
                literature and of the experience of colonization” (230).</p>
                
            <p>While some might respond that the study of British or American literature is
                Anglocentric by nature, this commitment to monolingualism out of habit robs the
                field of depth and breadth, since the African diaspora was not limited to
                English-speaking countries. During and even after the abolition of slavery in 1833,
                Britain continued to trade with the Global South while at the same time making
                greater imperial incursions in Africa and India, as scholars such as Robin
                Blackburn, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz, Omar Miranda, César Soto, Juan Sánchez, Jesse
                Reeder, and Sara Medina Calzada have shown. Even so, texts from this “second
                slavery,” as Dale Tomich has called it, have a belated entrance into Romanticism.
                Such texts include, for example, Juan Manzano’s <hi rend="italic">The Life and Poems
                    of a Cuban Slave</hi> (1840), translated by the abolitionist Richard Robert
                Madden, who also testified in the <hi rend="italic">Amistad</hi> trial, which
                vindicated the rights of enslaved persons to rise up against their enslavers and was
                one of the most famous international trials of its time. Nicole Aljoe suggests that
                the 1848 biography of the enslaved Brazilian Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua is another
                useful starting point for those wishing to expand their students’ reference points
                beyond texts written in English (<hi rend="italic">Creole Testimonies</hi> 111).
                Aljoe also challenges “the marginal status of West Indian slave narratives within
                critical discourses of the slave narrative genre, Caribbean and Black Atlantic
                literary histories” and reveals how abolitionist groups in England, the United
                States, and the West Indies were in close contact with one another (<hi
                    rend="italic">Creole Testimonies</hi> 2).</p>
                
            <p>Moreover, monolingualism, when assumed as a “natural state,” prevents a true
                reckoning with how English functioned as a significant barrier for the millions of
                people in British colonies who were deprived of access not only to literacy but also
                to the judicial recognition of their oral testimony in colonial courts, further
                limiting access to “the legitimate language.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In 1828, the law was revised to allow “the admission of
                        the evidence of slaves, in those cases only in which they are the actors or
                        the sufferers, excluding their evidence in other cases” (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Slave Law of Jamaica</hi> 216; see also 134–7.)</note> English in
                its oral and written forms was therefore a second language for many formerly
                enslaved authors, from Wheatley Peters to Sancho and Cugoano. Acknowledging and
                considering this duality helps to decenter the assumption of the normativity of
                English and the nationalist and imperialist subtexts underpinning the idea that it
                is the language of Romanticism. Doing so disentangles it from the “metaphysical
                empires” of language that Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o denounces and that his son, critic
                Mukoma Wa Ngugi, terms “EME” as shorthand for “English Metaphysical Empire” (Wa
                Ngugi; Mignolo). As much as they are part of the standardization of languages in
                this period, the creolizations of English and other European languages in contact
                zones are also part of the Romantic aesthetic (Elfenbein). In the United States, the
                question of accessibility is compounded by the disciplinary gateway of English as
                the privileged language of the corpus, since millions of its citizens speak
                languages other than English that go unrecognized if Romanticism is configured as
                solely Anglocentric. As we reimagine community in the twenty-first century to create
                spaces of redress and also of transformation, Romanticist scholars must do more to
                invite students to imagine new contact zones not only between canonical and
                non-canonical texts and between or among disciplines but also between the past and
                the present, between history and historical fiction, between printed and living
                voices, and between linguistic communities whose ties to each other have been
                willfully and violently erased.</p>

            <p>The genre of writing we asked contributors to engage in as their arguments took
                shape—something between argumentative prose, critical history, personal narrative,
                and a practical guide—is one that we are rarely asked to engage in as academics, and
                we thank the editors of
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles </hi>for the room they have
                made within the field for this kind of reflection.<note place="foot" resp="author">We wish to thank Kirstyn Leuner, Andrew Birkett, and Anna Wingfield at 
                    <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles</hi>; Mary Bellino, our copyeditor; and the departments of English at Amherst College and UMass 
                    Amherst for supporting the completion of this project.</note> Following the work of exemplary
                scholars and educators such as Paolo Freire, Stuart Hall, bell hooks, and Edward
                Said, we are humbled by the task of approaching, alongside our contributors, the
                question of how our teaching and scholarship can contribute to the advancement of
                restorative justice. We inhabit a global community where division and injustice
                toward those structurally submitted to exclusionary regimes is increasing due to
                economic agendas that put profit over people, wage geopolitical conflict around the
                globe, disregard climate change, and mismanage the fallout from Covid-19. As Hall
                sagely anticipated in his seminal 1980 essay, “Teaching Race”:
                
            <quote>The really crucial question is how do you begin to make that move away from the level
                of prejudice and belief? One needs to undermine the obvious. One has to show that
                these are social and historical processes and that they are not written in the
                stars, they are not handed down. They are deep conditions which are not going to
                change if we start tinkering around with them. We must not give our students that
                kind of illusion. We can however begin the process of questioning what the
                structures are and how they work. (127)</quote>
                
            This collection enters into the spirit of “beginning the process of questioning” with
                the awareness that there are many more questions to be asked than can be answered in
                one volume. Because it has emerged out of a call for colleagues within a particular
                geographically defined network to describe to us what they were already teaching,
                rather than from an open call for work about the future of our field at large, we
                cannot make claims for broad coverage. We regret that no essays address Romantic
                antislavery literatures from Latin America, Africa, Asia, or Australia, or work with
                indigenous literatures, translation, or multilingualism. We also regret that there
                is no essay that addresses in detail the question of how to teach the Haitian
                Revolution, which is clearly foundational in the study of antislavery in the
                Romantic period. As Nick Nessbit, drawing on Marx, writes in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean</hi> (2022)<hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> such work brings “living labor” to the forefront and its
                connection to Hegelian historical realization.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> For a consideration of labor in the
                            current moment, see Reed (2020).</note> As the discourse of
                antiracist approaches to teaching literature of the Romantic period continues to
                broaden, we hope this volume—a record of one localized conversation—will be a prompt
                to further discussion.</p>
                
            <p>The essays collected here explore how recent history informs the way students might
                currently receive Romantic texts, clearing a space for further discussion about how
                the conversation will continue to change the way Romantic texts signify. As scholars
                and teachers, becoming conscious of not only how pedagogical praxis might be shaped
                by developments in research and critical race theory but also how events in the
                classroom might reshape research is more than a matter of good teaching or meeting
                the publish-or-perish expectations of the academy. Taken together, these essays
                encourage scholars to reflect on how both instructors and students must consider the
                relation between the classroom and the university and its relationship to the
                imagined community at the national and planetary levels. As Matthew, Gordon,
                Richardson, and Lee elucidate here, instructors and students must grapple with how
                structures of white privilege are implicit in the university, the archive, and the
                discipline so that together they can transform interpretation into a dialogic act of
                resistance as they deconstruct racialist and exclusionary discourses, thereby
                creating alternative spaces of interrelational knowledge.</p>
                
            <p>The co-creation of knowledge is one of the paths toward the liberatory potential of
                education that Freire, a major inspiration for the 2018 panel, describes. Arguing
                against the “banking concept” of education, a system in which students merely bank
                information they passively receive from their teacher, Freire challenges the
                asymmetry of power central to the subject/object dichotomy that is also at the core
                of the ontological negation that racism relies on. As hooks writes in her meditation
                on how Freire’s pedagogy informs her own, “Freire’s work affirmed that education can
                only be liberatory when everyone claims knowledge as a field in which we all labor”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Teaching to Transgress</hi> 14). Moments of first encounter
                are often formative: students are coming to texts about slavery from a different
                historical perspective than their teachers, and this means that students have the
                potential to teach their instructors things that they have not before seen and that
                they may find hard to see.</p>
                
            <p>While by no means exhaustive, this conversation offers some specific practices in the
                attempt to create classroom environments to fashion a place “where both [professors
                and students] are simultaneously teachers and students” while respecting the
                intersectionalities of race, gender, and class in our increasingly diverse student
                body (Freire 72). hooks also cautions that “teachers are often among that group most
                reluctant to acknowledge the extent to which white-supremacist thinking informs
                every aspect of our culture including the way we learn, the content of what we
                learn, and the manner in which we are taught”
                (<hi rend="italic">Teaching Community </hi>25). With this in
                mind, the discussions here respectfully offer multiple ways to reflect on how we
                might more consciously acknowledge and evaluate how our own experiences inflect our
                pedagogical practices and how to work with students to create spaces in our
                classrooms for this vital dialogue. At a time when events in the United States have
                inspired civic action and debate in countries across the world, the present moment
                can no longer be kept outside the doors of a classroom in which Romantic literature
                is being read. As scholars, it is useful to consider not only how pedagogical praxis
                might be reshaped by developments in research but also how events in the classroom
                might reshape research practices.</p>
