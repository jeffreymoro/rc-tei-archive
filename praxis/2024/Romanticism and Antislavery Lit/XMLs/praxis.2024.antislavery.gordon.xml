                <p>How, as teachers of the literature and history of slavery, are we to address the fact that 
                    our classrooms and campuses are still yet structured by the social relations of slavery? 
                    Using an Afropessimist framework that alerts us to the anti-Blackness of the American academy, 
                    in particular, and colonial modernity at large, this essay discusses teaching the literature of 
                    slavery and abolition as an exploration of “the pathology of Whiteness” and “the Slave grammar of 
                    suffering.” As it takes up texts by Mat Johnson, Edgar Allan Poe, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and
                    others, the essay moves toward a pedagogy of “dehiscence” that differentiates itself from liberatory 
                    pedagogies by positioning woundedness, anger, and antiromantic selflessness alongside feelings of guilt, 
                    redemption, and consciousness-raising.

                        Black studies is a dehiscence at the heart of the institution and at its edge; its broken, 
                        coded documents sanction walking in another world while passing through this one, graphically 
                        disordering the administered scarcity from which black studies flows as wealth. The cultivated 
                        nature of this situated volatility, this emergent poetics of the emergency in which the poor trouble 
                        the proper, is our open secret.

                slavery? Using an Afropessimist framework that alerts us to the anti-Blackness of
                the American academy, in particular, and colonial modernity at large, this essay
                discusses teaching the literature of slavery and abolition as an exploration of “the
                pathology of Whiteness” and “the Slave grammar of suffering.” As it takes up texts
                by Mat Johnson, Edgar Allan Poe, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and others, the
                essay moves toward a pedagogy of “dehiscence” that differentiates itself from
                liberatory pedagogies by positioning woundedness, anger, and antiromantic
                selflessness alongside feelings of guilt, redemption, and consciousness-raising.</p>
                    
            
            <p>In the Spring semester of 2014, eighteen months prior to the course I describe in
                this essay, I had begun to study Afropessimism during a graduate seminar on global
                modernism. The following summer, when officers of the New York Police Department
                killed Eric Garner, when police officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown, when a
                highly militarized police force intensified its occupation of Ferguson, Missouri,
                Claudia Rankine published <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi> (2014), Black feminist
                activists founded the Movement for Black Lives, and Sandra Bland died in prison
                after her arrest following a pretextual traffic stop. Afropessimism offered an
                analytically rigorous and unflinching account of the paradigm of “ontological
                terror” (Warren) in which these events had occurred and a framework for reevaluating
                my fledgling pedagogical practices. Emerging in part from the acknowledgment of a
                continuum that links racial slavery to the anti-Blackness of contemporary Whiteness,
                policing, and state violence, Afropessimism challenges conventional accounts of
                civic reason and historical progress and produces a conceptual break to think
                through the paradigmatic anti-Blackness of global modernity in “the afterlife of
                slavery” (Hartman, <hi rend="italic">Lose Your Mother</hi> 6).</p>
                    
            <p>Afropessimism explains the performance of anti-Black racism in higher education as
                much as it explains the performance of anti-Black policing. As context for the
                discussion on pedagogy that follows, I will briefly describe a spate of anti-Black
                violence on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst that took place in
                the fall of 2014. Though I reproduce some of the language as it appeared on campus
                that fall, my purpose in doing so is not to transgress Black suffering but to refuse
                a practice so common to neoliberal institutionality by which systemic racism and
                structural violence are hushed in the service of a recommitment to the institution.
                At the time, the incidents I describe here led to the organization of somber events
                about “standing together against racism,” to sanctimonious acts of “reflection,” to
                repetitious commitments to “diversity and tolerance,” and to administrative calls to
                “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect for all.”<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> An event called “Standing Together against
                        Racism: A Week of Reflection, a Day of Solidarity” was organized by the
                        Anti-Racism Committee of English Students and Faculty and featured a
                        full-day “Solidarity Read-In” that I participated in on November 4, 2014.
                        The phrase “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect
                        for all” appeared in a campus-wide email by the university’s chancellor,
                        Kumble Subbaswamy, on October 14, 2014.</note> There was little
                institutional recognition, however, of the well-documented history of anti-Black
                violence as a longstanding tenet of the academy at large, little space or outlet for
                the expression of Black anger, suffering, or rage, and no answer as to why incidents
                of anti-Black violence should lead the “community” to <hi rend="italic">come
                    together</hi> as opposed to <hi rend="italic">coming apart</hi>. Christina
                Sharpe comments on how often “the note of a more perfect union, the note of
                unhearable Black suffering” is struck by leaders on occasions of anti-Black
                violence: a striking note that “sutures Black suffering to romance and redemption”
                (par. 6). It is a practice far too common that seeks, by way of anti-Black
                institutions, solutions to the very problems they give rise to. I therefore describe
                these incidents in the spirit of an antiromantic and antiredemptive abolitionism in
                the service of an imperfect disunion.</p>
                    
            <p>In October 2014, amidst the cries and lamentations of protestors responding to the
                killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner that summer, anti-Black hate speech was
                found written on the door of a dorm room shared by two Black students in Harambee, a
                defined residential community for African and African American students. One of the
                students directly targeted, an undergraduate, had recently returned from Ferguson,
                where he had taken part in “Ferguson October,” a coalition-building social movement
                later known as “Ferguson Action.” It was written on his door during the fatefully
                named “Columbus Day” weekend (Odam). That same weekend, someone else had written
                explicit hate speech ostensibly targeting Mexican and multilingual Spanish-speaking
                students on the door of another dorm room, and the following week, several more
                students were targeted by a person later identified as Devin Ayres, who was charged
                with property damage and arraigned in the local district court, thereby leaving a
                public record of his “reasoning.” According to testimony quoted in reports, Ayres
                wrote “n*” on the door of one student because he knew her to be African American,
                while he wrote “you guys got nboyfriends” on the door of two White students because
                he knew one of them to be dating an African American man (Lederman, Vidales). Viewed
                through an Afropessimist lens, the performance of anti-Black sexual racism is
                neither aberrant nor anomalous but as banal and procedural as Ayres’s court
                testimony. In a university context, furthermore, the cop-out of White ignorance
                should not be allowed its ordinarily stabilizing effect for a multicultural society
                where education is purported to be the antidote to (rather than the cause of)
                anti-Black racism. There was nothing unknowing or unintentional about these acts of
                violence. Their intention, not to mention their effect, appears to have been to
                restore the order of White institutional dominance.</p>
                    
            <p>A year later, in the fall of 2015, I taught an introductory “Ethnic American
                Literature” course oriented toward transatlantic (anti)slavery literature. The
                course’s emphasis on the legacies of (anti)slavery literature engaged constructions
                of race, gender, and minoritization in narratives of slavery, colonialism,
                emancipation, and political awakening in a campus climate antagonized by anti-Black
                violence. Some of the texts, like Olaudah Equiano’s
                <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative </hi>(1789) and Edgar
                Allan Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi> (1838), were drawn
                from the era of Romanticism, properly speaking, and animated our discussions of
                freedom, slavery, persuasion, and subjectivity. Most of them, however, were
                contemporary texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a “speculative” framework,
                like Mat Johnson’s novel <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>(2011),
                Celu Amberstone’s short story “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s
                <hi rend="italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </hi>(1995/2005),
                and Samuel Delany’s novella
                <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>(1966)—all texts that engage
                with race, racialization, and the rule of dominance in contemporary (anti)slavery.
                The course I was assigned to teach, “Ethnic American Literature,” is defined by the
                University of Massachusetts Amherst English Department as “American literature
                written by and about ethnic minorities, from the earliest immigrants through the
                cultural representations in modern American writing,” and the course is
                traditionally taught as an introduction to immigrant literature, focusing either on
                historical breadth or on a particular literary tradition (Jewish American literature
                or Asian American literature, for example). Because the department has no designated
                undergraduate course in Black studies, however, and because the course description
                itself implicitly excludes the forced migration of the transatlantic slave trade
                from the descriptive purview of the “ethnic,” I decided to create a version of the
                course that would reckon with the apparent unassimilability of racial slavery to the
                “immigrant” experience. Thus, two other themes drove my choice of the “sci-fi” texts
                on the syllabus, namely (time) travel and consciousness. More like an introductory
                (critical) ethnic studies or Black studies course than a survey of ethnic American
                literature, the course aimed to provoke commentary on race and (anti)slavery through
                Bildungsromans about characters who awaken to the realities of colonialism,
                conquest, and displacement.</p>
                    
            <p>In the initial course design, Afropessimism provided a framework for understanding
                the wave of anti-Black terror as a brief moment of disequilibrium in the hegemony of
                everyday violence held over from slavery, rather than some shocking set of events
                unrelated to the political structure of the academy. I wanted students to engage
                with this continuum, to question their assumptions about the “pastness” of slavery,
                the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism of the
                Obama administration. And I wanted them to <hi rend="italic">get mad</hi>, to feel
                authorized to <hi rend="italic">express anger</hi> about what was happening on
                campus—affects that, under the circumstances, I found preferable to “standing
                together” or tolerance, romance or redemption, or contrition or magnanimity. In the
                epigraphs above, Fred Moten speaks to a “dehiscence at the heart of the
                institution,” seizing on the ambiguity of that odd word to indicate how Black
                studies attends to the structural vulnerability of critical thought in the academy,
                where Black studies is furthermore constantly vulnerable to regulation, defunding,
                and marginalization. A (wound) dehiscence is an opening in a plant that allows seeds
                to disperse as well as a gaping incision in a body (politic) prone to infection. I
                did not at the time conceive of my pedagogy as a “dehiscent” one, but upon
                reflection, I see how teaching (in) the wounds of slavery pushed my class toward
                shared vulnerability rather than inviolable strength, and how this shifted the goals
                of student learning from individual mastery to “other motives,” namely humility,
                questioning, and (as Moten also notes) “selflessness” (<hi rend="italic">Universal
                    Machine</hi> 118).</p>
                    
            <p>As we moved from Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> to the text it annotates (Poe’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi>), the first half of
                the course addressed “the pathology of Whiteness,” a subject that animated a wide
                spectrum of student responses, ranging from sheer delight and selfless auto-critique
                to reactionary defensiveness and retrenched White supremacy. By producing a class
                that was vulnerable and conflicted, wounded and antagonistic, the prick and
                provocation of simply naming Whiteness led us into the second half of the course,
                which focused on “the Slave grammar of suffering,” a phrase I adopt from the work of
                Frank B. Wilderson III (<hi rend="italic">Red, White, and Black</hi> 28 and passim).
                As I will go on to explain, “the Slave grammar of suffering” disrupts fantasies of
                social wholeness and historical redress from the ontological vantage point of the
                slave, inducing disquiet and anger rather than sentimentality or saviorism. Seizing
                on the double meaning of “dehiscence” as diaspora and wound, the essay then
                concludes with some afterthoughts on pedagogy: what do students learn and unlearn
                when asked to sit with the collective and enduring traumas of slavery?</p>

                        <head>The Pathology of Whiteness</head>
                        
            <p><hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, Mat Johnson’s third novel, follows protagonist Chris
                Jaynes, an assistant professor of African American literature, whose desire to
                uncover “how the pathology of Whiteness was constructed” (14) shapes his obsessive
                inquiry into the work of Edgar Allan Poe, particularly <hi rend="italic">The
                    Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</hi>, Poe’s Antarctic expedition
                tale. Chris is the only Black professor at a small liberal arts college in
                Manhattan, and as the only professor who specializes in African American literature,
                he is denied tenure because in teaching courses like “Dancing with the Darkies:
                Whiteness in the Literary Mind” (an allusion to Toni Morrison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Playing in the Dark: Whiteness in the Literary Imagination</hi> [1992]), he
                refuses to play the part of “Professional Negro” (7). “You were hired to teach
                African American literature,” explains the college president during a heated
                exchange. “Not just American literature. You fought that. Simple” (13).
                Foregrounding the racial politics of literary interpretation from the outset, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi> pits the institutional demand for minority representation
                (“We have a large literature faculty, they can handle the majority of literature.
                You were retained to purvey the minority perspective” [13]) against Chris’s heroic
                ambition to “[cure] America’s racial pathology,” which “like all diseases . . . had
                to be analyzed at a microscopic level” (8).</p>
                        
            <p><hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>staged a series of questions for us
                to consider at the outset of the course. Why does the college president say, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Not just</hi> American literature”? (emphasis added). Is African
                American literature (or ethnic American literature) <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                American literature, per se? And if the latter category is in fact so specific as to
                include these others, then why is it unmarked and unraced? Why not just refer to it
                as <hi rend="italic">White </hi>American literature? As the
                novel pursues such questions through a satirical travel narrative that takes Chris
                and an ad hoc “Creole crew” to Antarctica in search of the fabled island of Tsalal,
                that “great undiscovered African Diaspora homeland” referred to in Poe’s text
                (“uncorrupted by Whiteness”), it also begins to answer them (39). Whiteness is a
                “pathology and a mindset,” Chris thinks, not an “ethnic nomenclature” (33, 31). It
                is “metaphorical” (30), an “ideology” (30), and a “strategy” (31). Above all,
                “Whiteness isn’t about being something, it is about being no thing, nothing, an
                erasure” (225), a claim that is confirmed symbolically when Chris and his crew are
                enslaved by a “race” of culture-less “snow honkies” called Tekelians who rule the
                white, windswept landscape of the South Pole (160). When their captivity among the
                Tekelians appears to be inescapable, Chris’s uncle, Captain Booker Jaynes, tells
                him, “You can’t run from Whiteness. You have to stand and engage it” (209). For
                Chris, though, Whiteness is not something “to stand.” From New York to Antarctica,
                Whiteness is the inescapable background of his every movement.</p>
                        
            <p>To facilitate conversation between and among students, I assigned everyone to a small
                (three-to-four-person) online writing group where they submitted short essays and
                reading responses and provided each other with written feedback. In addition to my
                notes on in-class presentations that were also required of every student, this
                online record of the course is where I’ve drawn the direct quotations and
                paraphrased commentary that appear throughout this essay.</p>
                        
            <p>As painful as it is to see Chris denied tenure, students writing about <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi> were decidedly more affected by his enslavement, and the
                gratuitous violence used by the Tekelians to maintain control over their captives,
                than by the institutional politics of race that led to his firing. One non-Black
                student of color wrote that they were saddened by the apparent “hopelessness” of the
                novel, which seemed to suggest that “no matter how hard they [the crew] try,
                whiteness cannot be escaped.” Yet several students, perhaps feeling uncomfortable
                sharing this viewpoint with the whole class so early in the semester, confided that
                they were refreshed by the novel’s reorientation of the “normal” routes of
                novelistic desire, as <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> made the sniveling, nail-biting,
                blubber-eating white Tekelians repulsive and the Black Creole crew attractive.
                Indeed, many students became more comfortable analyzing Whiteness while reading <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi>; and after also reading Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative
                    of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi>, one student concluded that Whiteness is an “idea of
                unity that, in the case of this novel and perhaps in reality, only succeeds in
                destroying [rather] than bringing together. It swallows only the ideas that
                perpetuate its image as salvation, purity, and goodness, and erases all that would
                tarnish its brilliant color.” However, the criticism of Whiteness engendered by
                these books also led to some reactionary defensiveness and White entrenchment. In a
                response essay submitted to one of the online writing groups, one student wrote that
                Chris’s reference to the indistinguishability of the Tekelians (“they all pretty
                much looked the same to me” [131]) was effectively a form of reverse racism. This
                was addressed and, I think, adequately corrected both in their peer group and in the
                classroom, where we explained that an observer who is enslaved, and who therefore
                has no material or discursive power, cannot be <hi rend="italic">racist</hi>, even
                if that same observer can be provocative. I shared Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s definition
                of racism as “the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of
                group-differentiated vulnerabilities to premature death” (28), and we made this one
                of the running definitions of racism for the course as a whole.</p>
                        
            <p>The satirical tone and allegorical humor of <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> makes it an
                accessible index for critiquing Whiteness and engendering generous if sometimes
                painful (auto)critique. Having read it prior to Poe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narrative</hi>, and along with excerpts from Morrison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Playing in the Dark</hi>, students are presented with a persuasive case to
                study Whiteness as pathology, strategy, ideology. What is additionally generative
                about these texts is that although they are sometimes misrecognized as saying that
                “race” is a biological signifier, they also prompt students to think about the
                evaluative symbolism of “color.” Early on in <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, Chris
                comments on a passage of Poe’s novel where the narrator observes a river on the
                island of Tsalal “made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue;
                [whose] cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and
                imperfect in regard to neighboring veins” (29). Chris suggests that the description
                resembles the “racial fantasy” of Booker T. Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise,” a
                fantasy, in other words, of functional segregation (29). I taught Poe’s imagery as
                an anti-Black fantasy of (social) control over the distribution of color, however,
                pointing out that this fantasy is represented repeatedly in both novels.</p>
                        
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, for instance, Mahalia Mathis is the
                great-great-granddaughter of Poe’s “hybrid” character Dirk Peters. Although she
                appears to Chris to be phenotypically Black, Mathis refuses African heritage. She
                heads the Native American Ancestry Collective of Gary, Indiana (NAACG), a group that
                uses DNA testing to prove that their genes have “no kind of Africa”: “I got lots of
                Indian in me. I got Irish and I got a little French too. I got some German, or so
                I’m told. I even got a little Chinese in me, on my mother’s side. Matter of fact,
                I’m sure I got more bloods in me than I knows. But I do knows this: I ain’t got no
                kind of Africa in these bones” (49). This anti-Black fantasy, which plays itself out
                in the self-recognition of several “colors” ostensibly excluding “black,” also plays
                out in the color symbolism of Chris’s Antarctic expedition. After he and his best
                friend, Garth, escape their captivity among the Tekelians, they flee to an Antarctic
                BioDome owned by a painter, Thomas Karvel (a parody of Thomas Kinkade, a popular
                American artist who billed himself as “the Painter of Light”), who provides them
                shelter while they work a small plantation. True to his moniker, “the Master of
                Light” is a sovereign of <hi rend="italic">color</hi>, a monarch over a Disney-like
                “fantasy of Whiteness” marked by the manufactured monochromatic oversaturation of
                the BioDome, where the animals are too-white, the grass too-green, the river
                too-blue, but where nothing is black except Chris and Garth, the interlopers (185).
                Indeed, Chris complains to Garth that Karvel’s paintings never have Black people in
                them; even worse, he suspects that in Karvel’s work, “black people couldn’t exist,
                so thorough was its European romanticization” (184).</p>
                        
            <p>In “The Case of Blackness,” Fred Moten writes that “the cultural and political
                discourse on black pathology has been so pervasive that it could be said to
                constitute the background against which all representations of blacks, blackness, or
                (the color) black take place,” arguing in sum that “blackness has been associated
                with a certain sense of decay, even when that decay is invoked in the name of a
                certain (fetishization of) vitality” (177). As if throwing their hands up, one
                student recognized “the absurdity in our world’s thought process that anything, even
                things of the same nature such as mice and birds, can be separated and classified
                into greater and lesser categories just because of color.” But Johnson’s
                <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>and Poe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narrative</hi> suggest a politics of chroma that goes beyond irrational
                absurdity. For if black is theoretically every color, and whiteness is theoretically
                no-color, <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> suggests that “the pathology of Whiteness” lies
                precisely in this desire to master color itself. Whiteness is an ideology and a
                strategy because it is an operation that speciates every-color into veins of a river
                that do not “commingle,” turning inward into monochromatic oversaturation, dividing
                up into “ethnic” varieties of American literature. Blackness is the chromatic
                equivalent of refusing this violent speciation, and Whiteness is by definition
                antagonistic to such a politics.</p>

            <head>The Slave Grammar of Suffering</head>
                            
            <p>In the anti-Black environment in which my students and I moved our way through this
                course, I was not surprised that some students would perform their Whiteness through
                reactionary defensiveness and entrenched White supremacist logics. I was heartened,
                however, that for the most part the White and non-Black students of color in the
                course allied with the interest of their Black peers (which is to say, with
                Blackness) and committed themselves seriously to diagnosing “America’s racial
                pathology.” Questioning the basis of one’s relationship to Whiteness can produce
                existential crises that overflow what a normative classroom is able to hold, putting
                students in a position that may be analogous to the one occupied by the person who
                asked Frank Wilderson, in an online interview, what a White person could do to
                interpellate Afropessimism without succumbing to a form of reasoning that would lead
                them to suicide: “As a white person who feels bad about all my race does, what can I
                do to help besides killing myself?” Wilderson’s answer was swift and to the point.
                Rather than “kill yourself,” the questioner should get angry and “undo yourself.”
                Moreover, the questioner should develop “ways and means for your speech and action
                to be authorized by a Black/slave grammar of suffering rather than the grammar of
                suffering of subalterns.” Wilderson concluded the answer by remarking on the radical
                potential of the questioner’s “undoing”: “You are far more dangerous by being
                committed in this long, protracted struggle than you are or would be if you just
                check out” (Wilderson, “I Am Frank”). After the first half of the course focused on
                the pathology of Whiteness, the second half took up “the Slave grammar of
                suffering.”</p>
                            
            <p>What is the difference between the subaltern grammar of suffering and “the Slave
                grammar of suffering,” and what does it mean to be “authorized” by the latter? In
                    <hi rend="italic">Red, White, and Black</hi> (2010), Wilderson defines grammar
                as “the structure through which the labor of speech is possible,” arguing that
                scripts which view “social turmoil through the rubric of conflict (i.e., a rubric of
                problems that can be posed and conceptually solved)” (5) represent, on the one hand,
                a subaltern grammar of suffering in which grievances are submitted and solutions
                proposed to return aggrieved parties to a condition of prior wholeness. On the other
                hand, scripts that view social turmoil through a “rubric of antagonism (an
                irreconcilable struggle between entities, or positions, the resolution of which is
                not dialectical but entails the obliteration of one of the positions)” represent a
                “Slave grammar of suffering” that disrupts the dream of repair (5). One of the
                primary distinctions between a “Slave grammar of suffering” and a grammar of
                subaltern suffering concerns a text’s relationship to resolution. From the vantage
                point of the Slave, whose exclusion from civil society is fundamental to the freedom
                enjoyed by citizens (Wilderson’s terminology includes “Humans,” “Whites,” and
                “Settlers”), inclusion is a form of “obliteration.” Being authorized by “the Slave
                grammar of suffering” therefore begins with refusing the “prescriptive gesture” of
                reconciliation. For Wilderson, it continues (through Frantz Fanon via Aimé Césaire)
                with “the end of the world . . . the only thing . . . worth the effort of starting”
                (337).</p>
                            
            <p>As literary texts, Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees,” Octavia Butler’s “Amnesty” and
                “Bloodchild,” Samuel Delany’s <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi>, and Olaudah
                Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> are all available to
                interpretation through the grammar of suffering: “Refugees” through a
                colonizer/colonized dynamic on the fictional planet of Tallav’Wahir; “Amnesty” and
                “Bloodchild” through the lens of captivity on earth and on the Tlic planet
                (respectively); <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi> through its plot to emancipate
                the enslaved Lll; and the <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> through its
                autobiographical account of enslavement. Yet as a story about people relocated from
                a postapocalyptic earth, “Refugees” seems to engage the suffering of the colonized
                or the migrant subject struggling to reestablish the customs of their homeland; it
                does not engage “the Slave grammar of suffering,” since through “natal alienation”
                such resolution is ultimately unavailable to the Slave (Patterson 5). Similarly, by
                focusing on a human protagonist who translates between human beings and an
                extraterrestrial lifeform that has colonized earth, Butler’s “Amnesty” is more about
                structural adjustment and human de-exceptionalism than it is about slavery.
                “Bloodchild” certainly appears to be about slavery, and many students were certain
                it was; they were therefore puzzled that Butler herself disagreed (“It amazes me
                that some people have seen ‘Bloodchild’ as a story of slavery” [30]). However, as
                one student observed about the gender and reproductive politics of the story, Butler
                was probably right to call her narrative about the implantation of a male human
                named Gan with Tlic larvae a “love story,” rather than a slave narrative:
                
            <quote>It is interesting that in a society where women get pregnant and have children all
                the time, it is often called love, but when it is a man being impregnated in almost
                the same exact way, it can be seen as slavery. Perhaps this happens because sci-fi
                novels are seen as so drastically different in their own imagined worlds that it is
                hard to see their similarity to the reality of life on Earth, or it is because of
                the patriarchal views that have been instilled in the reader that affect how
                “Bloodchild” is read.</quote>
                
            Prompted by such articulate student writing, I wonder, then, when I thought I was
                teaching about slavery several years ago, if I was not, perhaps, teaching about
                something else. Recognizing that not all of these texts are engaged with the grammar
                of Slave suffering places pressure on how I would teach Romantic antislavery
                literature and its legacies in the future, especially when the topic is “the slave
                narrative.”</p>
                            
            <p>Of all the texts we read together, Delany’s
                <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>gets nearest to representing
                the suffering of the Slave, as it were, grammatically. At the center of this novella
                about slavery and emancipation in a far-off galaxy is “the suffering of the Lll”
                (79), a race of world-building beings whose emancipation is seemingly dependent on
                the delivery of a message to Empire Star by the young protagonist, Comet Jo. As
                students begin to notice, however, the Lll never speak. They are always described
                collectively, never individually. And their enslavement seems to be constituted as
                much by their silence as through the garrulous verbosity of everyone else with
                something to say about why the Lll should be or should not be emancipated, which is
                to say, every other “free” character. “Their place in the book is the un-speaking
                point of conflict,” wrote one student; indeed, “they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
                conflict, not <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">being</hi>.
                And while they might achieve ‘emancipation,’ they are not free, but remain enslaved
                to others with a voice.” The world of <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi> clearly
                depends upon the slavery of the Lll, making their emancipation a political farce and
                their suffering an antagonism with no redress—pessimistic conclusions frankly
                confirmed by <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi>’s circular, spiral, and
                “retrocausal” form (Shephard). Treating the continuum of slavery and emancipation as
                a formal element of the text, the novella ends exactly where it began, with Comet Jo
                realizing he has been tasked with Lll emancipation perhaps many times before.</p>
                            
            <p>By contrast, Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> appears to end on
                a somewhat hopeful, solution-oriented note based on free-market liberalism, the
                British state’s capacity for “justice,” and the good will of “every man of
                sentiment” (176). Yet if this prescriptive gesture lends itself to an interpretation
                as a grammar of suffering from a subaltern rather than Slave perspective, the book
                is nevertheless undoubtedly a narrative that grapples with exposing the grammar, or
                structure, of Slave suffering. In one class discussion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Interesting Narrative</hi>, a conversation that continued in our online
                discussion forum, I introduced students to the evidence compiled by Vincent Carretta
                suggesting that Equiano may have been born in Carolina, even though his
                autobiography tells us he was born in Africa, was captured as a child, and suffered
                the Middle Passage (see also Youngquist). I explained that Carretta’s evidence
                included the ship’s log for Equiano’s Arctic voyage as well as the record of his
                baptism, both of which identified Carolina as his place of birth. I also explained
                that Carretta’s intent was not to cast doubt on Equiano’s narrative but to raise
                questions about what literary and political concerns may have motivated Equiano’s
                fabrication, if it were indeed true. Why would Equiano invent a first-person fiction
                in the midst of a true autobiography?</p>
                            
            <p>The conversation that ensued more or less followed Carretta’s own conclusions:
                Equiano’s political motivation was to abolish slavery, and an account that included
                a young child being captured and enduring the Middle Passage was the most likely way
                to provoke what one non-Black student referred to as a “drama-driven English
                audience.” Elaborating on a now-foundational connection between the liberal
                antislavery movement and spectacular representations of Black suffering (Hartman,
                    <hi rend="italic">Scenes of Subjection</hi>), some students were therefore
                content to understand autobiography as a genre with certain formal needs and
                capabilities, including “literary devices.” Abolition by any means necessary. Others
                went so far as to suggest that it was “natural and unavoidable to lie when selling a
                story,” and that the act of lying “is practically part of the social contract”
                between writers and readers.</p>
                            
            <p>This conversation was enormously productive for changing the mind of at least one
                non-Black student, who wrote online that before the full unfolding of our class
                discussion he viewed Equiano’s potential fabrication as a way to disguise his status
                as an otherwise “privileged slave” who was able to read, write, and build
                relationships with free Whites. “I thought that it seemed a bit ridiculous that he
                would make things up and make [a narrative of his capture and the Middle Passage]
                sound like his own life to rouse sympathy in the readers,” wrote the student, whose
                classmates were quick to jump on the notion of “privilege” at play. One non-Black
                peer wrote that they would “hesitate to call a slave privileged, especially since it
                is clear from the text that Equiano does not define himself this way and
                consistently refers to any good luck that comes his way as an aberration from a
                system that is built to deny him any good fortune. He certainly considers himself
                blessed, mainly in retrospect after being freed, but his narrative is demonstrating
                how the institution of slavery blocks privilege based on race.” A good
                point—although it was ultimately not the purpose of the first student to pursue the
                idea of “privilege.” Rather, in examining why Equiano would fabricate aspects of his
                autobiography, the student had become interested in whether it was Equiano’s
                intention “to voice stories of other slaves that do not have the opportunity to.” In
                other words, was Equiano’s narrative more of a social history than an
                autobiography?</p>
                            
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Intimacies of Four Continents</hi> (2015), Lisa Lowe
                demonstrates how Equiano’s narrative, given voice through a genre of liberalism (“In
                a sense, the autobiography is the liberal genre par excellence” [46]), reveals a
                connection between slavery, subjugation, and “the singular life” (71). In thinking
                of the <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> as a kind of polyvocal
                performance of himself and “other slaves,” then, my student was perhaps moving
                toward a critique of autobiography: Olaudah Equiano was not only Equiano, he was
                also Gustavus Vassa, and he was born in multiple places. In attempting to find a
                grammar requisite to the suffering of the Slave, Equiano/Vassa had to call the genre
                of the autobiography, the narrative of the singular life, into profound question.
                Even though the
                <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative </hi>concludes with a
                predictable form of prescriptive redress, much of it nevertheless strives toward a
                “Slave grammar of suffering” that is collective and dispersed rather than selfish,
                self-made, or individual. The internal differentiation of Equiano’s narrative into
                that of Gustavus Vassa
                <hi rend="italic">as well as </hi>“[those] slaves that do not
                have the opportunity” leads us to think and imagine antislavery everywhere.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the field of Black studies has become, perhaps more consciously than
                ever before, an interdisciplinary mode, a fugitive method, and an intellectual
                itinerary variously referred to as <hi rend="italic">black study</hi>,
                <hi rend="italic">black </hi>study<hi rend="italic">, and </hi>black
                    <hi rend="italic">studies</hi>, which are inseparable but nevertheless
                distinguishable from the disciplinary study of blackness, Black people, or Black
                arts and culture. While there are many descriptions of what black study is and does,
                Moten’s description of it as “a dehiscence at the heart of the institution and at
                its edge” (“Black Op” 1743) has animated these afterthoughts on the pedagogy of
                dehiscence in and as a form of wounding that is also a plan of dispersal. Dehiscence
                is a recurring concept in Moten’s work, where he mobilizes uses of the phrase from
                Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Lacan with a difference—as in the
                second epigraph, from an essay on Adrian Piper, where he further elaborates on
                dehiscence as a “motif of selflessness” against the longstanding association of
                subjectivity with the inviolability of the possessive individual
                (<hi rend="italic">Universal Machine </hi>118). My
                understanding of dehiscence as a marginal if animating premise and practice of Black
                studies postdates the “Ethnic American Literature” course I have described. However,
                in our attention to “the Slave grammar of suffering” expressed in course materials,
                in society in general, and on the UMass Amherst campus circa 2014/15 in particular,
                we were, I think, working toward a pedagogy of dehiscence—a learning environment
                that takes place in the vulnus or wound of slavery thought to have been closed by
                emancipation, reconstruction, and civil rights.</p>
                        
            <p>My use of the word dehiscence to describe a method of teaching (anti)slavery
                literature and its legacies thus weaves together Black studies pedagogy with the
                intellectual and scholarly protocols of Afropessimism, which repeatedly express
                dissatisfaction with the state of academic knowledge production as civic engagement,
                politically acceptable modes of reform, and solution-oriented prescriptive gestures
                for addressing the continuum of anti-Black violence. In the introductory “Ethnic
                American Literature” course that I have described, it was difficult to address “the
                pathology of Whiteness” and “the Slave grammar of suffering” in part because
                students accustomed through education to think of themselves as becoming productive
                individuals, engaged citizens, and masters of solutions in a context driven by
                competition against one another are not accustomed to “undoing” aspects of their
                education rather than advancing their careers. There is nothing that excludes
                radical forms of care and compassion from a classroom informed by these practices.
                However, the feelings of woundedness and vulnerability in my class did not
                immediately lend themselves, nor should they have, to being neatly, cleanly
                sutured.</p>
                        
            <p>In a well-known passage of <hi rend="italic">Teaching to Transgress: Education as the
                    Practice of Freedom</hi> (1994), bell hooks shares an anecdote about the pain
                her students feel when they take her classes: “We take your class. We learn to look
                at the world from a critical standpoint, one that considers race, sex, and class.
                And we can’t enjoy life anymore” (42). hooks concludes the passage by suggesting
                that modeling mutual respect for that pain reveals its commonness among students
                “across race, sexual preference, and ethnicity,” and she writes that through sharing
                this pain her classes “build community” (42–3). In the “Ethnic American Literature”
                course I taught, students experienced similar feelings of pain, confusion, remorse,
                anger, and defensiveness when sitting with the violence of Whiteness and the
                enduring suffering of slavery’s afterlives, and though I do not wish to disagree
                with hooks’s optimistic comments about community-building, I do wish to question
                them. To my mind, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not (at least not at first) end in a
                reformed community. Instead, in ways much more congruent with recent literature in
                abolitionist pedagogy (Dunn, Love, Rodriguez, Whynacht), it opens up the possibility
                of ending “community.” Put another way, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not seek
                simply to undermine the hierarchical relations of the classroom and build community
                on disingenuous assertions of equality in the afterlife of slavery. Rather, a
                pedagogy of dehiscence acknowledges that the classroom continues to be structured by
                the social relations of conquest, colonialism, and slavery, and accepts that the
                wound this creates ought to cause one (one? many? who? us?) to pursue the
                abolitionist endeavor of ending <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind of world. Wherever
                that endless struggle takes us, that’s where we start.</p>
