                <div type="abstract">
                    <p>This essay introduces strategies for reading and writing about Romantic-era antislavery literature in efforts to animate colonial textuality with Afro-Caribbean creative expressions. In this process, I am guided by the Jamaican concept of tunyuhan (“turn your hand”), or the practice of using available resources or materials to fashion something new and sustainable. My fieldwork in Jamaica and my collaboration with the Charles Town Maroons have informed my research methods, and I bring these inventive, dynamic practices into the classroom. Interweaving Romantic-period writing with contemporary, nonliterary, and occasionally disturbing texts, we consider ways that in reframing the past and interrogating its brutal aftermaths, we might imagine a better future. </p>

            <p>Reading literature about slavery gives students a glimpse into Black lives in the
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but that’s not enough. Romantic-era accounts of
                slavery can whitewash the harrowing realities of plantation life, and even some
                authors of these texts acknowledge the ways their work has endured the interventions
                of their editors or imagined audiences. Whether excerpted, edited and “mard” (John
                Gabriel Stedman), transcribed or “pruned” (Mary Prince), “styled” (Olaudah Equiano),
                or “soiled” (William Earle), these texts bear the marks of the literary and social
                institutions and cultures that produced them. My pedagogical approach relies on
                introducing students to other kinds of texts beyond Romantic-era narratives to
                animate colonial textuality with the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture,
                which, in revising the past, imagines and nourishes future worlds. Inspired by
                Afro-Jamaican “tun yuh han mek fashion” techniques of improvisation and
                sustainability, I work with these materials, often contemporary and nonliterary, to
                refashion studies in Romanticism.</p>
                
            <p>Gaama Gloria Simms (she goes by the honorific “MaMa G”), a Trelawny Maroon and
                Rastafarian, taught me about <hi rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi>. The term refers to the
                Jamaican proverb “tun yuh han (turn your hand) [and] mek (make) fashion,” or to make
                the best use of available resources to create something new and sustainable.
                Afrocentric and inherently revolutionary, tunyuhan, as Kaiton Williams argues, “is
                tied up with the multiple and evolving sources of income and pastimes from which we
                source our identity” (par. 5).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Williams associates tunyuhan with the “DIY
                            mentality” that defines the Jamaican response to “material absence” and
                            also sees it as “a way to repair a break in the continuity of people and
                            culture sustained in the creation of our New World” (par. 8). She
                            writes, “All those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence
                            continue to be as much about making our world as about remaking our
                            relation to it,” proposing also that Jamaican multiplicity “is central
                            to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression of our soul and its
                            determination” (par. 3).</note> MaMa G, for example, plans to
                create and market a line of clothing and accessories made from repurposed materials
                as part of a therapy program for abused or vulnerable women to give them emotional
                and economic support. She aims also to establish small farms for self-subsistence,
                thus empowering Jamaican women and their communities. Taking her social and
                intellectual work abroad through invited lectures and workshops, MaMa G envisions
                opening a “borderless university,” located in Jamaica but developed online, to unite
                local and global communities in the project of disseminating indigenous knowledge.
                MaMa G’s financial circumstances—in part a rejection of modern capitalism—have
                inspired her to create alternative modes of survival that rely on resourcefulness,
                improvisation, and adaptability. Inspired by MaMa G and intrigued by the concept of
                tunyuhan, I try to apply its inventive, collaborative practices to my teaching and
                research.</p>

            <p>I first met MaMa G through my research on the notorious Jamaican fugitive
                Three-Fingered Jack (Jack Mansong), as I tracked stories about the Maroons who
                killed him. Looking back, I realize that our first meeting taught me to (try to)
                relax into a kind of nonteleological, suspended (sometimes surreal) state, very
                different from the structure and solipsism of archival pursuits. “Everyday life is
                our classroom,” MaMa G has explained to me, and “if you are not living it, you are
                so far from it [knowledge].” Fieldwork in Jamaica has taught me to find knowledge
                everywhere, reveling in what Paul Youngquist calls “ambient knowledge” (218).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Shalani Puri
                            has proposed that we consider what she calls “fieldwork in the
                            Humanities” for access “to knowledge and expression unavailable in
                            print; to disallowed or delegitimized knowledges; to localized or
                            vernacular rather than globalized knowledge and memory”
                    (59).</note> I have found it in the “yards” (homes) of contemporary
                Maroons, in conversations with taxi drivers, with fellow passengers on buses, in rum
                shops, at music events, on road trips, and etched in the landscape of the island;
                I’ve had conversations about Three-Fingered Jack in kitchens, in farmyards, on
                hiking trails, in rivers, on mountains, and in bat-filled caves. Cooperative,
                networked, improvisational, and dynamic, these perspectives have helped me to, as
                Bob Marley would put it, “lively up” my research.</p>
                    
            <p>The connections I’ve made in Jamaica took time and tunyuhan to evolve into
                collaboration. My fieldwork began with the Maroons of Charles Town, when their
                remarkable colonel, the late Frank Lumsden, introduced me to his community and,
                indirectly, to MaMa G.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Colonel
                            Lumsden was elected in 2004, remaining in office until his death.
                            Jamaica has four, arguably five, existing Maroon villages: Charles Town,
                            Moore Town, Scots Hall, Accompong, and, controversially,
                            Trelawny/Flagstaff. Maroon communities are self-governing, and in each
                            of the Jamaican Maroon towns, the community elects a colonel or chief,
                            who governs with the assistance of a council. However, the Jamaican
                            government periodically challenges the economic, social, and political
                            autonomy of the Maroons (Bilby, “Maroon Autonomy”).</note> I
                first met Colonel Lumsden at Kingston’s Red Bones Blues Café in 2008, upon his
                delivery of one of his paintings to its proprietor and our mutual friend, Evan
                Williams. We had been hearing about each other for months. Over cold Red Stripe
                beers, I asked Colonel Lumsden if I might visit Charles Town to interview him and
                others about Three-Fingered Jack. As it happened, Colonel Lumsden had been looking
                for an academic to organize an international conference in Charles Town to fulfill
                his vision of a global indigenous community. We struck a deal, and this relationship
                continues to enrich and beautifully complicate my life, even after his death in
                2015. I traveled to Portland, Jamaica, in June 2009 to help establish the first
                International Charles Town Maroon Conference, and in those summer months I spent
                time with Colonel Sterling of Moore Town, Marcia “Kim” Douglas (now Acting Colonel
                of Charles Town), Lynette Wilkes, Worries McCurbin, Brother Isaac Bernard, Keith
                Lumsden, and other Windward Maroons, building relationships that have grown
                    since.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The
                            Maroon villages are traditionally divided into Windward (on the east
                            side of the island) and Leeward (on the west side). Windward Maroon
                            villages include Charles Town, Moore Town, and Scots Hall; those in the
                            Leeward group are Accompong and Trelawny.</note> It took
                another two years for me to meet MaMa G, entirely by chance, through Colonel Prehay
                of the Scots Hall Maroons.</p>
                    
            <p>I met with Colonel Prehay in the temporary office of a visiting Maroon official in
                uptown Kingston. I found the space (with some effort) in a residential building
                adjacent to the wedding-cake-shaped Devon House, an estate built in 1881 by
                Jamaica’s first Black millionaire. In their distinctive hand-crafted coconut hats,
                Col. Prehay and MaMa G sat patiently in the waiting area amidst the pastel décor of
                the mysterious office, and I awkwardly asked questions about Three-Fingered Jack.
                Neither had much to say about him. But MaMa G did have quite a bit to say about
                Indigenous women, the Trelawny Maroons, and the power of improvisation for
                sustainability. I didn’t get information for my book that day, but I decided to
                follow my instincts, realizing when she invited me to her home that I had an
                opportunity to learn from this wise woman.</p>
                    
            <p>A few days later and after some logistical mishaps, I arrived at MaMa G’s East
                Kingston home with what would become my customary offering: a pineapple, four Red
                Stripes, and an orange juice for her granddaughter, Cookie. MaMa G’s East Kingston
                “yard” provided a shady, breezy haven, with multiple signs of her community
                involvement in evidence. I wasn’t sure exactly what I was doing there because MaMa G
                had expressed a marked lack of interest in Three-Fingered Jack. But I felt drawn to
                her energy, and our initial conversations focused on her frustrated departure from
                the social-work program at the University of the West Indies and her subsequent
                commitment to grassroots community organizing. That afternoon MaMa G introduced me
                to the concept of tunyuhan as she carefully stitched an elaborate hat wrought with
                coconut husk and recycled thread, a creation she would proudly wear as she delivered
                a talk to the United Nations several years later. Instead of extricating facts about
                Three-Fingered Jack, I developed strategies for acquiring knowledge beyond the
                archive. I learned to slow down, listen, wait, and even let go of (or at least
                defer) my intended goals. I found that knowledge should be about exchange rather
                than extraction and that it requires openness, creativity, and improvisation. These
                skills help in the classroom, too.</p>

            <head>Tunyuhan in the Classroom</head>
                    
            <p>I teach at a large public university, and most English professors have limited
                opportunities to teach classes in their areas of specialization because the number
                of majors has been declining, as part of a national trend. When we offer Romanticism
                or the long eighteenth century, we face extra pressure from students to keep it
                fresh and relevant to our increasingly diverse student population. I use tunyuhan to
                make available a more textured and topical understanding of Romantic antislavery
                texts. Motivated by my Jamaican research and the interdisciplinarity of the Maroon
                conference, I use the resources available to me, borrowing from other fields,
                experimenting with different genres, and branching into other centuries. I used this
                approach in an upper-level seminar for English majors that focused on eighteenth-
                and nineteenth-century representations of slavery.</p>
                    
            <p>I designed the course to interweave colonial and postcolonial literary and
                nonliterary texts. With tunyuhan’s multiplicity in mind, I incorporated interviews,
                images, and films to complement and challenge the conventions of literary
                historiography. Organized chronologically, the class began with travel writing
                (Lydia Maria Child’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of
                    Surinam</hi> [1838], extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s narrative of his
                military expedition to Surinam) and transitioned to Eurocentric fiction (John
                Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</hi> [1800]
                and Victor Hugo’s <hi rend="italic">Bug-Jargal</hi> [1826]). We followed fiction
                with the voices of formerly enslaved people (Mary Prince’s
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave </hi>[1831]
                and Olaudah Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of
                    Olaudah Equiano</hi> [1789]). And we finished with contemporary Jamaican fiction
                (Marlon James’s <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> [2009]). For the
                purposes of this essay, I will discuss only my classroom use of Child, Earle,
                Prince, and James, situating these texts within larger cultural and creative
                contexts. The Maroons played a significant role in my course partly because they are
                so often neglected, but also because their cultural and spiritual practices
                emphasize the connections I want to make between past, present, and future. Each
                unit also included the creative expressions of contemporary Afro-Jamaicans,
                disrupting the linearity of the syllabus to suggest the ways that the past leaves
                its mark on the present, as well as the ways that reimagining the past can inspire
                future generations.</p>
                    
            <p>Tunyuhan practices will vary in the hands of different teachers and scholars because
                the method involves the creative pursuit of individual interests and inspirations.
                One makes the best use of the available resources, whatever they may be for that
                person. Rather than following a list of suggested texts, videos, or websites, the
                teacher/scholar will experiment with unique combinations of texts or ideas. Dynamic
                and inventive, tunyuhan opens up possibilities and connections.<note place="foot" resp="author"> A reviewer of
                            this essay thoughtfully asked me what the tunyuhan approach would look
                            like in different hands than mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet
                            people like MaMa G. In short, every person will have a different
                            approach based on their interests and resources. My collaboration with
                            the Maroons and MaMa G grew from my interest in their history in
                            relationship to my project on Three-Fingered Jack. It took years to
                            cultivate these relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led
                            me to other opportunities too. The International Charles Town Maroon
                            Conference and Festival, for example, continues to offer opportunities
                            for professors and graduate students to engage with and learn about
                            Maroon culture from contemporary Maroons and Indigenous peoples and
                            scholars from around the world.</note></p>
                    
            <p>My work with the annual International Charles Town Maroon Conference and Festival has
                increasingly informed my teaching as well as my research. Set in the Asafu Yard—once
                a communal space to prepare for battle—it combines academic panels with drumming,
                dancing, wellness workshops, and sacred ritual. Interdisciplinary,
                intergenerational, and collaborative, this event takes academics out of their
                comfort zone and creates connections with contemporary Maroons, local Jamaicans, and
                other international scholars. Researchers meet the descendants of the people they
                study and teach; they hear their voices, listen to their stories, and dance to their
                music. Literary scholars mingle with geographers, geneticists with poets, and
                Maroons with ethnomusicologists.</p>
                    
            <p>Many of the visiting scholars fold archival time into this trip, and their research
                shifts as they move through experiences with people that, unlike archival records,
                speak to and with them. Experiencing alternative models for the production of
                knowledge, participants return to their campuses with more than the photocopies and
                facts that serve the archival imperative and its hierarchies. I’ve worked to bring
                this kind of knowledge into my classroom by using (filmed, digitized, or recorded)
                Maroon stories, songs, rituals, and artwork, for example, to enliven the print
                texts. This “undisciplined” mode of assembly responds to the call for what Christina
                Sharpe terms “wake work” and attends to “the largeness that is Black Life, Black
                life insisted from death” (17). These materials can also show the limitations,
                porousness, and vulnerabilities of logocentric knowledge.</p>
                    
            <p>Stedman, author of <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the
                    Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796), bemoaned the editorial intrusions that
                “mard” his narrative (as cited by Stedman, xlix). An officer in the Dutch army
                deployed to the colony of Surinam to quell the revolt of the Maroons in 1772,
                Stedman submitted his narrative to a London publisher and bookseller, Joseph
                Johnson. The 1796 published version, much to Stedman’s irritation, differed
                significantly from his original account, particularly in its representation of
                Joanna (documented in Richard and Sally Price’s 1998 transcription of his 1790
                manuscript). I won’t rehearse here the fascinating intricacies of what Dustin
                Kennedy has termed the “Stedman Archive,” though I did begin there with my
                    students.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            In addition to Kennedy, see also Jenny Sharpe (2002) and
                        Gwilliam.</note> I chose for my course text, however, not Stedman’s
                narrative but Child’s extraction of it, <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An
                    Emancipated Slave, of Surinam,</hi> first published in an 1834 gift book, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Oasis.</hi><note place="foot" resp="author"> This first version was titled <hi rend="italic"
                                >Joanna, or the Female Slave: A West Indian Tale</hi>
                            (1834). In the second
                            version (1838), Child replaced “female slave” with “emancipated slave,”
                            though Joanna remained enslaved until her death.</note> I
                wanted to track different kinds of mediations that feature in writings about
                slavery, even when produced by white men with relative power.</p>
                    
            <p>Child appropriated Stedman’s narrative for her own abolitionist purposes, but not
                without ideological contradictions. For example, she admires the domestic affections
                of Stedman and Joanna, yet she insists that abolitionists do not “induce anyone to
                marry a mulatto, even should their lives be saved by such an one” (3). Her concerns
                with propriety and miscegenation extend to her visual choices. Johnson’s edition
                includes illustrations by the British engraver and portraitist Thomas Holloway.
                Among them is an image of a bare-breasted Joanna; Child replaced this image with a
                more modest one by a Boston engraver, George Girdler Smith. We studied both, which
                prompted one irritated but engaged student to ask, “What’s up with her boobie?” A
                good question. It’s a cover-up. Jenny Sharpe has suggested that cloaking Joanna’s
                breasts desexualizes and yet emphasizes her role as wife and mother, registering the
                gender politics of women abolitionists like Child (85). My students and I agreed
                that it also covers up the violence visited upon enslaved women, whitewashing the
                realities of sexual exploitation in the colonies. In addition, Child almost entirely
                excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections and whose rebellions
                brought Stedman to Surinam in the first place. I had the students read a few
                Maroon-focused chapters from Stedman’s narrative with some Maroon historiography,
                which sparked their interest in the history of these self-emancipated Afro-Caribbean
                peoples.</p>
                    
            <p>Improvising, I introduced some additional background on the Maroons of Suriname and
                Jamaica and showed them a video of MaMa G’s enstoolment (installation) by the
                Okanisi Maroons as the first woman Gaama, the highest political position among the
                Maroons of Suriname (“Installation”).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Also spelled Ga’aama, Gaa’man, and
                            Gaa’mang.</note> A historic ceremony performed in Charles Town
                by spiritual leaders of the Surinamese and Jamaican Maroons, it showed how
                Afrocentric rituals are preserved, honored, and practiced in the Caribbean today.
                Because the ceremony took place at the Maroon conference, students witnessed the
                interactions between the local community and visiting scholars at this particularly
                moving event, showing them a different kind of scholarly method.</p>
                    
            <p>Next, the class viewed a short docudrama about Nanny of the Maroons,
                <hi rend="italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </hi>(2015),
                featuring MaMa G in a dramatization of the title character. Overtly addressing the
                dearth of archival material about Nanny (only four sources), Roy T. Anderson’s film
                features oral histories, music, and dance, and it includes interviews with Maroon
                leaders, Olympic athletes, politicians, and historians. My students especially liked
                the footage of a group of scholars and Maroons hiking to the remote former military
                stronghold of Nanny Town. As one student wrote in a response paper: “The expedition
                to Nanny Town up in the mountains shows that even now islanders still hold to these
                ancient places and honor the spirits of the past there. I was surprised to learn
                that many of the places in Jamaican folklore still exist such as Nanny Town to
                remember a leader who took down the British, a kick-butt woman who could catch
                bullets in her butt.”<note place="foot" resp="author">All student authors quoted have given permission
                            for their statements to be shared.</note></p>
                    
            <p>The students enjoyed the film, so I showed them additional video clips of
                contemporary Jamaican Maroons performing or explaining their lifeways (“Colonel
                Frank Lumsden,” “Charlestown Maroons,” and “Charlestown Drummers”). Another student
                wrote that “hearing from local Maroons such as Colonel Frank Lumsden and Delano
                Douglas gives the world a better idea of Maroons as lovers of nature and defenders
                of their cultural history in comparison with racist, colonialist generalizations
                that we read.” Other students agreed that the paratextual materials “made Maroon
                history real” for them, and when they returned to the course texts, they better
                understood the brave rebels omitted almost entirely from Child’s text.</p>
                    
            <p>Earle’s epistolary novel <hi rend="italic">Obi </hi>likewise
                elides the role of the Maroons in his account of the fugitive from slavery who was
                captured and killed by them in 1780. Earle’s novel falls short of its abolitionist
                reach, and though it misrepresents the free status of Maroons, it reveals the
                complex dynamics of a colonial state that pitted Afro-Jamaicans against one another.
                The weepy, unreliable narrator, however, inspires little confidence, especially in
                his repetition of the phrase “I am no author” (118). Famously overwrought and
                ideologically incoherent, Earle’s “sentimentalist abolitionism” (50), though
                brilliantly edited and annotated by Srinivas Aravamudan in the 2005 Broadview Press
                edition, has never been a crowd-pleaser for my students.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Aravamudan observes that Obi “is
                            written with a view to eliciting the feeling tear or the melancholic
                            sigh of the sentimentalist reader and the abolitionist activist”
                            (8).</note></p>
                    
            <p>I can’t blame the students for their frustration with Earle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Obi</hi>, against which we (much more to their interest) explored contemporary
                images of Jack and the Maroon who killed him. First, we studied the Jamaican artist
                Omari “Afrikan” Ra’s extraordinary painting of Three-Fingered Jack (n.d.), and the
                class listened to my recorded interview with the artist, who spoke of the influences
                of revolutionaries Makandal and Dutty Boukman. The students used Ra’s image to
                imagine a more nuanced picture of the infamous outlaw. They commented on his hard,
                intense stare and the words etched around his neck, perhaps suggesting the ways he’s
                been imprisoned by print. The students also found it interesting to think about
                Jack’s relationship to Quashie (also called “John Reeder”), the Maroon who took off
                Jack’s fingers and later killed him. Colonel Lumsden’s stunning painting of Quashie,
                in white face paint and rendered in “ambush,” depicts the complexity of this
                underrepresented figure in Jack’s story.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> “Ambush” refers to the Maroon tactic of
                            camouflage for the purposes of surprise attack.</note> One
                student commented, “The depth and intricacy of Quashie’s eyes and the surrounding
                patterns of greenery remind us that, in the end, Quashie is still a Maroon and that
                he would make his own ruthless decisions” (Fig. 2). These Afrocentric images of Jack
                and his killer usefully trouble Eurocentric textual accounts of colonial Jamaica
                with their depictions of proud Black warriors forced into opposition with one
                another by a brutal system.</p>

            <p>To conclude the Three-Fingered Jack unit, we watched clips of dancehall/reggae artist
                Buju Banton’s “Long Walk to Freedom” tour. This self-identified Maroon was released
                from a U.S. prison in December 2018, reminding my students that the
                prison-industrial complex functions as an extension of plantation slavery (Kreps).
                Buju Banton represents a potent expression of Black agency, harnessing the legacy of
                the island’s first freedom fighters. Putting Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> in
                conversation with contemporary Jamaican art and music amplifies Jack’s militant
                legacy of uncompromising resistance.</p>

            <p>In 2009, the same year Buju Banton was sentenced to ten years in prison, Marlon James
                published <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women,</hi> a
                grisly reimagining of Jamaican plantation slavery that insists upon and complicates
                Black agency in a system that rewards accommodation. James’s novel links
                thematically and geographically to Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> (and to Buju
                Banton), and it also echoes and revises key moments from <hi rend="italic">The

                            (“Marlon James”) for a thoughtful reading of James’s work. She discusses

                            but rather differed a great deal depending on their opinions on the
                            division between the natural and the supernatural” (51). See also

            <p>Much like Child’s <hi rend="italic">Joanna</hi>, Prince’s antislavery narrative
                underwent a complex editorial process, one that continues into the twenty-first
                century (Sinanan). Prince’s sponsor, Thomas Pringle (secretary of the Anti-Slavery
                Society), claimed that the illiterate Prince herself suggested to him the “idea of
                writing [her] history” so that “the good people in England might hear from a slave
                what a slave had felt and suffered” (3). Though Pringle claimed in his preface to
                Prince’s account that “no fact of importance” had been omitted or “a single
                circumstance or sentiment” added, his significant supplement offers materials that
                at once substantiate and contradict his defense of her character and the validity of
                her antislavery narrative.<note place="foot" resp="author"> When her enslaver, John Wood, refused to sell
                            Prince her manumission, the Anti-Slavery Society petitioned Parliament
                            (without success). The publication of her account prompted two
                            pro-slavery attacks and a subsequent series of civil suits. See Jenny
                            Sharpe (2002), Ferguson, and Todorova for discussions of the Prince
                            archive.</note> Subject to the Anti-Slavery Society’s notions
                of decency, Prince’s account itself (like Child’s <hi rend="italic">Joanna</hi>)
                reveals only insinuations of her sexual encounters, solicited and not, after it was
                transcribed and bowdlerized by the Methodist abolitionist Susanna Moodie and
                “pruned” (3) by Pringle.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Only in her later testimony in the court case that
                            her former owner, Wood, brought against Pringle (and won) did Prince
                            speak of her sexual relationships with the free Black man Oyskman and
                            the white Captain Abbot.</note></p>
                    
            <p>Prince’s narrative alludes to sexual assault by her “indecent” enslaver but goes no
                further than describing his “ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked” and
                ordering her “to wash him in a tub of water” (24). When she resisted, he would beat
                her severely, once prompting her to run away until the next morning. Prince’s
                account interweaves silences about rape with acts of resistance. Yet even as Prince
                censors her narrative to protect herself from allegations of promiscuity, Pringle
                included in his supplement a letter that mentions Prince’s sexual relationship with
                an unnamed “Capt.” and noted that “such connexions are so common” as to be almost
                universal (51). Pringle’s ambiguating supplemental materials gave my students the
                tools to piece together a version of her experience that reveals Black agency and
                exposes some of the truths (the “common connexions”) concealed by a white literary
                culture. But it was James’s deployment of Prince’s narrative in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Book of Night Women</hi> that students most fully engaged with. In his
                riveting novel, James adapts Prince’s bathtub incident to foreground rather than
                silence the violence of rape on the plantation, imagining, too, how revenge might
                look.</p>
                    
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women, </hi>the
                mixed-race protagonist, Lilith, spills hot soup on a visitor while serving dinner
                and endures daily lashings and a gang rape as punishment until her enslaver sends
                her to be seasoned by his future parents-in-law. At her new post, Lilith’s rage
                boils over, and when Massa Roget demands his bath-time sexual servicing (clearly
                evoking Prince), Lilith drowns him and sets fire to the house to hide the evidence,
                killing all its inhabitants, adults and children, enslaved and
                free. Despite this act,
                Lilith resists joining plans for a multi-plantation rebellion engineered by the
                enslaved head domestic, Homer, and Lilith’s half-sisters, the titular “Night Women.”
                Instead, Lilith becomes mistress to the new overseer, Robert Quinn, because she
                needs his protection from her previous tormentors. Already scarred with a “quilt” on
                her back, Lilith fears the fate of Homer, who once ran away, and when caught by
                Maroons, underwent a public flogging: “She cover up in scar big like animal stripe,
                her titties chop up and scar up so that is only nipple left to tell you that she
                born to suckle” (382). Under Quinn’s protection, Lilith suspects she can keep her
                own breasts intact and (like Joanna) covered. Ambivalent and with divided loyalties,
                Lilith at once accommodates and undermines the plantation system, oblivious to the
                contradictions that link her to the Maroons, whom the novel frequently criticizes
                for their collaboration with the British.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> In a process that involved written
                            documents and the ritual oath of drinking blood mixed with rum, the
                            British negotiated a treaty with the Maroons in 1739. The British and
                            Maroons held completely different notions about the treaty. The British
                            viewed it as the means to control the Maroons, and the infamous ninth
                            clause commits the Maroons to returning fugitives and putting down
                            island rebellions. For Maroons, the treaty celebrated their victory over
                            the English after eighty years of war. Many non-Maroon Jamaicans view
                            the Maroons as traitors because of the treaty, not unreasonably, driving
                            anti-Maroon sentiment in Jamaica today. MaMa G views the treaty as a
                            “trick,” informing my view of it as yet another example of English
                            methods of divide and conquer, pitting Afro-Jamaicans against one
                            another. For accounts of Maroon history, see Bilby, Campbell (1988),

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> reveals the brutalities as well as the
                contradictions of plantation slavery, a system that rewards accommodation. Even the
                rebellious Homer wrangles considerable power as head domestic, a position from which
                she gained access to literacy. When she teaches young Lilith to read, she explains,
                “Every time you open this [a book] you free” (57). Skilled in the spiritual as well
                as the literary arts, Homer practices obeah and myal, and she guides the Night Women
                in African-descended rituals that challenge European systems of power and knowledge.
                Homer works the system, using all tools available, and she, like Lilith, has thus
                become entangled with the power structure they resist.<note place="foot" resp="author"> New research on Ajami script

                tensions between literary and vernacular culture, invoking the dual relationship
                that Sylvia Wynter identifies between the “plantation” (the educated artist) and the
                “plot” (folk), particularly in its revelation of Lovey Quinn, Lilith’s daughter, in
                the final pages.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In “Novel and History, Plot and Plantation,” Wynter
                            argues that the history of Caribbean society “is that of a dual relation

                            originate in a single historical process” (99). In doing so they created
                            a folk culture that persists in resistant “secretive” histories,
                            expressed, for example, in folk songs, kumina practices, or myal rituals
                            (101). Wynter maintains that Caribbean literature registers the
                            ambivalence between the plot and the plantation but sees the ambivalence
                            as at once “the root cause of our alienation” as well as its “salvation”

                Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">Joseph Andrews</hi> (1742), and Edward Long’s <hi
                    rend="italic">The History of Jamaica</hi> (1774). Lovey remarks that Lilith
                taught her to write—“the most forbidden of thing”—so that “when the time come to
                write her song she have somebody true to be her witness” (426–7). Lovey uses her
                literacy to document the Night Women’s brave battles and violent deaths, learned
                through Homer and Lilith from songs devised and disseminated by Lilith’s
                half-sister, Gorgon; these songs celebrated the Night Women and scorned the white
                creoles, who tried but failed to contain their circulation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lilith and
                            Homer live out their post-rebellion lives neither free nor enslaved.
                            During the rebellion, Lilith saves her father instead of participating
                            in the destruction of the plantation, and afterward she remains in the
                            house and “live[s] like a free negro” though she is not free (422).
                            Injured almost to the point of death, Homer survives to live in the
                            shadow of the plantation, leaving behind her scent of lemongrass, hiding
                            forever after in the bush.</note> In large part a text about
                textual memory (as the title suggests) and its relationship to its folk counterpart,
                James’s narrative probes the complexities of telling stories about slavery, then and
                now.</p>
                    
            <p>The inclusion of
                <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women </hi>on my syllabus
                raised some eyebrows. Indeed, contemporary debates about content warnings in the
                classroom have in some cases prompted institutional resistance to exposing the
                gruesome details and residues of the Atlantic slave trade. Yet the study of texts
                about slavery should, with all due respect and sensitivity toward the experiences or
                traumas of students, confront and illuminate the historical realities that have
                shaped the anti-Blackness and structural racism of current cultures. My “note on
                content” in my syllabus acknowledges that these texts touch on the lived experiences
                of some students more than others, demanding respect and tolerance as we move
                through difficult material. James’s unapologetically graphic language and violent
                imagery understandably disturbed the students, but it also extended and enriched our
                ongoing conversation about the sanitization of representations of slavery.</p>
                    
            <p>Many of the students wrote their seminar papers about <hi rend="italic">The Book of
                    Night Women</hi>, because, they explained, they found it strangely compelling
                and unlike anything they had ever read. Almost every page reveals some devastating
                detail of slavery as James harrowingly pursues the elisions and ambivalences
                sometimes found even in overtly antislavery texts. James has been dubbed the
                “literary Tarantino” (the class also watched Quentin Tarantino’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Django Unchained</hi> [2012]), and as a gay Black Jamaican, James explains that
                he tries to complicate rather than ignore the island’s past and present violence,
                writing instead about “a Jamaica that never gets written” (as cited by Cain, n.
                pag.; see also Akbar). As an academic (a professor at Macalester College) and a
                Booker Prize–winning author, James occupies the space of the archive, but he uses
                that access to disrupt it, fully and critically aware of the contradictions
                    therein.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            James has blamed rejections of his work on the popularity of “cultural
                            ventriloquism” in fiction, where white authors write “in a ‘palatable’
                            way about countries and cultures of which they have no experience” (as
                            cited by Cain, n. pag.).</note></p>
                    
            <p>Critics have convincingly written about the “Power of the Neo-Slave Narrative Genre”
                and its ability to simultaneously attend to the past and future (Anim-Addo and Lima
                    6).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                            Anim-Adda and Lima’s special issue of <hi rend="italic">Callaloo</hi>
                            for a fantastic conversation about the genre. Invoking Stuart Hall, they
                            urge us to consider identity as a dynamic, always-constitutive
                            “production” (6). Their introduction (and the issue itself) nicely
                            theorizes and performs the power of the neo-slavery genre, calling
                            attention to its particular relevance to Black British writing as it
                            revises “the way in which British history is understood and remembered .
                            . . [by exploring] the continuing legacies of slavery into
                            twenty-first-century realities—economic and social inequity, racism, and
                            the impossibility of fully belonging—which suggests that it is only by
                            the full avowal of the past of slavery that the present might be
                            understood and the future imagined” (2).</note> I find James’s
                novel an especially useful though unsettling way to reconsider the history of
                slavery and its Romantic-period representations. Even arguably antislavery texts and
                politically aware interpretations of them reflect the structural racism of the
                institutions (nineteenth-century British plantation and/or literary culture and
                twenty-first-century academia, for example) that participate in the cultural
                production of race. In putting the creative expressions of contemporary Black
                culture in conversation with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary texts, I
                hope to move beyond glimpses of Black lives under slavery into broader landscapes
                that privilege Black agency, resistance, and life.</p>
                    
            <p>Interweaving different kinds of texts in new combinations, I conjure the spirit of
                tunyuhan and its commitment to creating new things from old materials. This idea is
                not new to Romanticism. Mary Shelley, for example, writes in her introduction to <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> (1831) that invention is borne out of chaos and
                “consists in . . . the power of moulding and <hi rend="italic">fashioning</hi> ideas
                suggested to it” (viii, emphasis added). As her novel shows, people tend to fear
                what they view to be “dark” or “shapeless,” but the modern academy generally, and
                the field of Romanticism particularly, could benefit from some creative if
                uncomfortable admixture to animate existing materials. Bakary Diaby has asked
                Romanticists to “do the work” to change the way we study Blackness in Romanticism
                (249). Until we have a new system (and I’m not holding my breath), we can experiment
                with and refashion the one we have.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 2020, I was going to take a group of students on a study abroad
                program to Jamaica, bringing my classroom into the field. Like most research and all
                conference travel that year, “Histories of Resistance in Jamaica” was cancelled by
                Covid-19. Instead, my institution asked me to develop a four-week online course that
                would give my students the Jamaica experience (!). Improvising with the medley of
                materials available to me (some from the class I just described), I created the
                course, including a public event using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra that featured
                MaMa G. Instead of the activities she and I had planned for my fifteen Jamaica-bound
                students, she gave an interactive workshop for forty students and faculty titled
                “Re-awakening the Knowledge and Wisdoms of Indigenous Women in Times of Covid-19.”
                With the (occasionally blurry) Ultra phone app and the Blue Mountains misting over
                the Asafu Yard, MaMa G created a unique virtual space for student engagement.</p>
                    
            <p>In a conversation that invoked the creative invention and adaptability of tunyuhan,
                MaMa G emphasized “Maroon principles of survival,” grafted from “knowledge [we]
                brought from Africa, learned from the [indigenous] Taino, and even now it continues”
                    (Simms).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            To protect students’ privacy the video capture of the Blackboard
                            Collaborate workshop is not publicly available; quotations in the text
                            were transcribed by the author.</note> Calling for a “shift in
                consciousness,” a “reawakening,” she urges a return to indigenous knowledge that
                values other cultures and respects the natural environment from which “we can always
                find a solution.” Wellness, she concluded, “comes from communication between body,
                earth, mind, spirit, and land—it’s all part of our healing.”</p>
                    
            <p>As teachers of texts about slavery, we can show students that its aftermaths are
                ongoing and interrelated, as demonstrated in part by the racism, police brutality,
                and unrest during the 2020 Covid-19 crisis, a public health catastrophe particularly
                critical for underserved Black communities. The creative and exciting global
                responses to these events signaled, as MaMa G suggests, an outcry and an opportunity
                for change. We can remake Romanticism, changing our approach to texts about slavery
                not only to confront and illuminate their violence and amnesia but also to
                incorporate and celebrate the “largeness that is Black life” (Christina Sharpe 17).
                If we want our institutions and disciplines to survive, we need to work with the
                materials we have to create something new and sustainable. Tun yuh han mek
