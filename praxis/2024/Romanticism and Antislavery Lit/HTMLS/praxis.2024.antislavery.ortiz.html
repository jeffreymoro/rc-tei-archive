            <p>In her recent essay about Mansfield Park (1814), Lynn Festa defines noise in Jane
               Austen’s novel as those sounds that we can hear but may not be linguistically legible,
               such as the cries of the Atlantic slave trade. This essay invites us to listen for
               noise in the soundscape of antislavery poetry. Focusing on the commonly overlooked
               tunes of ballads, I reveal the complicated politics of musical haunting in two canonical
               antislavery ballads: William Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and Hannah More’s
               “The Sorrows of Yamba” (1797). These ballads were set to the tune of an older song,
               Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), which mourns the deaths of thousands
               of English sailors from yellow fever in the Spanish West Indies. I model an exercise
               that invites readers to open their ears to the white noise in poetry about slavery
               and to think critically about the politics of formal, racial, and historical possession.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For those of us who study and teach the literature of slavery and abolition, listening
                     for silences as attentively as voices is a matter of ethical urgency. Since the publication
                     of Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern Speak?” (1988), critics who write about the
                     colonial and postcolonial world have been faced with the challenge of listening beyond
                     voice, which, in the texts we tend to teach, is so essentially constructed by and
                     for the Western subject. The problem with voice is its privilege—only few can speak,
                     and even fewer are actually heard. Silence too poses its own interpretive challenges.
                     We find the critical limitations of silence in Edward Said’s well-known interrogation
                     of Jane Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> (1814), a novel that notoriously dials down the volume on the subject of slavery and
                     empire that haunts its geographic and fictional borders. Critics have taken turns
                     defending Austen’s evident reserve on the slavery question in the novel.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a few excellent defenses of Austen on this front, see Boulukos; Ferguson, “Mansfield
                              Park”; and Fraiman.</span></div>
                     </div> Many have insisted that, if it is silent, Austen’s novel faithfully captures the taboo
                     nature of the theme in its own historical context and assumes an implicit contemporary
                     understanding of and sensitivity to the moral crisis at the center of the Bertram
                     estate.</p>
               </div>
               <p>More recently, however, Lynn Festa has proposed that in <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> Austen may not be asking us to listen for the omissions that fill the novel’s silences
                  so much as urging us to listen for what its <span style="font-style:italic">noise</span> might tell us: “For we may hear but we do not usually <span style="font-style:italic">listen</span> to noise. . . . For who listens to noise? We moderns consider having a voice as fundamental
                  to social and political representation, and silence is often equated with oppression”
                  (152, 154). As Festa distinguishes here, listening for noise means paying attention
                  to sounds we would otherwise block out because they are too raucous, inarticulate,
                  or inconvenient. And in <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, many things are noisy—the urbane Crawfords, the staging of <span style="font-style:italic">Lover’s Vows</span>, and, of course, Fanny Price’s questions about the slave trade at the dinner table.
                  Though Fanny’s timid inquiries about slavery threaten to disrupt the tranquility of
                  Mansfield Park, they hardly amount to the kind of political voice that Spivak problematizes,
                  nor do they qualify as silence within the terms of Said’s famous critique, even if
                  she is in fact silenced. If Fanny’s questions fall on deaf ears, it is not because
                  they do not echo in the room but because they travel at an inconvenient frequency.
                  “When Austen asks us to hear noise,” Festa observes, “she is asking us to recognize
                  that noise is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> simply what needs to be blocked out to hear the ‘real’ message, like the static that
                  makes the radio hard to hear. It may be something—in this respect, noise is like Fanny—that
                  we need to listen <span style="font-style:italic">for</span>” (153). In other words, listening for noise means being alert to the static in the
                  soundscape of the imperial world that so often escapes representation. Pondering the
                  marked noisiness of <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, Festa concludes that Austen implores us to open our ears to precisely this kind
                  of imperial static.</p>
               <p>In this essay I propose that we accept Festa’s invitation to listen for noise in the
                  literature of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world. Instead of attending to
                  fiction, however, I invite us to listen to the poetry that fills the archive. Poetry
                  is obviously rich in sound—meter, rhyme, alliteration, and so forth—but its <span style="font-style:italic">noise</span>, as Festa has defined it, is not always something that is heard or listened for.
                  Fortunately for us, the archive of slavery contains plenty of poetry, primarily because
                  abolitionists understood verse as a powerful medium that arouses the moral sentiments.
                  One of the most popular forms embraced by antislavery poets was the ballad, a poetic
                  genre that is particularly noisy because it reverberates a national history and an
                  oral tradition that is only rarely attended to. While balladeers construct a voice
                  (or voices) in their ballads, other historical noises haunt the form, including a
                  musical tradition. When I teach ballads by abolitionist poets like William Cowper
                  and Hannah More in my classroom, I begin by asking my students to examine the formal
                  and rhetorical strategies that these white writers used to construct enslaved Black
                  voices. Part of this exercise, however, requires that we listen beyond the constructed
                  voice found on the surface of the poem to the musical history that today only comes
                  through as static, or, as Festa proposes, as noise. Rarely do teachers of poetry pay
                  attention to ballad tune (or melody) but doing so can sometimes help clarify the political
                  stakes of a poem. In Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and More’s “The Sorrows
                  of Yamba” (1797), this musical dimension allows us to access a British imperial history
                  through a melody that enriches our political sense of these poems. For contemporaries
                  of Cowper and More, old ballad tunes might affect listeners given their own familiarity
                  with national songs, but for today’s readers of poetry tunes are more often than not
                  meaningless static. In what follows I consider the ballad’s media history as a kind
                  of meaningful noise that, in the context of British slavery and abolition, raises
                  important questions about the limits of political representation and voice for enslaved
                  subjects.</p>
               <p>I teach eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British antislavery ballads alongside
                  M. NourbeSe Philip’s astounding collection of poems, <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> (2008), which taps into a related but altogether distinct form of static—the noise
                  in the law. Philip’s title refers to the infamous eighteenth-century slave ship that
                  became the subject of a horrific and historic British legal case, <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span> (1783). The <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> witnessed the intentional mass drowning of over one hundred enslaved Africans in
                  order to claim an insurance policy on its human cargo, a great fraction of which had
                  become sick at sea from disease or malnourishment. When the insurance company refused
                  to pay out the claim on the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span>’s enslaved cargo, William Gregson and his syndicate brought the case to trial. While
                  technically tried as a disagreement about an insurance policy, the case opened up
                  a host of ethical questions regarding the treatment of the enslaved at sea. The chief
                  justice, Lord Mansfield, who presided over several landmark cases devoted to the slave
                  trade, ultimately ruled against the owners of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> on a technicality—evidence arose in the ship’s log that rainfall had ameliorated
                  the water shortage that Gregson and his crew claimed made the cargo disposable. Philip’s
                  extraordinary project in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> is to listen for the noise of slavery in the legal documents of <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span> and to reconstruct poems using only that language to offer testimony that was inadmissible
                  at the time of the trial, testimony that could only be dismissed as legal noise. My
                  aim in pairing antislavery and contemporary poems in this class is to underscore the
                  precarity of political voice in the slavery archive. To this end I engage my students
                  in a conversation about the limits of poetic justice in verse about transatlantic
                  slavery by uncovering the profound historical and interpretive potential of what I
                  have outlined here as noise.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Ballad Noise</span></h2>
               <p>The task of listening for noise in antislavery ballads is perhaps more challenging
                  than in a study of fiction because, of course, poetry is so noisy. At the same time,
                  critics and teachers of poetry are used to being attentive to sounds that students
                  or lay readers may not listen for. Beyond listening to narrative or voice in poetry,
                  there is also meter, rhythm, rhyme, and alliteration, frequent topics of discussion
                  in any class on poetry. In the case of the ballad, however, there is also tune. Music
                  is often overlooked because the literary study of the ballad tradition since the nineteenth
                  century deprioritized tune in favor of qualities like lyric voice, a shift that all
                  but rendered tune an inconsequential noise. Prior to the nineteenth century, however,
                  printed ballads were understood as lyrics accompanied by a musical score that functioned
                  as a deeply meaningful dimension to any ballad. Music works on us in a way that precedes
                  cognition and can possess us like a spirit from without. In the ballad tradition tunes
                  were recycled for new poems, which meant that modern ballads often carried a tune
                  from a much older song. This detail in the ballad’s media history places the genre
                  in a special category in the poetic tradition because ballads carry a musical past
                  that is now commonly ignored as <span style="font-style:italic">noise</span>.</p>
               <p>Two canonical eighteenth-century antislavery ballads carry an old tune that we should
                  listen for: Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” and More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba.” The
                  old song these poems echo is Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), a naval
                  ballad written during the Walpole era that celebrates a military victory in the Spanish
                  West Indies and mourns the tragic and avoidable loss of thousands of English sailors
                  to yellow fever on those waters. In Glover’s political ballad, the ghosts of these
                  sailors call out to the reader or listener to be remembered for their service and
                  sacrifice. In my classroom I invite my students to listen to Glover’s song, and I
                  ask them what it might mean that the enslaved Black voices constructed by Cowper and
                  More are mediated and amplified by a tune about thousands of white English sailors
                  who perished at sea. Why would Cowper and More make such a formal decision? And what
                  are some of the challenges that this decision poses for the political and literary
                  representation of enslaved Africans during the abolition debate? In other words, I
                  ask how we might read “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as a kind of meaningful noise.</p>
               <p>All of these questions stem from a common problem—<span style="font-style:italic">mediation</span>. Fortunately for us, the thematic ghostliness of Glover’s ballad allows us to bring
                  all of the ways in which mediation is in play into clear focus. The most obvious starting
                  point is thinking about the ballad as a poetic medium, not only in terms of the layered
                  musical and lyrical richness I’ve already described but also as an oral form that
                  migrated into print culture in the late eighteenth century as collections like Thomas
                  Percy’s <span style="font-style:italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> (1765) were assembled. In fact, Percy included Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                  in his popular compendium of national songs. As Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane
                  have observed, poets of Cowper’s generation participated in finding a middle ground
                  between oral and printed ballad forms in crafting new ballads during a period of media
                  transition (242). Indeed, Cowper and More are members of the last generation of poets
                  that seriously and intentionally engage the musical dimension of the ballad.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Another way to think about mediation in these poems is in spiritual terms. Mediums,
                     after all, are those persons who channel spirits from another world to our own. In
                     “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover performs the task of giving voice to the sailors
                     haunting that poem. In the later antislavery ballads that carry its tune, the enslaved
                     speakers function as another kind of medium altogether in their reverberation of the
                     older naval song. These enslaved subjects both echo and jar against the voices of
                     the sailors in Glover’s poem because their historical situations couldn’t be more
                     different.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This conflation between sailor and slave may recall Robert Southey’s “The Sailor who
                              had Served in the Slave Trade” (1798). In this ballad narrative, a sailor returns
                              to England from the “slave-coast” (110) traumatized by having been forced to beat
                              a female slave to death. Southey’s narrative exposes the communal trauma suffered
                              by everyone who participates in the institution of slavery, but he also reveals the
                              extent to which men like this sailor may similarly be deprived of their will. While
                              in Cowper’s and More’s ballads the slave speakers are haunted by music expressing
                              the plaints of dead…</span></div>
                     </div> Further still, Cowper and More act as mediums for <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> the Black voices they represent <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the ghosts of Glover’s ballad. When I present the layered and haunted quality of these
                     ballads in my classroom, my students are often surprised and provoked by the racial
                     complexity of the voices they hear—the enslaved African speakers are politically mediated
                     by both white poets and the spirits of white British sailors.

                              Poetry (2011), has identified in the remediation of songs by Africans and Native Americans
                              collected from imperial borders (108). McLane examines ballads like Mungo Park’s “Negro’s

                  in the later soundscapes of “The Negro’s Complaint” and “The Sorrows of Yamba.” In
                  media studies, the term <span style="font-style:italic">white noise</span> refers to static that exceeds the intended signal or message being transmitted. In
                  the antislavery ballad tradition, I’m interested in thinking not only about music
                  or tune as white noise in academic studies of the ballad but also in the racial implications
                  of this music—the whiteness of the voices amplifying Black, enslaved speakers. Beyond
                  this ghostly musical mediation, these poems also exhibit a kind of possession that
                  is intrinsic to the ballad form. As Susan Stewart argues in her essay “Lyric Possession,”
                  poets who write ballads are implicitly possessed by a national history as they broadcast
                  an oral tradition in their revision of older songs. “Of all the singers of Western
                  lyric,” Stewart writes, “the ballad singer is the one most radically haunted by others,
                  for he or she presents the gestures, the symptoms, of a range of social actors, and
                  he or she presents those gestures as symptoms of a previous action” (41). In other
                  words, haunting is a formal process native to the very composition of ballads. The
                  poet functions as a medium for historical action in their embodied composition of
                  a new song according to an older musical and metrical schema. Stewart calls this “the
                  submersion of will within convention” (40). In the poems we are dealing with, however,
                  possession is just as political as it is formal insofar as they condemn an institution
                  that supports the deprivation of human will. Bound by the formal imperatives of the
                  ballad tradition, Cowper and More become strange mediums and precarious political
                  representatives in their attempts to embody the experience of enslaved persons while
                  conjuring a formal and national history. Moreover, the voices we find ringing in the
                  ballads form a strange and spectral chorus of competing political pleas.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As scholars like Simon Gikandi, Laura Doyle, and Ian Baucom argue, the archive of
                     Atlantic slavery is hauntological and generically marked by the gothic. One of the
                     Afro-Caribbean spiritual practices that I share with my students in our discussion
                     of lyric possession is <span style="font-style:italic">obeah</span>, a common ritual among early slave communities in the West Indies. As Alan Richardson
                     reveals in “Romantic Voodoo,” obeah was a slave practice that struck fear among the
                     British in the Caribbean and in England after it began to appear in popular fiction
                     and poetry in the late eighteenth century, as we find in William Earle’s sensational
                     novel about obeah and the Jamaican folk hero Jack Mansong, <span style="font-style:italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack </span>(1800).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Alan Richardson proposes, representations of obeah increased anxiety and agitation
                              in the wake of slave uprisings (“Romantic Voodoo”). The politics of lyric possession
                              we find in the antislavery ballad seems in dialogue with charged spiritual practices
                              like obeah.</span></div>
                     </div> Accounts of obeah rituals also filled popular histories of the West Indies, including
                     Edward Long’s <span style="font-style:italic">History of Jamaica</span> (1774). These representations amplified colonial anxiety in the wake of slave rebellions
                     in the West Indies and exacerbated national tensions generated by political revolutions
                     in France, Haiti, and America. For our purposes, however, obeah might be considered
                     as one form of imperial noise that echoed within British cultural production about
                     slavery at this time. In its investment in ritual and incantation, we might also think
                     about obeah as an Afro-Caribbean analogue to lyric possession, as we see in William
                     Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation” (1797). In this poem, Shepherd parrots an obi priest
                     via the ode form as he calls for “the white man’s doom” by spurring a slave insurgency
                     using material rituals and lyric conjuring: 
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">Haste! the magic shreds prepare—</div>
                        <div class="l">Thus the white man’s corse we tear.</div>
                        <div class="l">Lo! feathers from the raven’s plume,</div>
                        <div class="l">That croaks our proud Oppressor’s doom.</div>
                        <div class="l">Now to aid the potent spell,</div>
                        <div class="l">Crush we next the brittle shell—</div>
                        <div class="l">Fearful omen to the foe,</div>
                        <div class="l">Look! the blanched bones we throw. (lines 25–32)</div>
                     </div> If the lyric possession we find in ballads by Cowper and More summons the specters
                     of British imperial history through music, Shepherd invokes the spirit of obeah to
                     craft a political ode designed to raise alarm about racial and imperial tensions in
                     the West Indies. Discussing obeah alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s own incantatory poetics
                     raises fascinating questions about the limits of Western poetic forms like the ballad
                     or the ode when framing historical Black voices. As Philip argues in her essay “Notanda”
                     (included in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span>), the project of rescuing enslaved Black voices from the history of British law required
                     a poetic approach that exceeded the rationality of Western forms. The poems generated
                     by Philip’s “irrational” approach to historical texts seem to echo the radical shamanistic
                     practice of obeah in colonial life in ways that feel historically authentic and politically
                     effective. Form, Philip teaches us, can sometimes speak so loudly as to drown out
                     the voices that poetry is meant to broadcast. I will return to obeah in the next section.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By reading British antislavery and naval ballads together with my students, I aim
                  to accomplish several things. First, I demonstrate how a Black voice is constructed
                  in an antislavery ballad and generate discussion around the politics of that construction
                  with special attention to the rhetoric of voice in each poem. Second, I teach my students
                  about ballad form and its media history, including the element of music so often overlooked
                  in the study of the ballad. Next, I share the political history of Glover’s “Admiral
                  Hosier’s Ghost” and comment on how it intersects with British transatlantic slavery.
                  My goal at the end of these exercises is to invite students to think critically about
                  what it means for Cowper and More to have chosen Glover’s song as a tune and a spirit
                  for the voices of enslaved Black subjects in their poems.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>My approach to these complex poems in the classroom is first to invite my students
                     to close-read Cowper’s and More’s ballads together while paying close attention to
                     voice. Whose voice(s) are we hearing? And, who is listening? I remind them that these
                     are lyric poems by white English writers who construct an African subject and voice
                     for an English audience. Our first exercise is to deconstruct that voice to understand
                     the rhetorical strategies at work in the two poems, which are distinct in both message
                     and approach. We find that Cowper’s African speaker makes a rational plea for liberation
                     and challenges the reader to examine his or her own sense of justice in the face of
                     the appeal. More’s Yamba, on the other hand, offers a much more sentimental and sympathetic
                     voice whose tragic story is designed to appeal to our moral feelings. Moreover, Yamba
                     echoes an Evangelical narrative in her turning to a missionary to find solace in a
                     Christian life and its teachings. To shed light on each poet’s rhetorical strategy,
                     I offer up biographical details about Cowper and More that give us some insight, including
                     Cowper’s religious mania and isolation and More’s commitment to practical and religious
                     teachings for the working-class public in writings like the Cheap Repository Tracts
                     series (where “Yamba” appeared). These biographical details help students understand
                     that there are personal traces of Cowper and More in the Black voices they construct

                              constructed in the abolition ballad. Richardson has exposed a fascinating conflict
                              of authorial voice in the poem’s textual history. According to Richardson, the poem
                              was originally penned by a minor Scottish poet, Eaglesfield Smith, and first published
                              in Universal Magazine in 1797; it was subsequently expanded by More in an anonymous
                              republication in the highly popular Cheap Repository Tracts series, which promoted
                              middle-class values of religious and social obedience. Such mixed and unstable authorship
                              undersc…</span></div>
                     </div> One of the awkward attunements we find in More’s poem is that it displays an attempt
                     at Afro-Caribbean dialect. This is common among ballads in the abolition archive and
                     significant because ballads must also adhere to the genre’s metrical patterns. What
                     does it mean, I ask my students, that poets attempted dialect while at the same time
                     accommodating the voice to English ballad meter? Finally, I contextualize the poems
                     in the wider historical landscape, pointing out that More’s poem was composed after
                     the beginning of the French and Haitian revolutions, which may account for its more
                     conservative tone and narrative. I often generate discussion around the political
                     efficacy of each ballad by asking students to compare their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Because these poems were distributed as broadsides and our attention is on ballad
                  media, I share images of both broadsides with my students. As popular forms, broadsides
                  were inexpensive literature and news media that circulated widely in town centers
                  (coffee houses and taverns, for example) and eventually migrated out into the country.
                  As the historian of abolition Brycchan Carey has shown, a ballad reproduced on broadsheets
                  could circulate rapidly, particularly if the ballad was set to a recognizable form
                  and tune (100). Abolitionists working with the Society for Effecting the Abolition
                  of the Slave Trade understood the importance of inexpensive print materials as they
                  sought to reach a wide popular audience, and the broadside was an ideal vehicle for
                  their message. The broadsides printed for Cowper’s and More’s ballads usually advertised
                  “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as the tune for their poems underneath the title. Glover’s
                  song was a popular tune that one might hear played in an eighteenth-century drawing
                  room, and so I make sure to play a recording of the song, accessible to everyone on
                  YouTube (Craig), in my classroom. The purpose of this demonstration is to immerse
                  my students in the ballad’s media history. In the past I have even printed the ballads
                  on single sheets so that students might read the poems as the tune plays. Once students
                  hear the tune, they are immediately struck by the awkwardness of framing an enslaved
                  voice in the tunes and metrical frameworks of polite society. A productive conversation
                  can emerge from reflecting on the aesthetic effects of these formal choices when students
                  are reminded of the intended British audience and the sensitive political debate around
                  slavery happening at the time. In order for the British public to connect and sympathize
                  with an enslaved African subject, that subject needed to sound as British as possible.</p>
               <p>Next, we turn to the broadside for “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” which features a striking
                  political cartoon of maritime specters rising from the Caribbean Sea. I offer my students
                  an account of the dynamic political climate surrounding Glover’s poem and some details
                  about Glover himself. Descended from the merchant class in London, Glover supported
                  the financial interests of trading companies that trafficked across the Atlantic,
                  including companies that bought and sold African slaves (Baines). In the early eighteenth
                  century, British trading vessels were routinely attacked and raided by Spanish ships.
                  Because Robert Walpole was reluctant to go to war with Spain at this time, London
                  merchants heavily criticized his lack of aggression against Spanish interference in
                  the West Indies (Rodger 234). When Walpole sent Vice-Admiral Francis Hosier and his
                  fleet to conduct a blockade along the mosquito-infested waters off Porto Bello, a
                  Spanish settlement in what is now Panama, in 1726, over three thousand sailors contracted
                  yellow fever and died. Seeing his opportunity to criticize Walpole, Glover drafted
                  “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” to remind the British public of the fatal consequences of
                  Walpole’s refusal simply to overtake the Spanish port. In the poem, Hosier’s spirit
                  rises from the waters near Porto Bello to relate his melancholy tale to Admiral Edward
                  Vernon, who successfully sacked Porto Bello twelve years later, in 1739. The ballad
                  thus mourns the lives of the sailors lost at Porto Bello due to Walpole’s military
                  failure, while celebrating Vernon’s later victory for Britain.</p>

               </div>
               <p>In “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover’s strategy is to exhume recent history from the
                  sea for political purposes, which is also the strategy employed by Cowper and More
                  in their later antislavery ballads. When we read the poem in the classroom, I ask
                  students to consider the dead sailors’ spectral plea to be remembered for their sacrifice
                  in the midst of imperial triumph. Hosier’s ghost rises from the waters and addresses
                  the victorious Vernon on behalf of his crew: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">See these mournful Spectres sweeping,</div>
                  <div class="l">Ghastly, o’er this hated wave,</div>
                  <div class="l">Whose wan Cheeks are stain’d with weeping:</div>
                  <div class="l">These were English Captains brave:</div>
                  <div class="l">Mark those Numbers pale and horrid,</div>
                  <div class="l">Who were once my sailors bold,</div>
                  <div class="l">Lo, each hangs his drooping Forehead,</div>
                  <div class="l">While his dismal Fate is told. (lines 32–40)</div>
               </div>
               <p> I ask my students to think about what this plea for remembrance means when the tune
                  of Glover’s poem transfers the sentiment to the tongue of the enslaved speaker in
                  Cowper’s and More’s later ballads. As a way to think through this question, I offer
                  more historical context on Porto Bello. In the early eighteenth century, Porto Bello
                  was a major Spanish outpost for the slave trade, and historians reveal that many slaves
                  in the region suffered and died of the very yellow fever that claimed Hosier and his
                  men (Lohse 74–109). While it is not at all surprising that these African voices are
                  not heard in Glover’s ballad, it is significant that Cowper and More later give voice
                  to their own enslaved speakers by echoing, at least musically, the voices of the sailors
                  from that original ballad. In other words, the noise of slavery ringing in Porto Bello
                  was muted in Glover’s ballad and only becomes audible in the antislavery ballads that
                  recycle its tune decades later. One other important detail to emphasize in discussing
                  the poem is that while Glover’s song is elegiac in tone, it actually celebrates Vernon’s
                  victory and imperial expansion in the Caribbean and implicitly supports the trading
                  interests of companies trafficking in enslaved bodies at that time. In this light,
                  “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” seems out of tune with the political message of the later
                  antislavery ballads that echo its music. Discussing Cowper’s and More’s potential
                  motivation for this awkward decision with students is a generative exercise. While
                  the melancholy tone and maritime context certainly seem appropriate, the actual politics
                  of Glover’s song—the zeal for the expansion of empire—seems dissonant with that of
                  the antislavery lyrics. One explanation that may be offered is that the poets sought
                  to reform the imperial economic impulse of Glover’s song by purging it of the moral
                  stain of slavery and overwriting its voices with those of the disenfranchised.</p>
               <p>Coming back to the question of voice can help students understand the real limitations
                  of political sympathy in this context. Whose voice(s) do we hear in these poems, and
                  why does it matter? The white noise we hear in antislavery ballads by Cowper and More
                  is, after all, the spectral chorus of Glover’s song. It is likely that these poets
                  chose Glover’s tune to strengthen sympathy for their enslaved African subjects. However,
                  as Saidiya Hartman has proposed in <span style="font-style:italic">Scenes of Subjection</span> (1997), sympathy in the literature of slavery and abolition can be as destructive
                  a mechanism as it is humanizing. While we typically understand sympathy as our best
                  means of human connection, it can often obliterate otherness in the process because
                  it “fails to expand the space of the other and merely places the self in its stead”
                  (20). The abolitionist project is often criticized for the ways in which the literature
                  it produced whitewashed its enslaved African subjects, a transformation that seemed
                  necessary for political reform at the time. Choosing Glover’s tune for their ballads,
                  Cowper and More hoped to tap into a well of melancholy about the loss of English sailors
                  during a major event in English imperial history. In doing so, they sought to facilitate
                  as much sympathy as possible, but that mediation certainly comes at the cost of an
                  authentic encounter with human otherness. To encounter otherness more directly would
                  require a recognition of the limitations of sympathy, given our own national, racial,
                  and gendered identity. It would also require an understanding of the limitations of
                  the British abolitionist archive, which might be supplemented by West African or Caribbean
                  texts that may have seemed alien to the British public—and particularly genres less
                  mediated by abolitionist leaders, such as African music and song.</p>
               <p>Another complication with respect to sympathy is the difference in situation between
                  an encounter with one voice as opposed to many. While it seems natural to feel a more
                  powerful sympathy for an individual, these sonically layered poems do in fact conjure
                  a chorus of voices. Philip’s contemporary poetry collection <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> develops this problem by refusing to construct individual voices altogether. Instead,
                  her poems about slavery are fragments of voices rescued from the language of history
                  and the law. White noise thus forms the polyphonic text of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> collection, allowing Philip to foreground the absence of enslaved voices in the archive
                  while preserving the language of <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span>. Engaging these cacophonous and irrational poems, sympathy seems impossible and perhaps
                  beside the point. In <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> Philip transforms the noise in the law surrounding the horrific <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre into a kind of poetry whose aim is not to generate sympathy but to stage
                  an ethical encounter with the victims of history that is as irrational as the event
                  itself.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. Listening for Noise in the Law</span></h2>
               <p>I ask my students to think about noise and formal haunting in a slightly different
                  way when we turn to Philip’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> collection, which was inspired by a similar scene and situation. Both the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre and the deadly plague in Porto Bello featured in “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                  are tragic and melancholy episodes in British imperial history. However, Philip’s
                  poetic approach to history is vastly different from that of Cowper and More. As an
                  Afro-Canadian attorney as well as a poet, Philip’s shared interests in the history
                  of transatlantic slavery and the law drew her to the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre. Philip’s project in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> is to listen to the noise in the legal documents of <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span> and to make that noise available to readers as poetic language. This involves mutilating
                  the text of Lord Mansfield’s decision in that case and using it as a repository of
                  language to reconstitute traces of the voices of the enslaved muzzled by the legal
                  proceedings. While Mansfield famously expressed personal disgust with the institution
                  of slavery, the conventions of the law prevented him from writing a decision that
                  recognized the enslaved Africans in question as legal or political subjects. Part
                  of Philip’s challenge in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span>, then, is to use that same language to attempt to give voice and reconstitute subjectivity,
                  even if only in a fragmentary way.</p>
               <p>Understanding that the task of mediating individual voices is impossible and perhaps
                  ethically problematic, Philip allows testimony to come through as linguistic noise.
                  We might say she is attempting to reconstruct historical subjectivity <span style="font-style:italic">as noise</span>. In “Notanda,” she explains her process and tracks her difficult journey making sense
                  of the case. She begins with this statement: “There is no telling this story; it must
                  be told” (189). What she means is that to render the story of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> in poetic narrative would be impossible because it absolutely resists narration.
                  And yet, it must be told. The problem as Philip sees it is that the horrors of the
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre resist logic and rationality, and no sense could possibly be made from a
                  mere accounting of the details of the story or from listening to any one historical
                  perspective. Her solution is to commit herself to the irrational because the event
                  itself was irrational. Only by “not-telling,” then, can the story be told. The “not-telling”
                  involves fragmenting the story told by the law and letting the noise in the legal
                  archive come through <span style="font-style:italic">as noise</span> instead of as potentially meaningful silence. Because Philip is not interested in
                  a single voice or testimony (as Cowper and More are), I ask my students to consider
                  what the fragmentation of language accomplishes that a ballad narrative cannot. Ultimately,
                  I am interested in what kinds of justice, poetic or otherwise, emerge in each of these
                  poems and what obstacles lie in the way of that justice.</p>
               <p>Aside from assigning the first section of Philip’s collection, called “Os,” I also
                  ask my students to read her essay “Notanda,” as well as Lord Mansfield’s brief decision
                  in <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span>, both of which are included at the end of Philip’s collection. The form that noise
                  takes in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> is the violent disordering of legal language: “I murder the text, literally cut it
                  into pieces, castrating verbs, suffocating adjectives, murdering nouns, throwing articles,
                  prepositions, conjunctions overboard, jettisoning adverbs: . . . [I] create semantic
                  mayhem,” she writes (193). The poems reconstructed from this mutilated language are
                  spare and wild word arrangements on the page, liberated entirely from the restrictions
                  of grammar and form. They can be read horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, either
                  from top to bottom or the reverse. The thoughts and ideas that the word arrangements
                  generate are not only specters of the transatlantic slave trade, they are also the
                  dark matter of the law. If the law employs language to create order and meaning in
                  the realm of human action, poetry can, Philip suggests, “engage language that is neither
                  rational, logical, predictable, or ordered” (197). By subverting the legal language
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert </span>in an act of poetic violence, Philip conjures the shadows surrounding the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre to access the human sounds obscured by the trial: “<span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> bears witness to the ‘resurfacing of the drowned and the oppressed’ and transforms
                  the desiccated legal report into a cacophony of voices—wails, cries, moans, and shouts
                  that had earlier been banned from the text” (203). Unlike the singular voices constructed
                  in the abolition ballads by Cowper and More, Philip’s voices are plural, fragmented,
                  and just barely articulate. They do not tell a story as those ballads do; instead,
                  they echo the senselessness of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre in language that never really settles into a coherent account. Philip’s
                  poems are thus fragments of voices that bubble up to the surface from the sea of history.</p>
               <p>Because Philip’s poems begin from a place of abstraction, they pose many interpretive
                  challenges for scholars and students alike. As spare word arrangements floating on
                  the white page, Philip’s text encourages a kind of reading that breaks free from tradition.
                  Instead of following a narrative thread, or even one channel of abstract thought along
                  a single verse, the language of the poem surfaces at random as ideas, images, and
                  concepts catch the reader’s attention. There is no order or story to discern in the
                  poems—only fragments of voice and thought rescued from the restrictive legal documents
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</span>. While the poems are challenging in their abstraction, they also present teachers
                  with a rich opportunity for conversation in the classroom. Breaking the class into
                  small groups, each of which spends time with one poem, can be especially productive.
                  The groups might spend ten or fifteen minutes lingering with one poem and taking notes.
                  Students make a collective list of the words, phrases, statements, or ideas that come
                  through the language on the page. Each group then considers and discusses what the
                  poem wants the reader to receive. After the exercise, we come back together as a class
                  and project each poem on the screen, one at a time, for everyone to see. Individual
                  groups review their notes with the class and report on what the poem spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Before each group reports back to the whole class, I like to revisit Philip’s journal
                  entry from July 12, 2002, which she includes in “Notanda.” Reading this entry informs
                  our understanding of the element of haunting involved in Philip’s process of composition,
                  which complicates my students’ sense of poetic agency: </p>

               <p> This journal entry describes a conjuring. Philip’s process recalls a form of lyric
                  possession described by Susan Stewart, but one that is markedly different as well.
                  While the possession Stewart describes involves submitting one’s will to convention
                  and to the irrationality of tune and meter, Philip is not plugging into the poetic
                  tradition of the balladeer. She has a much more difficult task—to listen to the noise
                  beyond the medium of the law for the voices silenced by the law, as if she were listening
                  to voices under water. Philip burns incense, prepares herself for a visitation, and
                  allows the words to “suggest how to work with them.” In listening for this kind of
                  noise, Philip becomes a scribe for a story that can’t be told. Moreover, by submitting
                  herself to ritual practice—burning incense—while listening to the British legal texts
                  for the words to “leap out” at her, Philip’s process recalls the conjuring involved
                  in obeah incantation. What makes this ritual unique, however, is its application of
                  spiritual conjuring to the interpretation of British law. In this context, as an Afro-Canadian
                  poet, Philip mediates the hauntological much like Cowper or More. It might be productive
                  during this exercise to introduce Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation,” which adopts
                  the ode form to frame a Black obi voice, to underscore the radical significance of
                  Philip’s approach. While Shepherd’s poem does capture the voice of Black colonial
                  resistance, that voice is clearly bound by a white Western formal poetics. In Philip’s
                  poems, however, Black voices are conjured and allowed to float freely on the page
                  to make their own kind of noise, resisting the demands of a unified and coherent Western
                  lyric subjectivity. This approach does justice to the historical denial of testimony
                  by enslaved Black peoples in the discourse of the law while offering them a different
                  kind of testimony, one that falls short of political voice but transcends legal silence.</p>
               <p>What students may realize during their own reading experience is that it resembles
                  Philip’s process of composition. That is, just as the words suggested their own arrangement
                  to the poet, they also offer up bits of meaning in dynamic configurations in the process
                  of reading. Moreover, students may observe that the poems do not only echo slave voices
                  crying out but also offer up concepts from the legal texts that are up for critique
                  or condemnation. Such configurations, when framed by the blinding whiteness of the
                  page, arouse a horror that would be difficult to recognize if embedded in the original
                  context. The work of making noise available to readers, Philip seems to suggest, sometimes
                  involves dialing down the message of most of the original document(s) to make more
                  audible those parts that we should linger on.</p>
               <p>After each group presents their reflections to the class, I ask my students to critique
                  Philip’s project and her creative/destructive dialogue between poetry and the law.
                  I ask them what poetic justice means in a project like <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> Does it matter that there is no single voice, or testimony, or point of view? Does
                  abstraction get in the way of the story that “can’t be told”? I also ask them to compare
                  the kinds of justice achieved by Cowper and More in their antislavery ballads. Those
                  poems are unified voices and narratives and communicate a message that is intelligible
                  and digestible for readers. Moreover, they allow the reader to engage in (or at least
                  perform) acts of sympathy with the speakers in the poems. At the same time, they feature
                  other voices (the sailors in Glover’s song) by way of music—is sympathy possible there?
                  Or is music so subliminal that it bypasses sympathy? The most important question to
                  ask about <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> is whether sympathy is possible in such fragmented language. If sympathy can’t be
                  generated, what is achieved by Philip? Whatever it is, is it more powerful than sympathy?
                  If so, why?</p>
               <p>One of the memorable classroom conversations that has emerged from this series of
                  questions is one about the similarities between sympathy and haunting. If, as Adam
                  Smith famously theorized, sympathy is a projective mechanism whereby we imagine ourselves
                  in the place of the other, it is by its very nature a kind of possession. In Cowper’s
                  and More’s poems, the performance of sympathy in connecting to the enslaved African
                  experience may seem like haunting, but it may also be read as another form of colonization
                  in which English sensibilities inhabit the bodies of others. At the same time, their
                  use of Glover’s tune reminds us how unavoidably intertwined our histories are in a
                  colonial narrative. In Philip’s project, however, haunting could never function as
                  sympathy, for sympathy requires a coherent narrative or representation with which
                  to identify. How do we connect to a story that can’t be told? The <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> poems facilitate a haunting in the reading experience that does not require the exchange
                  of subjectivity we find in sympathy. We could never, after all, embody the experience
                  of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre. Instead of hearing voices or testimonies from the sea of history, we can
                  only listen to noise. Being attentive to that noise offers us, according to Philip,
                  a more expansive ethical relationship to our traumatic past.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As a final exercise, one may introduce a group reflection devoted to visual noise
                     by examining the political cartoon presented in Glover’s broadside alongside J. M.
                     W. Turner’s famous painting <span style="font-style:italic">The Slave Ship</span> (1840), which Ian Baucom considers at length in his landmark study, <span style="font-style:italic">Specters of the Atlantic</span> (2005). Both images capture melancholy scenes in Britain’s maritime history, and both
                     are commentaries on empire. Moreover, they are both haunting seascapes that conjure
                     the dead from below the water’s surface. Perhaps the most significant difference,
                     however, is the representation of the dead. While Glover’s broadside gives clear individuality
                     and outline to the spirits of the sailors who perished during Hosier’s blockade of
                     Porto Bello, Turner’s drowned slaves dissolve in the sea. Pictorially, the slaves
                     in Turner’s picture lack distinction, and the eye must strain to identify individual
                     persons in the obscure detailing in the painting. Turner could have chosen to capture
                     a scene of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span>’s slaves being thrown overboard, as his original title suggests, but he chose instead
                     to eliminate identifiable human bodies from his work altogether. Human life is hauntingly
                     signaled by red and orange color in the water.

               </div>
               <p>What does it mean, one could ask the class, that the sailors of Hosier’s expedition
                  receive individuality and voice as they address the victorious Admiral Vernon, who
                  triumphantly captures Porto Bello with ships that proudly display the flag of Britannia?
                  And what does it mean that in Turner’s painting the slaves thrown overboard become
                  one with the sea in a horrifying, swelling tide of color and light? What is the power
                  of Turner’s decision to abstract the human bodies in the water beyond recognition?
                  After a conversation about this pictorial distinction, one could observe that these
                  two images strikingly reflect the differences in representation we find between the
                  abolition ballads by Cowper and More and Philip’s fragmented voices in <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> In the latter, there is no lyric voice or identity to be distinguished in the text,
                  only traces of subjectivity floating on the page. Visually, Turner found abstraction
                  to be appropriate for an event so lacking in humanity. Why is that? While a clear
                  picture of the atrocity is unavailable to us in Turner’s painting, the vibrant fragments
                  in the water certainly come through as an alarming form of noise.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">This conflation between sailor and slave may recall Robert Southey’s “The Sailor who
               had Served in the Slave Trade” (1798). In this ballad narrative, a sailor returns
               to England from the “slave-coast” (110) traumatized by having been forced to beat
               a female slave to death. Southey’s narrative exposes the communal trauma suffered
               by everyone who participates in the institution of slavery, but he also reveals the
               extent to which men like this sailor may similarly be deprived of their will. While
               in Cowper’s and More’s ballads the slave speakers are haunted by music expressing
               the plaints of dead sailors in Glover’s song, Southey’s sailor is haunted by the enslaved
               victim he was compelled to torture.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The relaying of voice found in Cowper’s and More’s ballads offers a related but contrasting
               example of what Maureen McLane, in <span style="font-style:italic">Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of Romantic Poetry</span> (2011), has identified in the remediation of songs by Africans and Native Americans
               collected from imperial borders (108). McLane examines ballads like Mungo Park’s “Negro’s
               Song” and Anne Home Hunter’s “Cherokee Death Song,” published in Joseph Ritson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Select Collection of English Songs</span> (1783), as examples of authentic African and American ditties returned to England,
               where they are versified and set to music. This process of remediation traces the
               migration of the song as it crosses imperial boundaries, where the musical instruments
               and poetic forms of polite society transform it for the English ear. Unlike these
               cases of English lyricists bringing home tunes from imperial territories for remediation,
               Cowper’s and More’s ballads are English songs dispatched across the Atlantic and placed
               in the mouths of African slaves. But this dispatch, oddly enough, returns to the scene
               of Hosier’s tragedy. Thus “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” which experienced its own transatlantic
               vocalization, uncannily wanders back to its place of origin—the Atlantic—only to be
               revocalized by a foreign, racialized body for new political purposes. I discuss this
               distinction in my own essay on this subject, “Lyric Possession in the Abolition Ballad.”
               In teaching antislavery ballads, one may emphasize this history of problematic international
               musical dialogue and appropriation across the British Empire.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">As Alan Richardson proposes, representations of obeah increased anxiety and agitation
               in the wake of slave uprisings (“Romantic Voodoo”). The politics of lyric possession
               we find in the antislavery ballad seems in dialogue with charged spiritual practices
               like obeah.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba” introduces new complications to the political voice
               constructed in the abolition ballad. Richardson has exposed a fascinating conflict
               of authorial voice in the poem’s textual history. According to Richardson, the poem
               was originally penned by a minor Scottish poet, Eaglesfield Smith, and first published
               in <span style="font-style:italic">Universal Magazine</span> in 1797; it was subsequently expanded by More in an anonymous republication in the
               highly popular Cheap Repository Tracts series, which promoted middle-class values
               of religious and social obedience. Such mixed and unstable authorship underscores
               the plurality of voices native to the ballad form; it also highlights an Anglo-Scottish
               colonial ideological problem that plays itself out in the poem’s variants. What was,
               in Smith’s hands, an outright critique of imperial commerce parroted by an African
               voice turns into a much less censorious narrative about Christian conversion and Yamba’s
               forgiveness of her masters in More’s version (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). For
               a discussion of the centrality of gender in the construction of the slave voice in
               the literature of sensibility, see Mellor; see also Ferguson, <span style="font-style:italic">Subject to Others</span> (1992).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               admit the uncanny, repetitive presentness of the past within the present, <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> to smooth time out, to contain the massacre within ‘past’ time by appearing to enjoin
               a choice between the past and an emergent, modernized present while indicating that
               there really is no choice, only an occasion for disinterested sympathy and a decent
               burial (of the dead, of the slave trade) that the living might live on unhaunted by
               these specters of the Atlantic” (282).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
