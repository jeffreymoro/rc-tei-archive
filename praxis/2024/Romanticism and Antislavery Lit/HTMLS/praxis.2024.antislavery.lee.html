               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: defined;</span></h2>
               <p>I like the word: emerge. What it conjures: Motion. Risk-taking. Ideas on the verge.
                  </p>
               <p>adrienne maree brown wasn’t the first to highlight emergence for me, but her 2017
                  book <span style="font-style:italic">Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds</span> rooted me in the concept’s importance to teaching, writing, and being in these charged
                  times. Emergent strategy originated as a business model in the 1970s meaning “a pattern
                  of action that develops over time in an organization in the absence of a specific
                  mission and goals, or despite a mission and goals” (Rivera). brown says that her engagement
                  with the concept began with her reading of Black science-fiction author Octavia Butler’s
                  notion of change as small, decentralized, and intentional. In brown’s introduction
                  to “intentional adaptation,” she quotes Butler: “We are Earthseed / The life that
                  perceives itself Changing” (46). From there, brown grew the idea to describe myriad
                  forms of brokenness and transformation needed for a more just world.</p>
               <p>“Emergent” also aptly describes the pedagogical interventions in this volume, where
                  scholar-teachers take risks and adapt as they develop new curriculums, such as Frances
                  Botkin’s adaptation of the resourceful practice of <span style="font-style:italic">tunyuhan</span>. The word, Botkin tells us, comes from a Jamaican proverb: “tunyuhan (turn your hand)
                  and mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best use of any available resources to create
                  something new.” Or Ivan Ortiz’s evocation of literary séance to make Black voices
                  audible. Ortiz uses texts as mediums and mediations, especially those that crack open
                  history, like M. NourbeSe Philip’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zong! </span>(2008) poems broken across pages and centuries. There is also Elizabeth Fay’s emphasis
                  on the violent movement of bodies and selves across the Atlantic, as well as Nicholas
                  Blaisdell’s ability to link eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholarship “to our
                  present.” And Sean Gordon’s amplification of “dehiscence,” a practice described by
                  Fred Moten as a Black studies “emergent poetics” (1743).</p>
               <p>Clearly, these examples show how an emergent strategy can vitalize the teaching of
                  Romantic literature in 2024 and beyond. In the years before I read brown, I was drawn
                  to anthropologist Kathleen Stewart’s idea of emergence, aligned with the changes in
                  my scholarly work and my teaching some years ago. In her 2007 book <span style="font-style:italic">Ordinary Affects</span>, Stewart wrote about the “emergent present,” the shifting, fragmented, heightened
                  moments of the everyday. Her book indexes potent encounters that we can’t quite categorize,
                  intimate moments that merge with public issues and then evaporate like a mist only
                  to reappear later in another form. Such moments, she says, “will shift people’s life
                  trajectories in some small way, change them by literally changing their course for
                  a minute or a day” (12). More often than not, I will add, emergent moments transform
                  us as they remake the ghostly past in the embodied present.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: as fragment;</span></h2>
               <p>In June 2013, I was at a house party in Chicago’s Belmont district, mingling with
                  people in a leafy backyard. These were people I didn’t see at my university; founders
                  of arts programs and alternative newspapers and activist organizations. A little Scotty
                  dog dashed around. Everyone except me knew his name. The guests, hip and creative,
                  wore mismatched stockings and skirts, asymmetrical hemlines, and bright earrings.
                  They seemed cool, and I wanted to join in, but when I edged into a circle, people
                  spoke past me. Hot dampness hung in the air, evoking a longing feeling, an ache for
                  the experiences I didn’t have with these people but which they had with one another.</p>
               <p>The yard was crowded and sweaty, and I moved inside. Only one other person sat in
                  the dimly lit living room where a melancholy tune of trombones and violins played.
                  I drifted over and sat next to Marvin, as he later introduced himself. He raised his
                  beer and smiled. The heat inside was suffocating yet Marvin wore a long black leather
                  jacket and bowler cap, as if he’d come from a distant country where it was always
                  cold. I didn’t want to bring up the weather because my eyes kept drifting to his cap,
                  so I asked where he worked. “I don’t work now,” he said. There was something about
                  this party that suppressed my normal social instincts. In any other context I would
                  have talked about my job and family. But all I seemed to be able to do was listen.</p>
               <p>While Black and white people mingled outside, inside Marvin and I connected over parenting.
                  I noticed he had a way of smiling that seemed new, as if he’d just rediscovered those
                  muscles around his mouth. He told me how his daughter grew up while he was locked
                  up, how he was getting to know her for the first time. He’d had a hard time finding
                  a job since he got out of prison, he said. It was hard when you’d been in prison for
                  so long. You had to toughen yourself up, and that made you awkward around people.
                  He rubbed his eyebrow shyly. He had just bought his daughter a house with the compensation
                  he received for being wrongfully accused.</p>
               <p>I thought of my own daughter as Marvin talked. She and I were estranged at the time.
                  I had desperately tried to contact her to no avail. Forced alienation from a daughter,
                  one of the deepest human hurts—it was a feeling I could touch. But as I looked into
                  Marvin’s intense eyes, my internal screen went blank. How could I know wrongful conviction
                  and forced separation from a child, from an entire family, in the context of the experience
                  he related to me? I couldn’t. But he was telling me his story, and I listened.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: and the Romantic period;</span></h2>
               <p>One of the most striking features of this volume is how the pastness of the British
                  slave trade, abolition, and emancipation emerge in current poems, novels, plays, songs,
                  and movies, across the internet, on the streets, and, crucially, within schools and
                  classrooms. Patricia A. Matthew acknowledges that although early abolitionist texts
                  are not “documentaries that teach us about the past,” they can speak to current race
                  issues. Her students discuss slavery and abolition at a historic and geographic remove
                  and yet feel the issues press closely on their lives as they learn to adapt one era’s
                  practices to their own.</p>
               <p>Adaptation is central to Botkin’s method as well. She puts Marlon James’s contemporary
                  novel <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span> (2009) in dialogue with Romantic literature. James’s dizzying historical remix, Botkin
                  says, features graphic scenes of trauma, which unsettle what students think they know
                  about enslavement. At the same time, it informs their current experience. Likewise,
                  Fay reveals that for her students, the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 gave writers
                  like Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince “a new legitimacy” unheard of in previous generations
                  of students. And Gordon, in an “Ethnic American Literature” course he designed in
                  2015, boldly led students to question their assumptions about “the ‘pastness’ of slavery,
                  the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism of the Obama
                  administration.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Surely my conversation with Marvin held so much import for me because of how the past
                     emerged in the present. For twelve of the years Marvin was in prison, I spent almost
                     every waking moment steeped in literature of the slave trade, abolition, and emancipation
                     during the British Romantic period. I wrote about that history in neat explications,
                     complete with historical contexts and pages of citations, and bound in scholarly journals
                     and books. But it was only when I stepped away from literary criticism and all I had
                     learned that the meaning of that awful history started to emerge in a different way,
                     rushing into my life in fleeting, transitory moments, informing and complicating the
                     present. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery with one major exception: slavery
                     remained appropriate punishment for a crime. The Virginia Supreme Court defined convicts
                     as synonymous with enslaved people.

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: as signifying;</span></h2>
               <p>I set upon the topic of the slave trade, abolition, and emancipation through a chance
                  encounter with Henry Louis Gates Jr., when I was a meek graduate student at the University
                  of Arizona. I had read Gates’s book <span style="font-style:italic">The Signifying Monkey</span> (1988), which had recently come out, and <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave </span>(1831) in a postcolonial literature course, and was excited that he was giving a talk
                  at the university. Gates spoke about race and the literary canon and about recovering
                  texts written by formerly enslaved men and women. There was a dinner after the talk,
                  and to my astonishment, I ended up seated elbow-to-elbow with the great scholar with
                  the smiling eyes. He was casual and friendly, fluffing out his napkin and pouring
                  me a glass of water before filling his own.</p>
               <p>In my time as a graduate student, I’d never read anything like <span style="font-style:italic">The Signifying Monkey.</span> I still recall being mesmerized by how Gates harnessed the African American vernacular
                  tradition and the double-voiced Yoruba trickster Esu to develop the “signifyin’ figure”
                  who danced through the pages of African American literature. “To rename is to revise,”
                  Gates wrote, “and to revise is to Signify” (xxiii). Revise the method for my project,
                  and maybe even shift the canon a bit, was what I wanted to do. The book emerged from
                  the hundreds of others on my Ph.D. reading lists, not just because of Gates’s ideas,
                  brilliant as they were, but because of how he himself had written a scholarly work
                  so alive, multiplicious, and full of intellectual trickery. It struck me as, well,
                  not entirely academic in style. How did he do it?</p>
               <p>In my eyes Gates may as well have been a movie star (and he would go on to become
                  a TV celebrity and witness in free speech court proceedings). I was too nervous to
                  utter a word, so I just stared at his nice old-fashioned wristwatch that fit the persona
                  of someone with schedules to keep. But Gates must have asked what I was working on,
                  because I distinctly remember telling him, in a stumbling monologue full of ums and
                  ahs, about Romantic literature and how only a shred of scholarship about the slave
                  trade and abolition had been produced. I had pored over Eva Beatrice Dyke’s 1942 book<span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</span>. I had attended Alan Richardson’s 1990 MLA panel. I was drawn to the topic, I told
                  him, but I confessed my worry. As a non-Black person, did I have a right to pursue
                  this research? Was it my story to tell? Perhaps I was also afraid to confront the
                  culpability of my own European ancestry.</p>
               <p>Gates’s eyes grew serious through huge glasses resting on his cheeks. “Absolutely!”
                  he said. I must “absolutely choose this topic” for my dissertation. Was I going to
                  the archive? Texts, voices, needed to be brought to light. Though my work might never
                  “signify,” I understood, it could have significance. Or maybe, as a white woman writing
                  about the atrocities of Europeans, my work could signify on early white men and women.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: and police violence;</span></h2>
               <p>A few months after I met Marvin, I had lunch with Alice, the woman who had hosted
                  the house party. I told her about my conversation with Marvin. Though the conversation
                  had lasted an hour at most, he kept surfacing in my thoughts. Was he okay? What had
                  happened?</p>
               <p>Chicago cops were the worst, Alice said through frowning eyes and pursed lips as she
                  told me his story. Some twenty years earlier, two women and three children were found
                  dead in what appeared to be a house fire. The police questioned suspects, and their
                  evidence suggested a family member had committed the murders and started the fire
                  as a cover up. Instead of pursuing that lead, the police arrested two innocent men,
                  Marvin and another man, Ronald Kitchen, who happened to live nearby.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Alice pointed me to some online articles, and I later found more on my own.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)

                     </div> Marvin and Ronald’s injustice started with Chicago police detective and commander
                     Jon Burge, who spent eighteen years leading a campaign against innocent Black men.
                     Before his crimes were exposed in 1990, Burge targeted some two hundred Black men,
                     torturing, imprisoning, and killing many of them for crimes they did not commit. Burge
                     had learned his craft in the Army during the Korean War, first as a military policeman
                     and then in combat, facing a foe of a different race (Conroy). Burge unleashed his
                     crimes unchallenged and even received numerous honors, including a Bronze Star. Today
                     his career stands as one of the most egregious examples of serial police violence
                     against Black men in U.S. history.</p>
               </div>
               <p>When Marvin was exonerated in 2009, media stories emerged. In an interview with Marlene
                  Martin of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, Marvin told how police broke down
                  the door to his sister’s house, kidnapped him, and then beat him. I felt the intensity
                  of the injustice when, in the interview, Marvin related tender stories of his formative
                  years growing up in a housing project. Though the buildings are now gone, he recalled
                  a courtyard of flowers where he used to hang out. His favorite memory was a camping
                  trip. A local pastor had organized the trip for him and a bunch of neighborhood kids.
                  “He made sure we went on this weekend camping trip to show us another side of life,”
                  Marvin said. “I’ll never forget that—it made such an impression on me” (Martin).</p>
               <p>I’ll never forget how at the lunch meeting, when I mentioned Marvin’s name, Alice
                  smiled so wide, the lines around her eyes sprawled across her temples and down the
                  sides of her face. Her face drew me in like a force. She nodded and peeked cautiously
                  from over her glasses, as if the thought of him gave her a feeling of deep fondness
                  with agony mixed in. Even after we parted, her expression appeared before me, slowly
                  gathering resonance rather than settling something.</p>

                  writers, Black voices can be heard, as Toni Morrison points out in <span style="font-style:italic">Playing in the Dark</span> (1992), giving expression to “social decay and economic division” of white culture

                  <p>I spent what felt like a lifetime examining the documents of British antislavery,
                     following trails, uncovering metaphors, reading works by mostly non-Black authors—the
                     court cases, the tracts and polemics, the debates, the newspaper articles, the dubious
                     scientific theories, the iconography, the mounds of antislavery poetry and plays and
                     novels, and the thousands of travel texts. I was tireless in my research, mesmerized
                     by how one source led to another and then another, by the physical act of filling
                     out the request forms in the British Library, the Cambridge University Library, the
                     University of London, and farther-flung archives in cities like Liverpool, Bristol,

                     or born into the system of enslavement speak for themselves.

                              is a scandalous place where “infelicitous speech, obscene utterances, and perilous
                              commands give birth to the characters we stumble upon in the archive. Given the condition

                     </div> I became increasingly concerned with finding those voices, even if they were often
                     mediated through white institutions and scribes. I read the letters of the Sierra
                     Leone settlers, which were scattered in libraries across England and the United States.
                     In one collection, I stumbled upon a small account of enslaved women—mothers and daughters—wresting
                     control of a plantation. In London a series of slave complaints emerged from the House
                     of Commons Parliamentary papers dating to 1816. In select colonies including Berbice
                     and Demerara, as I learned, the enslaved could report abuses to a British officer—called
                     a “Fiscal”—who took down their words and filed them with the House of Commons. These
                     complaints highlight aspects of Black culture hidden from most other accounts. I learned
                     about working conditions, living quarters, the amount of food, clothing, and other
                     supplies people had access to, and about their resistances and rebellions.</p>

                  <p>One afternoon in the British Library I found myself reading the account of Tommy,
                     a story that stays with me to this day: <span class="quote">‘February 19, 1819. Negro Tommy, belonging to William Fraser: —Says, he is a cooper
                        by trade, and employed as such by his master on plantation Goldstone Hall; that on
                        Friday morning last he went in the boiling-house for nails, and there saw another
                        cooper heading up sugars; Tommy went to one of the casks and took a lump of sugar
                        for the purpose of sweetening three gallons of hot water; did not hide the same, but
                        proceeded with it in his hand from the boiling-house; was met by his master, Mr. Fraser,
                        who inquired where he got the sugar, Tommy informed him of his having taken it, and
                        for what purpose, his master immediately ordered him to be laid down, tied to stakes,
                        put two drivers over him, and one hundred lashes inflicted upon him. Mr. Fraser went
                        to Tommy’s house and searched it, found in his tool chest a quantity of old nails,
                        among which were also a very few new ones; Mr. Fraser went to the trouble of weighing
                        them, there were fourteen pounds.

                                 2004 volume I co-edited with Alan Richardson, Early Black British Writing (337–40).
                                 I’m especially grateful to Richardson for his pioneering work on antislavery and Black
                                 writers during the Romantic period and for mentoring me during my career.</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> It took years for me to unravel the meaning of this testimony. Tommy’s actions replayed
                     in my imagination until I saw his self-determination in every word of his complaint.
                     By stealing sugar—the product of his own labor—Tommy was subverting capitalism, which
                     slave labor made possible. Subverting but also using. By collecting a great quantity
                     of nails, Tommy was exploiting capitalism. The fact that Fraser weighed the nails
                     implies that he suspected Tommy was selling them.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The account continues beyond the segment I’ve included here. In it, Tommy complains
                  of not enough food and clothing, and of being harassed by Fraser, but his primary
                  objection is the hundred lashes, when the legal limit was forty-one. The court interviewed
                  various witnesses, each claiming Tommy received a different number of lashes. Finally,
                  the court asked Tommy to “exhibit his posterior,” and he had very little sign of being
                  lashed. Tommy explains: “I was favored by the drivers who threw the whips over me.”</p>
               <p>Between the lines, I saw, Tommy was complaining to the court about harassment and
                  torture, but he was also announcing agency over the plantation system. When he said
                  he was favored by the drivers, he was issuing a warning. Drivers were enslaved men
                  who received larger food and clothing rations. They commanded other enslaved people,
                  which made it dangerous for planters to upset a driver’s authority once it was established.
                  Drivers could be mediators, cops, or potential rebel leaders.</p>
               <p>For me, what mattered most about Tommy’s story was how his firsthand account bubbled
                  up through the testimony recorded by colonists. Although, at first glance, the court’s
                  order for Tommy to remove his clothing might seem degrading, it also offers Tommy
                  a chance to reveal how he has been able to retain his agency. Tommy proved how the
                  drivers favored him by “exhibiting his posterior.” With that act, he was literally
                  mooning them (and mooning is a word and concept dating back to 1600). “Kiss my ass,”
                  he was saying. Most importantly, although Tommy was probably illiterate, he staged
                  his action in a way that would be recorded in the colonial discourse for centuries
                  to come. In other words, by showing the court his backside and letting them know he
                  wasn’t powerless, he was signifying on the institution that sought to oppress him.</p>

               <p>My years of research across continents piecing together Britain’s antislavery project
                  and searching for voices like Tommy’s and listening to stories like Marvin’s changed
                  me. At Washington State University, I taught entire courses on the subject, highlighting
                  the rebellions and revolutions in Jamaica, Saint Domingue, and elsewhere, as well
                  as the many ways the enslaved survived, resisted, and overturned. I stood over photocopy
                  machines and heavy-duty staplers creating handmade booklets for my students of these
                  defiant texts. In the geometry of my classroom, we gathered in a perfect circle and
                  read them aloud. As students took the words inside their bodies and made them live,
                  we heard power shift from the institution of slavery to a group of Black women taking
                  charge of a plantation or to a household servant poisoning an abusive white man.</p>
               <p>But my old-school ways were not nearly as inventive as the methods adopted in this
                  volume. Methods like Botkin’s Zoom dialogue with Maroons or Fay’s triangulations,
                  a practice she adapted from nautical strategy and scholar Christina Sharpe. Blaisdell
                  also triangulates his work—reading Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, and Friedrich Engels
                  together helps him understand the relationship between nineteenth-century problems
                  of unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism.</p>
               <p>“Emergence,” brown writes, “is our inheritance as a part of this universe; it is how
                  we change” (3). She consults nature for lessons on teaching, organizing, and taking
                  care of one another and oneself: birds flocking, earthworms burrowing, leaves decaying,
                  roots going deep offer different instructions. But one of nature’s most fascinating
                  forms—the fractal—is for brown the geometry of transformation. “What we practice at
                  a small scale can reverberate to the largest scale,” she reminds us (42). I found
                  this self-similar, iterative process evident across the essays of this volume, each
                  piece unfolding like an offering for how to teach an abolitionist Romanticism.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: and abolition;</span></h2>
               <p>A few years ago, I read a review by Carvell Wallace in the <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times</span> of “The Good Lord Bird,” a TV miniseries about the nineteenth-century American abolitionist
                  John Brown, produced by Ethan Hawke. “Can a white person ever usefully tell a slave
                  story,” Wallace asked, “or, more specifically, can they tell a story that is useful
                  to the descendants of the enslaved, rather than to their own egos or cinematic fantasies?”</p>
               <p>I felt a bright sting. Though the great Henry Louis Gates Jr. had once encouraged
                  me to tell the stories of Black lives, I continue to wonder—can I? I sometimes doubt
                  my ability to write about the stories of enslaved people by Romantic-era authors.
                  I decided I would not watch the series.</p>
               <p>Yet I kept returning to the fact that abolition and enslaved people were the most
                  pressing topic of the British Romantic period. At the time I started my research and
                  writing, nothing could have been clearer to me. Several authors in this collection
                  cite Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s sermon on abolition in 1795 on the steps of the Bristol
                  docks in the heart of that city’s slave business; Equiano’s and Cugoano’s fierce agitation
                  for abolition; and Prince’s narrative told to the London Anti-Slavery Society. Not
                  to mention the millions of pages of antislavery writings by Black and white activist
                  men and women.</p>
               <p>Antislavery was pursued with such intensity, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to find
                  abolition, albeit much transformed since the Romantic period, emergent among some
                  young activists today. Syrus Marcus Ware, a transgender scholar and artist, urges
                  academics, writers, poets, activists, performers—everyone—to “approach abolition as
                  the most loving thing that we can do for one another” (Ware). Last year I attended
                  Ware’s workshop on abolition, in which participants listened to Angela Davis while
                  we imagined futures full of love and freedom and justice. As Petra Kuppers, the workshop
                  organizer, put it: <span class="quote">‘This personal sensation of a white cis queer disabled woman feels far away from the
                     project of ending slavery’s long reach, I know, and I feel immediately the concern
                     of projecting my own sense of unfreedom, being denied access to my range-giving wheelchair,
                     onto the experiences of people racialized as Black. But that’s what Syrus is offering
                     to me here: charting my experience, my sense, from wherever I come from. Grounding
                     a sense of justice in a personal felt, lived experience, in connection. So I let it
                     stand, that moment of loosening the armor, and I touch into it to be present.” (Kuppers)’</span> The experience was visceral, uncomfortable, on the verge of something new for many
                  of the participants.</p>
               <p>Many of the teacher-scholars in this volume embrace abolition. I see a wonderful,
                  complementary rhythm between Ortiz’s call to listen to Romantic “sounds we would otherwise
                  block out because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient” and Ware’s
                  invitation to embody the sounds of a world rooted in liberation and self-determination.
                  I’m moved by Matthew’s account of how when students learn an “abolitionist Romanticism”
                  they are also learning “about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.”
                  As Alan Richardson observes in his response here, I too am heartened by Blaisdell’s
                  report of being inspired by Granville Sharp working shoulder-to-shoulder with Equiano
                  and Cugoano. Such collaborative abolitionism prompted Blaisdell to found a community
                  tutoring center. Reading about his actions also brought to mind Ware’s words: The
                  “abolitionist struggle . . . is 500 years strong,” he writes, and “now is a time to
                  reflect on the history of the abolition movement and what the future could look like
                  if we reach abolition in our lifetime” (Ware).</p>
               <p>I’ve also understood that the backward glances, missteps, doubts, and mistakes I make
                  when writing and speaking about abolition are part of the fractal nature of learning.
                  Shortly after I read the <span style="font-style:italic">Times</span> review about “The Good Lord Bird,” one of my African American students who writes
                  eloquently about <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince </span>called me by Zoom and said, completely unsolicited, “You should watch that series!”
                  The coincidence captured meant I had to respond. </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p>“But can a white person really tell that story?” I told her about the review.</p>

               <p>Caregiving. Collectivity. These ancient principles are emergent in this volume’s classroom
                  practices. For instance, the way Matthew begins her courses with “a conversation about

                  exercise about the word <span style="font-style:italic">sugar</span>.” The way Gordon encourages crosstalk by assigning student support groups for writing
                  and responding. How Blaisdell had his students enact a letter-writing campaign against
                  unjust school dress codes, where they learned “that the power of social change begins
                  and is sustained through collective civic action.” And how MaMa G, the elder featured
                  in Botkin’s essay, envisions opening a “borderless university,” rooted in Jamaica
                  but developed online, to unite local and global communities in the growth and dissemination
                  of Indigenous knowledge.</p>

                  models. Gumbs, for instance, collaborates with sperm whales—breathing, stretching,
                  finding intentionality. Further, her brilliant book <span style="font-style:italic">Spill</span> (2016) is a cross-generation, trans-temporal partnership with Hortense Spillers that
                  calls to mind collaborations with history like Philip’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zong! </span>poems, where meaning is “not to be ‘made’ but, rather, felt” (Wah), and the <span style="font-style:italic">Lost Privilege Company, or the book of listening</span> (2016), an assemblage from the archives of California’s Eugenics Records Office between
                  1910 and 1925 by an anonymous poetry collective.</p>

               <p>Marvin, the man I met at the Chicago house party, spent twenty-one years in prison
                  while his friend Ronald Kitchen was sentenced to death. I never saw Marvin again,
                  and I lost touch with Alice, but I didn’t forget them. The tangle of connections and
                  resonances remained emergent for me, demanding my continuing attention.</p>
               <p>I learned that while Ronald was in prison, he became one of the “Death Row 10,” Black
                  men tortured and wrongfully accused by Burge and his gang of corrupt cops. Ronald
                  went on to write his story in his 2018 book <span style="font-style:italic">My Midnight Years: Surviving Jon Burge’s Police Torture Ring and Death Row</span>. In a 2019 interview, he and one of his coauthors, Thai Jones, spoke about the police
                  brutality that called to mind so many descriptions in British antislavery writing.
                  They also spoke about the importance of storytelling.</p>
               <p>Marvin and Ronald may never have been exonerated if activists on the outside, including
                  Ronald’s mother, and, it turns out, Alice and some of the people at her house party
                  in June 2013, had not made their innocence a major story in Chicago. The activists’
                  work centered on building narratives around Martin and Ronald and other wrongly convicted
                  Black men. “It was storytelling that really did work this amazing revolution in people’s
                  consciousness,” said Jones (Kitchen). The stories eventually engaged the news media,
                  lawmakers, and people like Jesse Jackson, finally forcing Chicago to pass a reparations
                  package, the first of its kind in the country. The legislation provides compensation,
                  restitution, and rehabilitation services for those tortured by Jon Burge.</p>
               <p>Recently, Marvin joined Alice for a presentation of Alice’s co-edited book, <span style="font-style:italic">The Long Term: Resisting Life Sentences, Working toward Freedom</span> (2018). The book contains an essay by adrienne maree brown. Ronald is now an activist
                  speaking out against police brutality and corruption. Even so, police continue to
                  harass him. Whenever he’s back in Chicago visiting relatives, as he explained in the
                  2019 interview, police stop him numerous times, a reminder of the ruthless stop-and-frisk
                  policies he grew up with on the South Side.</p>
               <p>Now, however, the routine is different. When the police pull him over, Ronald signifies.
                  He always says, “Officer, why are you pulling me over?” The officer will reply: “Your
                  seatbelt.” But Ronald has tinted windows, and he points this out. Finally, the officer
                  says, “Is this your car?” “Yes, it is,” Ronald says in a calm, steady voice. “Where
                  did you get this Mercedes Benz?” the officer demands. “Well, officer,” Ronald says,
                  “you all bought this for me” (Kitchen).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Emergent: and the future</span></h2>
               <p>What does the future of Romantic pedagogy look like? The essays in this volume offer
                  some direction. In the spirit of multiplicity and nonlinearity, Botkin reports, “I
                  incorporated interviews, images, and films to complement and challenge the conventions
                  of literary historiography.” Gordon includes the speculative mode, teaching authors
                  like Mat Johnson, Celu Amberstone, and Octavia Butler, while Fay focuses on Afrofuturism
                  with the film <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> (2018) and N. K. Jemisin’s “How Long ’til Black Future Month?” Such texts, she says,
                  present a way of talking about the future in terms other than intergenerational trauma
                  and posthumanism.</p>
               <p>I am grateful to Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley for editing this powerful constellation
                  of essays and for inviting me to respond and giving me room to offer a few of my own
                  pedagogical practices. To begin with, I want to advocate for new ways of writing scholarship
                  and assigning student work. Part of the power of brown’s <span style="font-style:italic">Emergent Strategy</span>, after all, is its form. An assemblage of narratives, memories, theories, spells,
                  poetry, lists, assessment sheets, oral histories, questions, anecdotes, guiding quotations,
                  icons, images, and Afro-futures. Such an approach to Romantic scholarship and classroom
                  work can help liberate the field. I wholly support Kathleen Stewart’s argument that
                  generalized terms like “neoliberalism, advanced capitalism, and globalization . .
                  . do not in themselves begin to describe the situation we find ourselves in. The notion
                  of a totalized system, of which everything is always already somehow a part, is not
                  helpful (to say the least) in the effort to approach a weighted and reeling present”
                  (5). Equally, I’m in line with brown’s recommendation that we need to “give each other
                  more time to feel, to be in our humanity” (105).</p>
               <p>The center of my pedagogical practice today compels students to experiment with modes
                  of expression and to co-create with whatever texts we’re discussing. I present them
                  with dozens of forms, written and otherwise: letters, manifestos, photo essays, short
                  films, fragments, artist books, mixed media collages, erasure poetry, assemblage poetry,
                  catalogs, almanacs, and indexes, to name a few. I ask them to experiment on even the
                  most scholarly projects. I also encourage them to feel. I value experience over explication
                  of literary works, ordinary affects over totalizing systems. In my own writing, I’ve
                  pursued an emergent scholarship, one mixed up and messy, nonlinear and adaptive, rooted
                  in feeling and imagining as much as thinking. Which is why, these last years, I’ve
                  been compiling a catalog of emotions to use as a resource. Not big, singular emotions
                  like fear or shock or sudden love, but the complex, contradictory, ambivalent churning
                  inside us as we try to find stability in an unstable universe, as we try to put past
                  and present in place, as we try to find new forms and expressions for the emergent
                  present.</p>
               <p>And then, suddenly, some appear from a corner of the world, and we are moved, as when
                  Amanda Gorman stood at the podium during the presidential inauguration on January
                  20, 2021, and her words, emerging, held us all—not just America, but the world: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p>We will rebuild, reconcile and recover</p> 
                  <p>and every known nook of our nation</p> 
                  <p>and every corner called our country,</p> 
                  <p>our people diverse and beautiful will emerge . . .</p>
