            <p>This essay analyzes the powerful nexus between antislavery pedagogy, recognizing one’s
               own historical agency, and engaging in civic action in the context of the Black Lives
               Matter movement. I explore my own role as a pre-service teacher, social justice activist,
               and emerging scholar in the field of education in the context of the antislavery archive
               that shaped my undergraduate research and study. I place the work of Ottobah Cugoano
               and other Romantic-era and long-nineteenth-century authors in dialogue with Marxist
               theory, as well as with the work of Paulo Freire, to explore how unexpected interconnections
               between these texts emerge in the contexts of teaching, scholarship, and activism.</p>

               <p>When my fellow Black Lives Matter activists and I arrived at the corner of Lowell
                  Street and Russell Street in West Peabody, Massachusetts in order to stage a counterprotest
                  in July 2020, we were immediately approached by members of the town’s police department
                  and told that we had to relocate down the street to a marked-off location. Allegedly,
                  the corner of the public sidewalk where we intended to rally had been reserved by
                  a group under the organization of Dianna Ploss, a former radio host who had lost her
                  job at a New Hampshire station after filming herself “berat[ing] landscape workers
                  for speaking Spanish” (Taylor and Waller). When we informed one of the police officers
                  that we were not moving to the designated zone down the street and that our counterprotest
                  would continue as planned, the situation intensified. Our small group was quickly
                  surrounded by seven officers, and after a conversation about our right to occupy this
                  public space, we were told, “The debate’s over.” Yet the end of the debate about which
                  space we should occupy would also have meant an end to the counterprotest itself,
                  since that too was a form of debate.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, I know that a permit is not needed to protest in the city of Peabody,
                  and that public sidewalks cannot be reserved without proper documentation. At that
                  point, a friend of mine signaled to one of our legal observers for assistance and
                  began recording on her phone. In an attempt to de-escalate the situation, I told the
                  police captain that we would not antagonize the rally, while also asserting that we
                  had an equal, legal right to the public sidewalk. Perhaps due to the presence of the
                  camera and the National Lawyers Guild observers, the police backed away from us, and
                  we proceeded to successfully carry out our counterdemonstration. We received several
                  signs that debate was not welcome that day; the police captain’s sentiment was mirrored
                  in reactions we received from some of the city’s residents, who shouted profanities
                  at us as they drove by. Yet the interaction with the city’s police department was
                  instructive because it revealed that the act of protest could legally continue, even
                  when we had been told that it could not. More importantly, it also revealed the need
                  for persistence and for more sustained efforts in organizing for Black lives in my
                  hometown.</p>

               <p>Reflecting on this moment in which the police tried to quell our protest with the
                  phrase “the debate’s over” has led me to examine the powerful effect that antislavery
                  pedagogy has had on my understanding of my own historico-political agency. Throughout
                  this essay I will detail my trajectory in engaging with antislavery literature and
                  pedagogy, first as an undergraduate student, then as a pre-service teacher, and finally
                  as a scholar in the field of education and a social justice activist. I will also
                  explain how my ever-shifting relationship with antislavery literature and pedagogy—a
                  source of continual intellectual and affective debate—has informed my identity, experiences,
                  and civic activity in each of these social roles. Overall, I aim to situate my experiences
                  with antislavery curriculum, both as a student and as a teacher, within Paulo Freire’s
                  concept of <span style="font-style:italic">praxis</span>, or as he defines it, “reflection and action upon the world in order to transform
                  it” (<span style="font-style:italic">Pedagogy,</span> 51).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Reading Antislavery Discourse at the Undergraduate Level</span></h2>
               <p>My initial contact with antislavery pedagogy began in Professor Joselyn Almeida’s
                  “Introduction to British Literature” course when I was a first-year student at the
                  University of Massachusetts Amherst. Over the course of the semester, we read the
                  work of many prominent abolitionists and other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                  authors. For me, the three most powerful readings from this course for realizing my
                  own potential for civic action through writing were Ottobah Cugoano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery</span> (1787); Mary Prince’s <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave, Related by Herself</span> (1831); and Friedrich Engels’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Condition of the Working Class in England</span> (1845). In his fiery exhortation, Cugoano forcefully chastises the practice of slavery
                  while simultaneously merging its history into that of the developing capitalist economic
                  system. For example, one of the central aims of <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments </span>is to locate the individuals and corporations who “steal, kidnap, buy, sell, and enslave”
                  other humans, or as Cugoano dubs them the “merchandisers of the human species,” into
                  the larger economic framework of capitalism, which permits and rewards these cruel
                  and exploitative practices (51). In critiquing these “infamous ways of getting rich,”
                  Cugoano splices together the despicable history of slavery and that of capitalism
                  (70), anticipating the work of scholars such as Eric Williams, Ian Baucom, and Walter
                  Mignolo.</p>
               <p>Prince makes a similar point while describing her own experiences working as an enslaved
                  person in the salt ponds of the Turks Islands. Prince notes how slave owners “received
                  a certain sum for every slave that worked upon [their] premises” and how their profits
                  derived from this unpaid labor (10). The force of Prince’s autobiography is how she
                  goes on to elaborate the disturbing material conditions and details through which
                  slave owners extracted labor from their captives. Furthermore, just as Cugoano decried
                  the buying, selling, and merchandising of “the human species” for profit, Prince illustrates
                  these horrors through her own personal testimony of being offered “for sale like sheep
                  or cattle” (4). Even as her “heart throbbed with grief and terror so violently” at
                  the reality of being ripped away from her mother and sisters, Prince clearly recognized
                  that for those who bought and sold them, tearing apart this family was simply a matter
                  of maximizing their profit margin. In other words, for the slave traders who “examined
                  and handled [Prince] in the same manner that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was
                  about to purchase,” Prince’s enslavement, the separation of her family, and the sale
                  of her body and labor power could be reduced to being “knocked down to the highest
                  bidder” (4).</p>
               <p>Cugoano’s powerful critique of capitalism and Prince’s vivid depiction of the conditions
                  of slavery connect with the work of Engels in unexpected ways. Only a decade after
                  Prince published her <span style="font-style:italic">History</span>, Engels delineates the brutal indifference of the ruling class and the relationship
                  between the exploitation of the English proletariat and capitalism in his <span style="font-style:italic">Condition of the Working Class</span>. For Engels, capitalists can only generate profit in the form of surplus value through
                  the “surplus labour” of the proletariat, which “costs the capitalist nothing, yet
                  goes into his pocket” (314). Part of the power of Engels’s work relies on his depiction
                  of workers with “[knees] bent inward and backwards,” “ankles deformed and thick,”
                  “deformities of the pelvis,” and inhalation of “excessive dust, powder smoke, carbonic
                  acid gas” (162, 253, 249). Although it is indisputable that the English working class
                  were “far better off than slaves” (Prince 23), and the atrocious exploitation of the
                  free laborers hardly approached the inhuman mistreatment of unfree laborers in all
                  ways, reading Cugoano, Prince, and Engels together led me to interrogate the complex
                  relationship between unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism unfolding in the nineteenth
                  century.</p>
               <p>This inquiry resulted in a term paper, which challenged me, as a student at the time,
                  to reflect on ways I could deploy my writing against oppressive institutions and resulted
                  in a more focused independent study with Professor Almeida on free and unfree labor.
                  At the outset, the core question guiding the independent study focused on the dialectical
                  relationship between the condition of enslaved laborers in the Global South (e.g.,
                  Cuba and Brazil), the condition of the working class in the Global North (e.g., United
                  States and Britain), and capitalism as an international politico-economic system.
                  In the syllabus we planned together, I aimed to deepen my knowledge of writers from
                  the introductory course as well as to read other lesser-known figures, such as Thomas
                  Spence and Robert Wedderburn. In addition, we sought to include more contemporary
                  scholarship on the topic of slavery, such as texts by C. L. R. James, Eric Williams,
                  David Brion Davis, Sidney Mintz, and David Eltis.</p>
               <p>In reading these authors and scholars, it soon became more evident to me that the
                  relationship between capitalism and slavery in the nineteenth century encompassed
                  what Cugoano acutely established in his <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments</span>. It confirmed Karl Marx’s famous assertion in the first volume of <span style="font-style:italic">Capital</span> (1867) that “the veiled slavery of the wage-earners in Europe needed, for its pedestal,
                  slavery pure and simple in the new world” (833). It underscored Williams’s revolutionary
                  and groundbreaking proposition that the profits of the transatlantic slave trade “fertilized
                  the entire productive system of [Britain]” (105). By the end of the independent study,
                  I argued in my term paper that capitalism as an economic force not only accommodated
                  transatlantic slavery but also shared in a deep-rooted and fundamental relationship
                  with slavery’s nineteenth-century development.</p>
               <p>This idea became the basis for my undergraduate honors thesis the following academic
                  year. Learning about the field of nineteenth-century antislavery literature led me
                  to analyze the structural relationship between capitalism and unfree labor in the
                  twenty-first century. To be more precise, I became interested in exploring Marx’s
                  (triggering) assertion that not only did “the turning of Africa into a warren for
                  the commercial hunting” of Black people signal “the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
                  production” but also his recognition that unfree labor was inextricably and structurally
                  intertwined with an economic system whose sole purpose is to “force the cost of labor
                  back towards . . . zero” in order to maximize profits (823, 657). I wanted to apply
                  my previous research to the project of exposing twenty-first-century forms of unfree
                  labor structurally produced by the capitalist mode of production. As I examined specific
                  examples of contemporary unfree labor and provided readers with direct action steps
                  to advocate for unfree laborers today, I began to become more deeply aware of my own
                  historical agency.</p>
               <p>Drawing on the research of modern scholars across numerous disciplines, the three
                  major forms of unfree labor in the twenty-first century that I explored in my thesis
                  were unfree prison labor, unfree migrant labor, and unfree international labor. By
                  reading Angela Davis’s <span style="font-style:italic">Are Prisons Obsolete?</span> (2003) alongside Michelle Alexander’s <span style="font-style:italic">The New Jim Crow</span> (2010) and Dennis Childs’s <span style="font-style:italic">Slaves of the State </span>(2015), I was able to trace the racialized history of prisoners’ economic unfreedom
                  from being legally designated as “slaves of the state” via the 1871 Virginia Supreme
                  Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Ruffin v. Commonwealth</span> (as cited by Alexander, 31) to the hundreds of millions of dollars in profits generated
                  by grossly underpaid, predominantly Black and Latinx prison laborers directly or indirectly
                  in the production line of the federal government and a vast array of private companies
                  including “Dell computers, the Parke­Davis and Upjohn pharmaceutical companies, Toys’R’Us,
                  Chevron, IBM, Motorola, Compaq, Texas Instruments, Honeywell, Microsoft, Victoria’s
                  Secret, Boeing, Nintendo, and Starbucks,” as well as TransWorld Airlines and Honda
                  (Mosher et al. 95). On the topic of unfree migrant laborers, my thesis synthesized
                  the research of immigration and slavery scholars Nicholas De Genova, Kevin Bales,
                  Ron Soodalter, and Tanya Maria Golash-Boza to elucidate how U.S. immigration policy
                  routinely converts already vulnerable migrant laborers into an illegal and, therefore,
                  a highly docile and exploitable unfree workforce. For instance, one of the main areas
                  of investigation of this portion of my thesis was the method through which major corporations
                  like Exxon, John Deere, and Monsanto, along with large agribusinesses and the supermarkets
                  and fast-food chains that buy from them, could profit from the inexcusable conditions
                  of enslaved, coerced, and unpaid labor of migrant workers (Bales and Soodalter 47–8).
                  The last section focused on how the structural tendency of capitalism, as embodied
                  by massive multinational companies, routinely colludes with governments and financial
                  institutions to produce and exploit unfree international workers for the production,
                  accumulation, and maximization of surplus value. For example, my explanation of unfree
                  international labor directly linked Apple’s 2019 market value of $1.8 trillion (“Apple”)
                  to the countless Chinese workers who are reportedly being forced to “hand[le] noxious
                  chemicals sometimes without proper gloves or masks” while standing “10 hours a day
                  in hot workshops slicing and blasting iPhone casings” (Gao and Webb).</p>
               <p>Ultimately, the overarching claim of my undergraduate honors thesis was that the production
                  and exploitation of maximally vulnerable and exploitable unfree laborers in the twenty-first
                  century is the result of a structural tendency inextricable from the framework of
                  capitalism itself. This structural tendency, or “directing motive, the end and aim
                  of capitalist production,” immediately derives from capital’s insatiable need to produce,
                  accumulate, and most of all, extract “the greatest possible amount of surplus­value,”
                  which is achieved by continuously attempting to “force the cost of labor back towards
                  . . . zero” (Marx 363, 657). In my conclusion I suggested that capital in the twenty-first
                  century continues to commandeer a panoply of state institutions and functions responsible
                  for incarceration, immigration, and international trade in order to realize its structural
                  impetus for producing, accumulating, and maximizing its share of surplus value.</p>

               <p>Overall, with my focus now shifted toward uncovering and critiquing manifestations
                  of slavery today, I soon began to recognize the relationship between my research in
                  antislavery literature and the contemporary need to dismantle the political and economic
                  institutions continuing to produce unfree laborers. My research and writing became
                  a moment for me to link my investigations from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
                  to our present, while simultaneously exploring ways to discern my place in impacting
                  the historical and material conditions of the twenty-first century. At this point,
                  I began to experience the way that, as Michel Foucault describes, “discourse transmits
                  and produces power; it reinforces it, but also undermines and exposes it, renders
                  it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it” (101). However, in reflecting upon
                  Freire’s notion that “the process of problematization implies a critical return to
                  action,” my ambitions in regard to antislavery pedagogy again shifted: rather than
                  merely focusing on finishing my thesis, I also developed a growing desire to engage
                  in more direct civic action (<span style="font-style:italic">Education,</span> 135).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">Translating Antislavery Discourse into Action as an Undergraduate</span></h2>
               <p>One of the first methods I explored for participating in civic engagement was petitioning
                  the state. The murder of Heather Heyer at the white supremacist “Unite the Right”
                  rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 moved me to action. That year,
                  I started a petition to remove the state of Massachusetts’s only Confederate memorial,
                  on Georges Island in Boston Harbor. The importance of understanding the history of
                  antislavery movements to the present moment was made explicit by the way that white
                  supremacists, neo-Nazis, and many Donald Trump supporters had utilized pro-slavery
                  symbols, like Confederate flags and Southern Nationalist flags, when they all marched
                  together at the “Unite the Right” rally. Since my education had focused on narratives
                  of antislavery from the era of the Confederacy, I understood the historical relevance
                  of nationwide protests aimed at removing public statues commemorating Confederate
                  soldiers in response to the rise of far-right extremism and violence.</p>
               <p>I was also led by my studies to engage with my local and state government in more
                  direct modes of action. After my examination of prison labor in my thesis, I began
                  drafting public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act and the Massachusetts
                  Public Records Law. Even though I always had the legal right and capability to issue
                  public records requests, it was only after being inspired by the canny ways that nineteenth-century
                  abolitionists manipulated the existing legal system to advocate for their antislavery
                  agenda that I began to realize how I might put this freedom to best use. I recalled
                  how the various abolitionist societies that emerged across England in this period
                  were able to organize unprecedented petitions, protests, legal proceedings, and other
                  forms of civic action. For instance, in the four weeks following a proposal at the
                  Congress of Vienna to “renew the rights of French slave-merchants,” English abolitionists
                  were able to get “a higher proportion of the population” to sign antislavery petitions
                  than any other petition of the time, including the massively popular Chartist petition
                  of 1848 (Fryer 213). I was also profoundly inspired by the work of Granville Sharp,
                  who won the famous <span style="font-style:italic">Somerset v. Stewart</span> case (1772) that outlawed the forcible removal of slaves from England. Sharp also
                  fought vigorously alongside Olaudah Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano in the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong </span>case (1781) to hold accountable the slave traders who massacred over 130 enslaved
                  people in order to fraudulently collect insurance money.</p>
               <p>Filing public records requests in Massachusetts also allowed me to find more specific
                  data regarding the potential collusion between the state, prisons, and capital in
                  relation to the production and exploitation of unfree prison laborers. The outcome
                  of these records requests revealed that the city of Boston had contracts for prison
                  labor, despite the Massachusetts law establishing that “no contract shall be made
                  for the labor of prisoners” (M.G.L. Chapter 127, Section 51). I also uncovered the
                  fact that prison laborers from the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department were excluded
                  from the living-wage agreement that vendors contracting with the city of Boston must
                  sign, meaning that there was legally no minimum wage for prison workers contracted
                  to the city. In some instances, contracts I obtained through public records requests
                  showed how prisoners working through a Massachusetts Department of Correction program
                  called “MassCor” earned as little as 40 cents per hour while producing a wide range
                  of products, including “certificates, beds, binders, padfolios, clothing, decals,
                  embroidered garments, flags, janitorial supplies, mattresses, pillows, chairs, desks,
                  and tables, office signs, name tags, street signs, park benches, picnic tables, fire
                  pits, bike racks, trash receptacles, engraved wood, brick, granite and stone, sheets,
                  and towels” for purchase by both public and private entities (MA DOC 3).</p>
               <p>The principles I garnered from reading and analyzing abolitionist and Marxist literature
                  also led me toward other avenues for realizing my potential as an agent of social
                  change, specifically in the field of education. During the summer of 2016, I founded
                  the Peabody Volunteer Tutoring Organization (PVTO), which has since partnered with
                  the Peabody public school system to provide free summer tutoring every year to hundreds
                  of students ranging from grades one through twelve in mathematics, science, English,
                  history, and test preparation. My desire to grant students and families of disadvantaged
                  socioeconomic backgrounds access to the additional levels of summer support that have
                  been routinely reserved for their more privileged counterparts, and modestly to contribute
                  to an atmosphere of community empowerment and solidarity in the city of Peabody, stemmed
                  from my yearning to disrupt what the Marxist scholar David Harvey identifies as “accumulation
                  by dispossession,” specifically within the realm of public education (<span style="font-style:italic">New Imperialism,</span> 144). With a wide range of scholarship documenting the horrific inequities in American
                  schooling from Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis’s <span style="font-style:italic">Schooling in Capitalist America</span> (1976) to Jonathan Kozol’s <span style="font-style:italic">Savage Inequalities</span> (1991) to Pedro Noguera’s <span style="font-style:italic">City Schools and the American Dream </span>(2003), the need for immediate individual and community action to subvert these systems
                  that regularly dispossess students of marginalized racial and economic backgrounds
                  of access to quality educational experiences became my top priority that summer. For
                  me, it was clear that this wide-scale educational inequity was a process deeply rooted
                  historically in the rise and expansion of capitalism and the Atlantic slave trade.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Realizing My Historical Agency in Responding to Racialized Dispossession in the Classroom</span></h2>
               <p>Upon graduating from UMass Amherst with my bachelor’s degree in English, I began more
                  directly to witness the “accumulation by dispossession” process firsthand while entering
                  a high-poverty urban school district in western Massachusetts as part of the residency
                  portion of my graduate program to earn a master’s degree in the field of education.
                  During my time as a pre-service student-teacher in this school, I was exposed to the
                  harsh material conditions of education in the United States, a system that routinely
                  works to effect the dispossession I described above, which in turn limits future economic
                  and social mobility. Before elaborating on the relationship between my own undergraduate
                  work and my experiences in this particular school district, I will first detail the
                  contexts of student learning in this setting.</p>
               <p>The school itself, formerly a Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance corporate building,
                  was located across the street from a brand new MassMutual location. In a stark contrast
                  to the $39.2 billion that MassMutual earned in revenue during the previous year (“Massachusetts
                  Mutual”) and the statewide median household income of $77,378 (United States Census),
                  some students attending the school came from neighborhoods in which the median annual
                  family income was estimated to be a meager $15,311 (FFIEC). Moreover, with “segregation
                  along racial, ethnic or other lines” being “notoriously pervasive features of all
                  capitalist social formation” (Harvey, <span style="font-style:italic">Seventeen Contradictions</span> 68) and “a higher percentage of Black children” attending “segregated schools now
                  than in 1968” (Knopp 27), the demographics of the school mirrored this reality and
                  were not at all proportional to the demographics of the state of Massachusetts. According
                  to data from the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 17.6 percent
                  of students at the school identified as African American, 70.8 percent as Hispanic,
                  and 8.5 percent as white (MA DESE). For purposes of comparison, 71.1 percent of all
                  residents in the state of Massachusetts identify as white (United States Census).
                  In other words, compared to the rest of the state, the school was clearly segregated
                  along lines of race and class, despite the <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v. Board of Education</span> (1953) Supreme Court ruling declaring that “separate educational facilities are inherently
                  unequal” nearly seventy years before (Warren 495).</p>
               <p>The staff of this school wielded a disproportionate amount of power over students.
                  The teachers and administrators were mostly white and of upper-middle-class backgrounds,
                  making it clear to me that this school was the embodiment of what linguist Mary Louise
                  Pratt identifies as a “contact zone,” or a social space “where cultures meet, clash,
                  and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of
                  power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in
                  many parts of the world today” (34). As a student with a background in antislavery
                  and resistance pedagogy, entering this contradictory contact zone as a pre-service
                  teacher meant that I understood I had the potential to either “reproduce socioeconomic
                  and racial inequalities” or “[build] critical consciousness . . . and revolutionary
                  resistance” (Au 90). This awareness led me to design a pedagogical unit that aimed
                  to dismantle one particular instance of a racialized and classist school policy harming
                  my new students: the school dress code.</p>
               <p>The district’s dress code policy, which banned any article of clothing with a hood,
                  was firmly entrenched in a history of anti-Black and anti-Brown racism in the United
                  States. Under the guise of promoting public safety, Black and Brown children were
                  being targeted. The underlying logic maintaining the dress code policy was the misguided
                  and racist belief that these children are more dangerous than other children and therefore
                  should not be allowed to wear anything that could potentially conceal their identities
                  in schools. Ideologically, this was the same belief system that allowed the murderer
                  of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black student, to be found innocent
                  of second-degree murder and even of the lesser charge of manslaughter (Alvaraz and
                  Buckley). In practice, the enforcement of the district’s dress code meant that the
                  school’s predominantly white teachers and administrators would waste valuable class
                  time stripping Black and Brown students of their winter clothing, whether a hoody
                  or a hooded jacket or coat. I can vividly recall sitting in the back of a math class
                  when the school’s principal halted the lesson by entering the room with a grocery
                  cart and making students take off their jackets one by one and put them in the cart.
                  After the principal left, I remember watching one student shivering at his desk in
                  a T-shirt for the remainder of class. On another cold fall morning, I heard an assistant
                  principal boast in the hallway how he “snagged another one,” referring to a student’s
                  hoody. On this particular day, it was so cold that it hurt my hands to type: how must
                  the student have been feeling, without his sweater? More shockingly, the enforcement
                  of the dress code continued all through the harsh New England winter, even as outdoor
                  temperatures fell well below zero and even as some of the school’s defective HVAC
                  systems blasted freezing outdoor air directly into classrooms.</p>

               </div>
               <p>The racialized, institutional violence and dispossession that the school’s dress code
                  inflicted on my new students prompted me to consider ways I could leverage my curriculum
                  to ignite student-based civic action. More specifically, after reflecting on the potential
                  power that petitioning against and publicly exposing injustice had, I decided to base
                  my “Persuasive Writing” unit on changing the dress code. Throughout the course of
                  the unit, students composed argumentative letters addressed to the district’s school
                  committee. I also wanted students to use these letters to participate in a speak-out
                  event that the school committee had planned in the spring of that school year to publicly
                  reveal the true and disturbing reality of the dress code policy. Working with students
                  to write these letters was by far one of the most transformative experiences in my
                  career as a teacher. In an approach that was based on synthesizing research and their
                  specific day-to-day material conditions, my students wrote cogent and powerful arguments
                  for why the dress code should be changed.</p>
               <p>It came as no great surprise that these arguments were quickly censored by the school’s
                  administrators. When they learned that I was working with students to present our
                  case to the school committee, a number of administrators visited my classroom with
                  the aim of disrupting our plan to disseminate the letters. My students were falsely
                  told that their constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression could not
                  be exercised at a school-run event. Although this was counter to the 1969 <span style="font-style:italic">Tinker v. Des Moines</span> Supreme Court decision that established that neither “students [nor] teachers shed
                  their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse
                  gate” (Fortas 506), my students were legitimately afraid to say anything that might
                  upset the school’s administration, especially because it was common practice to detain
                  students through in-school suspension for even very minor violations of school policy.
                  For myself, I remember being told in no uncertain terms that being vocal about this
                  issue could potentially impact my future career prospects as an educator because “principals
                  and superintendents talk.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the end, we were unable to send the letters. But despite this repression of student
                     and teacher resistance, the instructional unit still had a tremendous impact on my
                     students’ historical and political conceptions of themselves. In a post-unit reflection,
                     one of my students wrote: “Having gone through this unit, I would want you to teach
                     your future students this lesson. You taught us that we must stand up against the
                     people of power and that it’s wrong for them to be holding us back. This lesson taught
                     me that we have rights that are being taken away and changed just because the color
                     of our skin and because [of] our ages. You told us to fight against the system because
                     the system is corrupt.”

                     </div> Overall, my students’ powerful remarks indicated that the unit succeeded in promoting
                     their awareness of their historical agency and capacity for civic action. By the end
                     of the unit, students recognized that there will always be pathways for resistance
                     and subversion and that they must always continue fighting for their rights regardless
                     of the systemic barriers that powerful institutions will leverage against them. Students
                     also learned that the power of social change begins and is sustained through collective
                     civic action. In short, my unit was able to teach students the core values I internalized
                     from studying antislavery pedagogy, all through the framework of a curriculum of praxis.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Black Lives Matter Movement and Teaching for Civic Action</span></h2>
               <p>Notwithstanding experiences that could have derailed me from the path toward becoming
                  an educator, the lesson of resilience allows me to conclude this essay with a reflection
                  on what I have learned in my latest role as a teacher in the city of Revere, Massachusetts,
                  alongside my continuing role as a social justice activist in Peabody. After the murder
                  of George Floyd, a few colleagues and I formed a community organization called “Peabody
                  for Social Justice.” Our main focus has been raising awareness of the ways through
                  which the United States systematically attacks the lives of Black Americans and people
                  of color, whether through the militant policing of Black and Latinx neighborhoods,
                  the chronic underfunding of public education systems that primarily serve students
                  of color, the perpetuation of racialized and class-based inequities in the healthcare
                  industry, the unfair criminalization and imprisonment of people of color, the grotesque
                  exploitation of workers in predominantly Black and Brown communities, or by any other
                  means. In the words of our mission statement, we seek to “promote the values of liberty,
                  equality, and justice for all in our city, regardless of any individual’s race, ethnicity,
                  religion, cultural background, linguistic background, gender, sexuality, ability,
                  economic class, immigration status, or nationality.” To achieve this goal, we began
                  by leading a series of antiracism and anti–police brutality protests and rallies across
                  our predominantly white, middle-class suburban city. Next, we were able to arrange
                  a meeting with the city’s mayor to discuss more concrete and long-term political changes
                  to make Peabody more equitable and socially just. Some of the activities we proposed
                  included conducting thorough reviews of city policies, ordinances, and services for
                  race- or class-based biases; collecting and publishing data regarding the day-to-day
                  operations of city institutions; and organizing rallies and other events to promote
                  the need for social justice.</p>
               <p>In the spring of 2020, activists in Boston beheaded the statue of Christopher Columbus
                  that faced the waterfront in the city’s North End. Such events demonstrate that the
                  ongoing wave of civic action across the United States can be clearly traced back to
                  the continuous work of fighting against the legacy of slavery and contemporary manifestations
                  of white supremacy. When I returned to school after my summer of activism, I continued
                  to develop more robust civically-motivated lessons and antiracist curricula to spark
                  my students’ understanding of their own historical agency. For example, one instructional
                  unit I devised asked students to investigate and analyze current Massachusetts legislation
                  that involves the rights of marginalized socioeconomic groups and learn how they can
                  fight for social change at the state level by lobbying their elected officials. I
                  also continue to support students by incorporating the skills I learned from my early
                  activism to help them lobby for political changes that <span style="font-style:italic">they </span>want to see in the city, state, and beyond. In alignment with the principles of antislavery
                  pedagogy and Freire’s theory of praxis, I expect my students to utilize their ability
                  to read, analyze, and produce sustained discourse to influence social change, as well
                  as participate in more physical events of civic action.</p>
               <p>Now more than ever, we must embrace this emancipatory praxis promulgated by Freire.
                  As critical educators, we are constantly reminded that our roles and responsibilities
                  to our students extend far beyond the dominant “banking” concept of education, through
                  which “the students are the depositories [of knowledge] and the teacher is the depositor”
                  (Freire, <span style="font-style:italic">Pedagogy</span> 72). Instead, we must actively encourage students critically to examine the structures
                  of power and exploitation in their surrounding material conditions. By consistently
                  integrating theory and praxis in the classroom and offering students alternative visions
                  of the future, we can tap into their emerging conceptions of justice, equality, and
                  fairness. In my classroom, this looks like students conducting individually led, sustained-action
                  research projects based on social justice issues related to the course’s theoretical
                  frameworks.</p>
               <p>One project that encapsulates these ideas is the final project for my “World Revolutions”
                  unit. After students have learned about the conditions, beliefs, and triggers of some
                  of the world’s most significant revolutions, I ask them to research a country or place
                  they believe is ripe for a revolution today. In this project, students are invited
                  to integrate their understanding of the social, political, and economic causes of
                  earlier revolutions with the current historical moment. Rather than acting as a “depositor”
                  of information, my role in the classroom is to facilitate, challenge, and offer support
                  as students explore the material conditions of the past and present and the various
                  theoretical frameworks for interrogating it, such as Cugoano, Engels, Marx, Prince,
                  Williams, and others. Through self-directed, sustained-inquiry projects like the ones
                  I’ve described, we can ignite students’ passion for a better world, a world free of
                  slavery, exploitation, and oppression. As the story of my experiences with antislavery
                  pedagogy demonstrates, it was ultimately this kind of undertaking at various stages
                  of my development that guided and critically informed my trajectory from student to
                  researcher to educator to social activist and back.</p>
               <p>Although the challenges and institutional powers before us today in the twenty-first
                  century are unprecedented and complex, we cannot forget the historical importance
                  of the spirit of resilience to the project of abolition and social justice. As Cugoano
                  wrote: <span class="quote">‘This must appear evident, that for any man to carry on a traffic in the merchandize
                     of slaves, and to keep them in slavery; or for any nation to oppress, extirpate and
                     destroy others; that these are crimes of the greatest magnitude, and a most daring
                     violation of the laws and commandments of the Most High, and which, at last, will
                     be evidenced in the destruction and overthrow of all the transgressors. And nothing
                     else can be expected for such violations of taking away the natural rights and liberties
                     of men. (61)’</span> The abolitionists of the nineteenth century were up against some of the most powerful,
                  vicious, and despicable institutions of modern human history. Yet in their fight against
                  the transatlantic slave trade—the cradle of capitalism and present-day neo-slavery—the
                  abolitionists, radicals, and revolutionaries never ceased to envision a world in which
                  transgressors were overthrown and the rights and liberties of all people were upheld.
                  Antislavery pedagogy in the era of Black Lives Matter reminds us of the work that
                  we must do to keep ourselves united and organized to promote freedom and equality
                  for all. Claiming our own historical agency and the field for civic action means insisting
                  that debate must persist, even when authorities tell us it cannot.</p>
