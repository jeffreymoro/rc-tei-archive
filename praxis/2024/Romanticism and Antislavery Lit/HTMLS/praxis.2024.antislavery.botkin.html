            <p>This essay introduces strategies for reading and writing about Romantic-era antislavery
               literature in efforts to animate colonial textuality with Afro-Caribbean creative
               expressions. In this process, I am guided by the Jamaican concept of tunyuhan (“turn
               your hand”), or the practice of using available resources or materials to fashion
               something new and sustainable. My fieldwork in Jamaica and my collaboration with the
               Charles Town Maroons have informed my research methods, and I bring these inventive,
               dynamic practices into the classroom. Interweaving Romantic-period writing with contemporary,
               nonliterary, and occasionally disturbing texts, we consider ways that in reframing
               the past and interrogating its brutal aftermaths, we might imagine a better future.

               <h1><span class="head">Tunyuhan: From the Field to the Classroom </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Reading literature about slavery gives students a glimpse into Black lives in the
               eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but that’s not enough. Romantic-era accounts
               of slavery can whitewash the harrowing realities of plantation life, and even some
               authors of these texts acknowledge the ways their work has endured the interventions
               of their editors or imagined audiences. Whether excerpted, edited and “mard” (John
               Gabriel Stedman), transcribed or “pruned” (Mary Prince), “styled” (Olaudah Equiano),
               or “soiled” (William Earle), these texts bear the marks of the literary and social
               institutions and cultures that produced them. My pedagogical approach relies on introducing
               students to other kinds of texts beyond Romantic-era narratives to animate colonial
               textuality with the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture, which, in revising
               the past, imagines and nourishes future worlds. Inspired by Afro-Jamaican “tun yuh
               han mek fashion” techniques of improvisation and sustainability, I work with these
               materials, often contemporary and nonliterary, to refashion studies in Romanticism.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Gaama Gloria Simms (she goes by the honorific “MaMa G”), a Trelawny Maroon and Rastafarian,
                  taught me about <span style="font-style:italic">tunyuhan</span>. The term refers to the Jamaican proverb “tun yuh han (turn your hand) [and] mek
                  (make) fashion,” or to make the best use of available resources to create something
                  new and sustainable. Afrocentric and inherently revolutionary, tunyuhan, as Kaiton
                  Williams argues, “is tied up with the multiple and evolving sources of income and
                  pastimes from which we source our identity” (par. 5).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Williams associates tunyuhan with the “DIY mentality” that defines the Jamaican response
                           to “material absence” and also sees it as “a way to repair a break in the continuity
                           of people and culture sustained in the creation of our New World” (par. 8). She writes,
                           “All those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence continue to be as
                           much about making our world as about remaking our relation to it,” proposing also
                           that Jamaican multiplicity “is central to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression
                           of our soul and its determination” (par. 3).</span></div>
                  </div> MaMa G, for example, plans to create and market a line of clothing and accessories
                  made from repurposed materials as part of a therapy program for abused or vulnerable
                  women to give them emotional and economic support. She aims also to establish small
                  farms for self-subsistence, thus empowering Jamaican women and their communities.
                  Taking her social and intellectual work abroad through invited lectures and workshops,
                  MaMa G envisions opening a “borderless university,” located in Jamaica but developed
                  online, to unite local and global communities in the project of disseminating indigenous
                  knowledge. MaMa G’s financial circumstances—in part a rejection of modern capitalism—have
                  inspired her to create alternative modes of survival that rely on resourcefulness,
                  improvisation, and adaptability. Inspired by MaMa G and intrigued by the concept of
                  tunyuhan, I try to apply its inventive, collaborative practices to my teaching and
                  research.</p>

                  <p>I first met MaMa G through my research on the notorious Jamaican fugitive Three-Fingered
                     Jack (Jack Mansong), as I tracked stories about the Maroons who killed him. Looking
                     back, I realize that our first meeting taught me to (try to) relax into a kind of
                     nonteleological, suspended (sometimes surreal) state, very different from the structure
                     and solipsism of archival pursuits. “Everyday life is our classroom,” MaMa G has explained
                     to me, and “if you are not living it, you are so far from it [knowledge].” Fieldwork
                     in Jamaica has taught me to find knowledge everywhere, reveling in what Paul Youngquist
                     calls “ambient knowledge” (218).

                              knowledges; to localized or vernacular rather than globalized knowledge and memory”

                     trips, and etched in the landscape of the island; I’ve had conversations about Three-Fingered
                     Jack in kitchens, in farmyards, on hiking trails, in rivers, on mountains, and in
                     bat-filled caves. Cooperative, networked, improvisational, and dynamic, these perspectives
                     have helped me to, as Bob Marley would put it, “lively up” my research.</p>

                  <p>The connections I’ve made in Jamaica took time and tunyuhan to evolve into collaboration.
                     My fieldwork began with the Maroons of Charles Town, when their remarkable colonel,
                     the late Frank Lumsden, introduced me to his community and, indirectly, to MaMa G.

                              has four, arguably five, existing Maroon villages: Charles Town, Moore Town, Scots
                              Hall, Accompong, and, controversially, Trelawny/Flagstaff. Maroon communities are
                              self-governing, and in each of the Jamaican Maroon towns, the community elects or
                              installs a colonel or chief, who governs with the assistance of a council. However,
                              the Jamaican government periodically challenges the economic, social, and political
                              autonomy of the Maroons (Bilby, “Maroon Autonomy”).</span></div>
                     </div> I first met Colonel Lumsden at Kingston’s Red Bones Blues Café in 2008, upon his delivery
                     of one of his paintings to its proprietor and our mutual friend, Evan Williams. We
                     had been hearing about each other for months. Over cold Red Stripe beers, I asked
                     Colonel Lumsden if I might visit Charles Town to interview him and others about Three-Fingered
                     Jack. As it happened, Colonel Lumsden had been looking for an academic to organize
                     an international conference in Charles Town to fulfill his vision of a global indigenous
                     community. We struck a deal, and this relationship continues to enrich and beautifully
                     complicate my life, even after his death in 2015. I traveled to Portland, Jamaica,
                     in June 2009 to help establish the first International Charles Town Maroon Conference,
                     and in those summer months I spent time with Colonel Sterling of Moore Town, Colonel
                     Marcia “Kim” Douglas of Charles Town (deceased 2024), Lynette Wilkes, Worries McCurbin,
                     Brother Isaac Bernard, Keith Lumsden, and other Windward Maroons, building relationships
                     that have grown since.

                              Moore Town, and Scots Hall; those in the Leeward group are Accompong and Trelawny.</span></div>
                     </div> It took another two years for me to meet MaMa G, entirely by chance, through Colonel
                     Prehay of the Scots Hall Maroons.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I met with Colonel Prehay in the temporary office of a visiting Maroon official in
                  uptown Kingston. I found the space (with some effort) in a residential building adjacent
                  to the wedding-cake-shaped Devon House, an estate built in 1881 by Jamaica’s first
                  Black millionaire. In their distinctive hand-crafted coconut hats, Col. Prehay and
                  MaMa G sat patiently in the waiting area amidst the pastel décor of the mysterious
                  office, and I awkwardly asked questions about Three-Fingered Jack. Neither had much
                  to say about him. But MaMa G did have quite a bit to say about Indigenous women, the
                  Trelawny Maroons, and the power of improvisation for sustainability. I didn’t get
                  information for my book that day, but I decided to follow my instincts, realizing
                  when she invited me to her home that I had an opportunity to learn from this wise
                  woman.</p>
               <p>A few days later and after some logistical mishaps, I arrived at MaMa G’s East Kingston
                  home with what would become my customary offering: a pineapple, four Red Stripes,
                  and an orange juice for her granddaughter, Cookie. MaMa G’s East Kingston “yard” provided
                  a shady, breezy haven, with multiple signs of her community involvement in evidence.
                  I wasn’t sure exactly what I was doing there because MaMa G had expressed a marked
                  lack of interest in Three-Fingered Jack. But I felt drawn to her energy, and our initial
                  conversations focused on her frustrated departure from the social-work program at
                  the University of the West Indies and her subsequent commitment to grassroots community
                  organizing. That afternoon, MaMa G introduced me to the concept of tunyuhan as she
                  carefully stitched an elaborate hat wrought with coconut husk and recycled thread,
                  a creation she would proudly wear as she delivered a talk to the United Nations several
                  years later. Instead of extricating facts about Three-Fingered Jack, I developed strategies
                  for acquiring knowledge beyond the archive. I learned to slow down, listen, wait,
                  and even let go of (or at least defer) my intended goals. I found that knowledge should
                  be about exchange rather than extraction and that it requires openness, creativity,
                  and improvisation. These skills help in the classroom, too.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Tunyuhan in the Classroom</span></h2>
               <p>I teach at a large public university, and most English professors have limited opportunities
                  to teach classes in their areas of specialization because the number of majors has
                  been declining, as part of a national trend. When we offer Romanticism or the long
                  eighteenth century, we face extra pressure from students to keep it fresh and relevant
                  to our increasingly diverse student population. I use tunyuhan to make available a
                  more textured and topical understanding of Romantic antislavery texts. Motivated by
                  my Jamaican research and the interdisciplinarity of the Maroon conference, I use the
                  resources available to me, borrowing from other fields, experimenting with different
                  genres, and branching into other centuries. I used this approach in an upper-level
                  seminar for English majors that focused on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century representations
                  of slavery.</p>
               <p>I designed the course to interweave colonial and postcolonial literary and nonliterary
                  texts. With tunyuhan’s multiplicity in mind, I incorporated interviews, images, and
                  films to complement and challenge the conventions of literary historiography. Organized
                  chronologically, the class began with travel writing (Lydia Maria Child’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</span> [1838], extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s narrative of his military expedition
                  to Surinam) and transitioned to Eurocentric fiction (John Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</span> and Victor Hugo’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bug-Jargal</span>). We followed fiction with the voices of formerly enslaved people (Mary Prince’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave </span>[1831] and Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</span> [1789]). And we finished with contemporary Jamaican fiction (Marlon James’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span> [2009]). For the purposes of this essay, I will discuss only my classroom use of
                  Child, Earle, Prince, and James, situating these texts within larger cultural and
                  creative contexts. The Maroons played a significant role in my course partly because
                  they are so often neglected, but also because their cultural and spiritual practices
                  emphasize the connections I want to make between past, present, and future. Each unit
                  also included the creative expressions of contemporary Afro-Jamaicans, disrupting
                  the linearity of the syllabus to suggest the ways that the past leaves its mark on
                  the present, as well as the ways that reimagining the past can inspire future generations.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Tunyuhan practices will vary in the hands of different teachers and scholars because
                     the method involves the creative pursuit of individual interests and inspirations.
                     One makes the best use of the available resources, whatever they may be for that person.
                     Rather than following a list of suggested texts, videos, or websites, the teacher/scholar
                     will experiment with unique combinations of texts or ideas. Dynamic and inventive,
                     tunyuhan opens up possibilities and connections.

               <p>My work with the annual International Charles Town Maroon Conference and Festival
                  has increasingly informed my teaching as well as my research. Set in the Asafu Yard—once
                  a communal space to prepare for battle—it combines academic panels with drumming,
                  dancing, wellness workshops, and sacred ritual. Interdisciplinary, intergenerational,
                  and collaborative, this event takes academics out of their comfort zone and creates
                  connections with contemporary Maroons, local Jamaicans, and other international scholars.
                  Researchers meet the descendants of the people they study and teach; they hear their
                  voices, listen to their stories, and dance to their music. Literary scholars mingle
                  with geographers, geneticists with poets, and Maroons with ethnomusicologists.</p>
               <p>Many of the visiting scholars fold archival time into this trip, and their research
                  shifts as they move through experiences with people that, unlike archival records,
                  speak to and with them. Experiencing alternative models for the production of knowledge,
                  participants return to their campuses with more than the photocopies and facts that
                  serve the archival imperative and its hierarchies. I’ve worked to bring this kind
                  of knowledge into my classroom by using (filmed, digitized, or recorded) Maroon stories,
                  songs, rituals, and artwork, for example, to enliven the print texts. This “undisciplined”
                  mode of assembly responds to the call for what Christina Sharpe terms “wake work”
                  and attends to “the largeness that is Black Life, Black life insisted from death”
                  (17). These materials can also show the limitations, porousness, and vulnerabilities
                  of logocentric knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Stedman, author of <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</span> (1796), bemoaned the editorial intrusions that “mard” his narrative (as cited by Stedman,
                     xlix). An officer in the Dutch army deployed to the colony of Surinam to quell the
                     revolt of the Maroons in 1772, Stedman submitted his narrative to a London publisher
                     and bookseller, Joseph Johnson. The 1796 published version, much to Stedman’s irritation,
                     differed significantly from his original account, particularly in its representation
                     of Joanna (documented in Richard and Sally Price’s 1998 transcription of his 1790
                     manuscript). I won’t rehearse here the fascinating intricacies of what Dustin Kennedy
                     has termed the “Stedman Archive,” though I did begin there with my students.

                              though Joanna remained enslaved until her death.</span></div>
                     </div> I wanted to track different kinds of mediations that feature in writings about slavery,
                     even when produced by white men with relative power.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Child appropriated Stedman’s narrative for her own abolitionist purposes, but not
                  without ideological contradictions. For example, she admires the domestic affections
                  of Stedman and Joanna, yet she insists that abolitionists do not “induce anyone to
                  marry a mulatto, even should their lives be saved by such an one” (3). Her concerns
                  with propriety and miscegenation extend to her visual choices. Johnson’s edition includes
                  illustrations by the British engraver and portraitist Thomas Holloway. Among them
                  is an image of a bare-breasted Joanna; Child replaced this image with a more modest
                  one by a Boston engraver, George Girdler Smith. We studied both, which prompted one
                  irritated but engaged student to ask, “What’s up with her boobie?” A good question.
                  It’s a cover-up. Jenny Sharpe has suggested that cloaking Joanna’s breasts desexualizes
                  and yet emphasizes her role as wife and mother, registering the gender politics of
                  women abolitionists like Child (85). My students and I agreed that it also covers
                  up the violence visited upon enslaved women, whitewashing the realities of sexual
                  exploitation in the colonies. In addition, Child almost entirely excludes the Maroons
                  with whom Joanna had family connections and whose rebellions brought Stedman to Surinam
                  in the first place. I had the students read a few Maroon-focused chapters from Stedman’s
                  narrative with some Maroon historiography, which sparked their interest in the history
                  of these self-emancipated Afro-Caribbean peoples.</p>

                  <p>Improvising, I introduced some additional background on the Maroons of Suriname and

                     Maroons as the first woman Gaama, the highest political position among the Maroons

                     practiced in the Caribbean today. Because the ceremony took place at the Maroon conference,
                     students witnessed the interactions between the local community and visiting scholars
                     at this particularly moving event, showing them a different kind of scholarly method.

                  <p>Next, the class viewed a short docudrama about Nanny of the Maroons, <span style="font-style:italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </span>(2015), featuring MaMa G in a dramatization of the title character. Overtly addressing
                     the dearth of archival material about Nanny (only four sources), Roy T. Anderson’s
                     film features oral histories, music, and dance, and it includes interviews with Maroon
                     leaders, Olympic athletes, politicians, and historians. My students especially liked
                     the footage of a group of scholars and Maroons hiking to the remote former military
                     stronghold of Nanny Town. As one student wrote in a response paper: “The expedition
                     to Nanny Town up in the mountains shows that even now islanders still hold to these
                     ancient places and honor the spirits of the past there. I was surprised to learn that
                     many of the places in Jamaican folklore still exist such as Nanny Town to remember
                     a leader who took down the British, a kick-butt woman who could catch bullets in her
                     butt.”

               <p>The students enjoyed the film, so I showed them additional video clips of contemporary
                  Jamaican Maroons performing or explaining their lifeways (“Colonel Frank Lumsden,”
                  “Charles Town Maroons,” and “Charles Town Drummers”). Another student wrote that “hearing
                  from local Maroons such as Colonel Frank Lumsden and Delano Douglas gives the world
                  a better idea of Maroons as lovers of nature and defenders of their cultural history
                  in comparison with racist, colonialist generalizations that we read.” Other students
                  agreed that the paratextual materials “made Maroon history real” for them, and when
                  they returned to the course texts, they better understood the brave rebels omitted
                  almost entirely from Child’s text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Earle’s epistolary novel <span style="font-style:italic">Obi </span>likewise elides the role of the Maroons in his account of the fugitive from slavery
                     who was captured and killed by them in 1780. Earle’s novel falls short of its abolitionist
                     reach, and though it misrepresents the free status of Maroons, it reveals the complex
                     dynamics of a colonial state that pitted Afro-Jamaicans against one another. The weepy,
                     unreliable narrator, however, inspires little confidence, especially in his repetition
                     of the phrase “I am no author” (118). Famously overwrought and ideologically incoherent,
                     Earle’s “sentimentalist abolitionism” (50), though brilliantly edited and annotated
                     by Srinivas Aravamudan in the 2005 Broadview Press edition, has never been a crowd-pleaser
                     for my students.

                  <p>I can’t blame the students for their frustration with Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi</span>, against which we (much more to their interest) explored contemporary images of Jack
                     and the Maroon who killed him. First, we studied the Jamaican artist Omari “Afrikan”
                     Ra’s extraordinary painting of Three-Fingered Jack (n.d.), and the class listened
                     to my recorded interview with the artist, who spoke of the influences of revolutionaries
                     Makandal and Dutty Boukman. The students used Ra’s image to imagine a more nuanced
                     picture of the infamous outlaw. They commented on his hard, intense stare and the
                     words etched around his neck, perhaps suggesting the ways he’s been imprisoned by
                     print. The students also found it interesting to think about Jack’s relationship to
                     Quashie (also called “John Reeder”), the Maroon who took off Jack’s fingers and later
                     killed him. Colonel Lumsden’s stunning painting of Quashie, in white face paint and
                     rendered in “ambush,” depicts the complexity of this underrepresented figure in Jack’s
                     story.

                     he would make his own ruthless decisions” (Fig. 2). These Afrocentric images of Jack
                     and his killer usefully trouble Eurocentric textual accounts of colonial Jamaica with
                     their depictions of proud Black warriors forced into opposition with one another by

                  from a U.S. prison in December 2018, reminding my students that the prison-industrial
                  complex functions as an extension of plantation slavery (Kreps). Buju Banton represents
                  a potent expression of Black agency, harnessing the legacy of the island’s first freedom
                  fighters. Putting Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi</span> in conversation with contemporary Jamaican art and music amplifies Jack’s militant

               <p>Prince’s narrative alludes to sexual assault by her “indecent” enslaver but goes no
                  further than describing his “ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked” and ordering
                  her “to wash him in a tub of water” (24). When she resisted, he would beat her severely,
                  once prompting her to run away until the next morning. Prince’s account interweaves
                  silences about rape with acts of resistance. Yet even as Prince censors her narrative
                  to protect herself from allegations of promiscuity, Pringle included in his supplement
                  a letter that mentions Prince’s sexual relationship with an unnamed “Capt.” and noted

                     over, and when Massa Roget demands his bath-time sexual servicing (clearly evoking
                     Prince), Lilith drowns him and sets fire to the house to hide the evidence, killing
                     all its inhabitants, adults and children, enslaved and free. Despite this act, Lilith
                     resists joining plans for a multi-plantation rebellion engineered by the enslaved
                     head domestic, Homer, and Lilith’s half-sisters, the titular “Night Women.” Instead,
                     Lilith becomes mistress to the new overseer, Robert Quinn, because she needs his protection
                     from her previous tormentors. Already scarred with a “quilt” on her back, Lilith fears
                     the fate of Homer, who once ran away, and when caught by Maroons, underwent a public
                     flogging: “She cover up in scar big like animal stripe, her titties chop up and scar
                     up so that is only nipple left to tell you that she born to suckle” (382). Under Quinn’s
                     protection, Lilith suspects she can keep her own breasts intact and (like Joanna)
                     covered. Ambivalent and with divided loyalties, Lilith at once accommodates and undermines
                     the plantation system, oblivious to the contradictions that link her to the Maroons,
                     whom the novel frequently criticizes for their collaboration with the British.

                  in the classroom have in some cases prompted institutional resistance to exposing
                  the gruesome details and residues of the Atlantic slave trade. Yet the study of texts
                  about slavery should, with all due respect and sensitivity toward the experiences
                  or traumas of students, confront and illuminate the historical realities that have
                  shaped the anti-Blackness and structural racism of current cultures. My “note on content”

                  students more than others, demanding respect and tolerance as we move through difficult
                  material. James’s unapologetically graphic language and violent imagery understandably

                     than ignore the island’s past and present violence, writing instead about “a Jamaica
                     that never gets written” (as cited by Cain, n. pag.; see also Akbar). As an academic
                     (a professor at Macalester College) and a Booker Prize–winning author, James occupies

                  not new to Romanticism. Mary Shelley, for example, writes in her introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> (1831) that invention is borne out of chaos and “consists in . . . the power of moulding
                  and <span style="font-style:italic">fashioning</span> ideas suggested to it” (viii, emphasis added). As her novel shows, people tend to
                  fear what they view to be “dark” or “shapeless,” but the modern academy generally,
                  and the field of Romanticism particularly, could benefit from some creative if uncomfortable
                  admixture to animate existing materials. Bakary Diaby has asked Romanticists to “do
                  the work” to change the way we study Blackness in Romanticism (249). Until we have

                  remake Romanticism, changing our approach to texts about slavery not only to confront
                  and illuminate their violence and amnesia but also to incorporate and celebrate the
                  “largeness that is Black life” (Christina Sharpe 17). If we want our institutions
                  and disciplines to survive, we need to work with the materials we have to create something
                  new and sustainable. Tun yuh han mek fashion.</p>

               to “material absence” and also sees it as “a way to repair a break in the continuity
               of people and culture sustained in the creation of our New World” (par. 8). She writes,
               “All those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence continue to be as
               much about making our world as about remaking our relation to it,” proposing also
               that Jamaican multiplicity “is central to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression
               of our soul and its determination” (par. 3).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Shalani Puri has proposed that we consider what she calls “fieldwork in the Humanities”
               for access “to knowledge and expression unavailable in print; to disallowed or delegitimized
               knowledges; to localized or vernacular rather than globalized knowledge and memory”

               has four, arguably five, existing Maroon villages: Charles Town, Moore Town, Scots
               Hall, Accompong, and, controversially, Trelawny/Flagstaff. Maroon communities are
               self-governing, and in each of the Jamaican Maroon towns, the community elects or
               installs a colonel or chief, who governs with the assistance of a council. However,
               the Jamaican government periodically challenges the economic, social, and political
               autonomy of the Maroons (Bilby, “Maroon Autonomy”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">The Maroon villages are traditionally divided into Windward (on the east side of the
               island) and Leeward (on the west side). Windward Maroon villages include Charles Town,
               Moore Town, and Scots Hall; those in the Leeward group are Accompong and Trelawny.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">A reviewer of this essay thoughtfully asked me what the tunyuhan approach would look
               like in different hands than mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet people like
               MaMa G. In short, every person will have a different approach based on their interests
               and resources. My collaboration with the Maroons and MaMa G grew from my interest
               in their history in relationship to my project on Three-Fingered Jack. It took years
               to cultivate these relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led me to other
               opportunities too. The International Charles Town Maroon Conference and Festival,
               for example, continues to offer opportunities for professors and graduate students
               to engage with and learn about Maroon culture from contemporary Maroons and Indigenous
               peoples and scholars from around the world.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               mixed with rum, the British negotiated a treaty with the Maroons in 1739. The British
               and Maroons held completely different notions about the treaty. The British viewed
               it as the means to control the Maroons, and the infamous ninth clause commits the
               Maroons to returning fugitives and putting down island rebellions. For Maroons, the
               treaty celebrated their victory over the English after eighty years of war. Many non-Maroon
               Jamaicans view the Maroons as traitors because of the treaty, not unreasonably, driving
               anti-Maroon sentiment in Jamaica today. MaMa G views the treaty as a “trick,” informing
               my view of it as yet another example of English methods of divide and conquer, pitting
               Afro-Jamaicans against one another. For accounts of Maroon history, see Bilby, Campbell
               (1988), Carey (1997), Craton (1993), Kopytoff, Rediker and Linebaugh (2001), Roberts
               (2015), Robinson (1969), Wilson, and Zips (1999).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Homer is reclaiming the written word from an African tradition and not a Western one,
               complicating the binary between orality and literacy that is often posited in the

         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">In “Novel and History, Plot and Plantation,” Wynter argues that the history of Caribbean
               society “is that of a dual relation between plantation [the elite] and plot [the folk],
               the two poles which originate in a single historical process” (99). In doing so they
               created a folk culture that persists in resistant “secretive” histories, expressed,
               for example, in folk songs, kumina practices, or myal rituals (101). Wynter maintains
               that Caribbean literature registers the ambivalence between the plot and the plantation
               but sees the ambivalence as at once “the root cause of our alienation” as well as
               its “salvation” (99).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the rebellion, Lilith saves her father instead of participating in the destruction
               of the plantation, and afterward she remains in the house and “live[s] like a free
               negro” though she is not free (422). Injured almost to the point of death, Homer survives
               to live in the shadow of the plantation, leaving behind her scent of lemongrass, hiding
               forever after in the bush.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               to consider identity as a dynamic, always-constitutive “production” (6). Their introduction
               (and the issue itself) nicely theorizes and performs the power of the neo-slavery
               genre, calling attention to its particular relevance to Black British writing as it
               revises “the way in which British history is understood and remembered . . . [by exploring]
               the continuing legacies of slavery into twenty-first-century realities—economic and
               social inequity, racism, and the impossibility of fully belonging—which suggests that
               it is only by the full avowal of the past of slavery that the present might be understood
               and the future imagined” (2).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
