            <p>In the Spring semester of 2014, eighteen months prior to the course I describe in
               this essay, I had begun to study Afropessimism during a graduate seminar on global
               modernism. The following summer, when officers of the New York Police Department killed
               Eric Garner, when police officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown, when a highly
               militarized police force intensified its occupation of Ferguson, Missouri, Claudia
               Rankine published <span style="font-style:italic">Citizen</span> (2014), Black feminist activists founded the Movement for Black Lives, and Sandra
               Bland died in prison after her arrest following a pretextual traffic stop. Afropessimism
               offered an analytically rigorous and unflinching account of the paradigm of “ontological
               terror” (Warren) in which these events had occurred and a framework for reevaluating
               my fledgling pedagogical practices. Emerging in part from the acknowledgment of a
               continuum that links racial slavery to the anti-Blackness of contemporary Whiteness,
               policing, and state violence, Afropessimism challenges conventional accounts of civic
               reason and historical progress and produces a conceptual break to think through the
               paradigmatic anti-Blackness of global modernity in “the afterlife of slavery” (Hartman,
               <span style="font-style:italic">Lose Your Mother</span> 6).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Afropessimism explains the performance of anti-Black racism in higher education as
                  much as it explains the performance of anti-Black policing. As context for the discussion
                  on pedagogy that follows, I will briefly describe a spate of anti-Black violence on
                  the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst that took place in the fall
                  of 2014. Though I reproduce some of the language as it appeared on campus that fall,
                  my purpose in doing so is not to transgress Black suffering but to refuse a practice
                  so common to neoliberal institutionality by which systemic racism and structural violence
                  are hushed in the service of a recommitment to the institution. At the time, the incidents
                  I describe here led to the organization of somber events about “standing together
                  against racism,” to sanctimonious acts of “reflection,” to repetitious commitments
                  to “diversity and tolerance,” and to administrative calls to “work together to reaffirm
                  our values of inclusion and respect for all.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>An event called “Standing Together against Racism: A Week of Reflection, a Day of
                           Solidarity” was organized by the Anti-Racism Committee of English Students and Faculty
                           and featured a full-day “Solidarity Read-In” that I participated in on November 4,
                           2014. The phrase “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect for
                           all” appeared in a campus-wide email by the university’s chancellor, Kumble Subbaswamy,
                           on October 14, 2014.</span></div>
                  </div> There was little institutional recognition, however, of the well-documented history
                  of anti-Black violence as a longstanding tenet of the academy at large, little space
                  or outlet for the expression of Black anger, suffering, or rage, and no answer as
                  to why incidents of anti-Black violence should lead the “community” to <span style="font-style:italic">come together</span> as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic">coming apart</span>. Christina Sharpe comments on how often “the note of a more perfect union, the note
                  of unhearable Black suffering” is struck by leaders on occasions of anti-Black violence:
                  a striking note that “sutures Black suffering to romance and redemption” (par. 6).
                  It is a practice far too common that seeks, by way of anti-Black institutions, solutions
                  to the very problems they give rise to. I therefore describe these incidents in the
                  spirit of an antiromantic and antiredemptive abolitionism in the service of an imperfect
                  disunion.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In October 2014, amidst the cries and lamentations of protestors responding to the
               killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner that summer, anti-Black hate speech was
               found written on the door of a dorm room shared by two Black students in Harambee,
               a defined residential community for African and African American students. One of
               the students directly targeted, an undergraduate, had recently returned from Ferguson,
               where he had taken part in “Ferguson October,” a coalition-building social movement
               later known as “Ferguson Action.” It was written on his door during the fatefully
               named “Columbus Day” weekend (Odam). That same weekend, someone else had written explicit
               hate speech ostensibly targeting Mexican and multilingual Spanish-speaking students
               on the door of another dorm room, and the following week, several more students were
               targeted by a person later identified as Devin Ayres, who was charged with property
               damage and arraigned in the local district court, thereby leaving a public record
               of his “reasoning.” According to testimony quoted in reports, Ayres wrote “n*” on
               the door of one student because he knew her to be African American, while he wrote
               “you guys got nboyfriends” on the door of two White students because he knew one of
               them to be dating an African American man (Lederman, Vidales). Viewed through an Afropessimist
               lens, the performance of anti-Black sexual racism is neither aberrant nor anomalous
               but as banal and procedural as Ayres’s court testimony. In a university context, furthermore,
               the cop-out of White ignorance should not be allowed its ordinarily stabilizing effect
               for a multicultural society where education is purported to be the antidote to (rather
               than the cause of) anti-Black racism. There was nothing unknowing or unintentional
               about these acts of violence. Their intention, not to mention their effect, appears
               to have been to restore the order of White institutional dominance.</p>
            <p>A year later, in the fall of 2015, I taught an introductory “Ethnic American Literature”
               course oriented toward transatlantic (anti)slavery literature. The course’s emphasis
               on the legacies of (anti)slavery literature engaged constructions of race, gender,
               and minoritization in narratives of slavery, colonialism, emancipation, and political
               awakening in a campus climate antagonized by anti-Black violence. Some of the texts,
               like Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative </span>(1789) and Edgar Allan Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span> (1838), were drawn from the era of Romanticism, properly speaking, and animated our
               discussions of freedom, slavery, persuasion, and subjectivity. Most of them, however,
               were contemporary texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a “speculative” framework,
               like Mat Johnson’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>(2011), Celu Amberstone’s short story “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </span>(1995/2005), and Samuel Delany’s novella <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>(1966)—all texts that engage with race, racialization, and the rule of dominance in
               contemporary (anti)slavery. The course I was assigned to teach, “Ethnic American Literature,”
               is defined by the University of Massachusetts Amherst English Department as “American
               literature written by and about ethnic minorities, from the earliest immigrants through
               the cultural representations in modern American writing,” and the course is traditionally
               taught as an introduction to immigrant literature, focusing either on historical breadth
               or on a particular literary tradition (Jewish American literature or Asian American
               literature, for example). Because the department has no designated undergraduate course
               in Black studies, however, and because the course description itself implicitly excludes
               the forced migration of the transatlantic slave trade from the descriptive purview
               of the “ethnic,” I decided to create a version of the course that would reckon with
               the apparent unassimilability of racial slavery to the “immigrant” experience. Thus,
               two other themes drove my choice of the “sci-fi” texts on the syllabus, namely (time)
               travel and consciousness. More like an introductory (critical) ethnic studies or Black
               studies course than a survey of ethnic American literature, the course aimed to provoke
               commentary on race and (anti)slavery through Bildungsromans about characters who awaken
               to the realities of colonialism, conquest, and displacement.</p>
            <p>In the initial course design, Afropessimism provided a framework for understanding
               the wave of anti-Black terror as a brief moment of disequilibrium in the hegemony
               of everyday violence held over from slavery, rather than some shocking set of events
               unrelated to the political structure of the academy. I wanted students to engage with
               this continuum, to question their assumptions about the “pastness” of slavery, the
               progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism of the Obama
               administration. And I wanted them to <span style="font-style:italic">get mad</span>, to feel authorized to <span style="font-style:italic">express anger</span> about what was happening on campus—affects that, under the circumstances, I found
               preferable to “standing together” or tolerance, romance or redemption, or contrition
               or magnanimity. In the epigraphs above, Fred Moten speaks to a “dehiscence at the
               heart of the institution,” seizing on the ambiguity of that odd word to indicate how
               Black studies attends to the structural vulnerability of critical thought in the academy,
               where Black studies is furthermore constantly vulnerable to regulation, defunding,
               and marginalization. A (wound) dehiscence is an opening in a plant that allows seeds
               to disperse as well as a gaping incision in a body (politic) prone to infection. I
               did not at the time conceive of my pedagogy as a “dehiscent” one, but upon reflection,
               I see how teaching (in) the wounds of slavery pushed my class toward shared vulnerability
               rather than inviolable strength, and how this shifted the goals of student learning
               from individual mastery to “other motives,” namely humility, questioning, and (as
               Moten also notes) “selflessness” (<span style="font-style:italic">Universal Machine</span> 118).</p>
            <p>As we moved from Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> to the text it annotates (Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span>), the first half of the course addressed “the pathology of Whiteness,” a subject
               that animated a wide spectrum of student responses, ranging from sheer delight and
               selfless auto-critique to reactionary defensiveness and retrenched White supremacy.
               By producing a class that was vulnerable and conflicted, wounded and antagonistic,
               the prick and provocation of simply naming Whiteness led us into the second half of
               the course, which focused on “the Slave grammar of suffering,” a phrase I adopt from
               the work of Frank B. Wilderson III (<span style="font-style:italic">Red, White, and Black</span> 28 and passim). As I will go on to explain, “the Slave grammar of suffering” disrupts
               fantasies of social wholeness and historical redress from the ontological vantage
               point of the slave, inducing disquiet and anger rather than sentimentality or saviorism.
               Seizing on the double meaning of “dehiscence” as diaspora and wound, the essay then
               concludes with some afterthoughts on pedagogy: what do students learn and unlearn
               when asked to sit with the collective and enduring traumas of slavery?</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">The Pathology of Whiteness</span></h2>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, Mat Johnson’s third novel, follows protagonist Chris Jaynes, an assistant professor
                  of African American literature, whose desire to uncover “how the pathology of Whiteness
                  was constructed” (14) shapes his obsessive inquiry into the work of Edgar Allan Poe,
                  particularly <span style="font-style:italic">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</span>, Poe’s Antarctic expedition tale. Chris is the only Black professor at a small liberal
                  arts college in Manhattan, and as the only professor who specializes in African American
                  literature, he is denied tenure because in teaching courses like “Dancing with the
                  Darkies: Whiteness in the Literary Mind” (an allusion to Toni Morrison’s <span style="font-style:italic">Playing in the Dark: Whiteness in the Literary Imagination</span> [1992]), he refuses to play the part of “Professional Negro” (7). “You were hired
                  to teach African American literature,” explains the college president during a heated
                  exchange. “Not just American literature. You fought that. Simple” (13). Foregrounding
                  the racial politics of literary interpretation from the outset, <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> pits the institutional demand for minority representation (“We have a large literature
                  faculty, they can handle the majority of literature. You were retained to purvey the
                  minority perspective” [13]) against Chris’s heroic ambition to “[cure] America’s racial
                  pathology,” which “like all diseases . . . had to be analyzed at a microscopic level”
                  (8).</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>staged a series of questions for us to consider at the outset of the course. Why does
                  the college president say, “<span style="font-style:italic">Not just</span> American literature”? (emphasis added). Is African American literature (or ethnic
                  American literature) <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> American literature, per se? And if the latter category is in fact so specific as
                  to include these others, then why is it unmarked and unraced? Why not just refer to
                  it as <span style="font-style:italic">White </span>American literature? As the novel pursues such questions through a satirical travel
                  narrative that takes Chris and an ad hoc “Creole crew” to Antarctica in search of
                  the fabled island of Tsalal, that “great undiscovered African Diaspora homeland” referred
                  to in Poe’s text (“uncorrupted by Whiteness”), it also begins to answer them (39).
                  Whiteness is a “pathology and a mindset,” Chris thinks, not an “ethnic nomenclature”
                  (33, 31). It is “metaphorical” (30), an “ideology” (30), and a “strategy” (31). Above
                  all, “Whiteness isn’t about being something, it is about being no thing, nothing,
                  an erasure” (225), a claim that is confirmed symbolically when Chris and his crew
                  are enslaved by a “race” of culture-less “snow honkies” called Tekelians who rule
                  the white, windswept landscape of the South Pole (160). When their captivity among
                  the Tekelians appears to be inescapable, Chris’s uncle, Captain Booker Jaynes, tells
                  him, “You can’t run from Whiteness. You have to stand and engage it” (209). For Chris,
                  though, Whiteness is not something “to stand.” From New York to Antarctica, Whiteness
                  is the inescapable background of his every movement.</p>
               <p>To facilitate conversation between and among students, I assigned everyone to a small
                  (three-to-four-person) online writing group where they submitted short essays and
                  reading responses and provided each other with written feedback. In addition to my
                  notes on in-class presentations that were also required of every student, this online
                  record of the course is where I’ve drawn the direct quotations and paraphrased commentary
                  that appear throughout this essay.</p>
               <p>As painful as it is to see Chris denied tenure, students writing about <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> were decidedly more affected by his enslavement, and the gratuitous violence used
                  by the Tekelians to maintain control over their captives, than by the institutional
                  politics of race that led to his firing. One non-Black student of color wrote that
                  they were saddened by the apparent “hopelessness” of the novel, which seemed to suggest
                  that “no matter how hard they [the crew] try, whiteness cannot be escaped.” Yet several
                  students, perhaps feeling uncomfortable sharing this viewpoint with the whole class
                  so early in the semester, confided that they were refreshed by the novel’s reorientation
                  of the “normal” routes of novelistic desire, as <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> made the sniveling, nail-biting, blubber-eating white Tekelians repulsive and the
                  Black Creole crew attractive. Indeed, many students became more comfortable analyzing
                  Whiteness while reading <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>; and after also reading Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span>, one student concluded that Whiteness is an “idea of unity that, in the case of this
                  novel and perhaps in reality, only succeeds in destroying [rather] than bringing together.
                  It swallows only the ideas that perpetuate its image as salvation, purity, and goodness,
                  and erases all that would tarnish its brilliant color.” However, the criticism of
                  Whiteness engendered by these books also led to some reactionary defensiveness and
                  White entrenchment. In a response essay submitted to one of the online writing groups,
                  one student wrote that Chris’s reference to the indistinguishability of the Tekelians
                  (“they all pretty much looked the same to me” [131]) was effectively a form of reverse
                  racism. This was addressed and, I think, adequately corrected both in their peer group
                  and in the classroom, where we explained that an observer who is enslaved, and who
                  therefore has no material or discursive power, cannot be <span style="font-style:italic">racist</span>, even if that same observer can be provocative. I shared Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s definition
                  of racism as “the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of group-differentiated
                  vulnerabilities to premature death” (28), and we made this one of the running definitions
                  of racism for the course as a whole.</p>
               <p>The satirical tone and allegorical humor of <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> makes it an accessible index for critiquing Whiteness and engendering generous if
                  sometimes painful (auto)critique. Having read it prior to Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative</span>, and along with excerpts from Morrison’s <span style="font-style:italic">Playing in the Dark</span>, students are presented with a persuasive case to study Whiteness as pathology, strategy,
                  ideology. What is additionally generative about these texts is that although they
                  are sometimes misrecognized as saying that “race” is a biological signifier, they
                  also prompt students to think about the evaluative symbolism of “color.” Early on
                  in <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, Chris comments on a passage of Poe’s novel where the narrator observes a river on
                  the island of Tsalal “made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue;
                  [whose] cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and
                  imperfect in regard to neighboring veins” (29). Chris suggests that the description
                  resembles the “racial fantasy” of Booker T. Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise,” a fantasy,
                  in other words, of functional segregation (29). I taught Poe’s imagery as an anti-Black
                  fantasy of (social) control over the distribution of color, however, pointing out
                  that this fantasy is represented repeatedly in both novels.</p>
               <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, for instance, Mahalia Mathis is the great-great-granddaughter of Poe’s “hybrid”
                  character Dirk Peters. Although she appears to Chris to be phenotypically Black, Mathis
                  refuses African heritage. She heads the Native American Ancestry Collective of Gary,
                  Indiana (NAACG), a group that uses DNA testing to prove that their genes have “no
                  kind of Africa”: “I got lots of Indian in me. I got Irish and I got a little French
                  too. I got some German, or so I’m told. I even got a little Chinese in me, on my mother’s
                  side. Matter of fact, I’m sure I got more bloods in me than I knows. But I do knows
                  this: I ain’t got no kind of Africa in these bones” (49). This anti-Black fantasy,
                  which plays itself out in the self-recognition of several “colors” ostensibly excluding
                  “black,” also plays out in the color symbolism of Chris’s Antarctic expedition. After
                  he and his best friend, Garth, escape their captivity among the Tekelians, they flee
                  to an Antarctic BioDome owned by a painter, Thomas Karvel (a parody of Thomas Kinkade,
                  a popular American artist who billed himself as “the Painter of Light”), who provides
                  them shelter while they work a small plantation. True to his moniker, “the Master
                  of Light” is a sovereign of <span style="font-style:italic">color</span>, a monarch over a Disney-like “fantasy of Whiteness” marked by the manufactured monochromatic
                  oversaturation of the BioDome, where the animals are too-white, the grass too-green,
                  the river too-blue, but where nothing is black except Chris and Garth, the interlopers
                  (185). Indeed, Chris complains to Garth that Karvel’s paintings never have Black people
                  in them; even worse, he suspects that in Karvel’s work, “black people couldn’t exist,
                  so thorough was its European romanticization” (184).</p>
               <p>In “The Case of Blackness,” Fred Moten writes that “the cultural and political discourse
                  on black pathology has been so pervasive that it could be said to constitute the background
                  against which all representations of blacks, blackness, or (the color) black take
                  place,” arguing in sum that “blackness has been associated with a certain sense of
                  decay, even when that decay is invoked in the name of a certain (fetishization of)
                  vitality” (177). As if throwing their hands up, one student recognized “the absurdity
                  in our world’s thought process that anything, even things of the same nature such
                  as mice and birds, can be separated and classified into greater and lesser categories
                  just because of color.” But Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>and Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative</span> suggest a politics of chroma that goes beyond irrational absurdity. For if black
                  is theoretically every color, and whiteness is theoretically no-color, <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> suggests that “the pathology of Whiteness” lies precisely in this desire to master
                  color itself. Whiteness is an ideology and a strategy because it is an operation that
                  speciates every-color into veins of a river that do not “commingle,” turning inward
                  into monochromatic oversaturation, dividing up into “ethnic” varieties of American
                  literature. Blackness is the chromatic equivalent of refusing this violent speciation,
                  and Whiteness is by definition antagonistic to such a politics.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Slave Grammar of Suffering</span></h2>
               <p>In the anti-Black environment in which my students and I moved our way through this
                  course, I was not surprised that some students would perform their Whiteness through
                  reactionary defensiveness and entrenched White supremacist logics. I was heartened,
                  however, that for the most part the White and non-Black students of color in the course
                  allied with the interest of their Black peers (which is to say, with Blackness) and
                  committed themselves seriously to diagnosing “America’s racial pathology.” Questioning
                  the basis of one’s relationship to Whiteness can produce existential crises that overflow
                  what a normative classroom is able to hold, putting students in a position that may
                  be analogous to the one occupied by the person who asked Frank Wilderson, in an online
                  interview, what a White person could do to interpellate Afropessimism without succumbing
                  to a form of reasoning that would lead them to suicide: “As a white person who feels
                  bad about all my race does, what can I do to help besides killing myself?” Wilderson’s
                  answer was swift and to the point. Rather than “kill yourself,” the questioner should
                  get angry and “undo yourself.” Moreover, the questioner should develop “ways and means
                  for your speech and action to be authorized by a Black/slave grammar of suffering
                  rather than the grammar of suffering of subalterns.” Wilderson concluded the answer
                  by remarking on the radical potential of the questioner’s “undoing”: “You are far
                  more dangerous by being committed in this long, protracted struggle than you are or
                  would be if you just check out” (Wilderson, “I Am Frank”). After the first half of
                  the course focused on the pathology of Whiteness, the second half took up “the Slave
                  grammar of suffering.”</p>
               <p>What is the difference between the subaltern grammar of suffering and “the Slave grammar
                  of suffering,” and what does it mean to be “authorized” by the latter? In <span style="font-style:italic">Red, White, and Black</span> (2010), Wilderson defines grammar as “the structure through which the labor of speech
                  is possible,” arguing that scripts which view “social turmoil through the rubric of
                  conflict (i.e., a rubric of problems that can be posed and conceptually solved)” (5)
                  represent, on the one hand, a subaltern grammar of suffering in which grievances are
                  submitted and solutions proposed to return aggrieved parties to a condition of prior
                  wholeness. On the other hand, scripts that view social turmoil through a “rubric of
                  antagonism (an irreconcilable struggle between entities, or positions, the resolution
                  of which is not dialectical but entails the obliteration of one of the positions)”
                  represent a “Slave grammar of suffering” that disrupts the dream of repair (5). One
                  of the primary distinctions between a “Slave grammar of suffering” and a grammar of
                  subaltern suffering concerns a text’s relationship to resolution. From the vantage
                  point of the Slave, whose exclusion from civil society is fundamental to the freedom
                  enjoyed by citizens (Wilderson’s terminology includes “Humans,” “Whites,” and “Settlers”),
                  inclusion is a form of “obliteration.” Being authorized by “the Slave grammar of suffering”
                  therefore begins with refusing the “prescriptive gesture” of reconciliation. For Wilderson,
                  it continues (through Frantz Fanon via Aimé Césaire) with “the end of the world .
                  . . the only thing . . . worth the effort of starting” (337).</p>
               <p>As literary texts, Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees,” Octavia Butler’s “Amnesty” and “Bloodchild,”
                  Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span>, and Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> are all available to interpretation through the grammar of suffering: “Refugees”
                  through a colonizer/colonized dynamic on the fictional planet of Tallav’Wahir; “Amnesty”
                  and “Bloodchild” through the lens of captivity on earth and on the Tlic planet (respectively);
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span> through its plot to emancipate the enslaved Lll; and the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> through its autobiographical account of enslavement. Yet as a story about people
                  relocated from a postapocalyptic earth, “Refugees” seems to engage the suffering of
                  the colonized or the migrant subject struggling to reestablish the customs of their
                  homeland; it does not engage “the Slave grammar of suffering,” since through “natal
                  alienation” such resolution is ultimately unavailable to the Slave (Patterson 5).
                  Similarly, by focusing on a human protagonist who translates between human beings
                  and an extraterrestrial lifeform that has colonized earth, Butler’s “Amnesty” is more
                  about structural adjustment and human de-exceptionalism than it is about slavery.
                  “Bloodchild” certainly appears to be about slavery, and many students were certain
                  it was; they were therefore puzzled that Butler herself disagreed (“It amazes me that
                  some people have seen ‘Bloodchild’ as a story of slavery” [30]). However, as one student
                  observed about the gender and reproductive politics of the story, Butler was probably
                  right to call her narrative about the implantation of a male human named Gan with
                  Tlic larvae a “love story,” rather than a slave narrative: <span class="quote">‘It is interesting that in a society where women get pregnant and have children all
                     the time, it is often called love, but when it is a man being impregnated in almost
                     the same exact way, it can be seen as slavery. Perhaps this happens because sci-fi
                     novels are seen as so drastically different in their own imagined worlds that it is
                     hard to see their similarity to the reality of life on Earth, or it is because of
                     the patriarchal views that have been instilled in the reader that affect how “Bloodchild”
                     is read.’</span> Prompted by such articulate student writing, I wonder, then, when I thought I was
                  teaching about slavery several years ago, if I was not, perhaps, teaching about something
                  else. Recognizing that not all of these texts are engaged with the grammar of Slave
                  suffering places pressure on how I would teach Romantic antislavery literature and
                  its legacies in the future, especially when the topic is “the slave narrative.”</p>
               <p>Of all the texts we read together, Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>gets nearest to representing the suffering of the Slave, as it were, grammatically.
                  At the center of this novella about slavery and emancipation in a far-off galaxy is
                  “the suffering of the Lll” (79), a race of world-building beings whose emancipation
                  is seemingly dependent on the delivery of a message to Empire Star by the young protagonist,
                  Comet Jo. As students begin to notice, however, the Lll never speak. They are always
                  described collectively, never individually. And their enslavement seems to be constituted
                  as much by their silence as through the garrulous verbosity of everyone else with
                  something to say about why the Lll should be or should not be emancipated, which is
                  to say, every other “free” character. “Their place in the book is the un-speaking
                  point of conflict,” wrote one student; indeed, “they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> conflict, not <span style="font-style:italic">character</span>, not <span style="font-style:italic">being</span>. And while they might achieve ‘emancipation,’ they are not free, but remain enslaved
                  to others with a voice.” The world of <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span> clearly depends upon the slavery of the Lll, making their emancipation a political
                  farce and their suffering an antagonism with no redress—pessimistic conclusions frankly
                  confirmed by <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star</span>’s circular, spiral, and “retrocausal” form (Shephard). Treating the continuum of
                  slavery and emancipation as a formal element of the text, the novella ends exactly
                  where it began, with Comet Jo realizing he has been tasked with Lll emancipation perhaps
                  many times before.</p>
               <p>By contrast, Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> appears to end on a somewhat hopeful, solution-oriented note based on free-market
                  liberalism, the British state’s capacity for “justice,” and the good will of “every
                  man of sentiment” (176). Yet if this prescriptive gesture lends itself to an interpretation
                  as a grammar of suffering from a subaltern rather than Slave perspective, the book
                  is nevertheless undoubtedly a narrative that grapples with exposing the grammar, or
                  structure, of Slave suffering. In one class discussion of the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>, a conversation that continued in our online discussion forum, I introduced students
                  to the evidence compiled by Vincent Carretta suggesting that Equiano may have been
                  born in Carolina, even though his autobiography tells us he was born in Africa, was
                  captured as a child, and suffered the Middle Passage (see also Youngquist). I explained
                  that Carretta’s evidence included the ship’s log for Equiano’s Arctic voyage as well
                  as the record of his baptism, both of which identified Carolina as his place of birth.
                  I also explained that Carretta’s intent was not to cast doubt on Equiano’s narrative
                  but to raise questions about what literary and political concerns may have motivated
                  Equiano’s fabrication, if it were indeed true. Why would Equiano invent a first-person
                  fiction in the midst of a true autobiography?</p>
               <p>The conversation that ensued more or less followed Carretta’s own conclusions: Equiano’s
                  political motivation was to abolish slavery, and an account that included a young
                  child being captured and enduring the Middle Passage was the most likely way to provoke
                  what one non-Black student referred to as a “drama-driven English audience.” Elaborating
                  on a now-foundational connection between the liberal antislavery movement and spectacular
                  representations of Black suffering (Hartman, <span style="font-style:italic">Scenes of Subjection</span>), some students were therefore content to understand autobiography as a genre with
                  certain formal needs and capabilities, including “literary devices.” Abolition by
                  any means necessary. Others went so far as to suggest that it was “natural and unavoidable
                  to lie when selling a story,” and that the act of lying “is practically part of the
                  social contract” between writers and readers.</p>
               <p>This conversation was enormously productive for changing the mind of at least one
                  non-Black student, who wrote online that before the full unfolding of our class discussion
                  he viewed Equiano’s potential fabrication as a way to disguise his status as an otherwise
                  “privileged slave” who was able to read, write, and build relationships with free
                  Whites. “I thought that it seemed a bit ridiculous that he would make things up and
                  make [a narrative of his capture and the Middle Passage] sound like his own life to
                  rouse sympathy in the readers,” wrote the student, whose classmates were quick to
                  jump on the notion of “privilege” at play. One non-Black peer wrote that they would
                  “hesitate to call a slave privileged, especially since it is clear from the text that
                  Equiano does not define himself this way and consistently refers to any good luck
                  that comes his way as an aberration from a system that is built to deny him any good
                  fortune. He certainly considers himself blessed, mainly in retrospect after being
                  freed, but his narrative is demonstrating how the institution of slavery blocks privilege
                  based on race.” A good point—although it was ultimately not the purpose of the first
                  student to pursue the idea of “privilege.” Rather, in examining why Equiano would
                  fabricate aspects of his autobiography, the student had become interested in whether
                  it was Equiano’s intention “to voice stories of other slaves that do not have the
                  opportunity to.” In other words, was Equiano’s narrative more of a social history
                  than an autobiography?</p>
               <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">The Intimacies of Four Continents</span> (2015), Lisa Lowe demonstrates how Equiano’s narrative, given voice through a genre
                  of liberalism (“In a sense, the autobiography is the liberal genre par excellence”
                  [46]), reveals a connection between slavery, subjugation, and “the singular life”
                  (71). In thinking of the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> as a kind of polyvocal performance of himself and “other slaves,” then, my student
                  was perhaps moving toward a critique of autobiography: Olaudah Equiano was not only
                  Equiano, he was also Gustavus Vassa, and he was born in multiple places. In attempting
                  to find a grammar requisite to the suffering of the Slave, Equiano/Vassa had to call
                  the genre of the autobiography, the narrative of the singular life, into profound
                  question. Even though the <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative </span>concludes with a predictable form of prescriptive redress, much of it nevertheless
                  strives toward a “Slave grammar of suffering” that is collective and dispersed rather
                  than selfish, self-made, or individual. The internal differentiation of Equiano’s
                  narrative into that of Gustavus Vassa <span style="font-style:italic">as well as </span>“[those] slaves that do not have the opportunity” leads us to think and imagine antislavery
                  everywhere.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Toward a Pedagogy of Dehiscence</span></h2>
               <p>In recent years, the field of Black studies has become, perhaps more consciously than
                  ever before, an interdisciplinary mode, a fugitive method, and an intellectual itinerary
                  variously referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">black study</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">black </span>study<span style="font-style:italic">, and </span>black <span style="font-style:italic">studies</span>, which are inseparable but nevertheless distinguishable from the disciplinary study
                  of blackness, Black people, or Black arts and culture. While there are many descriptions
                  of what black study is and does, Moten’s description of it as “a dehiscence at the
                  heart of the institution and at its edge” (“Black Op” 1743) has animated these afterthoughts
                  on the pedagogy of dehiscence in and as a form of wounding that is also a plan of
                  dispersal. Dehiscence is a recurring concept in Moten’s work, where he mobilizes uses
                  of the phrase from Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Lacan with a difference—as
                  in the second epigraph, from an essay on Adrian Piper, where he further elaborates
                  on dehiscence as a “motif of selflessness” against the longstanding association of
                  subjectivity with the inviolability of the possessive individual (<span style="font-style:italic">Universal Machine </span>118). My understanding of dehiscence as a marginal if animating premise and practice
                  of Black studies postdates the “Ethnic American Literature” course I have described.
                  However, in our attention to “the Slave grammar of suffering” expressed in course
                  materials, in society in general, and on the UMass Amherst campus circa 2014/15 in
                  particular, we were, I think, working toward a pedagogy of dehiscence—a learning environment
                  that takes place in the vulnus or wound of slavery thought to have been closed by
                  emancipation, reconstruction, and civil rights.</p>
               <p>My use of the word dehiscence to describe a method of teaching (anti)slavery literature
                  and its legacies thus weaves together Black studies pedagogy with the intellectual
                  and scholarly protocols of Afropessimism, which repeatedly express dissatisfaction
                  with the state of academic knowledge production as civic engagement, politically acceptable
                  modes of reform, and solution-oriented prescriptive gestures for addressing the continuum
                  of anti-Black violence. In the introductory “Ethnic American Literature” course that
                  I have described, it was difficult to address “the pathology of Whiteness” and “the
                  Slave grammar of suffering” in part because students accustomed through education
                  to think of themselves as becoming productive individuals, engaged citizens, and masters
                  of solutions in a context driven by competition against one another are not accustomed
                  to “undoing” aspects of their education rather than advancing their careers. There
                  is nothing that excludes radical forms of care and compassion from a classroom informed
                  by these practices. However, the feelings of woundedness and vulnerability in my class
                  did not immediately lend themselves, nor should they have, to being neatly, cleanly
                  sutured.</p>
               <p>In a well-known passage of <span style="font-style:italic">Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom</span> (1994), bell hooks shares an anecdote about the pain her students feel when they
                  take her classes: “We take your class. We learn to look at the world from a critical
                  standpoint, one that considers race, sex, and class. And we can’t enjoy life anymore”
                  (42). hooks concludes the passage by suggesting that modeling mutual respect for that
                  pain reveals its commonness among students “across race, sexual preference, and ethnicity,”
                  and she writes that through sharing this pain her classes “build community” (42–3).
                  In the “Ethnic American Literature” course I taught, students experienced similar
                  feelings of pain, confusion, remorse, anger, and defensiveness when sitting with the
                  violence of Whiteness and the enduring suffering of slavery’s afterlives, and though
                  I do not wish to disagree with hooks’s optimistic comments about community-building,
                  I do wish to question them. To my mind, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not (at least
                  not at first) end in a reformed community. Instead, in ways much more congruent with
                  recent literature in abolitionist pedagogy (Dunn, Love, Rodriguez, Whynacht), it opens
                  up the possibility of ending “community.” Put another way, a pedagogy of dehiscence
                  does not seek simply to undermine the hierarchical relations of the classroom and
                  build community on disingenuous assertions of equality in the afterlife of slavery.
                  Rather, a pedagogy of dehiscence acknowledges that the classroom continues to be structured
                  by the social relations of conquest, colonialism, and slavery, and accepts that the
                  wound this creates ought to cause one (one? many? who? us?) to pursue the abolitionist
                  endeavor of ending <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> kind of world. Wherever that endless struggle takes us, that’s where we start.</p>
