            <p>When we teach our students about the slave trade and the abolition movement, an Atlantic
               studies perspective that involves the circum-Atlantic trade of goods and persons is
               necessary to disrupt a white Anglo-American dialogue of historical persons and texts
               with a more fluid set of networks and relationships. In order to situate an Atlanticist
               pedagogy, I enlist the historical nautical strategy of triangulation between Africa,
               the Caribbean, and Britain in its metaphorical sense: the triangulation of three narratives
               within contextual materials; the triangulation of literary interpretation with historical
               and current interpretive concepts and methods; the triangulation of Atlantic coasts
               and land entities; and the triangulation of the strategic terms “fluidity,” “circulation,”
               and “movement” borrowed from nonliterary fields of study. Effectively, an Atlantic
               approach has the depth and breadth to put history, economic trade, political movements,
               and maritime realities in relation to rhetorical and figurative analysis of literary
               texts. </p>

               <p>Romantic period studies has tended to focus on those literary and cultural concerns
                  that apply to Anglo-American relations in terms of a transatlanticism belonging to
                  a determinate timeframe. However, the Romantic period was an age of global capitalism,
                  plundered resources, and cross-contamination; therefore, enlarging the Anglo-American
                  dialogue of public voices and efficacious texts more expansively makes sense, as Bernard
                  Bailyn and Joselyn M. Almeida have argued in separate contexts. Although I will be
                  focusing here on the triangular relation of Africa, Britain, and British holdings
                  in the Caribbean, folding into that relation the French colony of Saint Domingue and
                  the American city Philadelphia for two of the texts discussed, the same argument for
                  expanding the field of analysis holds for colonizers, the colonized, and brutalized
                  or enslaved peoples of other territories within panatlantic land masses. The point
                  of engaging with these histories, the ideologies that produced them, and the testimonies
                  of survivors is that the concerns of the Atlantic world remain central to the concerns
                  of today’s Atlantic and global reality. Historically, too, a more expansive treatment
                  of the Romantic-era Atlantic world could put the trading circuits of the West Indies
                  and the East Indies in dialogue; or one might make the connection for students between
                  the working of West Indian plantations and the not-too-different circumstances of
                  the diamond mines today in mineral-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of
                  the Congo, nations whose people see no profit from the rapacious mining of their land
                  by others. In terms of the transatlantic, this more expanded perspective is the interdisciplinary
                  domain of Atlantic World studies, which involves a deep sense of history from plate
                  changes in the ocean’s bottom to human geography (which, for example, examines migration
                  patterns over centuries, death tolls among enslaved people, and movement between Caribbean
                  islands and plantations).

               <p>The dilemma of what can be crammed into a class discussion arises when the materials
                  concerning the sites of literary production and dissemination (important for emphasizing
                  the precarity of narratives and testimonials of enslaved peoples) can be enriched
                  through contextualizing documents, such as those of charity organizations or Parliamentary
                  records of abolitionist and other conservative documents. Yet I want to argue instead
                  for a more engaged Atlanticist lens to broaden how we situate and affirm the complexities
                  of Atlantic life for students, the malleable nature of Atlantic identity, and its
                  opportunities for self-reinvention.

                           teaching the Romantic period: the Black Atlantic intersects with the Red Atlantic
                           (the circulation, exchanges, and material productions of indigenous peoples in the
                           Atlantic and coastal regions of the Americas, as well as their travels to Britain,
                           Europe, and Africa), and the Hispanic and Lusophone Atlantic world whose historical
                           importance loomed large in the period, as well as the Francophone Atlantic, all of
                           which extend our teaching about British Empire through these other circulations and
                           imperial networks.</span></div>
                  </div> To think pedagogically using such a lens has allowed me to think more broadly geographically
                  and temporally in order to situate the revolutionary aspects of Atlantic life in the
                  Romantic period. My main strategy is one I adapted from the nautical strategy of triangulation
                  to teach literary interpretation of narratives and testimonials of enslaved persons,
                  historical texts or information, related texts and websites in groups of three, and
                  to apply Atlantic studies concepts and methods in connection with literary analysis.
                  The strategy of triangulation has been richly explored in the work of Bailyn, Jeremy
                  Smith, Almeida, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz, and others.

                  </div> Against the Anglo-American oppositional model, triangulation is not just adding a
                  middle term to create a dialectical engagement; rather, it involves the fluid movement
                  of dynamic relationality among multiple and variable subjects. In this way texts can
                  be revisited several times to re-see them, and the strategic terms “fluidity,” “circulation,”
                  and “movement” help students approach the revisiting as necessary and deepening rather
                  than repetitive. This strategy has helped me unpack with my students a vitally mobile
                  and contingent arena in which texts embodying this dynamic can be read against those
                  stemming from empire, against each other, and within a network of unstable conditions
                  and circumstances.

            <p>Moreover, broadening the historical horizon from an Atlantic World perspective allows
               students to view the slave trade, abolition, and radical politics during the Romantic
               period as conversant with our contemporary politics. The courageous voices of those
               enslaved during the Romantic period take on a new legitimacy for my most recent students,
               compared with the way earlier student cohorts had responded to such texts; current
               students can more readily hear and empathize with the outrage of those from so long
               ago. This outrage responds to the authority of lived experience. While students understand
               that the value of <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> singular life made clear in individually voiced accounts was politically important
               to the abolitionist cause, the personal and communal resilience that such accounts
               express was necessary then and comes across all these many years later to be heard
               in all its dignity. These voices, then, can be further complicated (rather than polarizing
               them against the claims of colonists and politicians) with the biographies of figures
               like Baron de Vastey, who Marlene Daut has argued was signal for the development of
               a “[B]lack Atlantic humanism.” In counterpoint to Toussaint L’Ouverture’s rhetorical
               promotion of brotherhood across color lines, Vastey, a Haitian of biracial descent
               and Toussaint’s contemporary, critiques colonial dependencies on slavery. The slave
               trade and the high morbidity of slave labor, Vastey unceasingly argued, reveals that
               a free-market economy is merely an ideological justification for the inexcusability
               of racism.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Using material like Daut’s <span style="font-style:italic">Baron de Vastey and The Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism</span> (2017) to set the triangle trade within cosmopolitan humanism, as well as other globalizing
                  contextual materials (the competition between goods produced in the East Indies and
                  the West Indies, for instance), expands the horizon of how we teach the transatlantic
                  and the Atlantic world, but only if those singular voices are heard as integrated
                  with larger contexts. Accounts of formerly enslaved persons are important for our
                  students because, although mediated for a white audience, they make disclosures about
                  lived experience that novels can only gesture to, especially for those students who
                  resist the empathy necessarily involved in reading actual accounts, and worse, the
                  documentation of abusive planter practices.

                           helped me in teaching Black British writing, as well as Aljoe’s Creole Testimonies
                           (2012), which distinguishes between the testimonial and the narrative in terms of
                           authorial voice and rhetorical strategy. More recently, Chander and Matthew’s “Abolitionist
                           Interruptions” has extended how to think about slave narrative and about antislavery
                           literature as a genre.</span></div>
                  </div> While I rely on the arguments of Mark Salber Phillips for understanding historical
                  distance through the narrative function, that gut-level pain is also interpretatively
                  valid. To make connections between textual accounts in a way that makes for meaningful
                  interpretation, I have found that starting with an emotionally rather than physically
                  painful event can translate what students may be feeling into something we can discuss
                  and then extend to other connections between the texts that are more politicized,
                  and therefore more rhetorically inflected.</p>

                  </div> Prince’s account of the end of childhood, when her mistress sends her to work at another
                  house, is charged with the distress of the twelve-year-old girl; but the moment when
                  her mother has to take her and her sisters to the slave market to be sold after the
                  death of her mistress, despite the distance of years at the time of writing, is suffused
                  with emotional pain at confronting this final separation from family and home. Beginning
                  with the day before, she writes: “Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,—it
                  is too much.—It recalls the great grief that filled my heart, and the woeful thoughts
                  that passed to and fro through my mind, whilst listening to the pitiful words of my
                  poor mother, weeping for the loss of her children” (3). In describing the next morning,
                  Prince uses funereal language to depict the emotional death she and her mother feel
                  at this moment: “The black morning at length came. . . . Whilst she was putting on
                  us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be sold, she said, in a sorrowful voice,
                  (I shall never forget it!) ‘See, I am <span style="font-style:italic">shrouding </span>my poor children; what a task for a mother!’” (3). This chilling moment, in which
                  the mother has to sell her own children at the slave market, is heartrending in itself,
                  while Prince’s use of language and word choice feels authentic rather than rhetorically
                  distant (“I shall never forget it!”); the imagery of a funeral rather than a marketplace
                  symbolizes the death of the subject-self that being sold is meant to create. But the
                  exclamations and the never-forgotten emotion reveal, just as surely, that Prince has
                  held on to her subjectivity in a way that students can now see is revealed throughout
                  her narrative; Prince is a strong woman, one who can advocate through her story, and
                  so provide a heroic model of fortitude in the face of extreme suffering.</p>

               carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. . . . But alas! we were soon
               deprived of even the small comfort of weeping together. . . . [F]or my sister and

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Rhetorically, the “But, alas!” repetition has a lot of work to do, but for a modern
                  reader, it can’t carry the weight of the experienced trauma in the way that Prince’s
                  “Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,—it is too much.—” still does. If Equiano’s
                  response to the loss of his sister is different from Prince’s and perhaps strikes
                  the reader as pathos-filled rather than grief-stricken—so that students try to locate
                  the difference in experienced pain contextually—I’ve found it helpful to shift their
                  attention to seeing that the way the story is told can change the emotional register,
                  and that the way emotion is being put to use should not influence us to value or devalue
                  one person’s pain over another’s, given our historical biases. Critical context thus
                  informs students’ understanding of the disruptive force of the Atlantic trade during
                  this period and the valuation of bodies in a marketplace that took no account of pain.

                           that a pieza “was a man of twenty-five years, approximately, in good health, calculated
                           to give a certain amount of physical labor. He served as the general equivalent of
                           physical labor value against which all the others could be measure—with for example,
                           three teenagers equaling one pieza and older men and women thrown in a job lot as
                           refuse” (Wynter 81, as cited by Mignolo, 114).</span></div>
                  </div> Equiano openly states that his own father owned enslaved people, a repugnant fact
                  for many students; he also explains the practice of African enslavers in terms of
                  kidnapping and domestic servitude and in opposition to the brutality of the triangle
                  slave trade. This sometimes leads students to dismiss Equiano’s narrative. But by
                  getting students to look for resemblance rather than difference, they can then see
                  that like Prince, Equiano also tries to find a sense of home when he is with kinder
                  people, and yet whereas she finds her real sense of “home” in her own strong sense
                  of self, he continually remakes himself, transforming himself fluidly through the
                  circulations of ship voyages he participates in. He makes himself into an Atlantic
                  identity, so that he’s at home everywhere—on shipboard, in Philadelphia, in London,
                  and so on—whereas we sense that Prince is never at home except within herself. And
                  his rhetorical style is not just due to the temporal distance between the act of writing
                  and biographical events; Equiano is becalmed as he writes his narrative, stilled by
                  the land he now inhabits and the perhaps unyielding political audience he addresses.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In his <span style="font-style:italic">The Black Jacobins</span> (1938), which tells the history of St. Domingue and Toussaint L’Ouverture’s extraordinary
               transformation of the colony into a free state by 1803, C. L. R. James refuses the
               fiction of historical objectivity; students immediately respond to his passionate
               engagement with his story and his protagonist, and the book is filled with his exclamatory
               asides. Toussaint suffers none of the rending of family that Prince and Equiano experience,
               and so James’s indignation is focused on the abuses endemic to slavery and those historians
               who had covered it over. “A venal race of scholars, profiteering panders to national
               vanity, have conspired to obscure the truth about abolition,” he rails (51). By contrast,
               Toussaint “was so genuinely kind to the whites in their distressful condition that
               they could not fail to appreciate it” (157). James cannot but revel in the man’s political
               acuity and gracious use of political speech acts and his tolerance as a political
               leader for everyone in St. Domingue; his voice and message are clear in quotations
               from letters and speeches: “Learn, citizens, to appreciate the glory of your new political
               status. In acquiring the rights that the Constitution accords to all Frenchmen, do
               not forget the duties it imposes on you. Be but virtuous and you will be French men
               and good citizens. . . . Work together for the prosperity of San Domingo . . . [to]
               assure public well-being” (205). I point out to students how this passage, and Toussaint’s
               worry over “the fate of some unhappy whites who have been victims in this business”
               (157), is in stark contrast to James’s own assessment of white treatment of Blacks:
               “The difficulty was that though one could trap them like animals, . . . and beat both
               [man and animal] with the same stick, . . . they remained, despite their black skins
               and curly hair, quite invincibly human beings” (11).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To situate James’s passionate history, I ask students to read Sylvia Wynter’s article
                  on James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,” which clarifies her own
                  theoretical adaptation of James’s Afro-Caribbean-based theory of capitalism as a colonial-based
                  rather than a trade-based economy, one requiring enslaved labor rather than wage labor.
                  The bourgeois development of capitalism that overthrew a monarchy-based economy depended
                  on the development of a colonial scheme built on unpaid labor from colonists, indentured
                  servants, and enslaved persons. The monarchial symbolics of blood (blood lineage,
                  vassalage, war), as Wynter explains, was replaced by a symbolics of skin color, the
                  effects of which still reverberate today. Wynter posits the human condition of “becoming
                  [B]lack” to explain the way that discourse co-produces social experience along with
                  colonial capitalism for anyone who, we could say, has not undergone “becoming white.”

            <p>For students, then, firsthand accounts put the entire phenomenon of the slave trade
               into perspective, and for some students of color, especially those who are African,
               African American, or Caribbean American, firsthand accounts can be empowering, while
               secondhand accounts like James’s can reinforce that self-empowerment. These firsthand
               narratives give students a sense of what self-determining voices like Prince’s, Equiano’s,
               and Toussaint’s sounded like. The inner strength and the courage to simply live a
               life, or to trade up one’s own life-value, or to liberate a people, comes through
               in these narratives. Romantic literature gains a special meaning for these students,
               one that speaks to them in today’s contexts; it can also give them a history of strength,
               endurance, and courage. Texts from the more recent past, such as James’s, and from
               today’s headlines or popular genres add resonance to making personal connections with
               such a history. Identifying with texts from a different time and culture has resulted
               in multiple end-of-the-semester research papers on Equiano and women’s slave testimonials,
               as well as a comparative treatment of women’s escape narratives in the period. Recently
               a student has also used information from short lectures I gave on the slavery and
               human trafficking practices at this time on the Barbary Coast and in the Ottoman Empire
               to develop a paper on Equiano that sets him in a wider context of slaver practices
               historically and within the period.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In using an Atlanticist lens to teach this material, I try to return our focus to
                  the networks of colonialism wherever this approach makes sense, because more was at
                  stake in the triangle slave trade than the economy of bodies. The forward trajectory
                  of the larger stakes surely begins with the population decimation of northwestern
                  Africa and the overpopulation of the West Indies, but they include the monoculture
                  practices of Caribbean plantations (and continuing today with Caribbean banana plantations,
                  for instance), which—concurrently with the rise in Western national gross products—also
                  changed the natural resource structure of Caribbean terrain. Through increased commerce
                  in peoples, animals, plants, and goods, the slave trade also grossly heightened the
                  effects and pace of anthropocenic change, giving students a sense of how disastrous
                  history can affect worlds as well as peoples.

                  </div> That the ship should also be understood literally through viewing the virtual slave
                  ship on the SlaveVoyages.org website gives the metaphor powerful resonance in its
                  suggestion of mobility and flexible use. To image fluidity, movement (a term encompassing
                  more than human mobility and displacement), and circulation of the Atlantic world,
                  the metaphor of the Atlantic-ranging ship is perhaps unsurpassed. Whereas both fluidity
                  and circulation take into account the stagnation of being becalmed, Equiano’s autobiography
                  underscores how thriving among aquatic conditions requires understanding oneself,
                  or at least one’s life, in terms of the vessel that sails such waters. Living in and
                  on the Atlantic waterways requires at the very least having an abiding interest in
                  shipping news and port landings; in order to flourish, however, of more value would
                  be possessing a working knowledge of the vessel and, indeed, the classificatory terminology
                  used for distinguishing vessels and their component parts. These, as Equiano’s life
                  story reflects, were key not just to ship life but also to life itself: ship life <span style="font-style:italic">was</span>, in a sense, Atlantic life. And learning to navigate—as Equiano does—requires a more
                  flexible thinking, one based on a triangulating impulse that can reconcile oppositions
                  through adjacencies and affiliations.</p>

            <p>Triangulation—not just the juxtaposition of three terms but the fluid and dynamic
               movement between them—is key, I argue, to teaching Romanticism in terms of Atlantic
               movement, whether we are working with the binaries of the Anglo-American transatlantic
               or with the multiple triangulations of the Caribbean islands and Atlantic littoral
               that are always in play or potentially so. Putting the Atlantic ship metaphor and
               triangulation together, we might consider what the triangle slave trade has culturally
               produced as our heritage, the disturbed flow of water and lives that Christina Sharpe
               argues in <span style="font-style:italic">In the Wake: On Blackness and Being</span> (2016) is demonstrably ongoing. The “wake” figures a disruptive dimension in the
               lives of African Americans that began with a cut across what had been, the ship cutting
               across the ocean’s own waves as it cuts into lives, cuts off lives, and changes human
               relations in monstrous ways. In this sense, the United States is in relation not only
               to Britain and the West African coast but also in relation to the ocean and its human
               footprint on land, an ongoing relation of turmoil. Understanding the West’s impact
               on the West Indies during this period gives students a way to place Romanticism within
               their twenty-first-century perspective, not only as a chapter in the difficult history
               of enslavement but also as part of an aspirational identity, of a heroism born of
               struggle that is evidenced in the narratives of formerly enslaved persons, where singular
               voices, accounts of uprisings and attempted uprisings, and the hopes and aspirations
               that fueled abolition and emancipation can be found.</p>
            <p>To think Atlantically allows me to pose one regulative idea—that of the world as a
               centered experience that affirms the uniqueness of the white enfranchised self that
               is supported by peripheral others, in contrast to the disenfranchised (the world,
               in other words, of the colonial economic system)—against another regulative idea of
               the Atlantic as a fluid world of multiple and mobile players. It allows me to keep
               my students focused on the dynamic, fluid relation between center and periphery, larger
               and local contexts, and what is counted (money, bodies, trade items) and what does
               not count (lives). These are also the problems of sovereignty, and what in years past
               Romantic studies mainly focused on; they have only been transformed, but not displaced,
               in the slave trade economy and are the problems that Equiano marshals so well for
               his tale of self-recovery, innovation, and reinvention.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The triangulation of texts, contextualized through websites on the histories of abolition
                  and the slave trade, as well as a web-video of life on a virtual slave ship, a reconstruction
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">L’Aurore</span> (see also Rediker), allows students to connect to the voices that so clearly and emphatically
                  tell their story or the stories of others. Most recently, the three chosen texts were
                  those of Prince, Equiano, and James, which when triangulated situate the African,
                  West Indian, and St. Domingue experience in a deeply involved perspective that includes
                  the newly independent United States.

                  and the liberation of a people) participate in the very conditions that fueled the
                  French Revolution, financed by France’s slave-trade-enriched bourgeoisie, and the
                  English abolition movement, which, as James argues, was encouraged by William Pitt
                  as prime minister to deflect other political tensions (53–4). But triangulation requires
                  positioning and revisiting: following Prince’s story with Equiano’s is achronological,
                  but his rhetorically sophisticated style, because it distances and softens raw experience,
                  allows for a more appreciative revisiting of Prince’s rhetorical moves. The clear
                  parallels between Prince’s story of British colonial enslavement and Toussaint’s political
                  speechmaking as he liberates both his fellow slaves and his island from colonial legal,
                  economic, and political control enable students to bring together the three texts

               <p>To balance the firsthand narrative unit on Prince, Equiano, and the Haitian Revolution,
                  I designed a second unit focusing on women’s experience in fictional texts. Beginning
                  with the anonymously authored <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</span> (1808), the students then read Jane Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> (1814), a novel that creates comparisons between women whose wealth makes them decadent
                  and women who regard morality as more valuable. In each case the heroine’s transplantation
                  into a different family depends on a reliance on the wealth generated by exploiting
                  legal and capitalist networks that masked over the horrors of enslavement. Olivia
                  Fairfield is the daughter of a Jamaican plantation owner and the majestic Marcia,
                  a gifted but enslaved African woman. The conditions of Mr. Fairfield’s will are that
                  Olivia is to be married into, or become the dependent of, her relations, the English
                  Merton family. Fanny Price is adopted into her uncle Bertram’s family as a charity
                  case, and in this sense Olivia and Fanny have opposed relations to plantation wealth
                  but are in a chiasmic relation to each other that students can appreciate: the biracial
                  heroine brings wealth with her, the white heroine brings only her poverty. Sir Thomas
                  makes his wealth from his own Antiguan plantations though his family members, like
                  Olivia’s relations in the Merton family, are residents in England. In both novels
                  the women of these families display the decadent lifestyles and egocentrism created
                  by West Indian caste divisions, and so stand in for what Olivia calls “the most die-away
                  lady on the whole island of Jamaica” (73).

                  birth and biracial identity and Fanny through her parents’ downward social mobility.
                  Both are treated by their adoptive families as different in appearance (Olivia is
                  beautiful and biracial, while Fanny is small and plain) and in kind (Olivia has a
                  Black mother, and Fanny has a disreputable father). And both make observations that
                  explicitly (Olivia) or implicitly (Fanny) compare the women of their adoptive families
                  to the “decadent” behavior of West Indian women.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, in both novels the authorial insistence on a moral tale to be made of plot
               and characters enables the Caribbean plantation system itself to be glossed over.
               In <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> this gloss is effected through Olivia’s fond remembrances of life on her father’s
               plantation, her frequent remarks concerning her firm connection to her enslaved brethren,
               and her affectionate descriptions of her maid Dido, whose race and pidgin English
               make clear her formerly enslaved status. In <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, the masking is provided by Fanny’s translation of her uncle’s business concerns
               into a paternal treatment of his enslaved workers stemming from his moral rectitude.
               When these two novels are triangulated with Leonora Sansay’s short novel <span style="font-style:italic">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo</span>, which like <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> was also published in 1808, the plantation system’s inequities are unmasked. The
               white American narrator, Mary, visiting with her sister Clara in 1803, makes frequent
               criticisms of the behavior and regulation of different castes of women, from “coloured
               women” in general contrast to “white women,” to distinctions between “Mulatto” women
               (light-skinned biracial women), Creoles (white women born in St. Domingue, soon to
               be Haiti), French women (immigrants and visitors from France), and outsiders like
               Mary. Not only do sartorial distinctions demarcate castes among women in St. Domingue,

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Sansay presents it, the very Caribbean air taints moral choice since sexual attraction
                  alone determines women’s (limited) agency, so that “the mulatto women are the hated
                  but successful rivals of the Creole ladies,” for they not only appear to be sexier
                  but are also often wealthy: “before the revolution their splendor, their elegance,
                  their influence over the men, and the fortunes lavished on them by their infatuated
                  lovers, so powerfully excited the jealousy of the white ladies, that they complained
                  to the council of the ruin their [“mulatto” women’s] extravagance occasioned to many
                  [white] families, and a decree was issued imposing restrictions on their dress” (95).

                           of African birth, freed by Toussaint’s revolution) or most of the other caste divisions
                           that regulated life in St. Domingue.</span></div>
                  </div> Contrasted with the decadence of sexually explicit behavior is the novel’s real focus
                  on political revolution; Toussaint’s post-revolutionary reign is looked forward to
                  as utopian in comparison to the invading French forces there to support the white
                  plantation owners. The armed forces’ destructive violence is mirrored in acts of male
                  sexual aggression, exemplified in the rape of Mary’s sister Clara by her abusive husband,
                  St. Louis. Sex and politics come together in <span style="font-style:italic">Secret History</span> in a manner that turns the lens on <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>: suddenly students can realize how the sexual politics of those novels divide out
                  into sexual aggression, the politics of race, and the loss of any moral compass when
                  wealth depends on the unacknowledged suffering of enslaved laborers.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To provide a component to this fictional unit that ties it back to the real-life narratives
               of Prince, Equiano, and Toussaint, I include here the first chapter of Sharpe’s <span style="font-style:italic">In the Wake</span>. Sharpe’s meditations on, and theorization of, the historical effects of colonial
               schemes of skin color symbolism that Wynter analyzes yoke the development of colonial
               economies based on unpaid and enslaved labor. Sharpe’s reflections on her own and
               her family’s experience of the colonial symbolics of skin color (registered in Sansay’s
               delineation of the higher levels of St. Domingue’s caste system) illustrate so clearly
               how the colonial economy continues to mark the daily life of African Americans now.
               In the wake of the triangle slave trade, “the past that is not past reappears, always,
               to rupture the present” (9). Sharpe’s narrative, with its rhetorical insistence on
               the past’s ongoing harm, does more to make the connections between fiction and real-life
               narratives than news reports alone can do. As she notes, “Transatlantic slavery was
               and is the disaster” (5). Adding Sharpe’s critical reflections intermixed with personal
               narrative has the advantage of pulling the narrative and fictional units together
               because it enables further conversation about the economic and emotional risks of
               living in, and in the wake of, the triangle slave trade. This relates to Wynter’s
               analysis, which allows a conversation about colonial economies as a discourse concerning
               one’s relative worth.</p>
            <p>The question of personal versus fictionalized experience becomes a way to avoid simply
               comparing different encounters of slave and colonial life, racial prejudice, and degrees
               of gender violence. Instead, this comparison allows readers to triangulate and thus
               revisit/revise these three elements of the slave trade that the two units raise, allowing
               additional questions, such as one of inclusion/exclusion: Who is an insider, we could
               ask, and who is excluded in the system of colonial economy? Prince, Equiano, and Olivia
               present different kinds of outsider status, for instance. Moreover, female characters’
               treatment at the hands of (usually white) men provides a quite different way to think
               about movement as well as about the stormy violence of the colonial economy and requires
               thinking harder about the movement through the color caste system in both British
               and French colonial and postcolonial life.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Regardless of the texts selected to teach students how to see the experience of enslaved
                  persons as belonging to lives that mattered, what has made the most difference in
                  teaching this topic has been to find ways to make historical texts relevant. In order
                  to move beyond that framework, I have begun working with current events and Afrofuturism.
                  A useful supplemental text for exploring Afrofuturism is an essay by the award-winning
                  novelist N. K. Jemisin, “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” which provides a quick
                  introduction to the main ideas of Afrofuturism.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This is also the title of a collection of short stories by Jemisin, who is best known
                           for her Broken Earth trilogy (2015–2017), which won three Hugo awards. See also O’Connell.</span></div>
                  </div> Writers like Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler made science fiction the most significant
                  genre for Afrofuturist literature and film; these are texts that recast enslavers
                  and colonists through the sci-fi tradition of encounter narratives.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                           (16)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine (1895), The War of the Worlds (1898), and The First
                           Men in the Moon (1901) established the tradition. Andre Norton’s Witch World series
                           (1963–1968) and Arthur C. Clarke’s Space Odyssey series (1968–1997) are well-known
                           first-encounter narratives.</span></div>
                  </div> An easily referenced text for teaching is the 2018 film <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span>, in which the imbrication of past, present, and future is clearly dramatized. In
                  the film, the villain, Klaue, is depicted as an archetypal white adventurer despoiling
                  African resources, but rather than being characterized as European he is clearly meant
                  to suggest a heritage from the two Boer states of colonial Africa, with their brutal
                  treatment of those inhabiting what is now South Africa. The Black Panther, T’Challa,
                  defeats this despoiler and thus revises the historical first encounter with white
                  enslavers; instead, we have a failed encounter that strengthens the progressive futurism
                  of the Wakanda nation. This is not the best example, however, since Klaue should have
                  been colonized by the Wakandan citizens, so asking students why Klaue’s death at the
                  hands of T’Challa is a departure from Afrofuturism helps them see how easy it is to
                  accept more pasteurized versions of Black narratives.</p>
            </div>
            <p>“First encounter” narratives, made standard through works such as H. G. Wells’s <span style="font-style:italic">The War of the Worlds</span> (1898), merge with “second encounter” narratives so that the slave trade and colonial
               past is the pattern through which alien encounter is perceived, with the alien becoming
               the colonized victim of such thinking, and yet like the historical enslaved person,
               a victim who bears gifts. To historical enslaved people’s cultural and ideological
               gifts, these imagined aliens add technological and politically liberating gifts. Contrasting
               this model with the plot of <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> allowed my students to view Equiano’s representation of slavery, kind masters, and
               British political elites as pasteurized rather than simply self-serving (as students
               often read his narrative). Most importantly, connecting the texts they are studying
               with the regulative idea of Afrofuturism—that sovereign nations need the induction
               of alien life in order to become even more democratic, free, and at peace—allows students
               to consider the problem of both individual sovereignty and national sovereignty as
               the product of fluidity and movement. It is not a given, it can be taken away, and
               it must always be put into conversation with the interrelatedness of ocean and land.</p>
            <p>When we revisited Equiano’s narrative after the <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> exercise, I focused class discussion on the plan for a free Black state in Sierra
               Leone that Equiano participates in near the very end of his narrative; my students
               were able to rethink the potential of such an undertaking while also understanding
               it as a charity project rather than a utopian one (it is planned by “some philanthropic
               individuals” [242]). Pitting this scheme, devised by white politicians, against the
               utopian nation of Wakanda also helps us see why Equiano would have been so wary of
               the project: it lacks Wakanda’s self-determination arising from individual participation
               <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the necessary funding and resources (individual sovereignty <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> national sovereignty). Through the contextualizing lens of Afrofuturism, my students
               came to the recognition that any settlement, however utopian, displaces those who
               already inhabit the land, disturbing the eco-balance of lives lived for both the established
               inhabitants and for the newcomers. In other words, the past can’t be undone by charity
               and welfare schemes; the hard work has to be done here in this place, as both the
               abolitionist materials and the lesson of Wakanda’s self-determination make clear.
               A useful discussion point is already provided here in thinking about our own future
               regarding territorialization practices versus Atlantic fluidity, the circulation and
               triangulations of persons and things versus the requirement for self-determination
               and lives well lived.</p>
            <p>Just as the trade in enslaved persons fueled white liberationist politics in both
               Britain’s American colonies and revolutionary France, so too has it grounded and set
               the stage for the more expansive empire through an increasingly laissez-faire liberally
               sanctioned world economy. Students begin to see the relation between things as they
               are and the horrifying, daily violence of the exchange in enslaved persons as mercantile
               objects. The necessity of teaching about the slave trade and the experience of enslavement
               alongside the heroized narratives of abolitionist political labor can be empowering
               in that it allows for the possibility of thinking about the future otherwise than
               in a traumatic and posthuman way. Certainly we must ask: What will prevail in the
               Atlantic world when environmental damage takes too great a toll on human habitations
               of the Caribbean? Or when the coastal cities and other human developments in the circum-Atlantic
               are submerged or simply destroyed? But a sense of play through more fluid boundaries
               allows space for students to imagine a different world-making from the one we have
               known and that currently goes on without our much noticing. It allows for thinking
               about different kinds of heroism, different ways of achieving self-determination against
               the apparently unstoppable weight of globalism. It allows for considering the ship
               in a stormy sea: fluidity and flexibility are the necessary survival skills, but they
               must be combined with a persistence to endure, a Mary-Prince-like self-heroism and
               a Toussaint-like vision. It seems to me that Atlanticism is poised to locate such
               an imagination if we allow its triangulatory effects room to do this kind of work.</p>

               Atlantic and coastal regions of the Americas, as well as their travels to Britain,
               Europe, and Africa), and the Hispanic and Lusophone Atlantic world whose historical
               importance loomed large in the period, as well as the Francophone Atlantic, all of
               which extend our teaching about British Empire through these other circulations and

               to give a certain amount of physical labor. He served as the general equivalent of
               physical labor value against which all the others could be measure—with for example,
               three teenagers equaling one pieza and older men and women thrown in a job lot as
