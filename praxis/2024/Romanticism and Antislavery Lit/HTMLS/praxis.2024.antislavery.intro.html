            <p>Urgent questions remain regarding what it means to teach anti-slavery and abolitionist
               texts in the current moment, despite the field of Romanticism’s reassessment of its
               complicity in and resistance to Atlantic slavery and its global repercussions. The
               introduction offers some context for the 2018 roundtable on teaching Romantic abolitionist
               and anti-slavery literatures amidst the Black Lives Matter movement that gave rise
               to this essay collection. In Romanticism and Anti-Slavery Literatures: Pedagogies
               and Contexts, Patricia Mathew, Ivan Ortiz, Elizabeth Fay, Sean Gordon, Frances Botkin,
               and Nicholas Blaisdell explore various approaches to teaching abolitionist and anti-slavery
               literature of the long nineteenth century, and directly describe their experiences
               in the classroom with a series of case studies. Many of them argue that it is not
               enough to teach abolitionist texts from the period without also engaging contemporary
               perspectives on the legacies of slavery. Others articulate linkages that connect their
               teaching praxis with histories of resistance and liberation, even as they also seek
               to problematize this linkage. Drawing of the work of scholars such as Simon Gikandi,
               Edward Said, and Fernando Ortíz, the editors offer a meditation on 'contrapuntal reading'
               as theoretical framework that further elucidates what the contributors collectively
               achieve. The responses by Alan Richardson and Debbie Lee consider this intervention
               within the larger pedagogical conversation of the last thirty years and the directions
               of inquiry it suggests for scholars and teachers. </p>

            </div>
            <p>To the degree that the essays gathered here posit contrapuntal strategies in the teaching
               and reading of the archive of Romanticism and its multiple relations to slavery and
               to abolitionist and antislavery literatures, they are expanding the turn to contrapuntal
               reading, a method that Fernando Ortiz, in <span style="font-style:italic">Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el azúcar</span> (1940), and Edward Said, in <span style="font-style:italic">Culture and Imperialism</span> (1993), advanced independently of each other. In turn, this approach has influenced
               the work of writers like the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier as well as critics such
               as Mary Louise Pratt and Simon Gikandi. In <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery and the Culture of Taste</span> (2011), Gikandi uses contrapuntal reading to advance epistemologies and pedagogies
               that pluralize received hierarchies of knowledge and decenter the hegemony of an archive
               and its exclusionary categories—an approach to which our contributors are also committed.</p>
            <p>In the Anglo-American academy, scholars and students may be familiar with how Said
               theorizes the importance of reading “not univocally but <span style="font-style:italic">contrapuntally</span>, with a simultaneous awareness both of the metropolitan history that is narrated
               and of those other histories against which (and together with which) the dominating
               discourse acts” (<span style="font-style:italic">Culture and Imperialism</span>51). Drawing on music to describe a way of reading novels such as Jane Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> (1814), he writes: <span class="quote">‘In the counterpoint of Western classical music, various themes play off one another,
                  with only a provisional privilege being given to any particular one; yet in the resulting
                  polyphony there is concert and order, an organized interplay that derives from the
                  themes, not from a rigorous melodic or formal principle outside the work. In the same
                  way, I believe, we can read and interpret English novels, for example, whose engagement
                  (usually suppressed for the most part) with the West Indies or India, say, is shaped
                  and perhaps even determined by the specific history of colonization, resistance, and
                  finally native nationalism. (51)’</span> While Said’s archive was “English novels,” Ortiz applied <span style="font-style:italic">contrapunteo</span> in his anthropological analysis of sugar and tobacco (written roughly fifty years
               prior to Said’s work) and coined the word <span style="font-style:italic">transculturación</span> (transculturation) by now familiar to critics through the work of Pratt. It should
               be noted that Ortiz and his generation, which included Lydia Cabrera, the renowned
               scholar of <span style="font-style:italic">santería</span>, and Carpentier, who turned to the Haitian Revolution for inspiration, embarked on
               a reassessment of the contributions of Afro-Cuban and African cultures to Cuban identity.
               Counterpoint becomes both metaphor and method for Ortiz, who emphasizes the musical
               roots of the contrapuntal while he underscores the Afro-Cuban experience, one that
               incorporates both music <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the orality of verse in call-and-response rituals between griot and audience. He
               writes, “Recordemos en Cuba sus manifestaciones más floridas en las preces antifonarias
               de las liturgias, así de blancos como de negros, en la controversia erótica y danzarina
               de la rumba, y en los contrapunteos versificados de la guajirada montuna y de la currería
               afrocubana” (Let us remember the elaborate manifestations [of counterpoint] in Cuba,
               in the antiphonal liturgies of Blacks and whites, in the controversial erotics of
               the movement of the rumba, and in the versified counterpoints of country and Afro-Cuban
               peoples) (18).</p>
            <p>In his novel about the Haitian Revolution, <span style="font-style:italic">El siglo de las luces</span> (1962), Carpentier develops the aesthetics of the “arbitrario contrapunto de vidas”
               (the arbitrary counterpoint of lives) by considering the different, yet simultaneous,
               unfolding destinies of his protagonists, which shape and impact individual spheres
               of action as well as the grand récit of history (47). Carpentier later extends this
               idea in “Lo barroco y lo real maravilloso,” his essay about the marvelous real, where
               he again returns to the Haitian Revolution, Henri Christophe’s opposition to Napoleon
               Bonaparte, and François Mackandal, “que hace creer a millares y millares de esclavos
               en Haití . . . que puede transformarse en lo que quiera, y promueve con ellos una
               de las primeras revoluciones auténticas del Nuevo Mundo” (who convinces thousands
               and thousands of slaves in Haiti . . . that he can turn into anything, and promotes
               with them one of the first authentic revolutions of the New World) (84).</p>
            <p>Gikandi further develops the contrapuntal method when he applies it to reading the
               archive of Atlantic slavery and antislavery in <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery and the Culture of Taste</span> (2011) (xiii). He synchronizes the spatial, temporal, and interior dimensions of
               the lives of subjects as apparently disconnected as diarist Anna Larpent and Nealee,
               the enslaved woman in Mungo Park’s narrative. In other chapters, he considers texts
               by Francis Williams, David Hume, and Olaudah Equiano, and by Phillis Wheatley Peters,
               William Beckford, and Thomas Jefferson (among others) in contrapuntal relationship
               to each other. Gikandi accounts for how “the criteria driving the aesthetic ideology
               in the eighteenth century—disinterest and virtue, among others—had come to be haunted
               by slavery” (144). The effect of this more deliberate counterpoint, he observes, is
               to ensure “a dialectic between the visible subjects of modernity and its invisible
               actors” (70). Exegesis as an act of resistance exposes the symbolic systems that mediate
               materiality, disturbing the cognitive and symbolic separations between the violent
               system of the plantation, secured through empire, and the well-wrought tea set of
               the drawing room. Thus, it holds actors accountable for their complicity with such
               violence.</p>

               <p>The oral call-and-response underlying contrapuntal reading moreover gestures to this
                  collection’s origins in a roundtable conversation on “Anti-Slavery Literature, Its
                  Legacies, and the Future of Teaching,” organized in 2018 by members of the Five College
                  Faculty Seminar on Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century seminar was founded in 2012 by
                           Joselyn M. Almeida (then UMass Amherst), Gülru Çakmak (University of Massachusetts
                           Amherst) and Kate Singer (Mount Holyoke College). Daniel Block (then Hampshire College),
                           later became a co-organizer. By 2018 it was being led by Almeida, Singer, Lily Gurton-Wachter
                           (Smith College), and Amelia Worsley (Amherst College). The seminar was conceived as
                           a venue in which faculty from five colleges in the Amherst area of western Massachusetts
                           could collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of scholars attentive to the …</span></div>
                  </div> At that moment in time, many of us had been negotiating classroom conversations to
                  which students brought issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement. In dialogue
                  with Kate Singer and Lily Gurton-Wachter, co-organizers of the seminar, we resolved
                  to bring together four scholars of race and literature—Frances Botkin, Kimberly Juanita
                  Brown, Sean Gordon, and Patricia A. Matthew—to create a safe and respectful space
                  in which faculty and graduate student instructors could engage in dialogue with each
                  other about how they were currently teaching antislavery texts from the Romantic period
                  and how we might imagine teaching them in the future. Two of our speakers were local,
                  and two traveled from different East Coast locations to be with us. The roundtable
                  was transatlantic in disciplinary scope, with scholars representing Caribbean, American,
                  and British literatures. In our invitation, we simply asked our colleagues to speak
                  about approaches to teaching eighteenth- or nineteenth-century antislavery literature
                  in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. We asked them to share some moments
                  from their own recent experiences in the classroom as well as their subsequent reflections
                  on them. We stressed that the emphasis would be on conversation with the audience,
                  whom we imagined would also find it useful to have a space to share their thoughts
                  on classroom experience.</p>
            </div>
            <p>An unusually large audience was in attendance at the pedagogy panel in the spring
               of 2018; it was clear that this subject was of interest to students at both the graduate
               and undergraduate level, as well as to faculty members who more usually made up the
               audience of the Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century seminar. Several different
               pedagogical approaches were offered, but the panelists all shared a desire to confront
               the violence contained in these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts and the silences
               of the past and to share epistemologies of social justice, speaking to the present
               with the future in mind. Though the speakers approached the task of teaching different
               antislavery texts with different methodologies, each of them gave us an insight into
               classrooms where students are frequently invited to think about how to connect the
               past with the present moment. As our panelists discussed a range of approaches to
               teaching antislavery texts, the question of affect was clearly a central concern,
               as it had been in the discussion that led to the event. Students often have questions
               about the violence that these texts present them with, and, in turn, professors and
               instructors participating in the event had many questions for each other about how
               to frame that act of presentation. How should one prepare students for the affective
               responses—the emotions and feelings—that such triggering material is bound to bring
               into the room? How might we make space for conversation in the classroom about the
               various ways students might encounter antislavery literatures because of the varied
               experiences they bring to these texts? How do we support students through challenging
               readings beyond giving content warnings or making the readings optional?</p>
            <p>Several important questions about what it means to teach antislavery literature in
               the context of courses on Romanticism also emerged that day. As Saidiya Hartman asks
               in her 2008 essay “Venus in Two Acts,” where the archive is lacking, how can we retrieve
               “what remains dormant . . . without committing further acts of violence” in our own
               acts of narration (2)? Kimberly Juanita Brown played music over her own speech as
               she discussed the power of African American spirituals to invite students to connect
               to the “auditory dimensions” of the archive, a concept she also explores in her book
               <span style="font-style:italic">The Repeating Body: Slavery’s Visual Resonance in the Contemporary </span>(2015) (140). Indeed, many of our panelists asked us to attune their ears to detect
               multilayered channels of communication in antislavery texts. A central theme in our
               discussion was the question of how to bring to light the things that the texts do
               not say about the realities of slavery in the period, either because of the blind
               spots of the authors or because of the constraints placed upon them.</p>
            <p>The essays that follow record various answers to these collective questions, and although
               they arose out of in-person conversations we had in a particular time and place, we
               hope they will continue to have relevance to a wider audience in the present moment.
               Three of the original speakers at the panel (Frances Botkin, Sean Gordon, and Patricia
               A. Matthew) have contributed essays. Although Kimberly Juanita Brown was not able
               to engage in this iteration of the conversation, the impact of her contributions to
               the panel nonetheless remains. We have also purposely included essays by participants
               who were at different stages in their university careers at the time of the event:
               Sean Gordon was a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst at the
               time of his original contribution to the panel, and he is now a professor at Fresno
               State University. Nick Blaisdell, now Ed.D., was an undergraduate when he attended
               our seminar. By inviting other participants to join the conversation about pedagogy
               via the medium of print, we gesture toward the shared frame of reference that the
               Global Cultures seminar had produced when we met in person. Ivan Ortiz and Elizabeth
               Fay, who had also spoken in our series, graciously accepted our invitation. We are
               also grateful to Debbie Lee and Alan Richardson for agreeing to offer responses to
               the essays. Two decades after they worked together on <span style="font-style:italic">Early Black British Writing </span>(2004), Lee and Richardson offer a retrospective view not only of the shared insights

            <p>It has been intriguing for us to see that our contributors arrived at a shared methodology
               regarding how to approach teaching antislavery literatures today organically without
               a prompt from us and without reading drafts of one another’s essays. Each of them
               reframes and resituates eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts in new constellations,
               not only in relation to each other and to art and aesthetics from the period, but
               also in relation to texts from Black studies and to twentieth- and twenty-first-century
               works of fiction and criticism that seek to address the silences of the past. By asking
               students to listen to what remains unsaid in the texts they examine, several authors
               implicitly convey their commitments to contrapuntal reading.</p>
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew draws attention to how her students themselves implicitly enacted
               a contrapuntal method when they responded to the suppressed context of William Blake’s
               poem “The Little Black Boy.” Her essay presents a retrospective account of how this
               moment offered an invitation to continue to explore, in several different settings
               (both undergraduate and graduate), the effects of centering the topic of race and
               slavery in the classroom. Matthew invites makers of syllabi to look beyond the question
               of which single texts to use in a self-contained “unit” of a syllabus on slavery and
               instead to imagine how Romanticism looks when one centers race, abolition, and freedom
               on the level of the syllabus as a whole. She criticizes the idea that one can just
               add a single text about slavery to a syllabus and expect that the topic has been covered,
               as if a Romantic literature syllabus is a familiar recipe to which one can simply
               add a new ingredient. Rather than focusing a discussion about Atlantic slavery on
               a single text in a syllabus, Matthew argues, it should be considered a relevant context
               in discussions of all Romantic texts, even in texts where it seems not to be present.
               Matthew describes two different courses that center antislavery literatures and texts
               about race, including detailed discussions of teaching Blake’s poem, Hannah More and
               Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows of Yamba,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament;
               or, How to Make Sugar,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,”
               and the anonymous novel <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</span> (1808).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Ivan Ortiz’s method can also be called contrapuntal from several perspectives. Ortiz
                  puts Said’s argument about the silences in Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> in dialogue with Lynn Festa’s argument that Austen is also asking readers to listen
                  for “noise.” Ortiz begins by explaining how he uses this principle of “listening for
                  noise” as a method to teach abolition poetry written by white authors. He positions
                  this poetry in counterpoint with music when he asks students to examine the complexity
                  of a situation in which both More’s version of “The Sorrows of Yamba” and William
                  Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” were sung to the well-known ballad “Admiral Hosier’s
                  Ghost,” a tune about white English sailors who had died at sea. He then turns to a
                  text that could itself be called contrapuntal, M. NourbeSe Philip’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zong!</span> (2008), which is “composed entirely from the words of the case report <span style="font-style:italic">Gregson vs. Gilbert,</span> related to the murder of Africans on board a slave ship at the end of the eighteenth
                  century.

                  </div> As students center their attention on the silences that this text exposes, Ortiz writes,
                  they are confronted with the question of “what the fragmentation of language accomplishes
                  that a ballad narrative cannot.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Sean Gordon extends the contrapuntal method beyond the frame of synchronicity to ask
               how twentieth-century narratives might also inform students’ understandings of nineteenth-century
               testimonies. He describes the project of “teaching contemporary texts that take up
               Romantic-era concepts in a ‘speculative’ framework,” like Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees”
               (2004), Octavia Butler’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </span>(1995), and Samuel Delany’s <span style="font-style:italic">Empire Star </span>(1966), in relation to <span style="font-style:italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano </span>(1789). To frame his discussion of what it meant to discuss these texts on a campus
               responding to a series of violently racist incidents in 2014, Gordon centers Fred
               Moten’s term “dehiscence,” which describes a form of structural vulnerability that
               allows for productive disordering, as well as the Afropessimism of Frank Wilderson,
               pointing toward another speculative future, one in which a conversation between scholars
               of Black studies and scholars of Romanticism will become more common. He also discusses
               how teaching Mat Johnson’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Pym </span>(2011) in dialogue with Edgar Allan Poe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</span> (1838) allowed students to think through the issue of how structures of white privilege
               are implicit not only in the archive but also in the university itself.</p>
            <p>Afrofuturism provides a site of conceptual resistance in several of the essays here.
               As Terence Dean and Dale P. Andrews explain, “Afrofuturism is an evolving field of
               study in Black cultural studies. Its theories and scholarship are heavily influenced
               with particularities in science fiction, speculative fiction, new media, digital technology,
               the arts, and Black aesthetics all situated and focused on the continent of Africa,
               the Diaspora, and its imaginaries” (2). Through her syllabus and classroom discussion,
               Elizabeth Fay stages an innovative conversation between Afrofuturism, Romanticism,
               and Atlantic studies and challenges students to reinterpret Atlantic history by juxtaposing
               past and present narratives of the legacies of enslavement. When Fay asks students
               to compare Olaudah Equiano’s narrative with the film <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther </span>(2018) and contextualizes this question in relation to N. K. Jemisin’s introduction
               to Afrofuturism in her essay “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” she extends the
               possibilities for the interpretation of “geographical space, conceptual space, and
               textual space” in Black Atlantic narratives (Dillon 31).</p>
            <p>In the broader sweep of her essay, Fay emphasizes “the fluid movement of dynamic relationality
               among multiple and variable subjects” as she explores various exercises designed to
               ask students to triangulate narratives of enslavement and post-enslavement. For instance,
               Fay invites students to consider how Mary Prince’s nineteenth-century rhetorics of
               suffering and resistance compare with those of Equiano, and then she further complicates
               the question by asking them to read the rhetoric of Toussaint L’Ouverture’s letters
               in relation to C. L. R. James’s account of his life in <span style="font-style:italic">The Black Jacobins</span> (1938). Sylvia Wynter’s article on James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,”
               also offers students an argument about how James’s work helps to posit a theory of
               “becoming Black” that, in Fay’s words, is relevant “whether the year is 1800 or 2024.”
               In another unit of the syllabus, Fay triangulates Lenora Sansay’s <span style="font-style:italic">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo </span>(1808) and the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </span>with Austen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span>, as she asks students to compare fictionalized accounts of women’s experiences in
               the period, and she further contextualizes this exercise with references to the work
               of Christina Sharpe and Wynter.</p>
            <p>Frances Botkin also offers many possibilities for students to read contrapuntally
               when she insists that Romantic-era narratives cannot be taught without a serious commitment
               to contextualization. Through a theorization of the practice of <span style="font-style:italic">tunyuhan</span> (“to make the best use of available resources to create something new and sustainable”),
               Botkin uses what she terms an “undisciplined mode of assembly” to consider the value
               of generative improvisation in teaching, and she explores how contemporary art, film,
               music, and recordings of interviews with people in Jamaica “animate colonial textuality
               with the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture that, in revising the past,
               imagines and nourishes future worlds.” She describes, for instance, how she presents
               students with Lydia Maria Child’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam </span>(1834) (extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</span> [1796]), alongside John Earle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</span> (1800), a painting of Three-Fingered Jack by the Jamaican painter Omari “Afrikan”
               Ra, and a documentary film by Roy Anderson called <span style="font-style:italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </span>(2015). This constellation of works allows students to see how “Child almost entirely
               excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections.” When she asks students
               to read Mary Prince’s <span style="font-style:italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave </span>(1831) alongside Marlon James’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Book of Night Women</span> (2009), she puts further pressure on the question of what nineteenth-century writers
               do not say about the experiences of enslaved people and particularly of enslaved women.</p>
            <p>Another way in which the dialogic space can be transformed to create an antiracist
               classroom is through the acknowledgment of the tension between writing and speech,
               foregrounding for students the incomplete nature of the antislavery archive. In her
               focus on “doing the work” of traveling to Jamaica in order to better understand Maroon
               history, Botkin centers the notion of orality in order to problematize the hierarchy
               of knowledge that privileges the archive. Her fieldwork and connection to the Maroon
               leader Gaama Gloria Simms has enabled her to create a contact zone in the classroom
               where the oral histories of Afro-Caribbean descendants of Maroon communities expose
               asymmetries of power and the injustices encoded as silence in the written record.
               The annual conference in Jamaica that she co-organizes with Paul Youngquist, the Charles
               Town International Conference on Maroons and Indigenous People, reconfigures the spaces
               and possibilities of knowledge for Romanticists, which brings the “archive” into conversation
               with living indigenous knowledge.</p>
            <p>Nicholas Blaisdell elucidates how counterpoint as exegesis awakens agency, as Carpentier
               also discovered in <span style="font-style:italic">El siglo de las luces</span>, when Sofía, one of his protagonists, urges, “¡Hay que hacer algo!” (Something must
               be done!) (410). Blaisdell explores how antislavery writers like Ottobah Cugoano indict
               capitalism’s use of enslaved labor in the nineteenth century as a global system, anticipating
               the system’s accommodation of unfree labor through the present era. Drawing on Paulo
               Freire, he reflects on how the study of antislavery texts, abolitionist networks,
               and Karl Marx informed not only his development as a social justice activist and organizer
               of Black Lives Matter protests in Peabody, Massachusetts, but also his work as a high
               school teacher and an adjunct professor of education. His analysis illuminates how
               a Freirean pedagogy can translate into greater empowerment for students in educational
               and civic settings.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">II. Beyond the Anthology</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>A brief review of the texts available for teaching the topic of antislavery literature,
               as well as the history of its anthologizing, may be useful to those planning to embark
               on teaching it for the first time, as well as to those wishing to think further about
               the relationship between how developments in research relate to those in their own
               pedagogy. Indeed, the current moment necessitates a commitment to the continued and
               critical self-examination of genealogies of antislavery literature. Scholars have
               long been engaged in the struggle to bring this material into classrooms. Thus, for
               example, Eva B. Dykes, whose work, as Bakary Diaby has pointed out, should be reassessed,
               was the earliest critic to call for an expansion of the Romantic canon to include
               antislavery writings (Diaby, “Black Women”). Dykes’s groundbreaking <span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought; or, A Study of Sympathy for the Oppressed </span>(1942), written in the twilight of the Harlem Renaissance and also at the height of
               Jim Crow segregation in the United States, drew attention to names such as Olaudah
               Equiano, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Mary Prince, writers not yet present
               in any anthologies of Romantic-era literature at the time. The reassessment of Dykes’s
               work seems particularly necessary when one notes that a forty-year silence passed
               between the publication of <span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</span> in 1942 and 1985, when Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates Jr. published their
               pivotal anthology <span style="font-style:italic">The Slave’s Narrative </span>(1985), which presented excerpts by Equiano, Cugoano, Sancho, and James Albert Ukawsaw
               Gronniosaw, among others.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It was not until the 1990s that access to antislavery literature became more widespread.
                  Inspired by both the historicist and postcolonial turns in Romantic-era scholarship,
                  scholars in the United States and Britain worked to incorporate Black Atlantic authors
                  into the Anglo-American canon throughout this period.

                  available on the web. Anne K. Mellor and Richard Matlak were the first editors of
                  a broader anthology to grant a section to “Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Abolition
                  in Britain” when they included it in their <span style="font-style:italic">British Literature, 1780–1830</span> (1996).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The scholarly recovery of Romanticism’s implication in antislavery and the struggle
                  for abolition was also enormously facilitated by the publication of Peter J. Kitson
                  and Debbie Lee’s eight-volume <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation: Writings in the British Romantic Period</span> (1999). Following from this, collections such as James G. Basker’s <span style="font-style:italic">Amazing Grace: An Anthology of Poems about Slavery, 1660–1810</span> (2002), Marcus Wood’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Poetry of Slavery: An Anglo-American Anthology, 1764–1866 </span>(2003), <span style="font-style:italic">Early Black British Writing</span> (2004), edited by Alan Richardson and Debbie Lee, and <span style="font-style:italic">Transatlantic Romanticism</span> (2006), edited by Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and Chris Koenig-Woodward, also made antislavery
                  texts more accessible than they had previously been. The republication of various
                  novels that pertain to this topic has similarly changed students’ classroom experiences.
                  For instance, many of our colleagues now use the Broadview Press edition of the anonymous <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</span> (2008), edited by Lyndon J. Dominique. Since it is not possible to anthologize novels
                  in the same way as other texts, A. A. Markley’s overview of lesser-taught novels and
                  plays is a useful resource for those wishing to teach novels that deal with the topic
                  of slavery.

                  </div> Although there is not space here to give a full account of the scholarly literature
                  in this period, we note that our respondents, Debbie Lee and Alan Richardson, not
                  only played key scholarly roles in producing anthologies of these literatures but
                  also helped to define the critical conversation. Richardson’s seminal 1993 article
                  “Romantic Voodoo: Obeah and British Culture, 1797–1807” opened the field to Afro-British
                  intertexts in the archive, those within textuality and beyond. Lee’s <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery and the Romantic Imagination</span> (2002) is a fundamental text in any survey of this corpus.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Having said all of this, it is important to acknowledge that course syllabi have been
               in many cases slow to change—both during the 1990s and today. Zadie Smith and Paterson
               Joseph have each described the way that their education in the United Kingdom failed
               to take account of Black history. In a September 2022 article in <span style="font-style:italic">The Guardian </span>written in connection with her foreword to a new edition of Gretchen Gerzina’s <span style="font-style:italic">Black England: A Forgotten Georgian History </span>(2022), Smith remembers the effect that finding Gerzina’s book had on her. She writes,
               “It’s incredible to think of now, but by 1999 I’d gone through 15 years of formal
               education, including a three-year English degree, without ever being given a book
               to study that made any reference whatsoever to the presence of individuals like me
               in the country in which I was born.” Joseph has also described his encounter with
               Gerzina’s book as a life-changing one (Sulcis).</p>

               <p>The “Bigger Six Collective” was formed in 2017 to resist the narrative that “diversification”
                  or “going global” has done enough to change the field; instead, they have called for
                  the need “to make our field in the image of those whose access to Romanticism has
                  long been and continues to be actively restricted” (140).

                  </div> More recently, Deanna Koretsky has offered a searing indictment of the field’s continuing
                  intransigence: “Scholars of romanticism in its current configuration are all white
                  men, which is to say, we work in a field that was not only built around white bodies
                  and sustained through white critical perspectives but that has explicitly and deliberately
                  been used to maintain fictions of whiteness as transparent and thus universal” (31).
                  Moreover, many critiques of Romanticism remain firmly within the Anglo-American academy,
                  precluding methodologies that reveal alternative positionalities and epistemes. Antislavery
                  literatures—even aside from the larger and more neglected topic of race and Romanticism—still
                  occupy a marginal position in the undergraduate curriculum.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Despite the efforts of many scholars to join in the work of recovery and to redress
               the biases of twentieth-century criticism and editing of Romantic texts, the topic
               of slavery and abolition is still frequently framed as an addition to the anthologies
               that undergraduate classes rely on and in syllabi themselves. Digital searches of
               databases of online syllabi suggest that a handful of texts, especially in surveys
               of the period, are being asked to carry a heavy freight. Many and varied obstacles
               have been put in the way of affirming the contributions of Black and Brown writers
               from the period in the classroom. The presence of Mary Seacole and Ukawsaw Gronniosaw
               in anthologies of Black British writers, for instance, does not guarantee them a place
               on syllabi. Additionally, neither African American writers, such as Jupiter Hammon
               and John Marrant, nor Plácido and Juan Manzano, from the Hispanophone Atlantic, appear
               often on syllabi. In “Abolitionist Interruptions,” Chander and Matthew note their
               “shared frustration with how Olaudah Equiano and his <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> have served too long as the single abolitionist/antislavery text in Romanticism”
               (431), a discussion that Matthew extends in her essay for the present volume. The
               tradition that has elided subjects who historically were denied ontological value
               and who were silenced through enslavement and racism in the economic and geopolitical
               system of Atlantic slavery can still be observed today in this disconnect between
               research and pedagogy.</p>

            </header>
            <p>The project of articulating linkages that connect the teaching praxis of Romanticists
               with histories of resistance, liberation, struggles against slavery and for the rights
               of the oppressed, goes far beyond the purview of a single volume, and so we wish to
               note some of the areas for pedagogical inquiry within which our contributors have
               opened vistas. We hope that the pedagogical experiments detailed in this collection
               will be useful in practical terms for instructors as a guide to how to begin redesigning
               their own syllabi and classroom discussions. The larger aim, however, is for the collection
               to be useful in broader methodological terms as a prompt for readers to imagine their
               own contrapuntal arrangements of texts and voices. The possibilities for new contrapuntal
               readings and new constellations of texts go far beyond the specific texts or arrangements
               listed in these case studies.</p>
            <p>Beyond simply adding texts to established syllabi, then, our contributors imagine
               how to disrupt pedagogical traditions that have been handed down from past generations
               of scholars. These scholars invite readers to examine the degree to which their own
               pedagogy reflects transformations in the field, even as they push for further re-examination
               of the structures on which pedagogical attitudes to teaching antislavery have previously
               been built. Our contributors tend to agree that because Romantic-era accounts of slavery
               were conditioned by the period in which they were written, it is “not enough,” as
               Frances Botkin puts it, to ask them to speak on behalf of the enslaved without other
               sources to contextualize them. Dykes poignantly draws attention to this paradox at
               the center of Romantic antislavery literature in the opening pages of <span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</span>. “One of the salient features of the ‘Romantic Movement’ of the latter eighteenth
               and early nineteenth centuries was the love of freedom” (1), she writes, paying tribute
               to Mary Prince’s famous line, “To be free is very sweet” (27). However, she then immediately
               notes that Romantic writers could also be “limited . . . by an adherence to traditional
               forms and conventions,” and notes that antislavery writings did not always depose
               the hierarchical structure and racism that authorized the triangular trade in the
               first place (1). Many scholars since Dykes have complicated any simple celebration
               of the expansion of the Romantic canon to include antislavery texts by exploring the
               capacity of these texts to sometimes “popularize stereotyped, simplified, patronizing,
               and (often) degrading images of Africa, its peoples, and their descendants in the
               Americas and Britain” despite their ethical and civic commitments to breaking the
               Blakean “mind forg’d manacles” that sustained Atlantic slavery (Richardson and Lee
               7). The contributors to this collection build on their project.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Many of our contributors use specific examples to describe a method that could be
                  applied to various texts. The example Matthew gives, for instance, of what it means
                  to read William Blake’s work in dialogue with antislavery literatures encourages pedagogues
                  to look more closely at how canonical texts they have taught without reference to
                  the history of slavery might change when this crucial and yet often sidelined context
                  is brought to bear on them. Similarly, Gordon’s and Fay’s references to Afrofuturist
                  texts invite readers to conduct their own research in this field and to imagine their
                  own conversations between the past and speculative futures. Another question that
                  emerges from this focus on Afrofuturism is whether there might be room for more opportunities
                  for students to encounter examples of Black resistance, humor, joy, and agency in
                  the Romantic classroom. New possibilities for dialogue with contemporary texts will
                  continue to arise as new works of critical fabulation appear. Since we first began
                  to gather this collection, for instance, many of our colleagues have begun to teach
                  texts such as Honorée Fanonne Jeffers’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Age of Phillis </span>(2020) and Joseph’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius Sancho </span>(2022), alongside Wheatley Peters’s poetry and Sancho’s letters.

            <p>Our work on this set of essays has prompted us to imagine several future topics for
               <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles </span>collections on how to engage antislavery literatures in the classroom, for which we
               would be pleased to see responses. While our contributors engage the question of affect
               in passing, for instance, our field would benefit from a more sustained conversation
               about how to acknowledge the range of emotions that the learning process might bring
               up in classes that consider the history of slavery. Critical work that addresses the
               personal experience of critics themselves can offer crucial models for students: we
               eagerly await the publication of Mathelinda Nabugodi’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Trembling Hand: Reflections of a Black Woman in the Romantic Archive,</span> for instance. From another perspective, both Botkin and Ortiz encourage attention
               to the aural dimension of textuality and its silences, which reveals how orality and
               the epistemologies it transmits are also major components of the antislavery archive
               that could be engaged further. Becoming aware of the limitations that govern the textual
               archive<span style="font-style:italic">as text,</span> with attention to the conditions of its production, will allow for the interrogation
               of approaches with which Romanticists are familiar, such as historicist, post-structuralist,
               feminist, postcolonial, and neo-formalist methodologies.</p>
            <p>The essays here also enjoin readers to consider important questions that remain on
               the horizon of this collection about the extent to which discussions of antislavery
               texts have been made to stand in for larger discussions about race in the Romantic
               period and how this tendency might be addressed in the future. This connects the work
               of the collection with Marlon B. Ross’s call to “shift the focus momentarily away
               from the important question of Romanticism’s self-conscious investment in or diversion
               from slavery and colonialism to consider <span style="font-style:italic">race</span> itself as an economy of gut-instinctual, senseperceptual, socialpsychological, aesthetic-ideological,
               and geopolitical commitments,” in his essay “The Race of/in Romanticism: Notes Toward
               a Critical Race Theory” (26). As Diaby argues, “we must continue working on slavery,
               but we should not let it be our only engagement with, again, the deeply quotidian,
               socio-personal ordering of the world we inhabit and have inherited from the long Romantic
               period” (“Black Women” 252). Diaby himself offers a rare example of what it means
               to bring the topic of race to bear on texts that have not traditionally been grouped
               under the heading of those that address the topic of race in the Romantic period in
               his reading of William Wordsworth’s “We Are Seven” (“Counting the Bodies”). Although
               several of our authors encourage a more open dialogue between Black studies and Romanticism,
               a more widespread and sustained dialogue between Romantic literature and critical
               race theory is clearly necessary in the field at large.</p>
            <p>The field of Romanticism, and especially the study of slavery in the Romantic period,
               still needs to do more to address the divisions it has historically instantiated between
               Anglophone texts and texts in other languages. The Anglophone focus of the authors
               examined throughout this collection points to multilingualism and Romanticism as a
               related area for future research as the plurilingual nature of the histories of African
               and indigenous resistance comes further into view. As Gillian Sankoff writes, “It
               is difficult to conceive of another situation where people arrived with such a variety
               of native languages, where they were so cut off from their native language groups;
               where the size of no language group was enough to ensure its survival; where no second
               language was shared by enough people to serve as a useful vehicle of intercommunication;
               and where the legitimate language was inaccessible to almost everyone” (24).</p>
            <p>For some of the writers in the archive of antislavery literatures, the process of
               translation into English and language acquisition was also a process of living through
               epistemic violence. Yet the governing assumption in Romantic-era studies in approaching
               the antislavery archive is that the language of Black British authors is English (Almeida
               114). A similar assumption governs the indigenous archive, as Hessell shows in <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Literature and the Colonised World: Lessons from Indigenous Translations
                  </span>(2018). Hessell argues that indigenous interpretations of canonical authors are more
               than “novelties, nor [are they] simple evidence of the global power and reach of Romantic
               literature” (228) but are “simultaneous expressions of the value of Romantic literature
               and of the experience of colonization” (230).</p>
            <p>While some might respond that the study of British or American literature is Anglocentric
               by nature, this commitment to monolingualism out of habit robs the field of depth
               and breadth, since the African diaspora was not limited to English-speaking countries.
               During and even after the abolition of slavery in 1833, Britain continued to trade
               with the Global South while at the same time making greater imperial incursions in
               Africa and India, as scholars such as Robin Blackburn, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz, Omar
               Miranda, César Soto, Juan Sánchez, Jesse Reeder, and Sara Medina Calzada have shown.
               Even so, texts from this “second slavery,” as Dale Tomich has called it, have a belated
               entrance into Romanticism. Such texts include, for example, Juan Manzano’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Life and Poems of a Cuban Slave</span> (1840), translated by the abolitionist Richard Robert Madden, who also testified
               in the <span style="font-style:italic">Amistad</span> trial, which vindicated the rights of enslaved persons to rise up against their enslavers
               and was one of the most famous international trials of its time. Nicole Aljoe suggests
               that the 1848 biography of the enslaved Brazilian Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua is another
               useful starting point for those wishing to expand their students’ reference points
               beyond texts written in English (<span style="font-style:italic">Creole Testimonies</span> 111). Aljoe also challenges “the marginal status of West Indian slave narratives
               within critical discourses of the slave narrative genre, Caribbean and Black Atlantic
               literary histories” and reveals how abolitionist groups in England, the United States,
               and the West Indies were in close contact with one another (<span style="font-style:italic">Creole Testimonies</span> 2).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Moreover, monolingualism, when assumed as a “natural state,” prevents a true reckoning
                  with how English functioned as a significant barrier for the millions of people in
                  British colonies who were deprived of access not only to literacy but also to the
                  judicial recognition of their oral testimony in colonial courts, further limiting
                  access to “the legitimate language.”

                  this duality helps to decenter the assumption of the normativity of English and the
                  nationalist and imperialist subtexts underpinning the idea that it is the language
                  of Romanticism. Doing so disentangles it from the “metaphysical empires” of language
                  that Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o denounces and that his son, critic Mukoma Wa Ngugi, terms “EME”
                  as shorthand for “English Metaphysical Empire” (Wa Ngugi; Mignolo). As much as they
                  are part of the standardization of languages in this period, the creolizations of
                  English and other European languages in contact zones are also part of the Romantic
                  aesthetic (Elfenbein). In the United States, the question of accessibility is compounded
                  by the disciplinary gateway of English as the privileged language of the corpus, since
                  millions of its citizens speak languages other than English that go unrecognized if
                  Romanticism is configured as solely Anglocentric. As we reimagine community in the
                  twenty-first century to create spaces of redress and also of transformation, Romanticist
                  scholars must do more to invite students to imagine new contact zones not only between
                  canonical and non-canonical texts and between or among disciplines but also between
                  the past and the present, between history and historical fiction, between printed
                  and living voices, and between linguistic communities whose ties to each other have
                  been willfully and violently erased.</p>

                  </div> Following the work of exemplary scholars and educators such as Paolo Freire, Stuart
                  Hall, bell hooks, and Edward Said, we are humbled by the task of approaching, alongside
                  our contributors, the question of how our teaching and scholarship can contribute
                  to the advancement of restorative justice. We inhabit a global community where division
                  and injustice toward those structurally submitted to exclusionary regimes is increasing
                  due to economic agendas that put profit over people, wage geopolitical conflict around
                  the globe, disregard climate change, and mismanage the fallout from Covid-19. As Hall
                  sagely anticipated in his seminal 1980 essay, “Teaching Race”: <span class="quote">‘The really crucial question is how do you begin to make that move away from the level
                     of prejudice and belief? One needs to undermine the obvious. One has to show that
                     these are social and historical processes and that they are not written in the stars,
                     they are not handed down. They are deep conditions which are not going to change if
                     we start tinkering around with them. We must not give our students that kind of illusion.
                     We can however begin the process of questioning what the structures are and how they
                     work. (127)’</span> This collection enters into the spirit of “beginning the process of questioning” with
                  the awareness that there are many more questions to be asked than can be answered
                  in one volume. Because it has emerged out of a call for colleagues within a particular
                  geographically defined network to describe to us what they were already teaching,
                  rather than from an open call for work about the future of our field at large, we
                  cannot make claims for broad coverage. We regret that no essays address Romantic antislavery
                  literatures from Latin America, Africa, Asia, or Australia, or work with indigenous
                  literatures, translation, or multilingualism. We also regret that there is no essay
                  that addresses in detail the question of how to teach the Haitian Revolution, which
                  is clearly foundational in the study of antislavery in the Romantic period. As Nick
                  Nessbit, drawing on Marx, writes in <span style="font-style:italic">The Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean</span> (2022)<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> such work brings “living labor” to the forefront and its connection to Hegelian historical
                  realization.

                  </div> As the discourse of antiracist approaches to teaching literature of the Romantic period
                  continues to broaden, we hope this volume—a record of one localized conversation—will
                  be a prompt to further discussion.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The essays collected here explore how recent history informs the way students might
               currently receive Romantic texts, clearing a space for further discussion about how
               the conversation will continue to change the way Romantic texts signify. As scholars
               and teachers, becoming conscious of not only how pedagogical praxis might be shaped
               by developments in research and critical race theory but also how events in the classroom
               might reshape research is more than a matter of good teaching or meeting the publish-or-perish
               expectations of the academy. Taken together, these essays encourage scholars to reflect
               on how both instructors and students must consider the relation between the classroom
               and the university and its relationship to the imagined community at the national
               and planetary levels. As Matthew, Gordon, Richardson, and Lee elucidate here, instructors
               and students must grapple with how structures of white privilege are implicit in the
               university, the archive, and the discipline so that together they can transform interpretation
               into a dialogic act of resistance as they deconstruct racialist and exclusionary discourses,
               thereby creating alternative spaces of interrelational knowledge.</p>
            <p>The co-creation of knowledge is one of the paths toward the liberatory potential of
               education that Freire, a major inspiration for the 2018 panel, describes. Arguing
               against the “banking concept” of education, a system in which students merely bank
               information they passively receive from their teacher, Freire challenges the asymmetry
               of power central to the subject/object dichotomy that is also at the core of the ontological
               negation that racism relies on. As hooks writes in her meditation on how Freire’s
               pedagogy informs her own, “Freire’s work affirmed that education can only be liberatory
               when everyone claims knowledge as a field in which we all labor” (<span style="font-style:italic">Teaching to Transgress</span> 14). Moments of first encounter are often formative: students are coming to texts
               about slavery from a different historical perspective than their teachers, and this
               means that students have the potential to teach their instructors things that they
               have not before seen and that they may find hard to see.</p>
            <p>While by no means exhaustive, this conversation offers some specific practices in
               the attempt to create classroom environments to fashion a place “where both [professors
               and students] are simultaneously teachers and students” while respecting the intersectionalities
               of race, gender, and class in our increasingly diverse student body (Freire 72). hooks
               also cautions that “teachers are often among that group most reluctant to acknowledge
               the extent to which white-supremacist thinking informs every aspect of our culture
               including the way we learn, the content of what we learn, and the manner in which
               we are taught” (<span style="font-style:italic">Teaching Community </span>25). With this in mind, the discussions here respectfully offer multiple ways to reflect
               on how we might more consciously acknowledge and evaluate how our own experiences
               inflect our pedagogical practices and how to work with students to create spaces in
               our classrooms for this vital dialogue. At a time when events in the United States
               have inspired civic action and debate in countries across the world, the present moment
               can no longer be kept outside the doors of a classroom in which Romantic literature
               is being read. As scholars, it is useful to consider not only how pedagogical praxis
               might be reshaped by developments in research but also how events in the classroom
               might reshape research practices.</p>

               while the <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles</span> website was rebuilt and concurrent projects were under way. Although some contributors
               have added references to more recent work for the purpose of citational justice, the
               majority of these essays were drafted in 2019 and 2020.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               about Slavery/Teaching about Slavery,” for nuanced insights on the language of exegesis
               in the classroom and in scholarship. Tita Chico founded a series titled “Antiracism:
               Research, Teaching, Public Engagement,” hosted by the University of Maryland’s Center
               for Literary and Comparative Studies, which includes several talks by colleagues in
               our field. The series is ongoing and constitutes a rich pedagogical resource. It can
               be accessed online at <a class="link_ref" href="https://english.umd.edu/research-innovation/clcs/antiracism-series">https://english.umd.edu/research-innovation/clcs/antiracism-series</a>. Shelby Johnson, Brigitte Fielder, and Kerry Sinanan also spoke at a teach-in on
               “Race, Pedagogy and Whiteness in the Long 18C,” sponsored by the Keats-Shelley Association
               of America, the University of Texas San Antonio, and Mills College; a recording of
               this event is also available online at <a class="link_ref" href="https://k-saa.org/race_pedagogy_whiteness/">https://k-saa.org/race_pedagogy_whiteness/</a>. The issues raised by Ronjaunee Chatterjee, Alicia J. Mireles Christoff, and Amy
               Wong in their essay “Undisciplining Victorian Studies” also inflect the study of Romanticism.
               The Keats-Shelley Association of America posted online a two-part virtual roundtable
               titled “Toward an Anti-Racist, ‘Undisciplined’ Romanticism,” co-edited by Andrew Burkett
               and David Sigler (<a class="link_ref" href="https://k-saa.org/k-saa-virtual-roundtable-toward-an-anti-racist-undisciplined-romanticism/">https://k-saa.org/k-saa-virtual-roundtable-toward-an-anti-racist-undisciplined-romanticism/</a>). The Black Studies and Romanticism Virtual Conference held online, organized by
               Kate Singer at Mount Holyoke College, was also a virtual nexus for exchange at a moment
               when in-person conversations were not possible (<a class="link_ref" href="https://commons.mtholyoke.edu/blsandr/">https://commons.mtholyoke.edu/blsandr/</a>). <span style="font-style:italic">Teaching the Eighteenth Century Now: Pedagogy as Ethical Engagement,</span> edited by Kate Parker and Miriam L.

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">The Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century seminar was founded in 2012 by
               Joselyn M. Almeida (then UMass Amherst), Gülru Çakmak (University of Massachusetts
               Amherst) and Kate Singer (Mount Holyoke College). Daniel Block (then Hampshire College),
               later became a co-organizer. By 2018 it was being led by Almeida, Singer, Lily Gurton-Wachter
               (Smith College), and Amelia Worsley (Amherst College). The seminar was conceived as
               a venue in which faculty from five colleges in the Amherst area of western Massachusetts
               could collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of scholars attentive to the intersections
               and tensions among the constellations of globalization, cosmopolitanism, migration,
               and border studies in the nineteenth century. Over the years, faculty from the Five
               Colleges have met to share their work in progress and have also hosted lectures from
               colleagues from the surrounding area, which have illuminated the multiple intersections
               and tensions of colonialism and globalization, Atlantic slavery, cosmopolitanism,
               migration, border studies, and the digital humanities. Our conversation at the panel
               in 2018 was shaped by seminars with Simon Gikandi, Manu Samriti Chander, Grégory Pierrot,
               Laura Doyle, Ron Welburn, Roberto Márquez, Orrin Wang, Joel Pace, Elizabeth Maddock
               Dillon, and Jared Hickman. Because of funding limitations, our invitations were restricted
               to colleagues located on the East Coast of the United States, or those traveling through
               the area. The 2018 pedagogy roundtable, held at Mount Holyoke College, built on these
               shared experiences and emerged from the community that these previous discussions
               had created. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
