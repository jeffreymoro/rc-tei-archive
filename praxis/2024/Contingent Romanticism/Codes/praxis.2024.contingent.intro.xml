            <p>“Pandemic” was Merriam-Webster’s—and everyone else’s—2020 Word of the Year, but the
                silent partner of any crisis is “contingency.” The unconscionable death toll in the
                United States is at least partly the result of a failure to prepare for the
                non-surprise surprise of the pandemic. At the time this introduction was written, we
                were repeatedly informed that any timetable for a return to normalcy is at the mercy
                of various, unforeseen contingencies. Moving between reasonable probability and
                blind chance, contingency as an abstract “three dimensional concept” is the core
                experience of modernity—contingency promises both freedom from enclosed, controlled
                systems, and chaos.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Andreas Schedler, “Mapping Contingency,” in <hi

                    As the world traveled slowly from the moment of missed chances, the
                “known unknown,” to the uncertainty of a post-pandemic future—the “unknown unknown,”
                if you will—it is fitting to by look back to the early nineteenth century, a period
                during which contingency decisively entered the zone of historical thinking,
                disrupting progressive historicism with the possibility of uncertain futures.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Emily Rohrbach argues
                        that “Romantic anticipations” departed from a progressive teleology to
                        imagine “the present as a historical age whose apparent trajectory might be
                        disrupted by some dark, unpredictable futurity.” <hi rend="italic"

            <p>As Coleridge’s “Fears in Solitude” demonstrates, contingency’s purchase is most
                evident on the scale of the system. After leaving the productive solitude of the
                dell, Coleridge’s speaker admonishes the British public that their collective
                failure of imagination and capitulation to the empty signification of modern print
                culture has potentially far-reaching consequences. As “spectators and not
                combatants,” of war, their voyeurism makes them short-sighted, with “no guess/
                Anticipative of a wrong unfelt, /No speculation on contingency.”<note place="foot"

                knowns,” the next lines, where Coleridge appears to qualify speculation as “However
                dim and vague, too vague and dim/ To yield forth a justifying cause,” launch
                contingency from the realm of probability and into the far murkier waters of the
                    unknowable.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        Slavoj Zizek defines “unknown knowns” as the “disavowed beliefs,
                        suppositions, and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even
                        though they form the background of our public values.” “What Rumsfeld

                The inverted anaphora in the line is crucial, emphasizing contingency’s uncertain
                futurity and rendering it impotent, so that, “forth/ (Stuff’d out with big preamble,
                holy names/ And adjurations of the God in heaven)/ We sound our mandates for the
                certain death/ Of thousands and ten thousands!” (99-104) Empty mandates take the
                place of contingency’s justifications, but if contingency is so dim, can it ever be
                satisfactorily justified? Coleridge attempts to draw a causal line between the
                failure to speculate and the potential for future harm, but confronted with the
                multiple forms of empty signification the poem identifies (“Courts, Committees,
                Institutions, / Associations, and Societies”), the poem’s speaker does not provide a
                satisfactory way of overcoming a systemic resistance to contingency. </p>
                
            <p>What follows in this volume are a series of productive speculations on the place of
                contingency in Romantic culture, and on Romanticism’s contingency. We have already
                seen how we might read contingency’s place in Romanticism, but reading Romanticism’s
                contingency means confronting its constitutively elusive, often restrictive
                linguistic, historical and geographical borders. Speculating on a contingent
                Romanticism also means acknowledging long-standing disciplinary crises accelerated
                by the pandemic’s ruthless human and civic toll; specifically, universities’
                collective overreliance on flexible, contingent faculty, and the ease with which
                they can be abandoned. In the current crisis, the failure of one form of contingency
                and the overreliance on another are pushing academia into places of prophetic
                fulfillment. </p>
                
            <p>In “Fears of Solitude,” contingency’s elusive, frustrating horizon contrasts the
                productive interplay of mind with spirit, conjured by the tangible-intangible
                skylark of the poem’s opening stanzas. The skylark first enters the poem as a
                counterfactual, a potential sonic presence that both establishes and belies silence.
                The speaker then imagines a conditional scene of pastoral bliss in which a person
                “might” lie on the heath and hear the skylark, before finally apostrophizing the
                bird while in a state of imaginative fecundity. The silent, not-silent dell as “an
                unsettling site of too many possibilities” is thus premised on the skylark’s
                contingent place in the speaker’s imagination.<note place="foot" resp="author">Peter Larkin, “‘Fears in Solitude:’ Reading (from) the Dell,” 
                        <hi rend="italic">The Wordsworth Circle</hi>, vol. 22, no. 1 (1991),
                    13.</note> In his essay for this volume, Nathan Te Bokkel also explores
                the contingency of skylarks, and skylarks as a figure for Romanticism’s contingency.
                Stylistically, figurally, and thematically twining together reflections on
                mathematics, agriculture, and the ornithological poetics, Te Bokkel’s systrophic
                essay demonstrates how the ways in which we read Romanticism—as either rupture or
                continuity, as either metaphysical or grounded—may be more usefully considered as
                contingent, rather than binary, epistemologies. </p>
                
            <p>This is contingency on a large scale, but we cannot forget that contingence, in its
                earliest definitions, invokes closeness, affinity, and the sensorial (from the Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">con</hi>, or “with,”
                and<hi rend="italic"> tangere</hi>, “to touch”). Contingency,
                then, isn’t merely the unknown or counterfactual, but the affective and intimate.
                Michele Speitz’s essay on the work of the Haitian revolutionary poet Charles Hérard
                Dumesle draws on contingency’s other definition as an affinity, or closeness.
                Identifying an alternative revolutionary spirit in Dumesle’s writings—one that is
                contingent, local, and grounded rather than transcendent and immortal—Speitz traces
                how Dumesle’s coining of the neologism <hi rend="italic">lugubrer</hi>, “to make
                sorrowful,” is, in the context of Hatian revolutionary aesthetics, inspirational
                rather than elegiac. Uncovering what Speitz describes as “contingent meanings” in
                Dumesle’s use of <hi rend="italic">lugubrer</hi> reveals the human and terrestrial
                traces of colonial trauma. </p>
                
            <p>Writing on the relationship between unboundedness and fanaticism, Winter Jade
                Werner’s essay on the politics of despatialization in Hogg’s
                <hi rend="italic">Confessions of a Justified Sinner </hi>demonstrates
                a like investment on the tangible and bounded while demonstrating the pitfalls of
                assuming virtuality’s equivalence with parity. Charting the rhetorical similarities
                between the international Protestantism of the early nineteenth century and more
                recent cyber-utopianism, Werner analyzes the novel’s intersection of spatial and
                religious politics. Drawing from Hogg’s deft analysis of fanaticism, Werner
                demonstrates how we, like Hogg, might usefully counter presentist myopia by
                resisting history’s artifactualization in order to reveal the contingencies of the
                now. </p>
                
            <p>It’s worth remembering that in the June 8, 1809 issue of his weekly paper
                <hi rend="italic">The Friend, </hi>Coleridge referred to his
                poem as “Fears of Solitude,” an error that critics have suggested can be traced to
                Coleridge’s fear of the disconnect between the language of sensation and communal
                    feeling.<note place="foot" resp="author">Larkin, 11.</note> In the final
                essay in this volume, Chris Washington reads Shelley’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Last Man </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matilda</hi> as novels in which Shelley establishes loneliness as the original
                condition of selfhood. Washington demonstrates how temporality in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Last Man</hi> is displaced from heliocentric, anthropocentric time into a
                universal contingent temporality, and argument which is then broadened to make an
                argument for futurity’s lastness. We are all writing, Washington suggests, for the
                end of the world.</p>
