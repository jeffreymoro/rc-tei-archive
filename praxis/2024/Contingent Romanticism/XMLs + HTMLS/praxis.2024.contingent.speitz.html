            <p>This essay studies national narratives at the heart of one of the best-known works
               of Haitian revolutionary Romanticism. At issue is how these national narratives participate
               within larger semiotic systems of national infrastructure and nationalized earth.
               More particularly, the essay foregrounds Haitian places and ruins that bear complicated
               realities and histories in need of telling. In signature Romantic style, Haitian grounds
               and built structures have their own stories to tell and speak volumes in Charles Hérard
               Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage dans le nord d'Hayti</span> (1824). But the voices they sound and the accounts they record are not homogenous,
               timeless, nor transcendent, as we find in more universalizing iterations of Romantic-era
               calls for new political orders. Instead these voices and histories are particular,
               personal, and contingent—proving especially provocative when read in light of key
               terminology from Haiti’s <span style="font-style:italic">Acte de l’Indépendance</span> (1804). Dumesle’s revolutionary Romantic poetics turn upon the politics of prosopopoeia,
               intoning counternarratives and correctives to nationally-chauvinistic French colonial
               politics and aesthetics in part by giving voice to Haitian locales, by giving rise
               to the human and nonhuman stories they might tell if these places too had tongues
               or pens. That is, Dumesle drives home the political edge of the aesthetics and poetics
               of prosopopoeia, a trope that uses the imaginative and metaphorical spaces of narrative
               to imbue voice to whatever typically is not able to speak, from other animals to the
               land itself, from built objects to dead subjects. In this sense, Dumesle activates
               an especially time-sensitive iteration of prosopopoeia in place of more lyric-driven
               instances of prosopopoeia that might be said to reach for timeless universality. Here
               Haiti’s natural and built environments speak tales of national heroics and chronicle
               compressed events of human dispossession and death that cannot be sundered from stories
               of long-term environmental degradation and desolation. </p>

                  intones counternarratives and correctives to nationally-chauvinistic French colonial
                  politics and aesthetics. In keeping with Paul de Man’s classic discussions of prosopopoeia,
                  Dumesle relies on the figure of prosopopoeia not merely to draft the “fiction of an
                  apostrophe to an absent, deceased, or voiceless entity.”

                  Reading infrastructure and environment as archive, Dumesle not only anticipates Michel-Rolph

                  historicized as one of Haiti’s first epic poets. He figures as an early example of
                  an Haitian author participating in a nationalized Romanticism specific to Haiti that
                  remained active across the nineteenth century and through the early-twentieth century

                  around tropes of justifiable rebellion and rightful vengeance. Daut also distinguishes
                  how <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> marks a singular iteration of revolutionary Romanticism constitutive of Haiti and
                  its more unique expressions of an affect-driven Romanticism predicated upon a condition
                  of becoming sorrowful. Daut stresses how “by the mid-nineteenth century the verb <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span> [to make sorrowful] had become associated with not only the crafting of Haiti’s Declaration
                  of Independence, but with the early Haitian literary tradition more broadly.”

                  by this word, reveals how the condition of becoming sorrowful—rather than activating

                  of an aesthetic judgement capable of inspiring political action and great change.

                  </div> Daut foregrounds the term’s etymology, evolving meanings, and politicized reception
                  in a long passage: <span class="quote">‘The <span style="font-style:italic">Acte de l’Indépendance</span> famously contains a phrase that allegedly caused the most ardent of French grammarians
                     in the nineteenth century to turn up their noses: ‘The name of the French <span style="font-style:italic">makes sorrowful</span> our land’ [Le nom français <span style="font-style:italic">lugubre</span> encore nos contrées]. Disdain for this phrase derived not solely, it seems, from the
                     uninhibited hatred of the French it exhibits, but also from the fact that the adjective <span style="font-style:italic">lugubre,</span> which means “mournful” or “sorrowful,” had been turned into a verb, “to make sorrowful.”
                     Although the crassly termed “mulatto verb” [verbe mulâtre] has—at least since the
                     publication of Gustave D’Alaux’s 1852 article “Yellow Literature” [La Littérature
                     jaune]—been attributed to Dessalines’s most prominent secretary, Louis-Félix Boisrond-Tonnerre,
                     the verb <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span> was actually defined a few years before Haitian independence in Mercier’s <span style="font-style:italic">Neologisms: or Dictionary of New words, to Revive, or to Understand in New Ways</span> [<span style="font-style:italic">Néologie: ou Vocabulaire de mots nouveaux, à renouveler, ou pris dans des acceptions
                        Nouvelles</span>] (1801). In the dictionary, Mercier, who claimed in the work’s introduction to have
                     “removed (with very few exceptions) all words that relate to the [French] revolution,”
                     the entry for <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span> reads: to imprint with sadness. His imagination tends to make sorrowful everything
                     around him. To make sorrowful a theatre with dark and sad works, distressing; Make

                  </div> To underscore her point Daut emphasizes “the direct influence of the <span style="font-style:italic">Acte de l’Indépendance</span> on later works of Haitian literature and history,” including Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage.</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Daut rightly contends that to responsibly address Haiti’s national literature from
                  this period and its relationship to revolutionary Romanticism requires that we recognize
                  the contingency of the poetic and the political, the aesthetic and the historical
                  within this body of work. For Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> in particular, then, is it necessary to grasp the centrality of the <span style="font-style:italic">Acte de l’Indépendance</span> as a key allusive, intertextual reference point. It is also important to bear in mind
                  what is at stake when Dumesle is characterized as having “gone into ecstasies” over
                  the neologism <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer,</span> a highly politicized term itself central to the Haitian Declaration of Independence
                  and its literary and political legacies.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While the nineteenth-century French grammarian D’Alaux meant to disparage Dumesle
                  for being in thrall to the term <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span>, when read from another perspective, D’Alaux’s phrasing may well have signified a
                  compliment attesting to the political power of Dumesle’s words. D’Alaux’s negative
                  aesthetic judgement of the word suggests that Dumesle’s writing falls down a peg because
                  of a problematic mélange of an implied mindless devotion, hyper-embodiment, and irrationality
                  in his allegiance to <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span>. The reference to his going into “ecstasies” does double duty in conjuring to mind
                  a would-be thoughtless state of religious zealousness as well as a sexually-charged
                  state of orgasmic release, neither of which suggest a steady hand nor a level head.
                  Neither conforms to normative, hyperrational parameters of so-called western enlightenment
                  subjects. But when read against the French colonial grain, to go into ecstasy over
                  the term <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span>, a verb referring to the process of becoming sorrowful, suggests arriving at a motivated
                  state of emotional whiplash: a frenetic sadness, fevered grieving, heated distress.

                  As we shall see and confirming anew how Haitian revolutionary literature takes as
                  axiomatic a blend of enlightenment aesthetics and revolutionary politics, Dumesle’s
                  capacious thinking about the Haitian country, as including not just people but wider
                  environs replete with built and natural environments, aligns with evolving meanings
                  of the word <span style="font-style:italic">country</span> developing in Britain. Anne Janowitz’s <span style="font-style:italic">England’s Ruins: Poetic Purpose and the National Landscape </span>charts this precise historical development.

                     ruins were admired as blending into the countryside, while the sense of “country”
                     as rural terrain and “country” as nation also began to melt one into the other.

                  of people and place. The use of the adjective-turned-verb in the Haitian Declaration

                  to declare Haitian sovereignty over a specific population and location (my translation
                  and emphasis). This region and country, these Haitian lands, encircling the people

                  (people or things) in a circle, to travel round, circumnavigate (a place)” and the
                  Old French meaning “to wrap around (<span style="font-style:italic">c</span>1200), to traverse, to wander about (<span style="font-style:italic">c</span>1230), to surround, encircle (my translation).

                  metonyms operating in Proust. Instead of relying primarily on the exchange economy
                  of metaphor, here the constitutive relations of metonymy predominate. At play in this
                  case is “a syntagmatic structure based on contingent association such as metonymy
                  … [not] the substitutive totalization by metaphor which is said [by some whom de Man

                  sorrow) differently by way of context-driven association. Sometimes, for example,
                  a metaphor can signify all the more darkly due to one’s constitutive environs or political
                  context and vice versa. The entry’s phrasing foregrounds the contingency of meaning
                  and spotlights the role proximity plays in generating associated meanings. That is,
                  the entry’s language evokes the way meanings of words such as sorrow or <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span> can change next to different words, the way one’s sorrow can be transformed by another
                  who closes in too close, seemingly encircling and touching with sorrow everyone and
                  everything imaginable; “Lugubrer tout ce qui l’environne” [To make sorrowful all that
                  surrounds him] (my translation). The verbal power and politics of metonymy’s transformative
                  dynamics of proximity are borne out again and again in Mercier’s entry on lugubrer,
                  not least in light of Mercier’s contextualized definition, where the capitalized term
                  “Lugubrer” suggests this particular sort of sorrow-making can be imagined and read
                  as imprinting upon and therefore reformulating affectively and conceptually the entirety
                  of one’s surrounding nature and culture. By extension, here a mind touched and remade
                  by lugubrer is able to see this sorrowful condition and its attendant motivating affective
                  states as legible throughout all reaches of Haitian lived experience.</p>

                  beautiful aesthetic politics of ruination, seeing as the ruins he surveys there once
                  housed Henry I, King of Haiti, better known as Henri Christophe, who succeeded in
                  throwing off French colonial rule. In this landscape, ruins bear a strain of beauty
                  shared with other, assumedly unruined built structures. “The aspect of this city”
                  holds especial semiotic purchase, “preserv[ing] the thoughts of great memories” of
                  standing up to the French. Its ruins are revelatory, tantamount to a national iconography

                  Treating the port city’s environs more akin to central characters or narrators than
                  static backdrop or mere setting, Dumesle’s travel narrative imagines an ecological,
                  environmental, nonhuman agency that borders on artistic agency and license. The city
                  “seemed to appear from behind a curtain … the mountains that encircle her from the

                  for us her extensive wall.” The city metaphorizes into stage actor. The mountain metaphorizes
                  into the one who depicts. The city is not simply a passive storehouse of memory but
                  also actively “reveal[s] the events for which she was the stage.” Dumesle’s use of
                  active, non-finite verbs affords room for multiple histories and temporalities to
                  appear in synchrony, alongside one another, as the city-as-stage metaphor links the
                  ruins of another time with their stories from the past to Dumesle’s present where
                  “Cap-Haitian seemed to appear from behind a curtain to present before our eyes the
                  panorama of its beautiful edifices and ruins that are spread over her.” The city and
                  its environs surround Dumesle and his fellow travelers with the bounty of a rich infrastructural
                  historical archive capable at once of showcasing Haiti’s revolutionary past and authorizing
                  decolonized futures not least because the site is capable of carrying into the present,
                  and beyond, great memories of the Haitian past.</p>

               <p>The longstanding adjectival senses of <span style="font-style:italic">lugubre</span> (meaning mournful or sorrowful), as well as the reformulated verb form used in the

               <p>Further enlarging the scope of such temporal play, the ruin’s relationship to past

                  “[r]uins hold histories but are less than the sum of the sensibilities of people who
                  live in them. Instead we might turn to ruins as epicenters of renewed claims, as history

                  </div> How the temporalities of ruins are read produces telling results, not unlike a Rorschach
                  test: the temporal aesthetic judgements ruins arouse expose the historical politics
                  of their readers. “It is possible, for example, to view the anachronism of the ruin
                  as bearing a message from the past, rather than, as Michael Roth suggests in <span style="font-style:italic">Irresistible Decay</span>, operating as ‘an active site of life in the present,’” and, I would add, it goes
                  without saying that ruins could also operate as both at once, with ruins bespeaking
                  past and present simultaneously.

               <p>Immediately following the above account of the port town’s mountains, buildings, ruins,
                  Dumesle deploys another signature trope of Romanticism by foregrounding the relationship
                  between nature and imagination: <span class="quote">‘the imagination contemplates [the wider aspect of the city and its ruins] with surprise,
                     and occupies itself showing them again detachedly as if it was charged with collecting
                     them for history. While questioning the debris of these venerable monuments about
                     the great attributes of our revolution, it seeks to discover the causes that prepared
                     her and made her course so frightening. Informed by their testimonies that injustice
                     and oppression were the motifs for all the disasters which have ravaged this land,
                     it remains struck with astonishment and fear by the idea of the reign of the usurper
                     who dictated, not so long ago, his banishment decrees.

                     </div>’</span> Whereas, in lines just previous to these, elements of the built and natural world
                  take the stage to assume agential powers of author and artist, the lines quoted here
                  foreground the power of an imagination in thrall to the aesthetic force and historic
                  significance of revolutionary ruins. The aesthetic force of this landscape first sends
                  Dumesle’s imagination reeling—cooling then for a moment in the face of resolute purpose:
                  the charge of (re)collecting the scene’s actors, its mountains, its monuments, for
                  history. The imagination joins these Haitian environs as central players, with Dumesle’s
                  ruins and debris staged here as the imagination’s direct interlocuters, ripe as they
                  are for “questioning” and bearing as they do answers “about the great attributes of
                  our revolution.” The records these environs disclose to the imagination are “testimonies”
                  of “injustice and oppression” that would pave the way for “all [of] the disasters
                  which … ravaged this land.” At this point Dumesle’s imagination is once again thrown,
                  taken aback, “struck with astonishment and fear” not simply by encountering in these
                  ruins the stories of human injustice, “the reign of the usurper who dictated,” but
                  also the dialectally enfolding unjust desolation of “this land,” as the latter arrives
                  hand-in-hand with human “injustices and oppression.” Revealingly, the imagination
                  resides at the center of Dumesle’s sentence, with damaged, “ravaged” land on the one
                  side and a damaging, “dictat[ing]” humanity on the other. Dumesle’s syntax thematizes
                  a core concept: it grammatically yokes together in the space of one sentence the structural
                  link between social injustice and environmental injustice.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Just as Dumesle’s narrative foregrounds the structural contingencies of environmental
                  and social justice, it also places contingent affective-aesthetic forces at the heart
                  of its Romantic revolutionary history. As Dumesle interacts with the city, the landscape
                  aesthetics at play in the previous paragraphs that kept the Haitian country at arm’s
                  length now give way to an aesthetic of moving engagement—of conversant, affective
                  exchange. Now moving within the city, his soul is moved all the more, rendered increasingly
                  sensitive to its historical and temporal messaging: <span class="quote">‘Upon arriving in this city, at one time so flourishing, I feel this movement of the
                     soul receptive to receiving the life-saving lessons given by the imposing aspect from

                     reflections that each object gives rise in me transport me to the different epochs
                     whose traces I rediscovered in all that was surrounding me. I remembered [Vincent]
                     Ogé and [Jean-Baptiste] Chavanne, and the time when they appeared on the political

                     </div>’</span> Not only does he see or read “these precious ruins,” but by roaming “its path” he
                  becomes all the more “receptive to receiving the life-saving lessons” that this place
                  can impart to him. That is, his immersive multisensory engagement with the city—not
                  just gazing at it from a distance but standing upon it, feeling it beneath him, being
                  in it and with it—primes him to feel more deeply connected to it; it is as if his
                  surrounds or environs become more akin to communicative, speaking subjects than mute
                  or reified objects, more akin to historical agents than mere historical background
                  for Dumesle as he recounts engaging with the site via multiple sensory registers.
                  The ruins conjure experiential histories and lived memories of famed Haitian revolutionaries
                  (Vincent Ogé and Jean-Baptiste Chavanne), positioning them as key representatives
                  from just one of the “different epochs whose traces [he] rediscovered in all that
                  was surrounding [him].” The narrative has Dumesle enswathed in Haitian history at
                  the precise moment that he stands within the city’s environs and its physical embrace.
                  Feeling there and being there, he is primed to conceptualize Haiti’s temporal and
                  historical frameworks in distinctive ways. These ruins now speak of lessons that will
                  save lives in futurity as much as they locate the lives of Haitian revolutionaries
                  as seeding Haitian “regeneration,” and so Dumesle reads Haiti’s revolution and hard-won
                  independence from France as spurring a renewed Haiti, cut from French colonial rule
                  but still tethered to longer-standing histories lived on and through Haitian grounds.
                  The paragraph fittingly ends with contingent figurations of a thoroughly nationalized
                  earth and naturalized political imaginary. The aesthetic of these ruins and these
                  Haitian grounds all give rise to historical reflections rife with political affect,
                  to deeply preoccupying feelings about Haiti as “political scene” and as political
                  stage wherein anticolonial humans actors and agents fought to “demand the rights [they]
                  hold by nature.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Accounting for the multiple meanings generated by Dumesle’s narrative affords an important
               opportunity to revisit revolutionary Romanticism’s figurations of prosopopoeitic nature
               (i.e., representations of a natural environment that speaks) and how the trope of
               a voice-bearing nature often couples with naturalized political histories and teleologies.
               In the figurative sense, to state that revolutionaries “appeared on the political
               scene to demand the rights [they] hold by nature” means to suggest that the likes
               of Ogé and Chavanne fought to recover an inborn political sovereignty they already
               and necessarily possessed. Read in this way any potential radicality is all but evacuated
               as each revolutionary here simply asks with force for rights inherently bestowed by
               way of a citizen-based, nation-granted version of sovereignty that would more honestly
               go by the name of <span style="font-style:italic">national law</span> but is naturalized here instead as <span style="font-style:italic">natural law</span>—granted by the undeniable fact of their existence in Haiti, a place always already
               understood or imagined as “political scene.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Then when this phrase is read in the literal sense, Dumesle in essence becomes an
                  early advocate of environmental justice, an early arbiter of environmental law. In
                  this case historical figures such as the revolutionaries Ogé and Chavanne fighting
                  on Haitian grounds can be political only after and through nature. These Haitian environs
                  and all attendant human rights or political sovereignties can only ever be granted
                  or held first by the way of nature, through nature, with nature, never without nature.
                  Human beings in this case aren’t automatically or intrinsically instilled with political
                  rights at all nor granted any sort of inherent sovereignty. Rather nature itself is
                  the foundation. Nature makes politics possible just as Bruno Latour will tell us many
                  years later.

                  </div> Read literally and not figuratively, here nature makes possible any and all human
                  politics, rights, nations, revolutions. Only because of the sheer existence not of

                  anyone and all of us, can only ever become able to “demand” or “hold” rights because
                  the natural world makes us and them possible, makes possible most anything we think,
                  feel, encounter, or hold to be true. The tensions produced between these two readings
                  allow Dumesle’s text to simultaneously endorse a transcendental, Enlightenment humanist
                  basis for Haiti’s nation-based political sovereignty while also making the case not
                  for transcendental nature in the spirit of certain Romantic texts but a metaphysics
                  of rights-based politics wherein only the existence of nature could ever begin to
                  serve as the basis of politics and any imagined or constructed sovereign rights. This
                  is not simply the divine and righteous spirit of nature running throughout all things
                  fueling the just revolution, but the physical stuff of nature grounding the revolution,
                  the stuff of nature first setting any constructed political scene.</p>

                  as a sublime compression of historical time. While accounts of sublime nature routinely
                  recount stories of dizzied spectators whose minds cannot approach nature’s profundity
                  and complexity, here Dumesle flips the script and then some. To begin to come to grips
                  at all with “[a]ll the circumstances which have marked the course of this [national,
                  historical, teleological] interval … to unravel this chaos” the narrator must look
                  to sublime Haitian nature replete with its speaking ruins. Thinking with nature, listening
                  to nature, engaging with nature are all prerequisites to making any sense of Haiti’s
                  national memories, histories, and temporalities. Only after accepting the premise
                  that “nothing is silent in nature” can the “eloquence of ruins” carry out its sublime
                  work in “speak[ing] to the soul … [and] mind” in its “secret voice” to thereby explain
                  “the events that the imposing remains confirmed.” In this case, prosopopoeia, as de
                  Man is right to observe, once again proves itself to be “the trope of autobiography,
                  by which one’s name … is made as intelligible and memorable as a face,” and what is
                  given voice—and in so doing granted “face” in this case—is in fact nothing short of
                  the natural world.

               <p>It is worth emphasizing here that across a short sequence of paragraphs Dumesle suggestively
                  advances and intertwines the core arguments of two influential scholarly studies:
                  Trouillot’s <span style="font-style:italic">Silencing the Past</span> and Rob Nixon’s <span style="font-style:italic">Slow Violence</span>. Trouillot’s twentieth-century contention that Haiti’s ruins and others “provide
                  numerous vantage points from which to examine the means and process of historical
                  production” echoes implicit arguments in Dumesle whenever his travel narrative stages
                  Haitian monuments and debris as capable both of being read and bearing testimony.

                  </div>Daut likewise finds parallels between Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> and Trouillot’s <span style="font-style:italic">Silencing the Past</span>, suggesting that “Dumesle was one of the first Haitian writers to try not only to
                  make [Haiti’s] walls speak, but to help them tell their own story.”

                  </div> “In looking to the ‘imposing debris’ of Haiti’s revolution to allow it to tell the
                  story of Haitian independence,” Daut sees “Dumesle anticipat[ing] Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s
                  groundbreaking exploration of the palace at Sans Souci as archive in <span style="font-style:italic">Silencing the Past</span>. Trouillot had noted that the historical resources for telling the history of Haiti
                  could be found equally in the ‘buildings, dead bodies, censuses, [and] monuments,’
                  as they could be located in ‘diaries [and] political boundaries.’”

                  </div> Dumesle’s narrative already “claimed that stonework, bodies, and national monuments
                  could actually speak through him, as if these ‘ruins’ were in fact the primary and
                  most important informants and interlocutors of the Haitian past. In arguing that the
                  ruins spoke to him … Dumesle puts forward a theory of history based in large part
                  on lived memory.”

                  </div> Beyond this, Trouillot follows Dumesle in espousing not just the historical import
                  of lived memories actualized through engaging ruins, cities, and larger landscapes
                  that figurately speak by way of prosopopoeia. Both Dumesle and Trouillot also model
                  a theory of multisensorial history from which lived memories arise. For Trouillot,
                  Haiti’s infrastructural and environmental archive “span[s] a material continuum” (45).
                  Multisensorial affective histories become legible through various sensory modes not
                  reducible to any one avenue of sense perception, be it touch, taste, smell, sound,
                  or sight. Instead and in harmony with Dumesle, Trouillot’s Haitian ruins are “[c]oncrete
                  reminders that the uneven power of historical production is expressed [not simply
                  through immaterial or ideational dimensions of concepts, ideas, words, or narratives
                  but] also through the power to touch, to see, and to feel.”

               <p>In addition to anticipating Trouillot’s project in <span style="font-style:italic">Silencing the Past</span> of reading of Haitian ruins to recover unacknowledged Haitian pasts, <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> presages Nixon’s twenty-first century project in <span style="font-style:italic">Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor. </span>There, Nixon expands running definitions of violence to accommodate the long term
                  and often intergenerational damage done to places and peoples through unchecked and
                  often unacknowledged abuses of power. Nixon defines “slow violence” as a “violence
                  that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is
                  dispersed across time and space, an attritional violence that is not typically viewed
                  as violence at all.”

                  </div> Thinking with nonnormative temporalities proves crucial to this project. “Violence,”
                  he writes, “is customarily conceived as an event or action that is immediate in time,
                  explosive and spectacular in space, and as erupting into instant visibility. We need
                  … to engage a different kind of violence, a violence that is neither spectacular nor
                  instantaneous, but rather incremental and accretive, its calamitous repercussions
                  playing out across a range of temporal scales.”

               <p>When Dumesle surveys the more recent ruins of the Kingdom of Haiti on display at Cap-Haïtien,

                  past, he grapples not only with the more explosive events leading to and proceeding
                  from Haitian independence, but imagines also an even longer arc of Haiti’s difficult
                  history. As if to allude to and to expand the affective force and political resonances
                  of the term <span class="hi">lugubrer</span> from the Haitian Declaration of Independence, the ruins Dumesle consults bear “testimonies
                  that injustice and oppression were the motifs for all the disasters which have ravaged
                  this land,” not just those more spectacular forms of desolation wrought by “the usurper

                  Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> contains sweeping retrospectives and imagines broad futures to give “figurative form
                  to [otherwise] formless threats.” Just as Dumesle draws upon lived memory as well
                  as environmental and infrastructural forms of historical evidence to “discover the
                  causes that prepared [Haiti] and made her course so frightening,” he also leverages
                  such historical recovery work to script new contours for what follows as the “dawning
                  of [Haiti’s] regeneration.” Indeed, elsewhere in <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage </span>dead soldiers buried in the Haitian earth end up righting the historical record to
                  forge new futures: “Dumesle continues by suggesting that calling forth these names
                  [of buried Haitian soldiers] will make them ‘live until the most remote of ages,’
                  and thus that these names alone “will stand as depositions against the fury of the

               <p>At risk of romanticizing Dumesle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage</span> and its place in understanding Haiti’s revolutionary past, Dumesle’s text must not
                  ring more universal than it is. Indeed it foregrounds the lived memories and felt
                  histories of a politically-motivated, vengeful sorrow borne out by giving voice to
                  Haiti’s twinned desolations of place and people during a time of revolution. These
                  contingent desolations arrive in light of both French colonial rule and revolutionary
                  war, and these contingent desolations continue to endure long after. But Dumesle’s
                  text does not and cannot recover a complete history of the Haitian revolutionary past.
                  After all, the travel narrative does wear on its sleeve its relation to the genre
                  of the epic, making overtly clear its nationalist leanings. As Trouillot details,
                  “some former [enslaved people] had refused to submit [not only] to the French … some
                  (often the same) contested the new revolutionary hierarchy.”

                  often “enshrine the successes of elites as a common national heritage, even as those

               ‘savagery,’ as evoked sometimes even in the laudatory writings of Métral, and closer
               to what Daina Ramey Berry might call one of the ‘soul values’ of the formerly enslaved
               peoples of Saint-Domingue. The human soul that lives after death and tells its own
               story out of revenge for the intractable testimony of the colonists provides Vastey
               with an archive that not only intimately involves, but was created, contextualized,
               and preserved by nineteenth-century Haitians themselves” (503).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
