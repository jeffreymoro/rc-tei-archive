               <p>“Pandemic” was Merriam-Webster’s—and everyone else’s—2020 Word of the Year, but the
                  silent partner of any crisis is “contingency.” The unconscionable death toll in the
                  United States is at least partly the result of a failure to prepare for the non-surprise
                  surprise of the pandemic. At the time this introduction was written, we were repeatedly
                  informed that any timetable for a return to normalcy was at the mercy of various,
                  unforeseen contingencies. Moving between reasonable probability and blind chance,
                  contingency as an abstract “three dimensional concept” is the core experience of modernity—contingency
                  promises both freedom from enclosed, controlled systems, and chaos.

                  </div> As the world traveled slowly from the moment of missed chances, the “known unknown,”
                  to the uncertainty of a post-pandemic future—the “unknown unknown,” if you will—the
                  contributors to this volume thought it fitting to by look back to the early nineteenth
                  century, a period during which contingency decisively entered the zone of historical
                  thinking, disrupting progressive historicism with the possibility of uncertain futures.

                           to imagine “the present as a historical age whose apparent trajectory might be disrupted
                           by some dark, unpredictable futurity.” Modernity's Mist: British Romanticism and the
                           Poetics of Anticipation, (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016), 13.</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As Coleridge’s “Fears in Solitude” demonstrates, contingency’s purchase is most evident
                  on the scale of the system. After leaving the productive solitude of the dell, Coleridge’s
                  speaker admonishes the British public that their collective failure of imagination
                  and capitulation to the empty signification of modern print culture has potentially
                  far-reaching consequences. As “spectators and not combatants,” of war, their voyeurism
                  makes them short-sighted, with “no guess/ Anticipative of a wrong unfelt, /No speculation
                  on contingency.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                           J. Jackson, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), lines 96-98.</span></div>
                  </div> But if contingency here seems to refer to the willful moral blindness of “unknown
                  knowns,” the next lines, where Coleridge appears to qualify speculation as “However
                  dim and vague, too vague and dim/ To yield forth a justifying cause,” launch contingency
                  from the realm of probability and into the far murkier waters of the unknowable.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Slavoj Zizek defines “unknown knowns” as the “disavowed beliefs, suppositions, and
                           obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background
                           of our public values.” “What Rumsfeld Doesn’t Know That He Knows About Abu Ghraib”,
                           In These Times, (21 June, 2004) In These Times.</span></div>
                  </div> The inverted anaphora in the line is crucial, emphasizing contingency’s uncertain
                  futurity and rendering it impotent, so that, “forth/ (Stuff’d out with big preamble,
                  holy names/ And adjurations of the God in heaven)/ We sound our mandates for the certain
                  death/ Of thousands and ten thousands!” (99-104) Empty mandates take the place of
                  contingency’s justifications, but if contingency is so dim, can it ever be satisfactorily
                  justified? Coleridge attempts to draw a causal line between the failure to speculate
                  and the potential for future harm, but confronted with the multiple forms of empty
                  signification the poem identifies (“Courts, Committees, Institutions, / Associations,
                  and Societies”), the poem’s speaker does not provide a satisfactory way of overcoming
                  a systemic resistance to contingency.</p>
            </div>
            <p>What follows in this volume are a series of productive speculations on the place of
               contingency in Romantic culture, and on Romanticism’s contingency. We have already
               seen how we might read contingency’s place in Romanticism, but reading Romanticism’s
               contingency means confronting its constitutively elusive and often restrictive linguistic,
               historical and geographical borders. Speculating on a contingent Romanticism also
               means acknowledging long-standing disciplinary crises accelerated by the pandemic’s
               ruthless human and civic toll; specifically, universities’ collective overreliance
               on flexible, contingent faculty, and the ease with which they can be abandoned. In
               the current crisis, the failure of one form of contingency and the overreliance on
               another are pushing academia into places of prophetic fulfillment. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In “Fears of Solitude,” contingency’s elusive, frustrating horizon contrasts the productive
                  interplay of mind with spirit, conjured by the tangible-intangible skylark of the
                  poem’s opening stanzas. The skylark first enters the poem as a counterfactual, a potential
                  sonic presence that both establishes and belies silence. The speaker then imagines
                  a conditional scene of pastoral bliss in which a person “might” lie on the heath and
                  hear the skylark, before finally apostrophizing the bird while in a state of imaginative
                  fecundity. The silent, not-silent dell as “an unsettling site of too many possibilities”
                  is thus premised on the skylark’s contingent place in the speaker’s imagination.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Peter Larkin, “‘Fears in Solitude:’ Reading (from) the Dell,” The Wordsworth Circle,
                           vol. 22, no. 1 (1991), 13.</span></div>
                  </div> In his essay for this volume, Nathan Te Bokkel also explores the contingency of skylarks,
                  and skylarks as a figure for Romanticism’s contingency. Stylistically, figurally,
                  and thematically twining together reflections on mathematics, agriculture, and the
                  ornithological poetics, Te Bokkel’s systrophic essay demonstrates how the ways in
                  which we read Romanticism—as either rupture or continuity, as either metaphysical
                  or grounded—may be more usefully considered as contingent, rather than binary, epistemologies.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is contingency on a large scale, but we cannot forget that contingence, in its
               earliest definitions, invokes closeness, affinity, and the sensorial (from the Latin
               <span style="font-style:italic">con</span>, or “with,” and<span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>, “to touch”). Contingency, then, isn’t merely the unknown or counterfactual, but
               the affective and intimate. Michele Speitz’s essay on the work of the Haitian revolutionary
               poet Charles Hérard Dumesle draws on contingency’s other definition as an affinity,
               or closeness. Identifying an alternative revolutionary spirit in Dumesle’s writings—one
               that is contingent, local, and grounded rather than transcendent and immortal—Speitz
               traces how Dumesle’s coining of the neologism <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span>, “to make sorrowful,” is, in the context of Hatian revolutionary aesthetics, inspirational
               rather than elegiac. Uncovering what Speitz describes as “contingent meanings” in
               Dumesle’s use of <span style="font-style:italic">lugubrer</span> reveals the human and terrestrial traces of colonial trauma.</p>
            <p>Writing on the relationship between unboundedness and fanaticism, Winter Jade Werner’s
               essay on the politics of despatialization in Hogg’s <span style="font-style:italic">Confessions of a Justified Sinner </span>demonstrates a like investment in the tangible and bounded while demonstrating the
               pitfalls of assuming virtuality’s equivalence with parity. Charting the rhetorical
               similarities between the international Protestantism of the early nineteenth century
               and more recent cyber-utopianism, Werner analyzes the novel’s intersection of spatial
               and religious politics. Drawing from Hogg’s deft analysis of fanaticism, Werner demonstrates
               how we, like Hogg, might usefully counter presentist myopia by resisting history’s
               artifactualization in order to reveal the contingencies of the now.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It’s worth remembering that in the June 8, 1809 issue of his weekly paper <span style="font-style:italic">The Friend, </span>Coleridge referred to his poem as “Fears of Solitude,” an error that critics have
                  suggested can be traced to Coleridge’s fear of the disconnect between the language
                  of sensation and communal feeling.

                  </div> In the final essay in this volume, Chris Washington reads Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Matilda</span> as novels in which Shelley establishes loneliness as the original condition of selfhood.
                  Washington demonstrates how temporality in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> is displaced from heliocentric, anthropocentric time into a universal contingent temporality,
                  and argument which is then broadened to make an argument for futurity’s lastness.
                  We are all writing, Washington suggests, for the end of the world.</p>
