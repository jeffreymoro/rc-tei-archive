            <p>This essay reflects, via sorities, on what it means to write Romanticism during a

               <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Mathilda </span>and the recuperative power of ghostly love in her “On Ghosts.” Romanticism is always

               <h2><span class="head">Stranger Things</span></h2>
               <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that being a scholar is a lonely, solitary
                  pursuit and profession, full of long days reading in silent communion (one hopes)
                  with oneself, perhaps with the companionship of some books in want of a critical analysis,
                  or perhaps secluded in library rare books rooms, or chasing down some half-forgotten
                  (or is it half-remembered) quote—or, just as often, sequestered in a room of one’s
                  own at home chasing that flighty, fluttering, friable, flying thing we call writing.
                  Of course, while this, shall we say, romanticized description glints with truth, scholars
                  also know this “self-evident” truth to be largely self-evident rubbish as even the
                  briefest of glances at, say, any monograph’s acknowledgements movingly testifies to
                  the it-takes-a-village ethos of all scholarly writing endeavors. In fact, my first
                  book, <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Revelations</span>, about the post-apocalyptic visions Romanticism conjures up in reaction to fears
                  about the changing climate writers of the period witnessed as a result of 1816’s year
                  without a summer, found a dense colloquy of fellows in its converse with not only
                  the voices long past of the period but with scholars writing in what we might with
                  some honesty call the dread despair of the here and now.</p>
               <p>For what once was in 1816, in terms of climate change disasters and global pandemics,
                  seems to now be again (if it ever were not) and Romantic writing, creative and critical,
                  from then to now, continues to tarry with horrific visions and realities about both
                  the end of the world and the end of the human species. In some ways, Mary Shelley’s
                  pandemic novel, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> (1826), prefigures, or, if you like, prophecies, the moment we are living through
                  with the COVID-19 virus and the disaster of climate change evidenced in, to choose
                  but one example, the mass wild fires in California, Oregon, and Washington in the
                  summer of 2020 that made the sun appear dim red, like in John Martin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Last Man</span> (1849) painting, surrounded by a burnt orange coronal sky. Isolated in our homes
                  for months, we might all even begin to sympathize with Lionel at novel’s end who,
                  alone and at the species’ amort, with vague prospects of finding a companion, takes
                  it upon himself to write down the events of the plague that wiped out, mostly, the
                  human species with the exception, of course, of Lionel himself who sets sail at novel’s
                  end into the ocean’s vast unknown. He sets sail all alone aside from some books, a
                  dog, and a companionate loneliness that compels him to seek out others, to fly forth
                  into a world seemingly well lost to the pandemic’s decimating destruction.</p>
               <p>It is in this theorization of lastness that, I want to argue, Romantic writing of
                  the sort we see in the novel indexes this ontological, singular, accompanying loneliness
                  as life itself.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                        (1)
                        </sup></a> The dilemma of last-person-ness is the dilemma of both epistemological and ontological
                  uncertainty, an uncertainty that stems from what it would mean to know you are the
                  last person. How could one be sure? One would need to be omnipotent, omniscient, and
                  omnipresent, which would mean one were not terrestrial at all, but a god of some variation.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                        (2)
                        </sup></a> Concurrently, since a condition of being alive is that one may become the last person,
                  then being human contains within it the condition that we are all already extinct.
                  If this were not so, then we would be sempiternal. In other words, lastness, the condition
                  of lastness, means we are all already the last man, the last woman, the last genderfluid,
                  or last non-binary person<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                        (3)
                        </sup></a> This reality sorities would also mean that if lastness is a condition of life then
                  so is loneliness in the sense of the specific loneliness lastness is. But the nature
                  of this loneliness, unlike the scholarly imaginary spun out above, is far from self-evident.</p>
               <p>For Lionel’s loneliness, and arguably the loneliness of Romanticism, is best understood
                  as the realization that the hope for any companionship has already long been extinguished
                  by, paradoxically, strangely, companionship’s own ontological nature as loneliness.
                  We might turn to Percy Shelley’s state of nature imaginary in <span style="font-style:italic">A Defence of Poetry </span>(1821) to see how loneliness as sketched out in the novel scrambles the definition
                  of companionship Shelley famously articulates. Shelley writes that “the social sympathies,
                  or those laws from which as from its elements society results, begin to "develope
                  [sic] themselves from the moment that two human beings coexist.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                        (4)
                        </sup></a> When two persons meet in the state of nature, this meeting founds the social sympathies,
                  the laws that we call norms that then engender society itself. Shelley’s vision of
                  the social’s origin unfolds in chronologically temporal fashion—“the future is contained
                  within the present as the plant within the seed”—and something akin to this notion
                  surfaces at the site of the Sybil’s Cave that opens <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man (511)</span> <a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                        (5)
                        </sup></a> Only, in this scene, Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Defence</span>-dictum is dizzied by companionship’s essential, internal, lonely yearning for a futurity
                  whose horizon dims under the shade of the sun that would illuminate it. In 1818, when
                  the two anonymous travelers enter the Cave, they find the scattered, multilingual,
                  fragmentary jottings, the scholium, as it were, on the Sybilline apograph: <span class="quote">‘What appeared to us more astonishing, was that these writings were expressed in various
                     languages: some unknown to my companion, ancient Chaldee, and Egyptian hieroglyphics,
                     old as the Pyramids. Stranger still, some were in modern dialects, English and Italian.
                     <a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a>’</span> The linguistic virtuosity on display in the writing sunders companionate understanding—we
                  might even risk saying social sympathies—entire; the companion, in not knowing the
                  vast array of global languages on display, essentially estranges him or her or theirself
                  from our unnamed, un-gendered narrator and, what’s more, slices and dices the globe
                  into regions of the known and unknown thus constricting, reducing, and compartmentalizing
                  the world as, from the look of it, thoroughly Western in its orientation—a clear colonialist
                  thought process.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                        (1)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Stranger still, estrangement is “stranger still.” For at the moment the narrator,
                  on behalf of the companion, is returned to the Western world from the alienating unknown
                  of Chaldea and Egypt, the revelation unfolds that “modern dialects,” English and Italian,
                  which, presumably, a narrator writing in English in Italy would be aware of, are pronounced
                  “stranger still.” But not because these dialects are unknown: they are strange precisely
                  because they are <span style="font-style:italic">known</span>. The known, for some reason, is stranger than the unknown, the <span style="font-style:italic">heimlich</span> more <span style="font-style:italic">unheimlich</span> than the <span style="font-style:italic">unheimlich</span>. What is homely becomes unhomely and the one who inhabits a home becomes an alien
                  or foreigner in their own home, estranged from others—lonely near those they know,
                  their companions, just like our narrator who, unable to speak with their companion
                  in the foreign languages the companion does not know, Chaldean and Egyptian, or, apparently,
                  the languages the companion does know, English and Italian, no <span style="font-style:italic">longer does</span> speak with the companion. The nature, the being, of companionship, in effect, creates
                  loneliness from the cosmopolitanism the narrative covets but dispossesses in its xenophobic
                  colonialist logic that estranges areas of the globe from each other. After all, the
                  companion disappears because of his or her or their inability to help read the texts,
                  his or her or their inability to learn about others through their language, and the
                  narrator is left alone. In other words, in circumscribing the world, the companion
                  compartmentalizes the narrator into that smallest of units, the solitary self. The
                  consequent effect is that the self of the narrator is not just a solitary self, then,
                  but <span style="font-style:italic">the world itself</span>, the whole world as and in the self. <a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                        (7)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>What is more, the uncanny alienation of the self that makes stranger things of the
                  demotic known, is, it turns out, not grounded in anthropocentric, heliocentric time.
                  For the prophecies themselves are not preterist, prophesying not just events of the
                  future, since we know the narrative of the novel is dated 2073, but also events of
                  the present, “relations of events but lately passed,” and, it follows then, of the
                  past as well since this present is already passed according to our unnamed narrator
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">LM</span>, 7). It is perhaps something like what Barbara Johnson calls the “interminable death
                  of the penultimate,” where the question is not “how to begin speaking of the end,
                  but how to <span style="font-style:italic">finish</span> speaking of it.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                        (8)
                        </sup></a> Or, we might say, when does this novel, indeed, end, if its beginning takes place
                  after its end all while ostensibly taking place <span style="font-style:italic">in the narrator’s own present</span>? If prophecy tells the future here it tells the future not just, as Percy Shelley
                  would have it, as seeded from the present, but the future as both the past and present
                  <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> future <span style="font-style:italic">at once</span>; more, then, the future is taking place simultaneously in the past, present, and
                  a future that have all <span style="font-style:italic">already occurred</span>. The future is taking place in the narrator’s present, because the narrator is writing
                  it, even as that future is already passed, the past. The temporal effect is, thus,
                  stranger still as well since it erases the distinctiveness of heliocentric human time
                  that underwrites human history. What is written on the leaves, then, if we follow
                  this uncanny temporal logic, in this very “moment” of the narrator’s narration, is
                  the story the narrator is telling us and the story of past events <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the story of <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, which is a future the narrator cannot know but is writing, nonetheless, as she,
                  he, or they is simultaneously reading it, <span style="font-style:italic">right now</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                        (9)
                        </sup></a> The narrator writes what the narrator cannot, as yet, know and, what’s more, they
                  know they do not know it, and in not-knowing it, not-knowingly writing it, know it,
                  know the story they do not know. Therefore, we can say that the very thing they write
                  on the leaves <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> weird, non-anthropocentric, non-heliocentric time because it is non-epistemological
                  and non-ontological time. It is a timeless time, timeless because unbound by time,
                  by human time, a different time that we might properly recognize as not <span style="font-style:italic">contingent</span> on human beings (and in this sense, we can follow Peter Melville who says it is an
                  ethical story about “hospitality to come” in the “unpredictable future.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                        (10)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>This type of fortuity is akin to how Quentin Meillassoux describes contingency, which
                  he argues is the only turtles-all-the-way-down foundational natural law that exists,
                  in that the paradoxical problem of what he calls “correlationism”—our anthropocentric
                  idea that we are necessary <span style="font-style:italic">for</span>the world to be—also demonstrates that we may not be necessary for the world. But
                  the novel goes further, stranger, still, than Meillassoux. Contingency in the novel
                  transforms the “dim light” of the sun—that is, anthropocentric time—that casts the
                  shadows in the cave in this Platonic moment and thereby reorients notions of the world
                  by displacing humans from the world, from even being a part of the world. Like the
                  companionable logic that proves un-hospitable to the very notion of companionability,
                  the loneliness inherent in the enclosed human world makes humans exorbitant to the
                  world. A human is an enclosed world but not of the world, not indubitably connected
                  to the world but rather contingent, just a hanger-on, riding out onto the sea, an
                  indifferent sea, like Lionel. No longer oriented to the world, humans shall have to
                  wander all alone looking for others, other human beings, to anchor themselves, as
                  if they are lost vessels at sea bidding their sails search and search (to crib a phrase
                  from Nietzsche), for some island’s shore, some other person. Humans, it turns out,
                  accustomed to those social sympathies, think, believe, feel, that they need them.
                  We might even say this is why I am writing this, this essay, this Romanticism in,
                  at, of the end of the world.</p>
               <p>In this sense, what I am calling “writing Romanticism” in this essay—which is also
                  this essay, perhaps—as it confronts fortuity and futurity in our “moment,” realizes
                  that if amity contains within it its own loneliness, then this realization concurrently
                  negates the possibility of any human progress or achievement and, even, we see, negates
                  any human history at all. Samantha Webb argues that “with his departure from Rome,
                  Lionel Verney writes himself out of human history, only to be reinscribed into it
                  by the voice of the Cumaean Sibyl and recuperated as history by the editor.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

                  <span style="font-style:italic">completely</span> in regard to and from human history. The Last Man is about writing at the end of
                  the world as it is for humans (and, really, European, white humans, although the novel

                  of human history from outside of human history.</p>
               <p>What the novel shows us, then, strangely, or stranger still, in illustrating this
                  contingent non-anthropocentric, non-heliocentric time, is that the self is a stranger
                  thing too. Always interested in the solitary and the lonely, the creature in <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, the leper and Beatrice in <span style="font-style:italic">Valperga</span>, the mortal immortal in “The Mortal Immortal,” to name an exiguous few, Shelley’s
                  point is not, finally, that companionship only leads to loneliness but that each person
                  is always already riven with loneliness, a condition of selfhood, and the self’s only
                  companionship is loneliness. Loneliness becomes a case not of <span style="font-style:italic">noli me tangere </span>but <span style="font-style:italic">non est potis contingere</span>: it is not possible to make contact, to connect; there is no complimentary or complementary
                  togetherness possible. The search for the other that plays out in all of her work
                  stages the disorientation of the human, to show us how each person is an isolated
                  world, a last person. Moreover, since every human is a world they are, or, more accurately,
                  have been, perforce, <span style="font-style:italic">lonely and alone at the end of the world for their whole lives and always will be</span>. And this is ontologically true, at least as Shelley sees it, for a last man, a last
                  woman, a last non-binary person. It is in this regard that we can say that <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> is not some futuristic allegory but an ontological explanation of how a self is always
                  alone in the world, the world of the both the self and the world outside the self
                  that is not the self, the world.</p>
               <p>The consequences of Shelley’s a-temporal futurity, this loneliness whose only companion
                  is ontological loneliness, this loneliness that disorients the world of the self from
                  the world, are severe and sadness-making in their totality and infinity. Shelley makes
                  writing, writing Romanticism, a form of autobiography (although not, I think, in the
                  sense commonly meant, whether biographical or pyschobiographical). <a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                        (12)
                        </sup></a> Alone with loneliness, life, for any individual, means that, as we see in the novel’s
                  primal scene of writing in the Sybil’s Cave, every life, like the narrator’s and Lionel’s,
                  is autobiographical but in the sense of autobiography in the literal sense of self-life-writing.
                  But it is an autobiographical writing that is, yes, stranger still. Like the narrator,
                  like Lionel (who are, who are we kidding, if we follow the novel’s logic, the same
                  person, us), we are all worlds, all alone, and just as the pandemic does in the novel,
                  the coronavirus confronts us with the terrifying truth of contingency, that all writing
                  is therefore autobiographical since it cannot be otherwise than lonely and that all
                  writing is therefore a writing of the self, that is to say, the end of the world.
                  It is the writing of the self that is already not there and whose writing continues
                  to make the self disappear within each moment of that writing since each moment is
                  lastness, the end, death, even as that lastness is interminable in life. Romanticism
                  is always writing at and about the end of the world.</p>

               <p>We can see something of how Shelley’s phenomenology—this loneliness that lastness
                  is—presents in Derrida’s late lectures. The following is “one of the thousand directions”
                  in which he would be “tempted to interpret the last line of a short and great poem
                  by Celan”: <span class="quote">‘Between my world, the ‘my world,’ what I call ‘my world’—and there is no other for
                     me, as any other world is part of it—between my world and any other world there is
                     first the space and the time of an infinite difference, an interruption that is incommensurable
                     with all attempts to make a passage, a bridge…There is no world, only islands.<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                           (13)
                           </sup></a>’</span> J. Hillis Miller finds this passage to be axiomatic in Derrida’s work, at odds with
                  most of continental philosophy (Heidegger, Levinas, Blanchot, etc.) in that it severs
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Dasein</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mitsein</span>. In the continental tradition, because to be in the world necessarily places people
                  in relation to other subjects, “to be there” is to “be with,” existentially and phenomenologically
                  speaking. For Miller, though, Derrida’s Celan-passage provides concrete evidence that
                  when Derrida writes, elsewhere, "<span style="font-style:italic">tout autre est tout autre</span>,” “every other is wholly other,” <span style="font-style:italic">he means it absolutely</span>. On Miller’s reading, for Derrida, unlike John Donne (“no man is an island”) and
                  Jon Bon Jovi (“they say that no man is an island”), every person is an island, their
                  own personal version of Robinson Crusoe’s enisled-ness (Defoe’s novel is one of two
                  texts under discussion in Derrida’s late seminar), separated from all the other islands.
                  And yet, Derrida’s thoughts on <span style="font-style:italic">Dasein</span> tread well beyond Miller’s reading (Derrida says this is but one way he would interpret
                  Celan after all).</p>
               <p>For Derrida, each individual is a world, an island in the world, but also its own
                  world, hence, the “individual death I’ve often said was each time <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> end of <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> world, <span style="font-style:italic">the </span>end, the whole end of <span style="font-style:italic">the </span> world. . . the end of the world in general, the absolute end of the world” (<span style="font-style:italic">BS </span>II, 260). It is the death of an enclosed world of that person, the world they alone
                  know and we can never fully know, but the death of a world we witness and know only
                  through the fact that we cannot phenomenologically know it: “no one will ever be able
                  to demonstrate…that two human beings, you and I for example, inhabit the same world,
                  that the world is one and the same thing for both of us” (<span style="font-style:italic">BS </span>II, 265). If each person is a world, forever unconnected from other worlds in existential
                  solitude, then death, for each person, is the death of not only their world but the
                  death of a whole world for others as well. Lionel’s allusion is an apt one in this
                  regard: “for a moment I compared myself to that monarch of the waste—Robinson Crusoe.
                  We had been both thrown companionless—he on the shore of a desolate island: I on that
                  of a desolate world (<span style="font-style:italic">LM</span>, 366). Robinson Crusoe, as Lionel distinguishes him, theorizes each life as an island
                  that one may yet escape from (as Crusoe, arguably, does) and find another shore, another
                  person, who one can connect with whereas Lionel theorizes each life as a world, one
                  for whom no destinational shore is possible—he sails off at the end, as he says, in
                  search of a person, a world.</p>
               <p>We can see in Derrida two possible consequences of this a-straitened, a- phenomenological
                  worlding. The first, as Derrida puts it in <span style="font-style:italic">A Taste for the Secret</span>, is that we understand that <span class="quote">‘somehow, this secret that we speak of but are unable to say is, paradoxically. .
                     . the best-shared thing in the world; but it is the sharing of what is not shared:
                     we know in common that we have nothing in common. There may be an unlimited consensus
                     on the subject, but the consensus is of no use, since it is a consensus on the fact
                     that the singular is singular, that the other is other, that <span style="font-style:italic">tout autre est tout autre</span> . . . everything that exist shares the unshareable. <a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                           (14)
                           </sup></a>’</span> The shared, unshareable secret that is us, that is to say, you, an individual, means
                  only that, again, every other is wholly other and a consensus to a shared secret is
                  mere pretension since that secret, what is inside the self, can never be shared <span style="font-style:italic">absolutely</span> without obliterating the self. It follows, then, that the “I” is defined by the other,
                  <span style="font-style:italic">oriented </span>by the other, we might say: <span class="quote">‘that is what the self is, that is what I am, what the I is, whether I am there or
                     not. The other, the others, that is the very thing that survives me, that is called
                     to survive me and that I call the other inasmuch as it is called, in advance, to survive
                     me, structurally my survivor. Not my survivor, the survivor of me, the <span style="font-style:italic">there</span> beyond my life (<span style="font-style:italic">BS</span> II, 131).’</span> The survival that comes after our death is both the living other now and the survival
                  that pre-exists our death in that other who survives us in the sense of the “there
                  beyond my life” in that the prolepsis of my life is already taking place in my life
                  in the other before the there is there…and after the there (before and after <span style="font-style:italic">Dasein</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mitsein</span>, that is to say).</p>
               <p>This then is how Shelley—(but, what would it mean to say, to say so secretly, bashfully,
                  as if this is my secret, I)—would interpret Derrida. What can, does, occur between
                  two people, in love, say, who claim to share intimate and extimate feelings and experiences,
                  is, therefore, fictional: <span class="quote">‘. . . where there is no world . . . what I must do, with you and carrying you, is
                     make it that there be precisely a world, just a world, if not a just world. . . to
                     make as if. . . I made the world come in the world, as though there ought to be a
                     world where presently there is none, to make the gift or present of this as if come
                     up poetically, which is the only thing that…can make it possible that I can live or
                     had let you live, enjoy or have or let you enjoy, to carry you for a few moments without
                     anything happening and leaving a trace in the world, that belongs to the world, without
                     a trace left or retained in the world that is going away. . . leaving no trace, a
                     world that has forever been going to leave and has just left, going away with no trace,
                     the trace becoming trace only by being able to erase itself (<span style="font-style:italic">BS</span> II, 268).’</span> The presence of your absence that is in me, and the presence of my absent present
                  in you, in you, the presence of my presence that is not there, is the trace. This
                  is the poem or fiction of a shared life that embraces the other across the shores
                  even as the poem notes in its lines the death of the other who holds it in this life,
                  the survivor of the “I,” of me, who will survive me with there being a trace of me
                  in them. For only without the trace of me remaining, in you, always already in you,
                  will there have been a <span style="font-style:italic">possibility</span> of a world, of an “I,” that is not enclosed. Counter-intuitively, paradoxically,
                  the trace, the survivance of me in the other, means that I am a wholly separated world;
                  therefore only the annihilation of that trace, of me, after my death—that is, only
                  if that trace, my memory in you did not exist—<span style="font-style:italic">would it mean that I was not a wholly enclosed world</span>, any more than you are. But the erasure of that trace, that trace of me in you, would
                  also mean the death of you, would only happen on your death, and thus mean the death
                  of the survivance of me.</p>
               <p>The paradox is that the trace of me that survives, my name or memory in your memory,
                  is proof that I existed, as you did, do, wholly apart, since the trace is the other
                  come from without, me in you and you in me, but never the experience, a shared experience,
                  in you of me, of me in you, of my absolute being in you, or you in me. If it were
                  otherwise, the “I” that is me, and the “I” that is you, would be shattered, un-enclosed,
                  not an “I.” It would belong to, be, in another. It is in that sense, that the sense
                  in which that trace of me only exists, a ghost of me and not me, the I that is me
                  in you, would have to not exist in order for there not to be separate worlds. But
                  if that were so, if neither of us existed as separate worlds, if we were to touch
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">contingere</span> and not <span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>), be in the other, experience the other in the other, experience the other’s secret,
                  we would not be an “I” but some smoorged together island nation: we would not exist
                  as two people who love each other but as one world inseparable and hence not in love
                  because not “in” at all but rather within without the without within needs to be truly
                  without within. <span style="font-style:italic">Only by being apart can we be together.</span> Only by being lonely can one be together even if that loneliness never becomes togetherness
                  (<span style="font-style:italic">non est potis contingere</span>) in terms of a shared experience of a common world, of each other. There are only
                  worlds.</p>
               <p>That lonely companionship is a poem is why Derrida says that "the book lives its beautiful
                  death” (<span style="font-style:italic">BS</span> II, 130). In autobiographical writing, which is to say writing, the “I” encloses
                  the secret, the secret of us, or tries to and in so doing, leaves that trace behind
                  in the book. “Like every trace,” then, Derrida writes, “a book, the survivance of
                  a book, from its first moment on, is a living-dead machine, surviving, the body of
                  a thing buried in a library, a bookstore, in cellars, urns, drowned in the worldwide
                  waves of a Web, etc., but a dead thing that resuscitates each time…the breath of the
                  other. . . makes it live again by animating it” (<span style="font-style:italic">BS</span>II, 131). Lionel’s book is <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, given new life by the narrator who imparts it with a new breath, gives this death,
                  this trace of life, a life. Late in the novel, he finds writing materials and declares,
                  “I also will write a book, I cried” (<span style="font-style:italic">LM</span>, 380). His questions that follow this decision, though, have an explicitly Derridean
                  ring to them: “for whom to read?—to whom dedicated?” (<span style="font-style:italic">LM</span>, 380).</p>
               <p>Who indeed? His imagined addressee demonstrates the loneliness that inheres in the
                  self of autobiographical writing as its trace plays out in the writing that would,
                  if it could, speak to the other: “DEDICATION / TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD. / SHADOWS,
                  ARISE, AND READ YOUR FALL! / BEHOLD THE HISTORY OF THE / LAST MAN” (<span style="font-style:italic">LM </span>, 380). The inscription does not address some theoretical remnants who will bestir
                  a new population, even as he questions the possibility of that shortly thereafter—“yet,
                  will not this world be re-peopled, and the children of a saved pair of lovers, in
                  some to me unknown and unattainable seclusion. . .?”—but to the dead, to those already
                  gone of whom he, and his writing, his book, are the survivance (<span style="font-style:italic">LM</span>, 380). Lionel, the last man, is the trace of the other he writes to, for, in, this
                  inscription to a dead that cannot ever read this trace. His history erases itself
                  in the very writing of it since he theorizes writing as reading. <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>’s frame narrator also writes the narrative as they read it, which means, then, the
                  very book they are reading, <span style="font-style:italic">we are reading</span>, is being erased, a palimpsest, under the writing of the narrator and that also announces
                  our death, the end of the world that is—us, the reader, in the narrative’s logic.
                  There is no lastness, only a lonely firstness contingent and absolute on the teeter
                  of lastness of which we were and are.</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> is the autobiography of Lionel who does not write it but whose survivance as a trace
                  is blown into life as the dying embers of a fire by the narrator. This would mean,
                  could we say, can we say, that writing to anyone, that writing this essay, reminds
                  of the loneliness of lastness that is the self whose writing will always be autobiographical
                  and always read by another? And then, and then, any autobiography would be, perforce,
                  written by the other, our world, us, permanently enclosed in the self that even writing
                  erases in the reading that is writing by the other? To whom do we write? To whom dedicated?
                  To the trace of the self, that still that remains, in the other who will never know,
                  feel, experience, you as anything other than a trace evanescing under its own, their,

                  is actually many “strangers.” That multiplicative effect inflating the one to the
                  many indicates how Matilda sees herself as a world alone and lonely by nature, alone
                  by herself by her self. If Lionel is ambiguously gendered as Lisa Hopkins and Anne
                  Mellor point out (and if the novel plays with gender in other ways as Fuson Wang notes)

                        </sup></a> The autobiographical history Matilda produces at the end of her life, her world,
                  unlike Lionel’s, takes a different written form then. While Lionel’s process of writing
                  the self is the erasure of the self in the act of writing, Matilda’s pen-to-paper
                  does the reverse and writes her death to both produce and efface her life and to kill
                  her self outside of a cisheteropatriachcal system that would kill her love. The “history…had
                  better die with me” even as, in this writing that will be read by strangers, that
                  erasure of life gives life to her life in the other, the companion, in Woodville.
                  Matilda produces the very trace she must produce in order to die even though she had
                  rather annul that life, that trace, altogether.</p>
               <p>Further complicating this last-woman-ness is the novel’s incestuous family romance
                  between Matilda and her father that traffics in gender fluidity. As scholar Julia
                  Ftacek argues in her reading of Byron’s <span style="font-style:italic">Manfred</span>, the poem relies thoroughly on trans tropes for its being and meaning. According
                  to Ftacek, Manfred sees in his sister, Astarte, himself and she in him; that is, Manfred
                  sees in Astarte the female ideal of himself and his love for her is actually an expression
                  of his transgender desire to be a woman, that woman that he sees in this feminine
                  version, this—please forgive me Ftacek—Womanfred. <span style="font-style:italic">Matilda</span> stages a similar logic. <a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                        (17)
                        </sup></a> Their first physical meeting is colored in Shelley’s familiar, familiarizing litoral
                  language: “I jumped into the boat, and well accustomed to such feats, I pushed it
                  from the shore, and exerted all my strength to row swiftly across” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 160). Unlike the lover islands of Matthew Arnold’s “To Marguerite” who remain enisled
                  (“Yes! On the sea of life enisled” [1]), here one island appears to cross the shores
                  and merge with the other, the daughter to the father. Her father, similarly, has written
                  earlier that he must leave England, “that unhappy island, where every thing breathes
                  <span style="font-style:italic">her</span> spirit,” after the death of her mother (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 155). His return locates that mother’s spirit in Matilda (“my father has often told
                  me I looked more like a spirit than a human maid” [<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 159]), though, and he falls in love with her, his secret to which he cannot give
                  expression until pushed to do so by Matilda. He sees in her, in other words, the trace
                  of the mother but also, the trace of himself as a woman. Desire can sometimes be to
                  possess and to be that which one wants to possess—to be that person that one desires.
                  His face is also in his child. Because as Matilda reveals later after his death, this
                  is no simple familial resemblance: “I was surrounded by my female relations, but they
                  were all of them nearly strangers to me” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 184). Instead, in her relation with her father, a different type of strangeness
                  persists. As Matilda describes it, “in all this there was a strangeness that attracted
                  and enchanted me” because “I was all that he had to love on earth” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162). The strangeness, of course, is, on one hand, the unspoken incestuous secret
                  of that love that cannot be spoken on earth (<span style="font-style:italic">Manfred’s Hamlet</span> epigraph is coincidentally quite apt: “There are more things on heaven and earth,
                  Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy”). It is narcissistic and reveals
                  itself as Matilda desiring both her father and to be her father and he her. On the
                  other hand, it is the secret of the other in the other that neither of them know because
                  if it were known to them <span style="font-style:italic">it would not be a secret</span>. <a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">

                  the other and the world of the self.</p>
               <p>In that the secret is and maintains (maintains in its is-ing and is-ing in its maintenance)
                  their love for to speak it would also annihilate their love, it must remain secret,
                  or else it exposes the fact that they are two worlds destined to never be otherwise
                  than lonely in their experience of the other in their own self. Shelly uses the incest
                  narrative to encrypt the secret of love itself in that by saying incest she does not
                  have to say “I love you.” “You have a secret grief that destroys us both,” Matilda
                  tells her father, and “you must permit me to win this secret from you” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 171). Giving voice to it, as she does shortly after this exhortation, forcefully
                  announces the nature of their lonely en-worldling: “I was left on a barren rock; a
                  wide ocean of despair rolled around me. . .” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 163). As she writes, “who can be more solitary in a crowd than one whose own history
                  is known to no living soul. There was too deep a horror in my take for confidence;
                  I was on earth the sole depositary of my own secret” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 185). With her father’s death, the secret that defined his existence, his being—his
                  love for him in her—transfers to her and she can give no voice to it or she will be
                  obliterated. At the same time, she now knows the secret—that he loved him in her and
                  she in him—so it is no longer a secret to her but a revelation as long as she keeps
                  it hidden in her—she does not give voice to it, to her self. Her history, his history,
                  is known “to no living soul” but it is also in this moment of writing it, this moment
                  that is also after she is on earth as it is being read, that she makes it known to
                  Woodville who will read (is reading) this history and, unlike the narrator in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, not take part in writing it but through his reading it preserves the secret in his
                  self. The secret, the absolute secret, the secret of the self that Lionel can never
                  impart, moves between worlds in <span style="font-style:italic">Matilda</span>, and it is told again and again.</p>
               <p>This transference of the secret, of the trace, through writing, heralds how Matilda
                  thinks of lastness’s loneliness as what begets and is life precisely because it is
                  beyond life (a life beyond life, a death in life, your life as death in the other).
                  She describes their initial shore-crossing encounter “as if I were recreated and had
                  about me all the freshness and life of a new being” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162). When they embrace in union at the lakefront, they engender the secret that
                  they do not know in this new fiction of new being. After his death, she writes, “a
                  strange idea seized me; a person must have felt all the agonies of doubt concerning
                  the life and death of one who is the whole world to them before they can enter into
                  my feelings” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 182). This strange idea, a much stranger idea than the strangeness of loneliness
                  Lionel’s Romanticism is, signifies the secret no one else can know since the world
                  that is her father exists now only in her even though it is not him or his own experience
                  of him as himself or him self; thus, it continues as a secret so strange it estranges
                  her from it. She never explicitly gives voice to this secret in the rest of the novel:
                  she loves him too. Instead, she can only say “in truth I am in love with death. .
                  .” and “alone it will unite me to my father when in an eternal mental union we shall
                  never part” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 208). And this <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>the truth because the death she is in love with is her own death that takes with her
                  trace that is him inside her, the secret that she loves him, and the trace, because
                  she is also in him, that is her, her self. As she puts it, “My life has been before
                  as a pleasing country rill, never destined to leave its native fields, but when its
                  task was fulfilled quietly to be absorbed, and leave no trace” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162). For Matilda to die, she must pass the secret on to Woodville, the trace of
                  her father in her that keeps them both alive in survivance. For Matilda to die, she
                  must live in the writing of her writing of her life, her autobiography.</p>
               <p>The revenant of Matilda’s and her father’s love thus takes on disembodied life in
                  their death, in a writing whose survivance pulses with a life that could never be
                  in order to contain the love that would. “Love never woke again,” she reflects, but
                  “its ghost, ever hovering over my father’s grave, alone survived” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 184). As an ephemeral being and nothingness at once, love exists as this ghostly
                  imprint of life in the world within the closed pages of the book Woodville opens to
                  read.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Love is a ghost</span></h2>
               <p>As does the creature in <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, Matilda longs for an apocalypse, a return to Paradise. “Is it not strange that grief
                  should quickly follow so divine a happiness?” Matilda asks, a lament whose paradox
                  plays out on the very nature of the self that misunderstands itself as defined through
                  this supposedly grounding division of nature and culture (<span style="font-style:italic">M </span>, 162). Matilda finds herself, that is, her world, disorientated: “I had no idea that
                  misery could arise from love and this lesson that all at last must learn was taught
                  me in a manner few are obliged to receive it” (<span style="font-style:italic">M, </span>162). Misery arises, it orients, her to this new realization of how love works in
                  and through the other. She refers to “those few short months of Paradisiacal bliss”
                  in which she “disobeyed no command…ate no apple, and yet…was ruthlessly driven from
                  it” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162). The rewriting of the myth here places the firstness of their lastness on her
                  father: “Alas! My companion did, and I was precipitated in his fall. But I wander
                  from my relation” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162). For her father, in this riverrun past Eve and Adam, had a taste for the secret,
                  the forbidden secret, the secret of Matilda, which is to say, a taste for the knowledge
                  of Matilda’s self (it might be well here to recall that in Latin “sapere” means both
                  “to taste” and “to know).</p>
               <p>The incestuous logic of the novel suggests that this taste for the secret of the other
                  is also always a misrecognized taste for the self in the other. Driven by the riven
                  river-run loneliness of the self whose companion is always the trace of the self in
                  the other, love is the temptation to narcissism (make me one like myself the creature
                  says in <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>) to finding the other within the self, one’s self. To taste of it, then, destroys
                  it because it shares what absolutely must not be shared to remain what it is. The
                  self is always already defined by the need, the necessity, the demand to be lonely,
                  to keep the secret of the self sacred and safe from any paradise whether it is envisioned
                  as a return to an embowering nature or as a fast forward to a utopian society. The
                  novel dramatizes this ontological argument through incest since the father literally
                  sees the trace of himself in Matilda. That he seeks to partake of it, to partake of
                  the self he sees in that other, is the process that the novel suggests is what love
                  is precisely because, conversely, you also find the other in you. The secret that
                  is your self is also the love for that other as borne out through your narcissism.
                  In the lonely world of the self one finds a companion who is the other who is you,
                  but not like the narcissus palely gleaming, forever loitering on the Styx.</p>
               <p>At this point in the novel, early in the novel, her father has already died although
                  we have not, yet, as readers, arrived at that knowledge and so we miss, by Matilda’s
                  autobiographical design, that she tells us her secret, tells us her self, gives us
                  her secret, gives us her self, and so dies right in front of us on the page. “But
                  I wander from my relation,” she writes, a cunning pun, a kind of <span style="font-style:italic">hapax legomenon</span>, that disguises the very thing that it articulates (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 162).<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">
                        (21)
                        </sup></a> Her relation is, of course, the relation of her tale in this digression into reflections
                  on the mootness of yearning for a paradise lost. It is also her divulging that she
                  wanders now from her relation, from her father, and from her romantic love for him—and
                  her self. As a reference to the writing, making this statement indicates as well that
                  this writing, this autobiography, divulges the secret of the self. But that Matilda
                  cannot actually say “I love him” other than through a pun, paradoxically evidences
                  the fact that she loves him because to say it would betray it and betray the self.
                  To say what is forbidden tastes of it. Nonetheless, the secret must be told since
                  as long as she holds it, does not voice it, she remains alive and the trace of her
                  father in her remains alive as well. She has to say what she cannot say or betray
                  in order to betray it and say it, in order to die. But she can’t say it.</p>
               <p>Without her speaking it on her own behalf, Matilda discloses her love for her father
                  in a paranomasia that allows her to say in writing, after her death, what she could
                  not say in life. The life-writing allows her to do the very thing that causes her
                  death: voice her self. In that sense, then, since what she also gives voice to is
                  her self, her secret that is the self, is her romantic love for her father, this means
                  that her self is that love. The secret of the self, and the secret of the love, are
                  the same. “Love never woke again” and “its ghost, ever hovering over my father’s grave”
                  that “alone survived” is the survivance of that love, which also means that the ghost
                  is the trace of the other in the other. Which, in turn, means that the self is only
                  ever the trace of the other for whom that other can only ever be the other despite
                  that the other’s very self is the love the self has for that other that the self finds
                  when they find that other within their own self. If the other did not remain the other
                  absolutely, then there would be only the self who never finds that trace of the other
                  in their self. There would not be love, not even a ghost. (And if I can’t bring myself
                  to say it, then you already know my secret. If I die, I’ll live it th(r)ough. There
                  is that ghost of a chance, a contingency, that a hauntology, a love, revives to become

               <p>“Yet is it true that we do not believe in ghosts?” Shelley asks in her short reflection,
                  “On Ghosts” (1824). There she speculates that the modern world has lost all the wonders
                  and glories of the former: <span class="quote">‘The antediluvian world, strode over by mammoths, preyed upon by the megatherion,

                  of dullness, we find, rather, that Shelley believes in the mythologies of the Golden
                  Age as reality. Nor, for that matter, is this a willed belief parlayed in a skepticism
                  that announces doubt about the very belief it purports to disbelieve in in the moment
                  it states its belief, as in <span style="font-style:italic">The X-Files</span>’s “I want to believe.” Instead, the watery palaces of Atlantis in the pages of Plato’s
                  <span style="font-style:italic">Timaeus</span>, the El Dorado sub-aurum, and the enchanting perils that lullaby Odysseus finally
                  to a pleasurable sleep after his very long flight delay, have all been swept away,
                  kept alive now only in the poems that believe in them (books dying their beautiful
                  death). The “islands of bliss” that “lay” “far out at sea” recall the straitened water
                  worlds of all of her works. Yet, here, those islands have already been destroyed—because
                  we do not believe in ghosts!</p>
               <p>If this logic sounds odder, stranger, still, we might say, then, that the reason for
                  this oddity lies in the fact that Shelley means that the Golden Age is Percy Shelley,
                  and those worlds, those real worlds, of creative plenitude and possibility, have died
                  with him. Or, to put it differently, she thinks love has died out from the world because
                  we have stopped believing in it, stopped believing in ghosts! Shelley’s logic, which
                  is the logic of dream work, basks in tautology as an exorbitant antidote to the logical
                  poison of a reality denuded of the spectral hauntology of ghosts. We have stopped
                  believing in love because we have stopped believing in ghosts, which is to say we
                  have stopped believing in love! She exploits this figure as neither dream nor reality
                  but both <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> to illustrate the inexplicable, con-fusing (<span style="font-style:italic">non est potis contingere</span>), lonely nature of dreaming and of ghosts, which move in, and move in the world,
                  through the logic of unhomely knowingness: <span class="quote">‘For my own part, I never saw a ghost except once in a dream. I feared it in my sleep;
                     I awoke trembling, and lights and the speech of others could hardly dissipate my fear.
                     Some years ago I lost a friend, and a few months afterwards visited the house where
                     I had last seen him. It was deserted, and though in the midst of a city, its vast
                     halls and spacious apartments occasioned the same sense of loneliness as if it had
                     been situated on an uninhabited heath. I walked through the vacant chambers by twilight,
                     and none save I awakened the echoes of their pavement. …He had been there; his living
                     frame had been caged by those walls, his breath had mingled with that atmosphere,
                     his step had been on those stones, I thought:—the earth is a tomb, the gaudy sky a
                     vault, we but walking corpses. The wind rising in the east rushed through the open
                     casements, making them shake;—methought, I heard, I felt—I know not what—but I trembled.
                     To have seen him but for a moment, I would have knelt until the stones had been worn
                     by the impress, so I told myself, and so I knew a moment after, but then I trembled,
                     awe-struck and fearful. Wherefore?<a class="note_back" href="#Note24" id="Note24_return"><sup class="super">
                           (23)
                           </sup></a>’</span> In this passage, which haunts itself on the being of loneliness, Shelley refuses
                  to say the secret, to identify the lost friend—an unspoken but very pronounced, even
                  unspoken, spooky, clue—to say how to know what she means when she claims not to know
                  what she knows. She elides the experience entirely, in fact, stating at first that
                  this is a dream she awoke from before (dis)associating the experience with a former
                  visit to a house where she had last seen the lost friend, which suggests it is not
                  a dream but the recounting of a life memory. Dreams and reality are fused here, which
                  also makes the nature of the hauntology circumspect if not suspect. Did she see the
                  ghost in her dream? Or at the house? Quite the opposite, she writes, “to have seen
                  him” as if to say she has not. But to see a ghost would be to have seen and not seen
                  “him” as he is an apparition, the phantom that appears as the real, like the dream
                  that recalls imperfectly the life memory. Yet, simultaneously, she writes “I would
                  have knelt until the stones had been worn by the impress,” which gives the impression
                  that she <span style="font-style:italic">did not see him</span> because she would have knelt in order to make him appear.</p>
               <p>In the tautological, impossible terms of her hauntology, then, Shelley affirms that
                  <span style="font-style:italic">she did see him</span>—as a ghost. That she sees the ghost, and cannot, will not, say, who it is, likewise
                  affirms the identity of his secret identity: Percy Shelley. She will not speak his
                  name because to do so is to abolish their love—to say the secret. This ghostly visitation—skewing
                  the borders of fantasy and reality—“bestows on the feeling heart”—that heart that
                  loves, that is—“a belief.” The belief in ghosts. That society can no longer see the
                  gleaming, golden fields of Hesperides’s apples means it no longer has a taste for
                  the secret, for love of the other. For love. Because it does not, cannot, know, it
                  if it were ever to be (spoken).</p>
               <p>Like the plots of Shelley’s novels the liter(or)al loneliness of the COVID-19 pandemic
                  highlights the reality of the lyric loneliness of life for Shelley. “I want to see
                  you—and soon—I have a world to say to you,” Shelley’s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft,
                  writes to her lover, William Godwin.<a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">
                        (24)
                        </sup></a> I have a world to say to you? For whom to read? To whom dedicated? Indeed, as Shelley
                  well knows, the self is a world with much to say, the secret it cannot say, even to
                  the other. Forced to write, at home, to write alone, to write as writing always is,
                  as writing is not, the COVID-19 crisis reminds us, in this writing of Romanticism
                  that is always writing at the end of the world for that is what writing is, that we
                  have always been radically contingent on loneliness because that is what the self
                  is. To write the self in language is to expose the self’s secret. To write autobiographically,
                  to write, to write this, erases the self in the very trace of its imprint on the page.
                  I have a world to say to you? To whom dedicated? If every other is wholly other, and
                  every other is a world forever unreachable from this shore to their, then with what
                  purpose do you, I, write to them? To write to them, to write to them of the secret,
                  is to expose it, to destroy it, to destroy the self in the life writing of the self.
                  The self can only, only does, live in them, as the trace of you in survivance, not
                  even a ghost while the ghost of love wanders all alone waiting to be not seen (to
                  be seen) what a self is.</p>
               <p>Referencing Isaiah 11:7, Matilda asks on the last page of her self-less autobiography,
                  “why does my heart heave with the vain endeavor to cast aside the bitter anguish that
                  covers it ‘as the water covers the sea’” (<span style="font-style:italic">M</span>, 210)? If one were to pose that question, about waters that are islands, that know
                  the names of shores, that ask you to be, but be how who you are, over there, what
                  is that to say about the heart oh covered by the selfless sea? And what would Shelley,
                  to this, say, and would it be waving or drowning? Would she be able to say, yes, yes,
                  I will, a contingent loneliness of the self that it identifies, exposes, explores,
                  a sea for being, a Lionel and Matilda and creature Halloween party adrift finally
                  finding home? If Shelley were to answer, even in her ghostly books dying a beautiful
                  death I think, I think, perhaps, she might say the heart as the world, her world as
                  her heart, and the heart of Percy I kept, the water that covered that heart, that
                  heart you broke, that heart I kept, that heart that is yours, the ghost that now lives
                  as the love of that heart in a writing too knowing in its unknowingness of its secret
                  to speak it, to kill that love, to drown it. I believe in ghosts. I think. I think
                  then, that if we were to ask Shelley what she meant, what this, her strange autobiography
                  on autobiography means,she wouldn’t say, at all, of all her wanderers, Lionel, Matilda,
                  the creature, Beatrice, Perkin, me, you, that they are not set sail on the sea, like
                  one of Percy’s forlornly hopeful paper boats shoved off from the shore, capable of
                  finding that other world, but rather that they are the sea, what keeps the worlds
                  apart because there are only worlds, and thus there is the possibility of love, and
                  that is the gift she gives us, the possibility to find the companion of loneliness
                  in the self and to begin to write against the history of <span style="font-style:italic">non est potis contingere</span>, to begin to write the self and togetherness for the first time. She is showing us
                  how to write Romanticism at the end of the world. She wants us to believe in ghosts</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Emily Steinlight writes of Verney that “as soon as he is last, he is no longer man”
               because to be a human man requires a fellow species (71). While I agree with this
               estimation, at the same time, to be human always previously contains the possibility
               of lastness so, in a sense, we have all already “become” last. Nonetheless, Steinlight’s
               argument comports with the idea that Lionel may, in fact, not be a man, but rather,
               as Johnson’s and Fisch’s work variously suggests, that Lionel is the last woman. On
               the other hand, Lionel says that as soon as he begins writing his narrative, he becomes
               an Adam: “suddenly I became as it were the father of all mankind” ( PG#). Or, as Melville
               put its still differently, the question for Lionel is “how to announce the end of
               man, when he himself is still a man” (144). Andrew Sargent, meanwhile, trends somewhere
               else entirely, that a sort of human life will remain, however unrecognizable: “and
               though the no futures of this ‘now’ may still include something akin to ‘us,’ it might
               only be as fossils or ghosts” (323). Sargent’s powerful sense of ghosts here registers
               a bit differently than my reading of Shelley’s ghosts below. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               narrative strategy is both cautiously dialectical and consistently open-ended; firstness,
               middleness, and lastness are all constantly being shuffled into different permutations
               of the Sibylline leaves” (238). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               as Mellor does (<span style="font-style:italic">Mary Shelley</span>, 194-195). Nor do I mean autobiographical in the sense of it in Mellor’s, Harpold’s,
               or Nichie’s reading of the novel. Rather, I mean in the sense that all writing is,
               fundamentally, autobiographical. My sense of autobiographical here is much closer
               to Gillingham and Johnson. Of course, there are clear autobiographical resonances

               identity whereas I am taking it as fundamental to her existence: it “exists either
               as unconscious knowledge or as fear that comes from an intense personal secret, the
               revelation of which would disrupt the entire construction of her identity” (295).

         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">In this sense, I diverge from Harpold (54-55) and McKeever (197) who see it as the
               father’s passion for the mother in the daughter. Meanwhile, Clemet sees her as casting
               herself as Oedipus and not his daughter, “as both guilt-ridden and innocent, both
               sexual transgressor and sexually pure” (70-71). Diana Edelman-Young agrees that “she
               wants him as a lover, not a father…” and that “she must destroy the very thing she
               desires in order to succeed in creating her self” (141). Similarly, Tilottama Rajan
               writes that “it is also far from clear whose incestuous desire the text is about and
               also whether it protects or abjects that desire. The narrative is ostensibly about
               the father's passion for Mathilda and yet, just as powerfully about her desire for
               him” (n.p.). Gillingham, too, finds it ambiguous: “While the text declines finally
               to blame Matilda for her father's desire, neither does it position her solely as a
               passive, subjugated victim of it. Indeed, the nature of her own affection for her
               father is left persistently ambiguous” (267).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in the novel: “Here I am thinking of an encounter with the unconscious in Romantic
               literature’s various scenes of psychoanalysis, such as Shelley’s encounter with Rousseau
               in <span style="font-style:italic">The Triumph of Life</span>, which he describes as ‘thoughts which must remain untold’” (722).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
