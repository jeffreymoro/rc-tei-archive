            <p>Written in the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, this essay probes the enthusiasm
               for virtual communication in higher education to consider the political ramifications
               of virtual versus physical spaces. Reading James Hogg’s The Private Memoirs and Confessions
               of a Justified Sinner in light of a resonant spatial politics, it argues that absent
               what the novel proposes are the moderating effects of shared space, religious fundamentalism
               becomes radically individualistic fanaticism. In demonstrating Hogg’s attention to
               the ways new technologies enabled new forms of “virtual” religious affiliation, the
               essay suggests that the novel proves a rumination on our current orderings of space,
               offering a prescient view of the problems that might accompany uncritical acceptance
               of a supposedly inevitable digitally networked future. </p>

               <p>In the first months of the pandemic, a smattering of voices across higher education
                  tried to find the situation’s silver lining. Seeing economic, logistical, and social
                  hardships facing colleges as an opportunity to disrupt what they took to be an unsustainable
                  business model, these optimists suggested that the transition to remote learning and
                  Zoom conferencing represented a chance to “innovate” and “unbundle” the college experience.

                  imperiled institutions could deliver education to more students without the inconveniences

                  faculty and staff who otherwise might not possess the economic means to attend in-person
                  courses and conferences could participate in digital alternatives at little to no

                  </div>—preceded the pandemic, of course. But the pandemic hastened what some called the
                  inevitable trend toward networked models of assembling. Hence the spring and summer
                  of 2020 witnessed calls to “embrace this moment strategically,” to use the words of
                  Hans Taparia, a professor of business at New York University, as “online education
                  could expand access exponentially and drop its costs by magnitudes.”

               <p>On the one hand, it was easy to sympathize with these arguments. Before the pandemic,
                  the privilege of possessing and accessing physical space was mostly relegated to academia’s
                  elite. Adjuncts, for instance, were often denied physical offices on campus, let alone
                  institutional “homes,” and contingent faculty (like my spouse) were overwhelmingly
                  employed to teach online courses, while teaching in-person generally was the default
                  position of tenured or tenure-track faculty. Moreover, because contingent faculty
                  are granted little to no research funding, they had little ability to physically attend
                  academic conferences. As Jessie Daniels and Polly Thistlethwaite note, “What happens
                  inside a conference meeting room rarely exists for anyone except those few who can
                  afford to be physically present.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> A similar dynamic applied to the student experience, as idyllic, residential campuses
                  tend to attract a wealthier student body relative to online schools or commuter campuses.
                  In these ways, physical space in higher education often has functioned as the<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>dividing line separating the haves and have-nots, the privileged and everyone else.
                  No wonder the push among some to diminish the centrality of academia’s physical spaces,
                  to make them more contingent rather than central to the college experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But despatialization also exacerbates the very divides that its proponents argue it
                  would overcome. Taparia’s op-ed in the <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times </span>is an interesting case in point. Even as he acknowledges that “no one doubts that
                  the [online] student experience would not be as holistic” as the in-person one, he
                  nevertheless reaches this ultimate takeaway: “But universities don’t need to abandon
                  in-person teaching for students who see the value in it. They simply need to create
                  ‘parallel’ online degrees for all their core degree programs.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> In short, Taparia inadvertently ends up advocating for the further entrenchment of
                  the two-tiered system in academia, one that offers affluent students a more “holistic”
                  face-to-face, campus-based education while providing less affluent students a supposedly
                  “parallel” but, by his own admission, less “holistic” online education.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Taparia’s argument illustrates one of the main claims of this essay: the role of higher
               education as an aspirationally-democratic enterprise partly hinges on its ability
               to maintain the existence, robustness, and accessibility of its <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> shared spaces. No doubt the maintenance of such spaces with the threat of a pandemic
               resurgence is unprecedentedly complicated, expensive, and even, in some cases, impossible.
               Nevertheless, even as we improve digital communication, we must also keep front and
               center the importance of cultivating, investing in, and ensuring widespread access
               to academia’s shared physical spaces.</p>
            <p>Somewhat understandably, there is a presentism that attends descriptions of remote
               learning, online conferencing, or “unbundled” education: these are “unprecedented”
               endeavors in “uncharted waters” only recently opened by recent strides in computing
               technologies (see, for instance, Russell). But while it’s true Zoom has only been
               around since 2011, nevertheless there are past resources for thinking through the
               political ramifications of this shift. Thinkers ranging from Manuel Castells to Wendy
               Brown, for example, have considered the politics that arise from shared, concrete
               spaces versus technologically-enabled networks, bringing into focus how “network society”
               might come at the expense of the social weal. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Romanticism, I believe, is also well poised to contribute to contemporary defenses
                  of the political value of bounded, shared space. As Siobhan Carroll observes, “scholars
                  historicizing spatial concepts have, from Henri Lefebvre onward, tended to single
                  out the Romantic era as a time in which urbanization, new technologies of measurement,
                  and dramatic political revolutions collided to crystallize the modern construction
                  of space.”

               <p>Examining these historical developments, critics often have noted the enduringness
                  and relative success of Romantic projects in substituting “imaginary” spaces and communities
                  for more geographically bounded ones. Some of these scholars, influenced by the work
                  of historians such as Marcus Rediker, have celebrated the relative boundlessness of
                  the Romantic era as one that opened new opportunities for subject and community formation
                  unhindered by national boundaries. But several critics also observe that the flipside
                  of this success was an apprehension of the potential ill effects of such “unbounded”
                  projects. As they point out, an acute sense of anomie often accompanied nineteenth-century
                  endeavors to create imagined communities—an anomie that fed Romantic texts’ preoccupation
                  with the perils of social atomization.

                  of Romanticism “inside and outside academe” (in the words of this CFP) flows from
                  one vein of thought in the period that interrogated the supposed social benefits of
                  precisely what Brown terms “deterritorialized societies.” This channel of Romantic
                  thinking questioned the supposed social good of such deterritorialized societies,

                  “imagined communities,” which were built on and valorized an ideal of imagined shared

               background and lack of formal education—was particularly attuned to the politics of
               “imagined communities.” As much as he subscribed to the promises of finding like-minded
               individuals via the networks of mass print culture (which had freed him from shepherding
               and put him on the path to literary success), he remained throughout his career fixated

            <p>Hogg’s concern over despatialization, as represented by Wringhim, provides an unexpected
               resource as to why we should interrogate the rush to adopt permanently “digital” alternatives
               to academe’s lost spaces. In the modern academy, space is evermore at a premium, and
               it is tempting to view digital technologies as a means of providing virtual (and cheaper)
               replacements for the office, the classroom, the conference, or, even, the institution.
               Yet to heed Hogg is to see the very different politics that arise from bounded versus
               boundaryless spaces, to see the ways that concrete spaces perhaps are the irreplaceable
               foundation of an equitable, representative, and healthily pluralistic society. In
               the admittedly idiosyncratic way I bring together Hogg and today’s digitized society,
               then, I want to demonstrate that the novel is not simply about some distant, strife-ridden
               religious past. I suggest instead the novel explores the potential ill-effects of
               virtual “networks” on political subjectivity, perhaps cautioning us today to continue
               in the systematic investment and maintenance of our accessible, shared physical spaces.

               <h2><span class="head">A Politics of Space in the Digital Era</span></h2>
               <p>Political theorists from John Dewey to Wendy Brown have long noted that although xenophobes
                  and tribalists exhibit an obsession with policing the boundaries of their spaces,
                  bounded, shared space is nevertheless the precondition of those values necessary to
                  free society. Put differently, what such political theorists recognize is that even
                  if boundaries promote radical forms of exclusion, this doesn’t<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>necessarily mean that the condition of “boundarylessness” does the opposite. We might
                  equate boundarylessness (such as that which commonly attends conceptions of digital
                  spaces) with ultimate individual freedom, but this ideal of unhindered individual
                  freedom is also at odds with the values necessary to free society.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Brown offers a compelling explanation as to why the politics arising from the precondition
                     of concrete, shared space are anathema to neoliberal understandings of freedom. According
                     to Brown, neoliberalism is a “moral-political project” aimed at “dismantling and disparaging
                     the social state in the name of free, responsibilized individuals.”

                     a certain type of subjectivity antagonistic to the social weal. Pondering the differences
                     between “land” and “seafaring” peoples, Schmitt notes that the “boundarylessness”
                     of seafaring populations oriented them toward “use and consumption, rather than ownership
                     and cultivation.”

                     </div> A key difference, then, between the move from an imaginary based on concrete, geographically-bounded
                     space to one based on deterritorialized space was that the latter promoted a rapacious
                     appetite to “extend sovereignty” without the moderating responsibilities that attend
                     actual land—that is, the responsibility to make land more productive, to defend that
                     land, or, most of all, to negotiate conditions of cohabitation. Applying such contexts
                     to online discussion boards, Forestal looks to Dewey to argue that flexible but distinct
                     “boundaries” on Internet communities foster “an openness to respond and adapt to new
                     ideas and information” while discouraging trolls.

                     on nodes, and the gatekeepers of such nodes are the new privileged class. And these
                     gatekeepers gather in <span style="font-style:italic">geographic </span>spaces, even as they look to <span style="font-style:italic">un</span>space space and <span style="font-style:italic">un</span>time time.

               </div>
               <p>This isn’t to criticize digital conversations or interactions, nor is it to say that
                  digital platforms aren’t able to provide meaningful and more inclusive forms of horizontal
                  community. It is only to reemphasize what the pandemic years have made obvious. Digital
                  alternatives do not inherently resolve the problems that attend in-person meetings.
                  Without proper attention paid to the underlying inequalities of higher education,
                  such technologies in fact stand to deepen its existing two-tiered system, in which
                  access to in-person communication is increasingly the domain of the privileged few
                  while the rest ought to be satisfied with “virtual” forms of community or instruction.
                  Some cash-strapped institutions, for instance, are considering not reimbursing faculty
                  for in-person conferencing if a digital alternative is available.</p>
               <p>This separation is reason for special concern at a moment when higher education is
                  in crisis. For not only does fully online communication have a tendency to “fortify
                  and confirm” people in their own opinions, creating a more polarized society (“Danger
                  in the internet echo chamber”); the absence of the “rest” also creates an echo chamber
                  at the <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> academic conference, as attendees are less likely to engage with or feel beholden
                  to digital participants than they are with fellow in-person participants. If we are
                  to extrapolate Brown’s reasoning, the academic conference by virtue of being bounded
                  is <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> place where we better recognize who “cohabitates” disciplinary spaces and wherein
                  the need for “protocols of power sharing, enfranchisement, or commitment to negotiating
                  diverse views and needs, inclusion, or plurality” may come into sharper focus relative
                  to digital “deterritorialized” spaces. Hence why digital platforms perhaps haven’t
                  emerged as full-fledged “alternatives” to physical attendance at conferences. Digital
                  participation might be cheaper for struggling institutions, but the long-term political
                  costs for scholars and professional organizations could prove steeper. When (hopefully)
                  we find ourselves fully on the other side of the global pandemic, we might do well
                  to assess whether a new normal of “networked” conferencing has created the sorts of
                  communities we wish to inhabit.</p>
               <p>This is a necessarily reductive argument, I realize, one that oversimplifies complex
                  debates regarding social media, academic conferences, and online education, as well
                  as a robust critical literature on the politics of space in the fields of literary
                  studies, geography, sociology, gender studies, and more. It also neglects finer-grained
                  developments in Zoom and Google Meet technologies to create boundaries on virtual
                  classroom and conference attendance and participation. But I focus on the contributions
                  of Brown and Forestal (in conjunction with Castells), because they take such a comprehensive
                  view of the potential political consequences of digital spaces precisely at a moment
                  when technologies for virtual gathering are imagined to redress the inequalities and
                  inconveniences associated with physical, bounded space. Their ultimate concern strikes
                  me as fairly uncontroversial: rather than making people feel less alienated, digital
                  gatherings can accelerate alienation. </p>

                     connections of this kind. Social media, for instance, is often compared to Americana’s
                     old town square, and the Internet is regularly likened to the nineteenth-century Western
                     frontier. And these historical analogues are meant to do more than merely describe
                     digital interactions. As law professor Alfred C. Yen notes in an essay arguing against
                     the use of the “Western frontier metaphor” in relation to the legal regulation of
                     cyberspace, such metaphors also determine the character of the Internet interactions:
                     “The Western frontier metaphor operates as propaganda supporting the minimal regulation
                     of the Internet,” he argues.

                     of the cornerstones of the Christian faith. Thus the Particular Baptist Robert Robinson

                     of harlots,” and compared the various Protestant denominations to be properly akin

                     Like confederate states they assembled by deputies in one large ecclesiastical body,

                     of how to establish cooperation across denominational differences. International Protestantism,
                     in other words, was partly driven by an optimism and set of moral values that bears
                     some resemblance to the values and beliefs propounded by early-2000s cyber-utopianism.

                     self-sufficient, self-governing Christian communities rather than grinding foreign
                     peoples under the heels of an authoritarian political-religious power. That is, they
                     saw and defined <span style="font-style:italic">their </span>Christian expansion as the antithesis of a crusading (and thus often Catholic) Christianity,
                     whose <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi</span>, as they perceived it, was to invade, conquer, and impose spiritual change by force.
                     In the minds of these Protestants, missionaries wouldn’t invade or conquer—rather
                     they would live “alongside” people in small communities, “touching” individual hearts,
                     and thus provoking change from the ground up rather than the top down.

                     As a result, individual and national sovereignty would be preserved, even as Christianity
                     brought more people into its fold. Katherine Engel characterizes this idealized conception
                     of Protestant unity as an international “network” that was both “expansive and intentionally
                     vague,” one which valorized a vaguely-conceived “fellowship” by which “geographic

                     it seems clear that international Protestantism—in the form of the nineteenth-century
                     missionary movement and its collusion with European imperialism—didn’t necessarily
                     supply a remedy. As Clark and Ledger-Lomas observe of international Protestantism’s

                     producing a certain type of <span style="font-style:italic">anti</span>-social personality, who viewed civil society as fundamentally at odds with the exercise
                     of individual freedom. We see this anxiety in nineteenth-century British evangelicalism.
                     Within the movement, there was an emphasis on “self-interest and individualism” (as
                     prominent evangelicals declared themselves able to read and interpret the Bible free
                     of an “elite priesthood” or larger hermeneutical community).

                     that valued contribution from those who were not educated and encouraged modes of

                  <p>Ian Duncan’s important essay on <span style="font-style:italic">Confessions of a Justified Sinner </span>sees Robert Wringhim as the natural result and antagonist of civil society. Writing
                     that the novel “allows us to … read fanaticism as the dialectical product of objective
                     historical processes of modernization,” he concludes that Hogg ultimately “insists
                     on the modernity of the Wringhim’s antinomian sect, cut off from a traditional society
                     of customary or naturalized belief and founded on ‘abstract speculative principle’.”

                     radical Scottish evangelicals. As Adrian Hunter reminds us, Hogg witnessed the growing
                     power of “secessionist churches,” which “by 1820 … had consolidated in the form of
                     the Evangelical movement.”

                     “Killing Times” of 1679 to 1688. Thus “to many in the establishment, the [evangelical]

                     </div> One imagines that it was to critique these developments that Hogg set his novel in
                     the immediate wake of the “Killing Times” and made his homicidal “justified sinner”
                     a Covenanter. A defender of Scottish nationalism, Hogg wished to draw attention to
                     the ways that the attenuation of “traditional society” and its institutions in the
                     pursuit of an “abstract” ideal of freedom (to use Duncan’s words) not only fostered
                     dangerous forms of religious individualism; more forebodingly, the collapse of traditional
                     institutions could also inadvertently lead to dangerous forms of political domination.
                     Where radical evangelicalism tended to see in the Covenanters a straightforward morality
                     tale of freedom fighters resisting an illegitimate foreign power, Hogg drew from the
                     same historical archive to sound a more cautious note.</p>

                     more “networked” forms of organization. In other words, Hogg associates Wringhim’s
                     distinctly modern antagonism toward society to an abstract speculative notion of <span style="font-style:italic">religious space</span>—one tied to the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century decline of the older idea of

                     </div> By the time of Peter’s death in 1725, British views of Peter were fairly positive.
                     In fact, many saw him as the embodiment of ideal Enlightenment rule. When James Thomson
                     credits Peter with uniting disparate Russian communities not only with each other
                     but Europe as a whole in his renowned poem <span style="font-style:italic">The Seasons</span>—writing, “far-distant Flood to Flood is social join’d”—he echoes a view popularized
                     by Voltaire, which saw the czar less a despot and more the face of Enlightenment modernization,
                     who sought to construct a civil society protected by fair governance and united in
                     federation with the other states of Europe.

                              the ‘matchless Prince,’” which reinforced the hagiographic perception of Peter as
                              a border-crossing monarch “who left his native throne” for the sake of a more cosmopolitan

                     of the new internationalist sensibilities of the Protestant Enlightenment on the other.
                     Hence the repeated allusions to Peter in his story. Hogg suggests that the vogueish,
                     modern, and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>seemingly relatively emancipatory internationalism embodied by Czar Peter is Janus-faced:
                     Peter is an object-lesson in how the authoritarianism, militarism, and intolerance

                     extreme. Blanchard, notably, subscribes to the notion of religion rooted in the idea
                     of definite, human community. His doctrine is exemplified in his understanding of
                     religion as “the bond of society on earth, and the connector of humanity with the
                     Divine nature<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>”

                     </div> Moreover, there is “nothing so dangerous to man as the wresting of any of its principles,

                     </div> In other words, he argues that true religion inheres as much in “the bond of society<span style="font-style:italic">on earth</span>” as it does between the individual and the divine, and “damnable” religion is the
                     result of forcing religious principles “<span style="font-style:italic">beyond</span> due bounds.” Thus Blanchard ties his religious practice to a “shared earth,” a delimited<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>shared space. This commitment to the bond of society born of necessarily cohabited
                     space, Hogg seems to suggest, is what makes his religion social<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>moral, and moderate.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>No wonder, then, that of the various “divines” in the story, Blanchard is the only

                     Gil-Martin dislike Blanchard. Where Blanchard sees true religion as proceeding in
                     significant part from the social bonds that come of humanity sharing a common, finite
                     earth, Wringhim and Gil-Martin both argue for the “boundlessness of the true Christian’s

                     is everyone else, whose differing opinions and practices make them “mildew,” “enemies,”

                     harassment of his brother and his brother’s friends. He disrupts their tennis game
                     by intruding on the space of the court, mimicking and mocking their conversation and
                     movements. And, the more he is met by “rude shocks and pushes, accompanied sometimes
                     with hasty curses” in response to his interference, the more he “cling[s]” to his
                     brother, keeping him from playing.

                     harmed, Wringhim responds, “Is there any law or enactment that can compel me to do

                     as violent suppression of his speech and beliefs. In Wringhim’s mind, of course, he
                     has been victimized simply for exercising his individual freedoms, a narrative he
                     disseminates publicly so as to fuel mob violence. And, for Wringhim and the modern
                     troll alike, unleashing an extralegal mob on one’s targets has one significant benefit
                     over using one’s institutional authority to effect change: the latter requires conversation
                     and compromise, while the former, by design, bypasses both.</p>

                  <p>Thus Hogg establishes via Wringhim that religious “freedom” divorced from regard of
                     shared space<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>is individuating in the worst way possible. First, it valorizes a conception of individual
                     freedom necessarily antagonistic to the moderating tendencies that come of one’s realization
                     that human beings cohabitate a finite space. Second, it exacerbates societal divides,
                     as the “more flexible and decentered” network promotes dangerous homophilic forms
                     of association. Perhaps, then, it is unsurprising that in the digital, “networked”
                     age, political theorists are reassessing the value of in-person spaces precisely in
                     their capacity to “foster reciprocity and accommodation, through repeated interactions,”
                     to use Forestal’s phrase. For, so long as the digital realm is associated with “boundlessness”
                     it also harbors a dangerous, individuating conception of “freedom without society,”
                     freedom wielded <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> as <span style="font-style:italic">“</span>a pure instrument of power, shorn of concern for others, the world, or the future.”

                     Rather, “human orderings of space and the meanings attributed to those orderings shape

                     that the exercise of true individual “freedom” is <span style="font-style:italic">inherently</span> constrained by conditions of cohabitation or what Blanchard calls the “bond of society

               <h2><span class="head">Strange Times and Strange Essays</span></h2>
               <p>In this essay, I’ve tried to elucidate the ways that my personal experiences in higher
                  education—the financial precariousness of my institution, the uncertain conditions
                  of my spouse’s job, the alarmingly optimistic predictions about the long-term leveling
                  properties of digital scholarly and pedagogic “networks”—are filtered through my research
                  interests. My own published work has focused almost entirely on nineteenth-century
                  literature and religion, but, as this essay demonstrates, I find resonances between
                  this content and my more casual interests in digital communities and modern networked
                  society. Inescapably, these resonances inflect how I see current issues.</p>
               <p>There is some saying, I think, about how breadth comes at the expense of depth. Certainly
                  in the eclecticism of this essay, the truth of this adage is self-evident. In the
                  effort to be timely, as well as to move across centuries, different types of media,
                  and vastly different topics to think through this moment, I’ve left issues unaddressed
                  and oversimplified much of the historical material I study. This is an experimental
                  piece for me, but my hope is that this approach might yield new constellations of
                  thought that otherwise would have been missed. </p>
               <p>After all, in an essay partly about the forces that engender ideological echo chambers,
                  it perhaps is apt that this piece resists another type of “echo chamber,” specifically
                  the insistently presentist orientation of most popular writings about higher education
                  and the Internet. As mentioned above, there is so much emphasis on the <span style="font-style:italic">unprecedentedness </span>of digital technologies and communities, as though history and the narratives of the
                  past (particularly fictional narratives) offer little to guide us forward in such
                  “unprecedented” times. But such presentist rhetoric reinforces a certain myopia in
                  how we conceive of higher education and the “disruptions” of digital technologies,
                  for, whether we like it or not, we <span style="font-style:italic">already,</span> reflexively, rely on historical precedents to conceive of and justify the “virtual”
                  networks of the present.</p>
               <p>And these metaphors are not merely descriptive. Often, historical spaces—the Wild
                  West, the town square, even the “super highway”—are invoked in relation to the Internet
                  only insofar as they are assumed to mirror the present. But it is no new insight that
                  the historical metaphors by which we conceive of the present shape what might come
                  in the future. Indeed, as evinced in his criticism of the Covenanters despite his
                  sympathy with the cause of Scottish nationalism, Hogg himself perceived that more
                  savvy deployments of the past were needed to yield better futures (at least, better
                  than those being brought to fruition by Scottish radical evangelicals). That is, he
                  saw that the political dangers of past “network societies” demonstrated how “networks”
                  were never <span style="font-style:italic">intrinsically</span> emancipatory, nor individual freedom ever an <span style="font-style:italic">inherent</span> political good.</p>

                  <p>Historian Joanne Meyerowitz’s essay on the difficulties of contemporary categories
                     of sex and gender in capturing the “whole story” of “narratives of the past” gets
                     at what I’m trying to say: “Historical texts are useful in this way because they pry
                     us out of the familiar and thereby position us, in a sense, to anachronize the present
                     … The past can show us that our own ways of seeing the world are contingent, curious,
                     and changeable.”

                     </div> Meyerowitz’s optimism that the past empowers us to see the present as “contingent”
                     returns me to the context of higher education. In higher education, we think of “contingency”
                     in relation to one of the term’s definitions, as “conditional” or dependent for existence
                     on something else (i.e., in using the phrase “contingent faculty”). This sense of
                     “contingency” places academic labor and higher education institutions in a position
                     of defensive responsiveness. Often—and especially lately—it feels that we have little
                     choice but to adapt as quickly as possible to larger economic, political, and technological
                     forces out of our control. But Meyerowitz points to the past to remind us that “contingency”
                     isn’t just the passive acceptance of present circumstances. Rather, “contingency”
                     also<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>carries with it the recognition that our circumstances are changeable, can be “touched”
                     (to return to the word’s etymological association with the Latin <span style="font-style:italic">tangere</span>) precisely by how we decide to engage with the past. Texts such as Hogg’s, then,
                     maybe aren’t only artifacts of a distant time and culture. Attentive to the ways new
                     technologies enabled new forms of “imagined communities,” the novel also proves a
                     rumination on our current orderings of space, offering a prescient view of the problems
                     that might accompany uncritical acceptance of a supposedly inevitable “digital” and
                     networked future.</p>

               state of higher education and faculty jobs, Interfolio CEO Andrew Rosen and professor
               Jaime Lester offer this recommendation: <span class="quote">‘In addition to innovating around faculty’s access to data, colleges and universities
                  need to provide professional development for faculty that is focused on individual
                  career success and, as a result, their students’ successes. <span style="font-style:italic">The common use of professional development funds to attend disciplinary conferences
                     does little to support individual career success</span>. Instead, opportunities for career counseling in the form of individualized development
                  plans, mentoring, learning communities and grants to pursue research and teaching
                  innovations are important to keep all faculty motivated, progressing and supporting
                  institutional strategic goals. (emphasis mine)’</span> Never mind the vagueness of what is being suggested to take the place of disciplinary
               conferences (who is administering these “opportunities for career counseling”? What
               are the components of an “individualized development plan,” and how does this “plan”
               meaningfully differ from the self- and departmental assessments?). It’s enough to
               notice that the authors recommend the cessation of funding for disciplinary conferences
               to hire instead specialists to guide faculty toward advancing “institutional strategic
               goals.” I’m grateful to Mimi Winick for discussing with me the instrumentalization
               of knowledge that attends such conceptions of academic conferencing. See Andrew Rosen
