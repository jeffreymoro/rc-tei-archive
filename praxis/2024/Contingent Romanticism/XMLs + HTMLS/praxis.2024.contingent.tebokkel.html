            <p>This essay explores the quintessential romantic figure of the skylark and disambiguates
               the overdetermined concept of contingency to reimagine a paradigmatic literary-humanist
               thought-style and to articulate new lines of inquiry about romantic poetics, romanticist
               theory and criticism, and academic attitudes about disciplinarity and methodology.
               Gathering writers from Percy Shelley and Robert Bloomfield to Margaret Masterman and
               W. V. O. Quine, this essay explicates the systrophic and elliptical figures of idea
               and matter, fact and fiction, and history and nature at the heart of this paradigmatic
               thought-style, and argues for these figures’ critical, historical, and contingent
               (in all its polysemy) repurposing toward an intellectual commons rather than enclosed
               fields. </p>

               <p>Between sentences of this essay, I got my hands greasy fixing the Harvest-Aid and
                  gummy with propolis tending honeybees. I got sunburnt in the strawberry fields and
                  stung while catching swarms; I watched the sunrise over apple saplings and startled
                  killdeer between sandy rows of cantaloupes. I lived all this as a farmer and as a
                  scholar of Romantic literature—in short, as someone keenly aware of how my thoughts
                  and feelings, down to my barest sensations, were mediated by the old poetics of “farming
                  romance,” “written agriculture,” or “book husbandry,” and by the poetics they conditioned,
                  poetics of lyric self-expression, of sensuous experience, of natural and everyday
                  beauty, and so on.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                        (1)
                        </sup></a>My intuition that there’s something dispositionally and historically Romantic about
                  how we farm and how we think and feel about farming prompted my moving to the study
                  of Romantic literature from a BSc in genetics, where I learned the importance of long
                  histories and selection pressures, and from an MA in modernist poetry, where I learned
                  the value of every line, word, letter, and figure.</p>
               <p>So what are the relationships between farming and Romanticism, then and now? And what’s
                  the best way to talk about them? Like plenty of contemporary research, mine’s wrestling
                  with questions of terminology and methodology has also taken to the mat questions
                  about Romanticism as a field and the literary humanities as a discipline. The causes
                  of this self-reckoning are overdetermined, though, and include the humanities’ perennial
                  introspection about its disciplinary status, economic inequality coupled with the
                  neoliberalization of the university and its STEM-oriented funding, ecological catastrophe,
                  and systemic injustice. My questioning, as a contingent scholar, is contingent on
                  these questionings; I find myself dizzyingly caught up in what historian Andreas Malm
                  calls “an endless cycle of turns—cultural, linguistic, affective, cognitive, performative,
                  material, posthuman, nonhuman.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                        (2)
                        </sup></a> Yet regardless of the “turn,” most theories of late ostensibly afford engagements
                  with “interdisciplinarity” and, if more subtly, with “foundationalism.” My essay examines
                  “contingency” as the avatar of both engagements and of our disciplinary self-inquisition
                  in these modes and at these times.</p>
               <p>What we often mean by “contingency” is something like “systemically dependent,” as
                  in “this event was contingent on those events,” something like “precarious,” as in
                  “contingent faculty,” something like “possible,” as in “contingency plan,” or some
                  combination thereof: fortuitous chance, a butterfly effect, an accident rendered into
                  an act. This meaning of contingency relies on rupture or change rather than continuity,
                  succession rather than sequel, difference rather than similarity. It lends itself
                  well to “theory” in the sense of hypostatizing, systematizing, taxonomizing, and,
                  however each turn may try to duck it, foundationalizing. When we uprooted foundationalism
                  in the 1960s, its rhizomes lodged in our collective soil. Every “turn” is a shoot
                  of theory sprouting from a fragmented foundationalism. Anahid Nersessian puts her
                  finger on this when she identifies the “materialisms <span style="font-style:italic">manqué</span>—monism, mechanism, physicalism, vitalism, Spinozism, Lucretianism—that have for some
                  time now been presenting themselves as antidotes to the harms wrought” by the polysemy
                  of poststructuralism.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                        (3)
                        </sup></a> Likewise helping us specify Malm’s observation above, Fredric Jameson traces another
                  foundationalism in how literary theorists’ “unconscious” is paradoxically “an <span style="font-style:italic">enlargement </span>of consciousness, a widening of the very concept of intention so as to catch these
                  aberrant phenomena also in its net.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                        (4)
                        </sup></a> In response to the aforementioned overdetermined crises and the position of the humanities
                  within them, either seems to seek a new fundament or firmament, a new paradigm, whether
                  it be the material, the unconscious, language, form, objects, ecology, or history,
                  on which everything is contingent, or it gestures toward expertise in other disciplines
                  that may offer some such purchase, whether physics, mathematics, or philosophy. That
                  is, we go in for some kind of foundationalism or interdisciplinarity.</p>
               <p>Whether these are the right things to do is beside the question of whether these are
                  the only things we can do. There’s at least one other meaning of “contingency,” and
                  it comes from its etymology (<span style="font-style:italic">con</span>-, together; <span style="font-style:italic">-tangěre</span>, touch): in contact, side by side, touching together. These meanings of “contingency”
                  are themselves contingent in this side-by-side sense, and we can work them together
                  to create something fruitful. I follow Nersessian again, in “Romanticism as Method”
                  (2016), where she writes that “etymologically speaking, method (<span style="font-style:italic">meta</span>-, after, beyond, alongside; <span style="font-style:italic">hodos</span>-, way) can mean either a travelling-past or else a travelling-alongside.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                        (5)
                        </sup></a> There’s a deeper root for “meta”: “with” or “between”; “compare Mycenaen Greek <span style="font-style:italic">me-ta</span>, ‘together with,’ which is perhaps the original sense in Greek.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                        (6)
                        </sup></a> This root supports Nersessian’s conclusion that methods require “crowd-sourced scholarship”
                  and “multiple forms of knowledge.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                        (7)
                        </sup></a> With all this in mind, I offer a close reading of the thinking <span style="font-style:italic">style</span> that disguises foundationalism in gestures to interdisciplinarity. I study and repurpose
                  some of its figures, such as <span style="font-style:italic">systrophe</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">ellipsis</span>, and some of its motifs, such as cosmic exile and semantic ascent. My essay proceeds
                  by the neglected meaning of contingency, in a side-by-side, nested-example, by-the-way
                  manner, drawing on and examining this thought-style in an array of thinkers with whom
                  I work together metaphors, methodologies, and materials.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Parable of the Skylark</span></h2>
               <p>Before I “ascend” into the heady space of theory—though I would like to recode this
                  movement as a back-and-forth rather than an ascent-and-descent—I situate myself more
                  firmly in the study of Romantic poetry. The relation between understanding Romanticism
                  as a break with its past and understanding it as an “eventuality” of its past is dialectic;<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                        (8)
                        </sup></a> contingency as precarious path-dependence and contingency as codevelopment relate
                  dialectically, though perhaps we’ve given the former somewhat more priority. My argument
                  is that the contingencies within and of these two understandings, their tensions and
                  intersections then and now, are integral to Romanticism, with consequences for what
                  we study and how we do so. There are a lot of ways to make an argument like this,
                  but in “the spirit of the age-of-the-spirit-of-the-age,” I’ve chosen to use the skylark
                  as the “figure of these figures,” to employ some favourite formulae of Romanticists
                  since Paul de Man.<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                        (9)
                        </sup></a> The poems I read (of many options I’ve chosen five) could be paraphrased as being
                  “about” a skylark; they hang together on the rack of this symbol, and how they do
                  so allegorizes Romanticism’s “contingency.” I structure my essay’s movement from poem
                  to poem, then from poetry to theory, then from poetry-and-theory back to my scholarly
                  situation, on the movement of these poetic skylarks.</p>
               <p>The most famous of these five skylarks is surely Percy Bysshe Shelley’s. Written as
                  an “other poem” in his <span style="font-style:italic">Prometheus Unbound </span>(1820) volume, Shelley’s “To a Skylark” showcases the poet’s formal virtuosity and
                  revolutionary idealism. Opening with praise not for the skylark but for this “blithe
                  spirit! / Bird thou never wert,” the poem figures the skylark not as a bird but as
                  a symbol of Romantic genius, soaring through a systrophe of nested similes, characteristic
                  Romantic images, that reify its power and beauty—it’s like a cloud of fire, an unbodied
                  joy, a star of heaven, an arrow of a silver sphere, the moon raining out its beams,
                  a rain of melody, a poet hidden, a high-born maiden, a glow-worm golden, and a rose
                  embowered—until “heaven is overflowed” with music, light, sympathy, colour, and scent
                  “better than all measures” and “better than all treasures.” Shelley’s skylark is on
                  the one hand a symbol of Romantic symbols and a symbol of Romanticism. It is pure
                  figure, high figure, “scorner of the ground” in his proleptically gestalt terms. But
                  on the other hand, the poet concludes by asking, “Teach us, sprite or bird, / What
                  sweet thoughts are thine” and “What objects are the fountains / Of thy happy strain”;
                  “Teach me half the gladness / That thy brain must know.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                        (10)
                        </sup></a> This skylark is a speculative pedagogy driven by a desire to know what material grounds
                  (objects, brain) facilitate figurative flights of fancy, or conversely a sum of similes
                  whose limit asymptotically approaches “reality.”</p>
               <p>William Wordsworth’s two “To a Sky-lark” poems likewise figure the bird as an ideal
                  transcending the mundane. The first (1807) is a jaunty, exclamation-mark–ridden ballad
                  in which the poet asks, before Shelley and in a Shelleyan manner, the happy, strong-souled
                  Lark to go “up with me into the clouds” and to “guide me, till I find / That spot
                  which seems so to thy mind.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                        (11)
                        </sup></a> The second (1827) is three heroic sestets, its lines longer and slower than the first,
                  as if Wordsworth had read Shelley’s poem and sought to revise it and his original
                  (which also appears in the 1827 volume, indeed revised). Instead of singing only of
                  the skylark in the sky, this poem opens by asking if the “Ethereal minstrel” “despise[s]
                  the earth where cares abound” or fixes his heart on “thy nest upon the dewy ground.”
                  However, it moves in a trajectory similar to the former’s, if more earnest and less
                  exuberant, when it encourages the skylark to soar “To the last point of vision, and
                  beyond,” “to sing / All independent of the leafy spring,” and to “Leave to the Nightingale
                  her shady wood,” that it might pour its “rapture more divine” upon the world. Unlike
                  the first poem’s unqualified praise of the skylark in metaphysical flight from the
                  physical, this second poem also refigures the physical <span style="font-style:italic">as</span> metaphysical, for the skylark is not merely heavenly but “True to the kindred points
                  of Heaven and Home!”<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Before Wordsworth’s 1807 poem exclaims about “joy divine,” before Shelley’s 1820 poem
                  proclaims the “rapture so divine,” and before Wordsworth’s 1827 poem revises this
                  into a “rapture more divine,” farmer’s-boy-cum-London-cobbler and Aeolian harp maker
                  Robert Bloomfield wrote of a skylark in his wildly popular <span style="font-style:italic">Farmer’s Boy </span>(1800). This georgic, which sold more copies than Wordsworth’s and Shelley’s volumes
                  combined, precociously criticizes the skylark of these Romantics’ Romantics in a passage
                  worth quoting entirely: </p>

                  “pours” its song out, soars so high it’s almost lost to sight, and is compared to
                  fancy and dream. But Giles, watching it, falls asleep. There is no rapture and no
                  divinity, just a farmhand observing an animal. Accustomed as I was to the Romantic
                  skylark, I missed the implicit criticisms of the passage when I first encountered
                  this poem, but Giles’s visceral sleep, in contrast to their cerebral dreams, turned
                  me back again. This skylark passage opens with a question about the limits of vision,
                  then emphasizes how Giles sees the bird—his hat shades the “glaring light” (resonantly
                  opposed to the “glorious light” of the later poets), the bird flies beneath the clouds
                  (as opposed to above them), and it wheels from shade to light. Crucially, the passage
                  concludes with Giles’s earthly cares overcoming him.</p>
               <p>John Clare, another agricultural-labourer-and-poet, was almost certainly responding
                  to his predecessors in his “Skylark” (1835). In Clare’s poem, hurrying schoolboys
                  startle the skylark out of “her half-formed nest.” She “Winnows the air […] / Then
                  hangs a dust spot in the sunny skies” before dropping back to her nest unbeknownst
                  to the boys, on whom the poem meditates: </p>

                  <div class="l">they unheeded passed—not dreaming then</div>

                  <div class="l">As free from danger, as the heavens are free</div>

               <p> Opening with a terrified hare among corn “sprouting its spiry points of tender green,”
                  the poem closes with the skylark lying “safely, with the leveret, in the corn.” As
                  Bloomfield’s skylark, also nesting in corn, offered momentary reprieve from farm labour
                  for Giles, so Clare’s is part of the agricultural landscape—although it too is constituted
                  by agriculture, “winnowing” the air and hanging like threshing dust. But Clare extends
                  Bloomfield’s critique. Whereas Bloomfield describes how the skylark is visible to
                  Giles, Clare explains that the boys’ ignorance makes the skylark invisible to them,
                  then contrasts what he imagines to be their proud, ignorance-inspired fancies “buil[t]
                  on nothing but a passing cloud” and thereby free of danger, pain, and toil, with the
                  skylark’s vulnerable “nests upon the ground.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>So far, it may seem like I’ve set up a standard dichotomy within Romanticism, two
                  canonical poets against two less canonical poets, majoritarian center and minoritarian
                  margin. This rupture in the Romantic era along class lines (<span style="font-style:italic">ca</span>. 1820) continues in Romanticist scholarship along methodological and disciplinary
                  lines (<span style="font-style:italic">ca</span>. 1835–2020). These ruptures and the language used to describe them, including mine
                  above, depend on and make it all too easy to fall back into a singular and hypostatic
                  understanding of “contingency.” But in simply touching these poems together so they
                  overlap and intersect—Bloomfield’s earthly cares, Shelley’s systrophe, Wordsworth’s
                  transfiguration, Clare’s critique of imagination—I hope to unsettle and reimagine
                  this singular account, to show not only that are the ruptures complicated but that
                  their intertwinings and continuities are as vital as their fractures and tensions
                  to what Romanticism is. I want to contrast the recognized-as-Romantic skylark with
                  the as-yet-unrecognized but no less Romantic skylark in order to revive Romantics’
                  latent understanding of and participation in their late Georgian age as Enlightenment
                  eventuality, as improved improvement, ruptures and continuities and all.</p>
               <p>Before I get there, and as a step on the way to “theory,” I examine Romanticism’s
                  “semantic ascent.” This is W.V.O. Quine’s phrase for shifting from a material to a
                  formal mode of talking. One example is the shift from “talk of miles to talk of ‘mile.’”
                  Quine does not intend it to be positivistic disinterpretation into a logical vocabulary
                  that attempts to, but cannot, neglect pragmatic considerations, but to be a way to
                  “carr[y] the discussion into a domain where both parties are better agreed on the
                  objects (<span style="font-style:italic">viz</span>., words) and on the main terms concerning them.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                        (16)
                        </sup></a>The trouble with semantic ascent is that it creates a high-low dichotomy, privileges
                  the high over the low, and then neglects the low. When I wrote that the skylark of
                  the two quintessentially Romantic poets was a “figure of a figure,” I meant semantic
                  ascent, or Celeste Langan’s “reduction and abstraction.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">

                  figured language itself. Famously, Wordsworth writes in the Preface to the <span style="font-style:italic">Lyrical Ballads </span>(1802) that poets must use “a plainer and more emphatic language,” “the very language
                  of men,” and “the real language of nature” by judiciously choosing “incidents and
                  situations from common life,” particularly from “low and rustic life” and “rural occupations”
                  that the poet must “make [. . .] interesting.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

                  offers a glimpse at what he made of this idealization of “low and rustic life”—if
                  through another sort of idealization. For instance, we read of “tufted barley yellow
                  with the sun,” a “fav’rite morsel with the Rook and Crow,” who are so “Familiariz’d”

                        </sup></a> Bloomfield’s skylark section makes these moves, too, as does Clare’s, in which the
                  scared, vulnerable, toiling bird is contrasted with the flights of fancy of the ignorant
                  boys. These poets defamiliarize a metaphor and its metaphysics by familiarizing contingent
                  ecological and economic histories. Their language was not less or more “real” because
                  they were grounded on some foundation or looking down from some firmament. My turn
                  to Bloomfield and Clare is therefore not a turn to authors who wrote in some mythical,
                  monolithic “real language,” but a turn to authors who knowingly wrote in what the
                  others, following the long-standing capitalist naturalization of labour and labourers,
                  considered as such—<span style="font-style:italic">viz</span>., Wordsworth’s “lower classes,” Shelley’s apology for “erudition,” Capel Lofft’s
                  correcting Bloomfield’s “Jiles” to “Giles,” and John Taylor’s redacting Clare’s solecisms.</p>
               <p>If the “real language of men” is a fantasy, as Bloomfield and Clare remind us, their
                  languages are nonetheless real, and we ought to renegotiate what we mean by “real”
                  and “fantasy” and how they are contingent. This needs to be applied to Shelley and
                  Wordsworth. If consensus frees these canonical skylarks from the vicissitudes of contingencies
                  but insists on them with respect to the non-canonical skylarks, then for symmetry’s
                  sake and contingency’s sake we might insist on them with respect to both. If there’s
                  no one “real language,” there might be languages more or less “real” given a certain
                  situation; there might be languages that accomplish different purposes in different
                  contexts, along different figural-historical axes. If it’s easy, as above, to conclude
                  that Bloomfield and Clare’s languages, as their skylarks, come from their contingency
                  with farming and labouring, then it should be just as easy to conclude that Shelley
                  and Wordsworth’s language, as their skylarks, comes from contingency with philosophy
                  and poetry—Shakespeare, for instance, writes a lark “arising” to sing at “heaven’s
                  gate,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note30" id="Note30_return"><sup class="super">
                        (30)
                        </sup></a> and Gray writes a skylark who “melts into air and liquid light.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note31" id="Note31_return"><sup class="super">
                        (31)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>However, we can also observe that it is Wordsworth and Shelley who insist on the contingency
                  of the skylark’s ability to sing while soaring, and it is Clare and Bloomfield who
                  insist on the contingency of people’s perceptions, experiences, and descriptions of
                  the skylarks—both, indeed, responding to the poetic tradition of using the skylark
                  as a figure. Both are as informed by ornithology as by mythology, by material history
                  as by poetic convention, by fact as by fiction. The ways these languages are already
                  contingent <span style="font-style:italic">on</span> their own histories complicate the ways they become contingent <span style="font-style:italic">with</span> each other. Approaches to these tangled figural histories can only benefit from contingent
                  methods. To anticipate my turn to Meillassoux, the problem with this thought-style
                  isn’t metaphysics or figuration, but, having metaphysicalized and figured, a neglect
                  to also return to the physics and the ground—pithily, perhaps, theory without method.
                  Calls to do so are loud in these skylark poems: Shelley’s conclusion, rife with questions,
                  begs for that return, that recontextualization, as does Wordsworth’s uneasy opening
                  and aporetic conclusion. But they’re also audible in Bloomfield’s skylark calling
                  on Giles to “mark her way” and in Clare’s wistfulness for heavenly imagination.</p>

                  in 1965, close-read Thomas Kuhn’s <span style="font-style:italic">Structure of Scientific Revolutions </span>(1962)—and for similar reasons. Kuhn’s book presented the notion of the “paradigm,”
                  the relatively closed, model-based framework of beliefs, values, and practices held
                  in common in a given “normal science.” Paradigms “shift” when the anomalies inexplicable
                  within a paradigm accrue and effect new extra-paradigmatic research. Thinking about
                  a natural science or even all knowledge in terms of “paradigms” became its own paradigmatic
                  thought-style, like thinking in “contingency” is now. Both are akin to what Raymond
                  Williams called the “epochal analysis” of history as disconnected stages and static
                  types with “categorical rigidity.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note37" id="Note37_return"><sup class="super">

                  which the former is grounded on the latter two, and that at their heart is a concrete,

                        (40)
                        </sup></a> Systrophe is the figure at the heart of Meillassoux’s paradigm, but one he doesn’t
                  embrace. The reader is instead encouraged to smooth these complications into a definition:
                  “contingency” is the possible emergence of existence from, or the capacity-to-be-other
                  of, a necessary chaos. Meillassoux hypostatizes, from observable entities within the
                  universe, a chaos behind the multiverse, from [I] to [V]. The centerpiece of this
                  argument is Chapter 4, “Hume’s Problem,” which refutes consensus probabilistic arguments
                  for the truth of causal necessity (the reason the same effects always follow from
                  the same causes is that the universe in which the physical laws governing causality
                  always emerges from the set of all possible universes, “given a sufficiently gigantic
                  number of attempts”) with a Badiouan take on Cantor’s theorem (the set of all possible
                  universes cannot be totalized and so does not exist), in order to turn our usual order
                  of operations on its head and attempt to explain causal necessity given that it must
                  be contingent.<a class="note_back" href="#Note41" id="Note41_return"><sup class="super">
                        (41)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>This catachresis of mathematical metaphors (or, per Meillassoux, “anhypothetical principles”
                  and “axiomatics”) has more than a family resemblance to the humanistic theories of
                  the past half-century. It’s a variation in a metaphysical key on a common motif, from
                  paradigm shifts to contingency and between foundationalism and interdisciplinarity.
                  Meillassoux does something Romantic in figuring contingency via a series of expropriations
                  that free various kinds of contingency or contingent things from their social contexts,
                  figural histories, and material referents, and then by attempting to fuse them into
                  an organic whole, to use Langan’s analysis of the process of “reduction and abstraction”
                  in Wordsworth’s poetry. And in Wordsworth’s own words, Meillassoux “might’st seem,
                  proud privilege! to sing / All independent of the leafy spring.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note42" id="Note42_return"><sup class="super">
                        (42)
                        </sup></a> But since one of my purposes here is to get back to the leafy spring, to de-hypostatize
                  Meillassoux’s conclusions, I develop the systrophe elided in his theory. I want to
                  restore systrophe from this thought-style’s reifying use of “semantic ascent” to humanistic
                  methods in general and Romanticism in particular. It’s one drop of grammar—a useful
                  one—in this cloud of philosophy.</p>
               <p>Another figure at the heart of Meillassoux’s contingency is ellipsis—not just of his
                  integral systrophe, but also with respect to the verb “think.” Instead of common,
                  idiomatic verb phrases like “think about <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>or “think of <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>,” “think over <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>" or “think through <span class="hi">x</span>" Meillassoux uses “think <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>." As far as my French allows me to read, this isn’t an effect of Ray Brassier’s translation
                  but is also true in the French original, <span style="font-style:italic">Après la Finitude </span>(2006), which uses neither the idiomatic and most common “penser à <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>," nor the idiomatic but less common “penser de <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>,” “penser <span style="font-style:italic">z</span>” (where <span style="font-style:italic">z </span> is an infinitive), or “penser que <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>,” but opts instead for “penser <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>.” I don’t mean Meillassoux (or Brassier) simply elides “that,” which is idiomatic
                  and which he sometimes does. I mean that he deploys a grammatical figure. Excluding
                  adjective or noun uses of “thinking,” “think <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>" appears 100 times in <span style="font-style:italic">After Finitude</span>, almost always when Meillassoux presents his own argument, whereas idiomatic uses
                  of “think” (with a preposition or an elided “that”) occur only 32 times, almost always
                  when Meillassoux presents arguments to refute or characters discussing his arguments.</p>
               <p>This ellipsis is no inexplicable quirk, and regardless of whether it has precedents
                  in Pascal or Descartes, it’s nevertheless that from which a little of this contingency’s
                  philosophical <span style="font-style:italic">je ne sais quoi</span> derives. Witness it in examples of senses (20), (22), and (35) above: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">“I can think the contingency of this existing thing” (75) </div>
                  <div class="l">“I cannot think the contingency of <span style="font-style:italic">existence </span> as such” (75)</div>
                  <div class="l">“I am perfectly incapable of thinking the abolition of existence” (76)</div>
                  <div class="l">“it becomes possible to think a plurality of contradictory worlds” (78) </div>
                  <div class="l">“thought has become able to think a world [. . .] unaffected by whether or not anyone
                     thinks it” (116)</div>
               </div>
               <p> A reduction and abstraction complementary to that from a congeries of senses to one
                  definition occurs in this ellipsis of “thinking <span style="font-style:italic">about </span>a world” into “thinking a world”: the former merely conjures a representation in the
                  mind of a world that has mind-independent existence, whereas the latter either produces
                  a world in the mind or calls it into existence from the unthought void, and as such
                  it is not mind-independent (contrary to Meillassoux’s larger “post-Kantian” project).
                  But we don’t say “I think a skylark”; we say “I’m thinking <span style="font-style:italic">about</span> a skylark.” There is a tantalizing intimation of agency, being, or power in the way
                  the preposition-less “think” works. Yet, when prepositions are re-inserted, “contingency”
                  re-systrophized, made contingent, this cloud of philosophy condenses into a drop of
                  grammar, static theory into dynamic methods.</p>
               <p>Prepositionalizing in this way has its own figural history. Wittgenstein does it in
                  his celebrated complication of “seeing” into “seeing-as,” in which he postulates the
                  ineluctable conditioning of perception by precognition, habit, and experience <a class="note_back" href="#Note43" id="Note43_return"><sup class="super">

                  of Aristotelian necessity “all things considered” (a.t.c.) into necessities “relevant
                  to certain considerations” such as species’ habitats, patterns of life, and repertoires

                  are more fruitful than Contingency a.t.c. This Contingency is a foundation on which
                  a given thing, event, even world “could have been otherwise”—a conditional perfect
                  tense that enjoins a wistful imaginary to wring its hands while transmogrifying “could”
                  into “would” and “should”—and, moreover, it conflates concepts we already have handy
                  phrases for, such as “path-dependent” or “systemically caused” or, in a pinch, “socially
                  constructed.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note45" id="Note45_return"><sup class="super">

                        (49)
                        </sup></a>—though plenty of problems ask us to bring such fields together.</p>
               <p>Instead of cosmic exile, I want to explore the borderless free flow of ideas between
                  cosmoi, disciplinary fields as an open-field commons, before the enclosure that transformed
                  the Georgian era set off a series of enclosures (of knowledge, culture, biology, <span style="font-style:italic">etc.</span>) amid which we still find ourselves. There’s no one contingency, but all kinds, visibly
                  so in farming, which is another one of my systrophe of examples. I was writing this
                  paper in spring, the season in which every decision—who will clean the germination
                  greenhouse, when to prepare the beehives for spring growth and pollination, what old
                  blueberry growth needs to be pruned—has effects amplified a hundredfold some months
                  from now, even more so because that season these sensitively dependent decisions were
                  made during the manifold uncertainties of a pandemic. This is the Lorenz attractor,
                  butterfly effect, path-dependency kind of “contingency” with which we Romanticists
                  are most familiar, not least because of Meillassoux. <a class="note_back" href="#Note50" id="Note50_return"><sup class="super">
                        (50)
                        </sup></a> It also shows up in the way farmers rely on their previous decisions, review their
                  past seasons, and stick with what worked as much as possible—a reliance on tradition
                  that might raise the hackles of the critical Romanticist, but one that such a Romanticist
                  shares, at the very least in continuing to consult two-hundred-year-old poetry.</p>
               <p>At least one other kind of contingency is contingent with this kind, though. This
                  contingency is what farmers have to know and do in dozens of fields and communities
                  at once, an overlapping Venn diagram and exploded-view drawing, and a concern, as
                  contemporary-and-Romantic farmer-and-poet Wendell Berry says, “for the way that things
                  are joined together.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note51" id="Note51_return"><sup class="super">
                        (51)
                        </sup></a> Farmers have to know ecology, botany, animal biology, soil science, chemistry, climatology,
                  machinery, carpentry, fieldwork techniques, worker management, legislation, they have
                  to know people who know these things better than they do, and they have to know how
                  these fields interact. If they are experts in one field, sometimes literally, their
                  expertise diffracts against,<a class="note_back" href="#Note52" id="Note52_return"><sup class="super">

                  what the literary humanities have been at their best, too. Conditioned by a Romanticist’s
                  reflexivity, Meillassoux’s systrophe is the figure <span style="font-style:italic">sine qua non </span>for grappling with this contingency in all its movement, mess, and “mangle of practice,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note53" id="Note53_return"><sup class="super">

               <h2><span class="head">Semantic Descent and Open Cosmoi</span></h2>
               <p>To the extent that I’ve soared, it has been with a view of nesting back in the corn.
                  If doing metaphysics or being foundationalist is useful, then its use comes in its
                  recontextualization, pragmatization, pluralization—in its vulnerabilities, persistences,
                  and responses to difference and difficulty, like Clare’s skylark. We can recover a
                  <span style="font-style:italic">semantic descent</span> from Contingency to a systrophe of contingencies with various non-elided prepositions
                  such as Wittgensteinian “contingencies-<span style="font-style:italic">as</span>” or “contingencies-<span style="font-style:italic">of</span>” or “contingencies-<span style="font-style:italic">with</span>,” and from Necessity to various Footian “necessities-<span style="font-style:italic">for</span>.” In other words, from a Romantic “real language” to many real languages. We can
                  replace cosmic exile with open cosmoi, forming “contingencies” in the “side by side”
                  or “touching together” sense of common fields and of a farmer’s knowledge, the glorious,
                  glaring light of metaphysics helping us, by a bent-hat shade, to carefully scrutinize
                  a penumbrae of practices. These contingencies form and are formed by intersections,
                  path-dependencies, and historical figurations that must be stated and debated—and
                  crucially, they are formed by purposes that must be aired, too. They are less tidy
                  ideas that appear on one or the other side of paradigm shifts, epistemic breaks, Contingency,
                  and incommensurabilities, more messy notions that criss-cross in deep shifts, slow
                  breaks, long contingencies, and commensurabilities. As I’ve tried to demonstrate throughout
                  this essay, this is where Romanticists can use our methodological reflexivity, in
                  retooling the many methods of the post-Feyerabendian “almost anything goes” that results
                  from such contingency; this is where we can use our formalism, in analyzing what Stephen
                  Jay Gould calls “the complex events of narrative” rather than “the simple consequences
                  of natural law” (or, for that matter, of a Meillasouxian supernatural unlaw and of
                  what we think of as simple, as consequence, as natural, as law);<a class="note_back" href="#Note54" id="Note54_return"><sup class="super">
                        (54)
                        </sup></a> and this is where we can use our historicism, in generalizing the lessons of the
                  conditional perfect to the revolutionary reimagination of what Emily Rohrbach calls
                  the future anterior, of what will have been. <a class="note_back" href="#Note55" id="Note55_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>I’m only beginning my foray into the worlds of Romanticists and farmers. But I hope
                  the contingencies of my fields have been and will be fruitful. After Spivak’s assessment
                  of the state of comparative literature in <span style="font-style:italic">Death of a Discipline </span>(2003), and despite my disagreement with her that “‘fieldwork’ belongs to the social
                  sciences,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note56" id="Note56_return"><sup class="super">
                        (56)
                        </sup></a> I think we Romanticists can train ourselves and our students <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to be Scholars, Theorists, or Philosophers, whose field of choice lies cosmically
                  exiled beneath or behind or beyond all other fields, whether it be because language
                  is everything or mathematics is or affect is or agency is or matter is or form is,
                  <span style="font-style:italic">etc.</span>, but to be a contingent of scholars-and-…, theorists-and-. . ., philosophers-and-…,
                  whose fields lie beside and between other fields, because language, mathematics, affect,
                  matter, or form belongs to most things in some way. This means decolonizing, remembering,
                  demarginalizing, building specializations and expertise in anything but silos—but
                  building them nonetheless, and lending, borrowing, and helping others build. For me,
                  this also means a systrophe of Romanticist-and-farmer, “sideshadowed”<a class="note_back" href="#Note57" id="Note57_return"><sup class="super">
                        (57)
                        </sup></a> by historian and philosopher of science, genetics student, would-be writer. This
                  is, per the parable of the skylark, consistent with a renewed post–Romantic-ideology
                  sense of Romanticism as a vulnerable nest in a certain field from which we can both
                  soar and return to care, Romanticism done by paper-cut, plough-cramped hands. We can
                  make the sophistications of Romanticism complement others, supplement others, “yoking
                  the humanities, however distantly, with however few guarantees, to a just world.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note58" id="Note58_return"><sup class="super">
                        (58)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>We might take the lessons learned in our semantic ascent and return from the clouds
                  with them to nestle in fields around, refreshing the purpose of the university within
                  and without it, outside, around, all the time. Berry puts it succinctly in “Unspecializing
                  Poetry” (1983): this semantic descent <span class="quote">‘calls for a different kind of mind and a different kind of university, in which the
                     motions of intelligence would not follow radii ever outward from the center, each
                     discipline dividing farther from the others the farther outward it goes, but would
                     move in a dance pattern of exchanges and returns. Literary scholars might then begin
                     to teach biology, history, philosophy, science, etc., not to be versatile, but to
                     be pertinent. Writers would begin to feel the judgment of engineers, farmers, and
                     doctors.<a class="note_back" href="#Note59" id="Note59_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a>’</span> I’ve recontextualized, poetically and politically, Berry’s farmer-poetics as one
                  of my guides to try to show how I might do this—repurpose and ramify, not refute or
                  reify. Insofar as Romanticist approaches to contingency in particular depend on the
                  thought-style I’ve sketched, I hope I have made progress toward repurposing that dependency.
                  And insofar as Romanticist methods in general tend to recreate its cosmic exile and
                  semantic ascent, I hope I have made progress toward reimagining that tendency. As
                  rapturous as it is to soar, the corn needs care too.</p>
