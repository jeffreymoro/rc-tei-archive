            <p> At Duquesne University, I regularly teach a 300-level writing-intensive “Healthcare
                and Literature” class populated almost exclusively by sophomores and juniors
                enrolled in a Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) program, which awards them a
                bachelor’s degree after 4 years and a doctorate after 6. My primary goal is for
                these students to articulate practical, professional takeaways from studying
                literary representations of illness and medical intervention. Thus, I prioritize
                relevance, foregrounding it on the first day of class and throughout the semester,
                frequently asking students, “What does this mean for you as future physical
                therapists?” I let them know that I have worked to align the class’s goals and their
                needs by considering their program’s outcomes. And I require them to reflect on how
                experiences of illness and expectations for healthcare professionals have changed
                over time. We extend our discussion into how wellbeing coexists with illness on
                separate yet parallel tracks. We read a narrative of illness, and we ask, “Despite
                how sick the patient was, what made that patient’s experience terrible? What made
                that patient’s experience uplifting? How did the healthcare provider affect that
                experience? How can the healthcare provider manage their own wellbeing to
                subsequently increase patient wellbeing?” These things are interconnected. </p>
            <p> My “Healthcare and Literature” class is part of a trend in higher education: students
                majoring in health sciences are increasingly offered liberal arts courses designed
                to address humanistic issues that arise in their fields. Though at times the gap
                between literary studies and my students’ study of physical therapy has yawned wide,
                outcomes for the physical therapy program dovetail with literary and cultural
                studies’ investments in social justice, intersectionality, and careful reading.
                Indeed, this overlap is a hallmark of the medical humanities, which uses an
                interdisciplinary framework to bridge that imagined gap between medicine and
                literature. When we take a medical humanities approach, we draw from literature and
                art as well the social sciences to critically examine representations of medical
                education and medical practices. The college’s vision for the physical therapy
                program is outlined in their “Strategic Statements” document, which harmonizes with
                studies in the medical humanities by asking students to be “compassionate,
                culturally competent, and socially responsible reflective practitioners,” and
                “critical thinkers, life-long learners, healthcare educators … critical consumers of
                pertinent literature, and leaders in the profession” (“Strategic Statements”). In
                addition, the program’s learning outcomes emphasize “practic[ing] … in a competent,
                safe, ethical … reflective and professional manner,” “perform[ing] effective patient
                examination [and] evaluation,” “provid[ing] healthcare education to patients,
                clients, families, peers, and society, using culturally appropriate teaching
                methods,” and “demonstrate[ing] social responsibility and altruism” (“Outcomes”). </p>
            <p> Clearly, the program stresses empathy and reflection. It also links textual literacy
                to interpersonal literacy. Professional acumen flows from the ability to interpret
                patients’ individual needs. Students are expected to understand that patients
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">and </hi>practitioners are influenced by
                socio-cultural contexts and power-privilege dynamics; there is additionally an
                investment in holistic patient-centered care. My pedagogy, drawn from the medical
                humanities and narrative medicine, facilitates developing professional-personal
                critical reflection, altruism, interpersonal communication skills, and an awareness
                of the factors that affect hearing, telling, and developing care plans. Under the
                umbrella of the medical humanities, narrative medicine draws attention to the
                narratives that patients and practitioners construct. It also teaches students to
                interpret those narratives by thinking about things like word choice, mind-body
                relations, point of view, power, and context. I emphasize that skills in textual
                analysis are a personal-professional asset that will help students to hear patients
                and, by meeting them where they are, ensure that they are administering effective
                care.</p>
                
            <p> In “Healthcare and Literature,” the classroom becomes a space of conceptualizing
                wellbeing. Our medical humanities approach invites students to imagine themselves as
                future practitioners, but more importantly, it requires students to consider the
                relevance of their emotions in the present. We confront difficult scenarios together
                as a class. We discuss and process those feelings to create emotional resilience, a
                    <hi rend="italic">preparedness</hi> that equips them to lean into hard emotions
                now, which may prevent burnout later. The class—capped at 18—is discussion driven
                and thematically organized, and transhistorical. Focusing on North American and
                Western European medicine and culture, students complete reading, in-class writing,
                and process-writing with individual guidance.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Process writing involves assisting students with
                        planning, drafting, and revising. I dedicate class time to each stage of the
                        process, including workshopping student drafts. During workshop we discuss
                        how the student might revise their paper to meet the assignment’s
                        guidelines. It also allows me to demonstrate to them what an “A” thesis
                        looks like, for example. </note> I explain to students that our
                discussions will facilitate their awareness of humanistic issues in medical contexts
                past and present; improve literary analysis and close reading skills across genres;
                enable them to articulate their professional goals and values; and finally, set them
                up to write informal and formal essays. </p>
                
            <p>Although I teach texts from many historical periods, there is good reason in
                “Healthcare and Literature” to discuss Romantic texts as a foundation and starting
                point because the Romantic era is an especially rich moment in medical history. At
                the time, for example, surgery suffered from low status as manual craft (i.e., the
                “sawbones”) compared to the more “cerebral” work of physicians. Pairing Romantic
                texts with contemporary ones also shows how medical attitudes change across time.
                Clusters of texts allow us to study how anatomy has been taught and learned;
                shifting attitudes towards mental illness and disability; different
                conceptualizations of pain and attitudes towards pain management; and individual
                articulations of how treatment can traumatize patients. In this vein, our texts
                include long and short fiction and medical texts, poetry and visual art. We end the
                semester with contemporary nonfiction written by medical professionals and a visit
                to the campus cadaver lab where students will perform a dissection during their
                fourth year. </p>
                
            <p> Romantic texts that address medical topics are diverse, but I have found two texts
                especially useful for helping my students develop compassion and cultural awareness:
                Frances Burney’s journal letter, “Account from Paris of a Terrible Operation –
                1812,” and an anonymous 1831 short story “The Victim” from
                <hi rend="italic">The New Monthly Magazine, </hi> in which a
                medical student finds his friend’s fiancée on his dissection table. These works
                enable us to discuss aspects of healthcare that many students typically take for
                granted: that surgeons embody the pinnacle of expertise and manual dexterity, and
                that dissection and human anatomy are foundations for medical knowledge. As we
                engage both of these texts, historical distance allows students to safely express
                shock or anger and to openly criticize the practitioners as well as the “barbarism”
                of medicine. Students begin to probe their assumptions about professionalism,
                patients’ rights, and even the construction of the body in medical study. </p>
                
            <p> As I will demonstrate, when taught using principles of narrative medicine, including
                the concepts of logotherapy and pathography, Burney’s letter and “The Victim”
                provide an opportunity to connect literary study to the physical therapy program’s
                goals. The texts present relatable healthcare situations, such as receiving a cancer
                diagnosis or studying for an anatomy exam, with a striking strangeness that engages
                students’ emotional and intellectual interest. Ultimately, the texts often lead
                students to not only question the history of the medical professions, but also to
                assess their own personal and professional values and learn how to use emotions to
                facilitate care. As is characteristic of Romantic texts, Burney’s letter and “The
                Victim” stage and elicit powerful sentiment. The sexualized cadaver in “The Victim”
                disgusts students and opens a conversation about clinical distance as the story’s
                own medical students fail to balance clinical distance with empathy. Burney’s letter
                invites students to explain how they might communicate with their own patients
                differently from Burney’s surgical team in order to better support patient quality
                of life.</p></div>

                <head>Narrative Medicine, Logotherapy, and Pathography</head>
                
            <p> Narrative medicine emphasizes the transportability of close reading skills and the
                importance of language to the medical practitioner (Charon et al, “Close Reading”
                np). Narrative medicine also considers forms and effects through two concepts,
                pathography and logotherapy, which are a key focus of my “Healthcare and Literature”
                    course.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Anne
                        Hunsaker Hawkins coined the term “pathography” in
                        <hi rend="italic">Reconstructing Illness: Studies in Pathography. </hi>Purdue
                        UP, 1993. </note> Pathographies, or patient-produced narratives, provide
                audiences with the deeply subjective “extra-clinical” details of illness that
                resonate poignantly and build empathetic connections. As a philosophy, logotherapy
                affirms that narratives have the power to validate experiences of illness and can
                promote recovery.</p>
                
            <p> Narrative medicine uses literary texts to increase provider effectiveness by
                fostering skills in listening, critical thinking, and interpretation. Together,
                these skills are known as “narrative competence, that is, the competence that human
                beings use to absorb, interpret, and respond to stories…it enables the physician to
                practice medicine with empathy, reflection, professionalism, and trustworthiness”
                (Charon, “Narrative Medicine” 1897). Working with diverse kinds of texts ultimately
                equips the practitioner to avoid any one-size-fits-all assumptions, because
                “[e]valuating patients requires the skills that are exercised by the careful reader”
                (Charon et al ,“Literature and Medicine” 601). Much like literary scholars, the
                healthcare provider listens, collates, and interprets metaphors, point of view, and
                repetition. Narrative medicine fundamentally values patients’ stories, whether
                filled with overwhelming detail or loaded with meaningful silences, and views each
                story as much more than an index of symptoms. Narrative competence ensures that the
                practitioner meets the patient where they are (Charon, “Narrative Medicine” 1898).
                Patients can feel compelled to narrate their histories into coherence (Torney 37),
                and they know when they are being heard. </p>
                
            <p> Broadly speaking, writing about traumatic illness or treatment can promote wellbeing.
                Trauma-focused therapy frequently requires patients to write, read, and re-read
                narratives of their trauma because repeated exposures decrease episodes of
                physiological distress (Gurak et al). Pathographies prioritize the patient’s point
                of view within their socio-cultural moment: “in the full, rich, nuanced
                particularity seldom if ever available elsewhere, literary accounts of illness widen
                physician-readers’ knowledge of the concrete realities of being sick and enable
                these readers to appreciate their own patients’ stories of sickness” (Charon et al,
                “Literature and Medicine” 600). Pathographies tap into readers’ emotions. Healthcare
                providers who believe that clinical detachment keeps them unbiased while emotions
                distract from caregiving can benefit from using pathography to discuss how emotions
                can be appropriately leveraged into caregiving. </p>
                
            <p> Clinical detachment, though at times necessary, can become dangerous when
                practitioners are burned out. Yet suffering and illness cannot be ignored, nor can
                narratives in which medical professionals fail to practice effective care. Narrative
                medicine offers safeguards against the exhaustion deadly to careful interactions,
                and against the weariness born of bearing constant witness to suffering. The design
                of my “Healthcare and Literature” course follows a logical chain. Students read
                pathographies to encounter difficult patient experiences. Discussing these
                pathographies together as a class, we share our own strong emotions. In sharing
                these emotions, the emotions are in turn validated. Through such discussions,
                students can therefore begin to see emotions as a meaningful guide to patient care
                and to self care. When students can trust their emotions in this way, their
                wellbeing is preserved. </p>
               
                <div type="section">  
            <head>Burney’s Mastectomy Letter</head>
                    
            <p> I use Burney’s letter early in the semester to foreground the value of
                transhistorical analysis and reading medicine “across history.” Students usually
                expect that surgeons will explain to patients what kind of operation they need and
                what will be done to them. It is difficult for students to imagine surgeons
                lying—deliberately or through omission—because they believe that patients are
                entitled to transparency. However, by reading Burney’s letter they realize that
                their assumptions about surgical professionalism are historically constructed.
                Ultimately, I want students to consider how and why Burney’s surgeons fail to
                communicate honestly with her and what kinds of emotions drive their interactions.
                Before reading Burney’s letter, I have students watch “Being Mortal” (2015), an
                episode of <hi rend="italic">Frontline</hi> in which Atul Gawande addresses how
                difficult it is for oncologists to discuss end-of-life priorities with terminal
                patients, often because they fear hurting a patient’s feelings or being perceived as
                a failure. After discussing Gawande, the class reads Burney’s letter to study the
                ways in which Burney’s surgical team compounds her suffering by avoiding hard
                conversations. Finally, we read Mary Roberts Reinhart’s 1947 interview with Greta
                Palmer for <hi rend="italic">Ladies Home Journal</hi>, “I Had Cancer”, about her
                experience with breast cancer. We discuss these three texts over three class
                periods. I offer framing questions or comments, but most of my time is spent reading
                passages aloud, moderating discussion, and synthesizing students’ comments. They
                then submit a two-page reflection in which they may respond to a single text or the
                triad overall. </p>
                    
            <p> The thematic focus on cancer allows us to confront a troubling topic head-on while
                also inviting us to consider what kinds of things are said about cancer at different
                moments in history. What kinds of assumptions surround the symptoms, diagnosis, and
                treatment plan? What must be communicated? What is at stake? Many of these questions
                lead us to close examinations of language: the words used to describe disease
                reflect social attitudes towards that disease. After watching “Being Mortal”, we
                typically discuss the belief that patients need their doctors to communicate openly,
                even if doctors are worried about arousing strong emotions or coming across as
                failures. Only when doctors manage their own negative emotions can they venture into
                conversations that, though painful, can spare a patient long-term suffering. </p>
                    
            <p> While students have not yet read secondary materials on logotherapy or pathography, I
                introduce these terms to them during our discussion on Burney’s writing. Given the
                letter’s vivid and sometimes gruesome details, it is perfect for linking emotions to
                wellbeing via logotherapy. In addition, Burney’s literary skill infuses her
                pathography, enabling students to emotionally connect with her. I begin class by
                asking students how they felt about the reading: Was the letter hard to understand?
                What feelings did they have about Burney’s experience? They usually confess that
                they had difficulty sustaining attention up to the surgery. Student recall of the
                surgery is very high because of the feelings it elicits, while the “build up” takes
                more work to unpack. I lean into their discomfort with the earlier part of the text
                by having students recount Burney’s experience before the surgery. What results is a
                discussion about the meandering process of illness and treatment, and what students
                expect doctors will do when a patient needs help. </p>
                    
            <p> Students react especially strongly to the way that Burney’s surgical team treats her,
                and they empathize with her. We linger over passages where Burney describes her
                shock and terror. When I ask why Burney feels so terrified, students blame the
                surgeons. The students believe that Burney’s doctors prioritize their own fears and
                concerns over her wellbeing, and also that Burney’s male doctors treat her with a
                destructive delicacy because she is a woman. Moreover, they perceive the surgeons as
                inappropriately emoting. In their eyes, medical professionals should inspire
                confidence in their patients instead of expressing fear and anxiety. When Burney is
                told that a surgery is unavoidable, Dr. Larrey has tears in his eyes: “All were
                silent, and Dr. Larrey, I saw, hid himself nearly behind my Sofa… I saw all hope was
                over. I called upon them to speak. M. Dubois then, after a long and unintelligible
                harangue, from his own disturbance, pronounced my doom” (435-436). Students
                interpret Larrey’s hiding as childish, and Dubois’s “long and unintelligible
                harangue” as an inadequate effort to communicate clearly. In this respect, students
                see Burney’s doctors as incompetent because they cannot balance appropriate empathy
                with confidence. The surgeons’ poor communication compounds Burney’s helplessness
                and disempowerment. </p>
                    
            <p> The disempowerment escalates as Burney must fully submit to the surgeons. While
                Burney does not mention embarrassment at baring her breast to a male doctor, she
                comes close to expressing humiliation: “I was compelled, however, to submit to
                taking off my long robe de Chambre, which I had meant to retain – ah, then, how did
                I think of My Sisters! – not one, at so dreadful an instant, at hand, to protect –
                adjust—guard me” (440). Students interpret this passage as a commentary on gender.
                Burney realizes that only a woman could understand what she feels, yet her surgery
                is spearheaded by men who have demonstrated little interest in her wellbeing. A
                particularly poignant endorsement once came from a student who had experienced
                breast biopsy. She said that Burney’s account collapsed historical distance and made
                a Romantic text accessible. She knew the rawness. She knew the pull of modesty
                during disrobing and the helplessness in relinquishing it. She felt affirmed in her
                connection to Burney. It was like a shared triumph. This is an example of how the
                upsetting emotions elicited by pathography can lead a student to an insight about
                caregiving. Burney’s narrative allowed a student to think of herself as both patient
                and practitioner. By powerfully empathizing with Burney she could ask herself what
                responsibilities the surgeons abdicated and appreciate Burney’s fortitude. Difficult
                emotions thus become a gateway to assessing patient care. </p>
                    
            <p> Taken together, Burney’s letter and Gawande’s “Being Mortal” bring students to
                recognize that communication issues have long plagued medical interactions and that
                a fear of emotions is at the root of the problem. But while Gawande emphasizes
                including patients in conversation, making sure they understand their disease and
                asking about their goals and priorities, Burney’s doctors bowl her over, and in the
                end they don’t protect her from any suffering. Patients expect doctors to take the
                lead, but doctors may be unprepared for the emotional nature of conversations about
                critical illnesses. What is the patient’s understanding of their disease? What are
                their priorities? Gawande insists that medical professionals should avoid instilling
                false hope. He advises allowing patients to emote in whatever way they need to,
                since patient personalities differ. I ask students, as future physical therapists,
                what kinds of difficult conversations they may have to have with patients and how
                Gawande’s claims and Burney’s experience help them to think about what they should
                take into consideration when talking to patients. </p></div>
                
             <div type="section">    
            <head>“The Victim”</head>
                 
            <p> After discussing Burney and Gawande, I transition students into texts on anatomy and
                surgical education during the Romantic period, focusing on Ruth Richardson’s
                historical analysis of the 1832 Anatomy Act called <hi rend="italic">Death,
                    Dissection, and the Destitute</hi> and the short story “The Victim” (1831). What
                were surgeons taught? How were they taught? Can we find in other texts examples of
                emotions interfering with patient care? While Burney’s doctors emoted in
                uncontrolled ways, Richardson’s <hi rend="italic">Death, Dissection and the
                    Destitute</hi> shows how clinical detachment, or emotionlessness, could be taken
                to such an extreme that patients were treated as objects. She argues that during the
                nineteenth century, the emotional distance that medical professionals adopted in
                order to dissect human beings took on new stakes.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Britain’s 1832 Anatomy Act dictated that “people
                        too poor to pay for their own funerals” could be used for dissection
                        (Richardson 50). This abuse of the dependent poor showed how Romantic
                        surgeons’ clinical detachment could encourage a callous attitude towards
                        patients. </note></p>
            
            <p> The dark fictional landscape of “The Victim” presents the dangers of clinical
                detachment when medical study overshadows the main characters’ social awareness.
                Dudley, the narrator, is a medical student. He and his roommate St. Clare order a
                cadaver from a resurrectionist to study for an examination on the arteries of the
                neck. Passing this exam has high stakes for St. Clare: once he receives his
                certification, he will be able to marry his fiancée Emily and receive a significant
                sum of money. Dudley receives the cadaver late one evening and directs the
                resurrectionists to take it to the closet in his bedroom. Upon unwrapping the body,
                he is astounded to see the most beautiful woman he’s ever encountered. Rather than
                dissecting her, he kisses her, sketches her, and falls asleep on her exposed
                “inanimate breast, which had been deprived too soon of existence to know the pure
                joy of pillowing a fellow-heart it loved” (190). When St. Clare arrives home, he is
                devastated to learn that the cadaver is Emily. Time passes, St. Clare dies, and
                Dudley ends up treating a man who confesses to the murder of Emily. The story’s
                somewhat heavy-handed moral comes with the horrifying revelation that St. Clare’s
                love interest had been abducted and murdered because resurrectionists found it more
                convenient than digging up a dead body. Once Dudley realizes his complicity in the
                trafficking of the dead, he “renounc[es] the scalpel for ever” (193). </p>
                 
            <p> Students invariably discuss the irreplaceable importance of hands-on dissection.
                Students in the DPT program have the privilege of completing a yearlong cadaver lab
                on campus during their undergraduate curriculum. They know that dissection is a
                vital privilege. Some anticipate it with anxiety, while others look forward to it
                for years, but most have not thought about it critically. “The Victim” provides us
                with an opportunity to talk about students’ emotional experiences by using the
                characters in the story as our case study. </p>
                 
            <p> Before we begin discussing the story, we analyze images from John Bell’s and Govard
                Bidloo’s Romantic-era anatomical atlases so that they can get a sense of what
                anatomical study looked like before the historical development of the clinical gaze.
                I ask them what they could learn from these images and what their reactions are.
                They find them frightening and compelling, but not scientific. When I show them
                these images, they even more deeply understand why Dudley and St. Clare feel the
                <hi rend="italic">need </hi>to dissect to prepare.
                Illustrations from John Bell’s 1810 <hi rend="italic">Engravings of the Bones,
                    Muscles, and Joints</hi>, for example, do not meet their criteria for a didactic
                anatomy textbook. They marvel that students learned anything at all when textbooks
                were so encumbered with emotional valences and chaotic excesses.<note place="foot"> Janis McLarren Caldwell’s essay
                        “The Strange Death of the Animated Cadaver” could be taught in tandem with
                        J. Bell and “The Victim.” To extend discussion into the Victorian period,
                        Ruth Richardson’s <hi rend="italic">The Making of Mr. Gray’s Anatomy</hi>
                        provides an outstanding analysis of what made Gray
                        <hi rend="italic">the </hi>game-changer in anatomical
                        textbook illustration and design.</note> Through these images my
                students also speculate on how anatomists felt when dissecting and sketching their
                cadavers. John Bell’s images especially communicate a horror and sadness that
                students believe has no place in the dissecting room, even if they anticipate
                feeling fear or sadness when it is their turn in the lab. Even Dudley calls
                dissection a “necessary, but revolting, part of the profession” (189). Most
                importantly, “The Victim” gives a sexual torque to dissection’s insult. The sight of
                Emily’s cadaver stirs up erotic feelings in Dudley. He feels dissection will
                dishonor her, but he cannot resist her beauty. He experiences a warping of his
                ethical and erotic drives: 
                
            <quote>never till that instant had I seen aught that came so near to my most ideal picture
                of female loveliness; even though the last touches had been painted by the hand of
                Death … I had almost brought myself to meet with indifference the objects which are
                found on the dissecting table, [but] I could not gaze on one so young, so very fair,
                without feeling the springs of pity dissolve within me. (189) </quote>
                
            Dudley is stirred away from clinical distance toward more altruistic thinking. But
                his activated emotions lead him to a series of activities that starkly emphasizes
                his masculinity, agency, and dominance in contrast to her feminine and unresisting
                vulnerability. Receiving Emily’s body, unwrapping it, examining it, opening her eye,
                kissing her, sketching her, cutting off her hair, then finally dissecting her: these
                acts show Emily’s sexual undoing as a drawn-out process culminating in dissection. </p>
                
            <p> While students do not interpret this as a rape scene, I read out loud Dudley’s
                description of Emily’s body and his behaviors to push them to see the eroticized
                power dynamics at play in “The Victim.” I also show them anatomist Robert Knox’s
                1828 nude sketch of Mary Paterson’s cadaver.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Richardson details Knox’s treatment of Paterson’s
                        body: “men had come to draw her body, comments had been made upon her
                        physical attributes and Knox had even had her body preserved in spirits so
                        that he could continue to indulge in necrophiliac voyeurism”
                    (96).</note> This allows them to imagine that Dudley’s sketch of Emily may
                have looked to them more like an eroticized image of a nude, consenting, living
                woman than like a dead body. I also remind them that in the early nineteenth
                century, anatomists were viewed with disgust and distrust because they meddled in
                guts, and their affiliation with surgeons linked them to manual craft and
                butchery—not intellect. Excess of clinical distance, thinking of humans as inert
                material, facilitates the cavalier ordering and receiving of Emily’s remains. The
                ensuing objectification enables Dudley’s Robert Knox-esque abuse, even as it is
                masked as a misdirection of socially appropriate chivalrous emotion. We take time to
                identify the thoughts Dudley has, the emotions he feels, and the behaviors that
                follow from these. </p>
                 
            <p> While students cannot imagine admiring the beauty of a cadaver, they <hi
                    rend="italic">can</hi> imagine feeling exhilarated to see anatomical structures.
                They can also imagine being unable to “turn off” their feelings to achieve the
                clinical distance they need to dissect. None of them, I certainly hope, are at risk
                of sexualizing their cadavers, but I ask them what kinds of behaviors might be
                similar to Dudley’s behavior, such as making a joke about a cadaver’s appearance or
                taking photos. Most students share that they are afraid of what they will think and
                feel in the lab. They believe that to be studious, they must be <hi rend="italic"
                    >somber</hi>. This is where we really hit on appropriate emotions and coping.
                They can feel sad, frightened, excited, nervous, and even silly. But there are ways
                to experience all of these feelings, to accept them, and to use them as guides to
                engage their learning. If they are sad, they can talk about it. If they are excited,
                they can express it. If they are afraid, that’s okay, too. As narrative medicine can
                teach us, registering and exploring these emotions can make my students more
                compassionate and more effective medical professionals. I often share my own
                thoughts and feelings about the cadaver lab and how I have coped.</p>
                 
            <p> We come back to the dissecting experience twice more in the last
                three weeks of class. First, we read Pauline Chen’s 2012 work of creative
                nonfiction, “Resurrectionist,” in which Chen describes her first dissection as a med
                student. The essay allows us to discuss what a current-day student thinks, feels,
                and experiences before, during, and after dissecting. I again ask students how they
                feel about their upcoming dissection – are they anxious, excited, worried? This
                discussion is usually animated, and it’s clear that students are relieved to hear
                their peers’ concerns. Then, I collaborate with the Anatomy I lab professor who
                meets us in the cadaver lab where students will eventually be doing their
                dissections. My students have the opportunity to meet students who are currently
                dissecting. We give students time to experience their sensations and talk about
                their feelings first. Then, we open the body bags and let the students talk through
                their thoughts and feelings. Anatomy I students share what they thought and felt
                about dissecting, and how they coped. They show my students their cadavers and
                dissections. This has been an enormously fruitful collaboration. The Anatomy I
                professor knew that his students at times had struggled emotionally, and we both
                anticipate that the collaboration will equip future anatomy students with more
                resources for addressing these struggles. My students report great appreciation for
                the experience in written reflections, in the class discussion following the lab,
                and in their course evaluations. They feel that when it will be their turn to
                dissect, they will be able to fully engage intellectually instead of worrying about
                getting sick or crying. Organizing this collaboration has required emotional labor
                on my part, but supporting students during a difficult confrontation with a cadaver
                has afforded me another opportunity to validate their difficult emotions. It also
                has allowed me to show students how we can work through sadness or fear. For
                example, one semester I sat in the hallway with a sobbing student. I listened to
                her, and we developed a plan to walk into the lab together. She asked me to walk
                ahead of her, to keep up a steady stream of chatter, and to lead her to a table
                where a few of her friends were. Students know that they need to work through the
                discomfort of seeing cadavers but have few guided opportunities to do so. Visiting
                the cadaver lab has also given me a chance to really communicate to students that I
                care about their wellbeing, and I am able to welcome and withstand their feelings. I
                am, in other words, modeling how I accept emotions as part of my profession. </p></div>
                 
                 <div type="section">    
                     <head>“The Victim”>Student Reactions</head>
                     
            <p> The medical worlds of literary texts like Burney’s letter and “The Victim” are
                unimaginable to students pursuing degrees in health science—a world in which a
                mastectomy is performed on an inadequately informed, fully conscious woman by a
                clutch of terrified and silent surgeons, and a world in which anatomy students
                become sexual predators complicit in murder. My students’ world is one in which
                cancer is openly discussed, where cadaver lab is part of their undergraduate
                curriculum, and where surgeons are stereotypically the apotheosis of efficient
                protocol. My students are not ready for the butchery, for the emotionally labile
                surgical team, for the woman who holds her own breast on a pile of old mattresses.
                Nor are they ready for the student falling weeping onto and kissing his
                study-cadaver in his bedroom the night before an exam. The strength of these texts,
                then, is their medical uncanniness. They are familiar enough to comprehend and alien
                enough to shock students into engaged reflection. They bring to the surface
                students’ assumptions about appropriate study and care and thus embed them more
                mindfully in the present. Burney’s letter and “The Victim” invite conversations
                about clinical detachment as both necessary to practice surgery and dissection and
                also something that can be taken to a dangerous extreme. By reading these
                nineteenth-century texts, students come to the conclusion that empathy cannot be
                sacrificed in medical care. Even though medical professionals face complicated
                emotional challenges that can make effective care difficult, the patient’s
                experience must always be weighed and appreciated. Narrative medicine makes it clear
                that this leads to better outcomes for patients and can prevent other negative
                effects for medical professionals.</p>
                     
            <p> My “Healthcare and Literature” students connect to the texts in three significant
                ways: as learners with professional aspirations, as erstwhile and future patients,
                and as individuals who want to change lives. Official Student Evaluation Surveys
                have confirmed that students find the texts relevant to their future professions.
                They appreciate being introduced to communication challenges, and they can express
                the importance of language when working with patients. Students have stated that
                they appreciate discussing difficult medical scenarios. They know that they will
                have hard conversations when they ask a patient why they aren’t completing their
                prescribed exercises or when they resist instilling false hope in a postoperative
                athlete who will likely not comfortably play their sport again. Part of my joy in
                working with future physical therapists is their belief in recovery and triumph.
                They are optimistic and excited to help future patients. My ancillary joy is
                mediating their journey, even if in a small way, to becoming comfortable with
                situations where they may feel powerless, overwhelmed, angry, or frustrated—and
                being able to persist in the midst of those feelings. By normalizing difficult
                conversations, they can, I hope, take comfort, feel prepared, and know they are not
                alone. </p></div>
