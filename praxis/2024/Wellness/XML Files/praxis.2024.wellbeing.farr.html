               <h1><span class="head">Improvisational Accessibility and Romanticism</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In this essay, I explore the connections between accessibility and Romanticism to
               discuss how we can help the disabled students in our courses achieve well-being, something
               that is often difficult for them to attain in institutions of higher learning (Francis
               et al). As one psychological study puts it, well-being is not necessarily about health
               or autonomy or quality of life; rather, it is an equilibrium that one finds between
               the fluctuating forces of challenges and resources (Dodge et. al 230). When one's
               challenges overwhelm one's resources, well-being–the central component of this equation–dips,
               rendering it elusive. The authors of said study use a see-saw analogy to illustrate
               a dynamic relationship: <span class="quote">‘In essence, stable well-being is when individuals have the psychological, social
                  and physical resources they need to meet a particular psychological, social and/or
                  physical challenge. When individuals have more challenges than resources, the see-saw
                  dips, along with their well-being, and vice-versa. (230) ’</span> This definition of well-being takes into account resources–or what we might think
               of as accessibility or access–that we extend to students. Well-being is therefore
               the product of a shifting, inverse association, one which we have some degree of control
               over in our classrooms. This is not to say that our influence in this regard is infinite,
               but we can play a significant role in cultivating student well-being by opening up
               space in our classrooms for accessibility. We regularly offer students challenges,
               which are necessary for their intellectual growth, but do we provide them with the
               resources to help them maintain their well-being? The answer to this question, I think,
               has to do with a pedagogical disposition that we can cultivate over time.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, it is our ethical responsibility to educate ourselves about access to
               eradicate the barriers that we unwittingly reproduce. The Romanticism classroom is
               an ideal space in which we can work toward this objective because the authors we teach
               are often oriented in uncannily similar ways to access in the disability studies tradition.
               Accessibility and well-being are, in fact, at the core of some strains of Romantic
               thought. In the coming paragraphs, I consider how we can foster an approach to accessibility
               that is improvisational and inclusive and which aligns with those aspects of Romanticism
               in which disability is a foundation for personal and community transformation. </p>
            <p>I will begin, however, by discussing how accessibility helps me, a deaf academic.
               In a profession that demands constant vocal exchange–in conference panels, meetings,
               and classrooms–my hearing profile poses challenges. I've been hearing impaired in
               the moderately severe range for some time now, but D/deaf studies has given me a framework
               for thinking about my deafness as “a distinct way of being in the world, one that
               opens up perceptions, perspectives, and insights that are less common to the majority
               of hearing persons” (Bauman and Murray xv). This powerful paradigm shift has given
               me new ways of understanding my deafness. Still, despite the convincing philosophical
               underpinnings of “Deaf Gain,” the oral landscape of academia drains me. Trying to
               keep up with the spoken words of colleagues and students often leaves me exhausted.
               </p>
            <p>In my daily run-ins with the challenging demands of verbal communication, I have learned
               to express my access needs to friends and strangers alike. It is in these exchanges
               that I experience what I think of as improvisational accessibility. In characterizing
               accessibility as improvisational, I mean that access often occurs “spontaneously,
               without preparation, or on the spur of the moment” (OED Online). Access often happens
               when people make “do with what is available” in response to varying circumstances
               (OED Online). Improvisation is usually necessary when interacting with disabled people
               like me. Disabled bodyminds invoke extraordinary circumstances because we are not
               accounted for in the organization of social spaces and institutions. <a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>In my case, improvisational accessibility occurs after I've presented a paper at a
               conference and the panel chair repeats a question I can’t hear during the Q&amp;A, or
               when colleagues readily comply with my request to use speech-to-text transcription
               apps on our phones if we are in a loud setting. These may seem like small tokens,
               but they enable me to participate in conversations that would otherwise be inaccessible.
               In turn, my well-being is enhanced as I access the resources necessary to meet the
               challenge of vocal exchange. In my experience, the well-being of disabled people–our
               access to resources to meet the challenges of an ableist world–is to some degree reliant
               on an improvisational mindset in others. </p>
            <p>As in these personal examples, in which colleagues interact with me in unanticipated
               ways, improvisational accessibility in the Romanticism classroom denotes an openness
               to the unexpected as we find ways to make “do with what is available” to us at any
               given moment. In this political moment of austerity, we might not always have the
               resources that we need. We can, however, become sensitized to the access needs of
               our students, and we can improvise to grant them access if we develop a flexible orientation
               in our teaching habits. </p>
            <p>Such improvisational principles are evident in Wordsworth’s conception of inspired
               poetry. In his “Preface to the Lyrical Ballads (1802),” William Wordsworth writes,
               <span class="quote">‘For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: but though
                  this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached, were never produced on any
                  variety of subjects but by a man, who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility,
                  had also thought long and deeply. For our continued influxes of feeling are modified
                  and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the representatives of all our past
                  feelings; and, as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to
                  each other we discover what is really important to men, so, by the repetition and
                  continuance of this act, our feelings will be connected with important subjects, till
                  at length, if we be originally possessed of much sensibility, such habits of mind
                  will be produced. (598) ’</span> Wordsworth regards good poetry as the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.”
               But the act of writing such poetry does not just happen suddenly; rather, it is the
               product of years of studied reflection. Through feeling that is “modified and directed
               by…thoughts” with “repetition and continuance,” poets develop “habits of mind” that
               yield the creation of poems that seem spontaneous. Like the creation of excellent
               poetry, teaching accessibly is a craft to be studied and developed. As in Wordsworth’s
               preface, to teach accessibly, we must develop “habits of mind” that allow for improvisation.
               As we gain more experience in attending to the access needs of our students, we build
               this mindset, and over time we learn to skillfully stray from our lesson plans and
               expand our curriculum to make room for all students.</p>
            <p>When we deviate from planned time to account for all of the bodyminds in the room,
               we crip the classroom; that is, we confront the ableism that is embedded in our collective
               consciousness and pedagogical habits to build more inclusive communities with students.
               Indeed, finding ways to build “crip time” into our classrooms is critical for accommodating
               disabled students, as Margaret Price has argued. Price argues that we break from the
               traditional classroom, which she thinks of as a “kairotic space.” In using “kairotic,”
               Price invokes the classical cognate kairos which translates to “the opportune or appropriate
               time.” As kairotic spaces, classrooms “tend to be run under strict time constraints”
               (63). A kairotic space is one in which “knowledge is produced and power is exchanged”
               (60). Crucially, as Price argues, this time-sensitive approach to pedagogy excludes
               students with mental disabilities, among others.2 To resist kairos, we should be mindful
               of how we organize the syllabus, how we grade participation and attendance, and how
               we give feedback (64). Price also encourages us to learn Universal Design principles
               so that we can offer multiple pathways into the content we teach. 3 All of this requires
               that we find “ways to move” around the classroom, and, I would add, to improvise as
               we interact with students and progress through the semester (58). These are no small
               tasks, but as Price shows, access is an objective to work toward rather than a destination
               to which one arrives. As we learn to establish crip time through pedagogical improvisation,
               we mediate kairotic space for disabled students to create more accessibility in the
               classroom. </p>
            <p>Access never looks quite the same from class to class because contexts change according
               to the students that compose our classrooms. This highly individualized approach to
               access is one that also resonates with the phenomenological character of Romanticism.
               Tanya Titchkosky conceives of access as an embodied experience in which wonder plays
               a key role. “Access,” Titchkosky argues, “is an interpretive relation between bodies”
               (3). Such an approach to access requires us to be aware of the other individuals with
               whom we share a particular space. It requires active communication and sensitive interpretation.
               Titchkosky urges us to conceive of access as “collective action or exploration” (12).
               The “politics of wonder” that we should work toward is composed in part of “a wondering
               about that which organizes bodies and social spaces and their worlds of meaning” (15).
               Wonder is also, of course, a Romantic conceit. Samuel Taylor Coleridge conceives of
               wonder as central to philosophical inquiry: “In wonder all philosophy began: in wonder
               it ends . . . But the first wonder is the offspring of ignorance; the last is the
               Parent of Adoration” (qtd in Scott 229). According to Coleridge, childlike wonder
               is a catalyst to philosophical reflection, which in turn enables us to reach a “higher
               form of the emotion” and to access truths that produce a new kind of wonder based
               on rational principles.4 To build the wonder of accessibility into our classrooms,
               we should engage in dialogue, reflect collectively, and develop multiple entry points
               for students to access the content we teach. This pedagogical process is at the heart
               of Romantic epistemologies. </p>
            <p>Moreover, access is a labor of justice and a starting point for the building of community.
               In their Disability Visibility Project, Sandy Ho, Mia Mingus, and Alice Wong conceive
               of access “as not only about logistics, but about deepening our shared humanity and
               dignity, growing access intimacy with each other and an opportunity to create more
               justice and love in our world.” Elsewhere, Mingus reminds us that access should be
               “collective and interdependent.” Access should not be a burden that disabled people
               alone carry, but ideally is a principle that is shaped among a collective. This looks
               different in every classroom and has much to do with who we are as instructors. </p>

               a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible

               the purposes of this essay, allows for a broad conception of student engagement in
