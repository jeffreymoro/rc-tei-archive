            <p> James Robert Allard</p>
            <p>Full disclosure of an open secret up front: I am not a medical historian. I study,
                teach, and write about literature and culture, spending the bulk of my time with the
                texts, people, institutions, and events of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                century in Britain. Much of what I do as a researcher is marked by strong interests
                in the history of medicine, especially surgery, and in how “Medicine”—as
                institution, as techne, as embodied in the people who inhabit or encounter its
                communities (if sometimes only temporarily and perhaps under duress)—talked about
                itself to itself, articulated its means and ends to those not trained in its ways,
                and how it was in turn represented by “outsiders” in a variety of texts and
                contexts. But those interests, at least in those terms or with any degree of
                specificity, rarely (and rarely easily) find their way into my classrooms, and
                normally not at the undergraduate level. Nevertheless, as I imagine is the case with
                many of us, my thinking about my teaching practices and research interests, which in
                important ways are quite different, are guided by a few fundamental questions that
                have haunted me since my early days as a graduate student: what does it mean to
                “have” a body? what are the various forces that shape how we think about that
                meaning? who is authorized to answer those questions, and how is that authority
                built and acknowledged? how have shifting ideas about the body affected shifting
                ideas about “wellbeing”? Since those early grad student days, I have pursued those
                questions and sought various answers in the spaces where literary studies and
                medical history overlap, and I have perhaps only lately come to realize just how
                deeply my teaching philosophy and practices have been shaped by those efforts.</p>
            <p>In what follows, I track two parallel narratives. The first begins with what I have
                always believed to be the two moments that crystallized those fundamental questions,
                and the second interweaves examples from some of the classes that I have taught—from
                a standard second-year Romantics survey, to an Honours seminar on Keats, to a
                graduate seminar on “Romantic Bodies”—where those questions have been most firmly on
                display, often in ways that are not at first glance obvious. My goal here, as in the
                classroom, is to urge greater attention to what I have called, borrowing from
                Francis Barker, the “bodiliness” of Romantic-era texts: to demonstrate what happens
                to our understanding of key features of Romanticism when we attend, first, to the
                at-times overwhelming number and variety of bodies that are and always have been at
                the heart of a period often seen as celebrating the <hi rend="italic"
                >meta</hi>physical, the sublime, the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling” in
                one way or another, and, second, to some of the ways that those bodies were
                represented and experienced by the writers and readers of the period. And I would
                add that any discussion of “wellbeing,” however we are defining it—and the present
                volume gives us a sense of just how varied and complex the definitions can be—must
                at some point come to terms with the bodiliness, what I have called elsewhere the
                “body consciousness,” of the period. It is of course true that health and wellbeing
                are more than physical, quantifiable phenomena, but it is equally true that
                treatments of bodies often presuppose, explicitly or not, fairly or not, what is and
                is not “normal” or “healthy” or “well,” and thus any conception of one is
                necessarily caught up in a conception of the other. In this period, in particular,
                whether we engage with figures obsessed with Brunonian notions of excitability,
                emboldened by the pioneering anatomical and surgical work of John and William
                Hunter, or even wedded to an already-out-dated-but-still-popular theory of the
                Galenic humours, “wellbeing” had to contend with the complexities of our flesh
                worlds, to a greater or lesser degree. In the end, I seek—once again, both here and
                in my teaching—to encourage more sustained attention to the ways in which our
                understanding of our own material realities both enable and inhibit our engagements
                with the Romantic period and some of its key texts and ideas. </p>
            <p>As a student in a graduate seminar, nearly twenty years ago now, while having a
                fascinating and productive group discussion about Judith Butler’s notion of
                performativity, I remember an overwhelming sense of frustration that finally made me
                blurt out, “But what about the body?!” I understood, I thought, the idea of a
                disconnect between sex and gender, that effacing the distinction was
                heteronormative, that what were often assumed to be “essential” characteristics of
                gendered behaviour—including, among other things, body language—were learned. Where
                I struggled, though, was in coming to terms with where the body was, with what it
                    <hi rend="italic">meant</hi>, in this dynamic: is it the stage for the
                performance? the costume performers wear? the ground upon which the struggle of
                identity is fought? the prize at the end of a contest? I have since come to realize
                that my frustration had less to do with a lack of philosophical or theoretical
                understanding—still, obviously a distinct possibility—and much more to do with my
                inability to effectively pose the question, to deploy a vocabulary of interrogation
                that would help to frame an answer, however tentative and temporary it might be. And
                that frustration haunts me to this day: though I have since developed various
                strategies (grounded in a material historicist approach) and encountered
                vocabularies (leaning heavily on Foucault, especially in those early days) that have
                helped me to propose certain tactical and generative ways of asking and answering
                such questions, I remain aware of how far I am from a truly satisfying answer and
                that students at all levels experience similar frustrations as they encounter the
                ideas and questions that will haunt them. It is precisely the memory of the
                frustration itself, that desperate moment when I <hi rend="italic">needed to
                    know</hi>, even more than the details of the conversation, that I carry with me
                into every lecture hall and seminar room. To be sure, the question I asked was
                prompted by my own idiosyncratic concerns and interests, but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >need </hi>that drove me to shout it out is, I think, something common to all
                who read and think, perhaps especially to our students.</p>
            <p>The second moment came about a year later, when I had just begun the process of
                trying to develop a working proposal for my dissertation, which would eventually
                become my book <hi rend="italic">Romanticism, Medicine, and the Poet’s Body</hi>.
                While watching a football game, I listened as the announcers talked about an injured
                player. I was told that “an MRI had revealed a partially torn ACL” and that “he
                probably won’t need surgery but will likely be out six to eight weeks.” These
                statements were delivered in as matter-of-fact a tone as can be imagined, as if both
                the announcers and everyone listening knew exactly what all of this meant. To be
                sure, sports fans have heard a great deal about players’ injuries, prognoses, and
                treatments, and many of these terms would be familiar in this context, but I was
                struck at this moment by the assumption that almost everyone listening (and,
                obviously, the announcers themselves—a broadcaster and an ex-athlete, neither a
                trained medical professional, one would think) could be assumed to have enough of a
                working knowledge of human anatomy, of specialized acronyms, of what
                state-of-the-art medical imaging technology could do, of specific medical procedures
                and their outcomes, that these statements could be offered without explanation and
                heard without confusion. Of course, had I not been actively thinking about the
                circulation of medical discourse in the public sphere I would not have thought twice
                about this exchange, but that’s precisely the point: our thinking about our own
                bodies, which would seem to be perhaps a most instinctive, intuitive operation
                concerning the most “natural” of things, has always been marked if not entirely
                dominated by the presence of hyperspecialized discourses—religious, scientific,
                etc.—that the majority of us have no earthly reason to know. For those of us steeped
                in Foucault and other theorists of power and discourse, this is hardly a new
                insight, but that experience provided a fantastic, real-world example that helped me
                to concretize my own thinking and that still serves a key pedagogical function in my
                classrooms. I like to frame this issue with a reference to Roy Porter’s simple and
                yet still profound claim that the body is <hi rend="italic">always </hi>“the body
                in,” that the body we encounter, whether “in” flesh or text or image, is always
                medicalized or gendered or raced or classed or any one of a thousand other things or
                some combination thereof, that seeing or talking about or even imagining a body,
                even our own, as somehow pre- or non-discursive is impossible. The seeming immediacy
                of bodies often prompts immediate and understandable resistance to this kind of
                theorizing which can often just as quickly prompt the kind of examination of
                assumptions at the heart of so many pedagogical encounters.</p>
            <p>But what does any of this have to do with teaching Romanticism, with the day-to-day
                classroom experiences of survey classes and advanced seminars that are part of a
                degree in English Language and Literature? For me at least, the answer is easy: this
                has <hi rend="italic">everything </hi>to do with teaching, and especially with
                teaching Romanticism. One of the running themes in my version of the second-year
                Romantics survey course<note xml:id="ftn2" place="end" n="2">. I usually adopt
                    Duncan Wu’s wonderful <hi rend="italic">Romanticism: An Anthology </hi>for use
                    in my undergraduate classrooms; the texts and authors I mention here are the
                    selections provided in that anthology.</note> at my institution (a twelve-week
                sprint through the period), is framed by the question “who controls the vocabulary?”
                When discussing British responses to the French Revolution, for example, I work to
                show how Burke, Wollstonecraft, Paine, Godwin, Thelwall, Williams, and other key
                players in the 1790s pamphlet wars were seeking to claim the right to define the key
                terms of the debate: “natural,” “revolution,” “nation,” and so on. I then carry that
                same framework into our readings of, for example, the “Preface” to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lyrical Ballads</hi>, Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi>, and Smith’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elegiac Sonnets</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>where we encounter
                similar efforts to stake the same claim with terms like “poetry,” “poet,” and,
                again, “nature.” In many cases—in Wordsworth’s loaded observation that “poetry” is a
                “word of very disputed meaning,” or Wollstonecraft’s challenge to Burke to remember
                that a nation is “people” and not an abstraction—it’s relatively easy to demonstrate
                the extraordinary self-reflexivity on display, the efforts of Romantic-era writers
                not just to use words but to interrogate their use, engage with their meanings and
                effects, and reflect on their role in making the things they were ostensibly only
                describing. Thus, when we encounter, say, texts that consciously participate in or
                critique the cultures of sensibility (More’s <hi rend="italic">Sensibility: A
                    Poem</hi>), or that foreground the physical acts of reading and writing (Blake’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>), or that explore
                Romantic-era notions of gender (Barbauld’s “Washing Day” or Keats’ “The Eve of St.
                Agnes”), it doesn’t take much to show that the same process is at work with the word
                “body” and its cognates, and to further show what that process does to the sense of
                “bodiliness” in those texts. More shows us problematic bodies that perform and
                “conscious” ones that read and critique that performance, and having students
                generate a simple list of references to bodies, body parts, and bodily responses
                (sighing, blushing, crying, etc.) either on the spot in class or in their reading
                notes prior to our meeting helps to underscore the deeply embodied nature of
                sensibility as she uses and critiques it. Blake shows us reading and writing as
                distinctly physical, material activities, not disembodied concepts, and introducing
                students to the plates as provided in the digital <hi rend="italic">William Blake
                    </hi><hi rend="italic">Archive</hi> encourages them to see the centrality of
                embodied, sensual experience in Blake’s thought. Barbauld and Keats show us bodies
                that act and react in the world, bodies as subjects and as objects, and emphasizing
                the degree to which they foreground the materiality of labour, of love, of lust, and
                of loss to show how they mark and are marked by bodies encourages students to see
                these ideas as more than abstractions.</p>
            <p>In terms of course content, then, such efforts let us explore in a productively
                contained way some of the period’s key terms and ideas, while also ensuring that we
                can see the interconnectedness of those terms that lead some to identify enough of a
                sense of cohesion to label the period, if often problematically, as Romantic. In
                terms of classroom practice, two features of this particular class and my teaching
                style more generally come to mind. First, I’m always conscious of my own bodiliness
                in the classroom space: to teach is, of course, to perform, and that is most true
                and most evident for me in the lecture hall. I’ve been told (not as a criticism, I
                think!) on more than one occasion that my lectures are “high energy,” as I
                constantly move about the space, often using exaggerated gestures and changing the
                projection of my voice (I may or may not frequently shout and, very occasionally,
                sing. . . badly) for dramatic effect. While I am an advocate for student-centred
                learning, I work to make my voice and embodied self the focal point of the
                classroom, giving students a single, if moving, target in the space of the lecture
                hall—in an effort tokeep them engaged and interested, yes, but also to force a
                particular kind of deeply focussed attention without (usually) the distraction or
                relief of PowerPoint and other audio-visual technologies. The point is less to make
                my body the focus (which isn’t always ideal or productive or even possible for all
                    instructors<note xml:id="ftn3" place="end" n="3">. Though dwelling on the issue
                    is outside the scope of this essay, I should say here that there is perhaps no
                    greater indicator of my own privilege that I, as a tenured, white, straight male
                    instructor, feel free to centre my body in the classroom in this way, and have
                    never really been forced to think about the ramifications of that centring in
                    any but the most superficial of ways. </note>), but to use my
                bodiliness—gestures, voice, movements within the space, etc.—to create a single,
                dynamic point of reference to which students can return when they look up from their
                texts and notes. Second, I often encourage students to read aloud so that they
                might, first, hear things that they don’t see on the page, and, second, so that they
                develop a sense of the physicality of the reading experience: if I am to argue for
                an attention to the body consciousness of Romantic writing, I think it’s equally
                crucial to emphasize the bodies that are engaging with that writing. It helps, to be
                sure, that many of the writers and texts we spend time with often dwell on what it
                means to read aloud. Whether we’re discussing William Hazlitt’s fascination with
                Coleridge as a preacher in “My First Acquaintance with Poets” or John Thelwall’s
                fiery renditions of Godwin for crowds in the 1790s, and whether talking about the
                Cockney rhymes of Hunt and Keats that are only heard when they are spoken or Joanna
                Baillie’s demand that her plays be recognized as scripts for performance, I’m always
                careful to remind students that an attention to the bodiliness of Romantic-texts
                doesn’t just mean pointing to the bodies represented in them; it also means engaging
                with the bodies, all of them, that write, speak, and read. Until drafting this
                essay—and I owe profound thanks to the volume’s editors for this—I never really
                thought in depth about the fact that about a third of the majors in my department
                are actually Concurrent Education students, and thus in the process of becoming
                teachers themselves, so a more critically self-aware attention to the embodied
                nature of teaching and of learning may serve to help them think more reflexively
                about how they will lead their own classrooms one day, even as it foregrounds those
                aspects of the period that I find most fascinating. Thus, in relation both to the
                questions and topics I ask students to think about and in an awareness of the
                classroom as a communal space we bodily inhabit, I’m working to model ways of
                navigating the often maddeningly complex terrain of terms, theories, and approaches
                that make up Literary Studies by demonstrating, on one hand, that the Romantics
                themselves were faced with similar frustrations, and, on the other, how I as a

            <p>Similar efforts to encourage a sense of critical self-awareness that works in tandem
                with the material are manifest in an Honours seminar I sometimes teach called “Keats
                and Romanticism.” We spend the first three of twelve three-hour sessions reading as
                many of Keats’ poems and letters as we can in the time we have (most of the
                selections in Jeffrey Cox’s splendid Norton Critical Edition), and then we spend the
                rest of the term diving into a highly selective version of “Keats Studies,” first
                reading excerpts from his early biographers and interpreters in the nineteenth
                century, before moving on to extracts from the New Critics, the Harvard Keatsians,
                some of the canonical studies of the mid-twentieth century, the textual scholarship
                of the 1970s, and then to and through the theoretical turn of the 1980s and 90s,
                before sampling some extraordinary recent work.<note xml:id="ftn4" place="end" n="4"

                    fact that I personally know and am friends some of these people, a further
                    reminder of teaching and scholarship as embodied practice. I even paused during
                    one seminar to email Jeff Cox to ask a question a student had about the choice
                    of cover art for his Keats edition--which seemed to amaze the group, prompting
                    one to ask if I knew Matthew Arnold, too. Hilarious.</note> Aside from having
                senior undergraduates face the demands of reading scholarship, the point is to see
                how our reading of Keats shapes and is shaped by our understanding of Romanticism
                (or, later, romanticisms), and to see how our understanding of Romanticism shapes
                and is shaped by larger shifting trends in Literary Studies. Of course, we could
                substitute almost any writer, from almost any period, to achieve much the same
                thing, but his relatively small body of work together with the popular appeal of his
                biography makes Keats, I think, an ideal choice—and since he is so often both the
                darling and the punching bag of theorists from the New Critics on, the case for “why
                Keats?” is an easy one to make. </p>
            <p>By the time they come to this course, many students are aware of some of my own
                research interests, so it comes as no surprise to them when I highlight the
                references to Keats’ medical training in the letters, or trace the overt physicality
                of a poem like “Lamia,” or describe the opening, post-battle scene of “Hyperion” as
                “triage.” But, as always, I try to show that an appreciation for “bodiliness” throws
                a number of key critical questions into stark relief. For example, students are
                often intrigued and somewhat frustrated when we note how little attention the early
                biographies pay to the material realities of Keats’ life (and how almost no
                attention at all is paid to his early life); it’s true that in some cases the
                historical evidence wasn’t available to those early reviewers, but it’s also true
                that they often simply weren’t concerned enough with questions of material history
                to even bemoan its absence. For students who are particularly interested in these
                questions, I direct them either to later biographical studies (Roe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">John Keats</hi>, in particular) or to one or more of the critical
                studies that focus on Keats’ time at Guy’s (depending on the specifics of their
                interests) and encourage them to think not just about what new evidence became
                available but how existing evidence was re-valued. When we move from the sensual
                Keats of the Victorians as they try to rescue the immoral young Cockney to the
                apparently uncontexted, bodiless poet of the New Critics, to the deeply embodied and
                situated poet we’ve come to know since the ground-breaking work of Nicholas Roe in
                the mid-1990s, we can see not only the changes in what we’ve learned about Keats
                over the past two centuries but also the shifting trends in Literary Studies and
                Critical Theory (and the changing fortunes of the body as material entity and
                concept). The assignment structure for the class (for most of my classes) tends to
                be fairly traditional—article summaries and critiques, short presentations, and
                standard term papers—but some of the topics that the students have generated, almost
                always entirely on their own, speak directly to the concerns of this essay and this
                volume as a whole. One particularly memorable essay compared a number of
                biographical accounts of Keats’ time at Guy’s Hospital to examine the role of that
                particular time in Keats’ life in the “story” as the biographers were telling it.
                Another worked to read the depiction of women’s bodies in some of the later poems in
                relation to the Fanny Brawne letters to explore the seeming disconnect between
                Keats’ misogynistic tendencies in some poems with what she identified as the
                tenderness and vulnerability on display in those love letters. Another engaged with
                some recent critical work and collected references to breath and breathing in the
                poems and letters and made a case for an understanding of “inspiration” as a
                profoundly embodied activity. I don’t consciously encourage students to think
                specifically about bodies and embodiment, though surely I must often do so
                more-or-less unconsciously, and the critical readings I require as reading are
                derived at least as much from my own interests as they are from my sense of the
                landscape of Keats Studies. But as these senior undergraduate students bring their
                own varied theoretical and critical interests (and frustrations) to ongoing
                classroom discussions, I’m always struck by how often my insistence that we pay
                attention to the bodiliness of Keats’ work, together with some consideration of the
                place of an attention to that bodiliness in Keats Studies, helps them to come to
                some new realization not just about the poet but about their own interests and
                patron theorists. That is, even if they are not interested in connecting the
                bodiliness of Keats’ work to his medical training, reflecting on that bodiliness may
                help them to think more critically, more reflexively, about key aspects of the
                material dimensions of gender, class, race, labour, artistic expression, and so on.
                And I increasingly believe that such realizations are, perhaps not <hi rend="italic"
                    >only</hi>, but certainly <hi rend="italic">more</hi> possible in the shared,
                physical, and embodied space of the classroom.</p>
            <p>Finally, I sometimes teach a graduate seminar in our MA program called “Romantic
                Bodies” that seeks, first, to work with the transdisciplinary field of “Body
                Studies” (sometimes rendered in the literature as “Body Culture Studies,” and which
                I describe as a consciously ill-formed “field” of study that borrows and adapts from
                a wide range of theoretical perspectives, from Philosophy to Sociology to
                Historiography, always focussed on the body and bodiliness) and, second, to
                construct something of an “Alternative Romanticism”—“alternative” in the sense that
                I assume grad students come in with some kind of working understanding of the
                period, whether a passing familiarity with some canonical names or something more in
                depth, and I work to try to defamiliarize the period by forcing attention on what I
                claim is literally “a poetry of flesh and blood”—which is rarely, at that level at
                least, an approach that they have considered or encountered.<note xml:id="ftn5"
                    place="end" n="5"><p>. I propose the same kind of thing in a third-year
                        undergraduate class on “Women Writers of the Romantic Period,” asking
                        students to think about what “Romanticism” looks like, whether they are
                        seeing it for the first time or not, when we consider only writers who
                        happen to be women.</p><pb/><p> Works Cited</p><p>Allard, James Robert. <hi

                recognize that a popular and still enormously influential understanding of
                “Romanticism,” by which I mean the kind of thing students glean in general
                historical surveys or in entries in dictionaries of literary terms or in the casual
                references to the period that appear in their other classes, is dominated by notions
                of the sublime, imagination, emotion, metaphysicality, the “ideal,” and the like.
                But rather than emphasize the poetics of the “spontaneous overflow of powerful
                feeling,” I then urge us to take literally Wordsworth’s expressed desire to keep his
                “Reader in the company of poetry of flesh and blood.” The primary readings for the
                course are heavily canonical, for the point is precisely to interrogate a canonical
                understanding of Romanticism: the last time I taught the course, for example, I used
                Duncan Wu’s <hi rend="italic">Romantic Poetry</hi> from the Blackwell Essential
                Literature Series, which includes only canonical selections from the Big Six, and
                supplemented with some selections (including, for example, “Beachy Head” and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</hi>) from Paula Feldman’s anthology
                    <hi rend="italic">British Women Poets of the Romantic Era</hi>. The goal is to
                provide a relatively specific point of access to something we all think we know (the
                treatment and depiction of “bodiliness” in widely known Romantic poetry), to lay
                bare our shared assumptions (as one student put it in a course evaluation, “my
                historical survey didn’t tell me there were so. many. bodies. in poems that I
                thought talked all about the imagination and emotion”), to introduce a set of tools
                to examine those assumptions (drawn particularly from the anthology <hi

                Fraser and Monica Greco, and supplemented with texts such as Paul Youngquist’s
                “Lyrical Bodies” and Alan Richardson’s “Keats and the Glories of the Brain”), and
                then to encourage the seminar’s participants to bring their eclectic
                theoretical/political/literary interests to bear. The presentations, term papers,
                and class discussions, most often generated by the students themselves, on gender
                and canonicity, selfhood and identity, poetry and aesthetics, even book history,
                among other things, have been among the most fascinating and generative I’ve
                experienced and rival even some of the best conference sessions I’ve attended. And I
                think the key is that the course is decidedly <hi rend="italic">not </hi>focussed on
                medicine (though of course it comes up, usually when discussing Keats and Coleridge,
                as one can imagine, or, more likely, when I’m directing the discussion in the
                absence of student-led presentation) but rather on the body and bodiliness; the
                students, encouraged to bring their own theoretical concerns to the material,
                primary and secondary, inevitably find ways to read against the grain, make
                connections between theorists, and pursue interesting readings of the primary
                material that I could not—yes, sometimes in ways that are wildly fantastic and
                ill-advised, but often generative and novel, and always fascinating. In these
                circumstances, when my own inclination is to appeal to “the body in” medical
                discourse, I am always, in the best ways, forced to acknowledge the discursive
                effects of my own words on both the material at hand and, perhaps more crucially, on
                the classroom dynamic. To put it simply, and to cite an example that often comes up
                in my classes, grad and undergrad alike, just because I want to (and can’t seem to
                help but) read the opening sequence of “Hyperion” as a depicting the practice of
                triage Keats would have learned at Guy’s—to argue that when Thea touches Saturn
                “upon that aching spot / Where beats the human heart” (42-43) she is in effect
                checking his vital signs—that doesn’t mean that we have to or even <hi rend="italic"
                    >should</hi> read it that way, that my doing so is a perfect example of treating
                “the body in” medical discourse. Encouraging students to think and read critically
                for themselves, I’m reminded in these moments, must include encouraging them to
                think and read critically what I as their instructor teach them.</p>
            <p>While I don’t know for sure if any of the students who have taken these classes over
                the years have had the same ultimately generative moment of exasperation that I had,
                I can say without hesitation that my own such moment at once lead me to do the work
                I do in the way that I do it and continues to impact the ways I think about
                teaching. Even when my specialized interests in the body, bodiliness, and medical
                history don’t or can’t be brought to the foreground of class discussions, they do
                still provide, first, key points of access and framing devices that help to curate
                the sometimes chaotic space of the classroom by providing key points of reference
                both in the room and in the texts, and second, constant reminders that I was once
                sitting in their seat, simultaneously fascinated and terrified by ideas that seemed
                completely new and by questions and insights that I assumed were unique to me. And
                it should be obvious to us all that such a sense of self-awareness, including the
                too-often mistaken but still overwhelming impression that one struggles in
                isolation, is a key element in any effort to foster “wellbeing”—as true for the
                Romantics as it for us and our students. Self-consciously <hi rend="italic"
                    >embodying </hi>those struggles by engaging with the very notion of “embodying”
                itself demands that I think critically about ways to bring together my work as both
                researcher and teacher and, I always hope, makes me better at both.</p>
