            </header><br/><p>Full disclosure of an open secret up front: I am not a medical historian. I study,
               teach, and write about literature and culture, spending the bulk of my time with the
               texts, people, institutions, and events of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
               century in Britain. Much of what I do as a researcher is marked by strong interests
               in the history of medicine, especially surgery, and in how “Medicine”—as institution,
               as techne, as embodied in the people who inhabit or encounter its communities (if
               sometimes only temporarily and perhaps under duress)—talked about itself to itself,
               articulated its means and ends to those not trained in its ways, and how it was in
               turn represented by “outsiders” in a variety of texts and contexts. But those interests,
               at least in those terms or with any degree of specificity, rarely (and rarely easily)
               find their way into my classrooms, and normally not at the undergraduate level. Nevertheless,
               as I imagine is the case with many of us, my thinking about my teaching practices
               and research interests, which in important ways are quite different, are guided by
               a few fundamental questions that have haunted me since my early days as a graduate
               student: what does it mean to “have” a body? what are the various forces that shape
               how we think about that meaning? who is authorized to answer those questions, and
               how is that authority built and acknowledged? how have shifting ideas about the body
               affected shifting ideas about “wellbeing”? Since those early grad student days, I
               have pursued those questions and sought various answers in the spaces where literary
               studies and medical history overlap, and I have perhaps only lately come to realize
               just how deeply my teaching philosophy and practices have been shaped by those efforts.</p>
            <p>In what follows, I track two parallel narratives. The first begins with what I have
               always believed to be the two moments that crystallized those fundamental questions,
               and the second interweaves examples from some of the classes that I have taught—from
               a standard second-year Romantics survey, to an Honours seminar on Keats, to a graduate
               seminar on “Romantic Bodies”—where those questions have been most firmly on display,
               often in ways that are not at first glance obvious. My goal here, as in the classroom,
               is to urge greater attention to what I have called, borrowing from Francis Barker,
               the “bodiliness” of Romantic-era texts: to demonstrate what happens to our understanding
               of key features of Romanticism when we attend, first, to the at-times overwhelming
               number and variety of bodies that are and always have been at the heart of a period
               often seen as celebrating the <span style="font-style:italic">meta</span>physical, the sublime, the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling” in one way or
               another, and, second, to some of the ways that those bodies were represented and experienced
               by the writers and readers of the period. And I would add that any discussion of “wellbeing,”
               however we are defining it—and the present volume gives us a sense of just how varied
               and complex the definitions can be—must at some point come to terms with the bodiliness,
               what I have called elsewhere the “body consciousness,” of the period. It is of course
               true that health and wellbeing are more than physical, quantifiable phenomena, but
               it is equally true that treatments of bodies often presuppose, explicitly or not,
               fairly or not, what is and is not “normal” or “healthy” or “well,” and thus any conception
               of one is necessarily caught up in a conception of the other. In this period, in particular,
               whether we engage with figures obsessed with Brunonian notions of excitability, emboldened
               by the pioneering anatomical and surgical work of John and William Hunter, or even
               wedded to an already-out-dated-but-still-popular theory of the Galenic humours, “wellbeing”
               had to contend with the complexities of our flesh worlds, to a greater or lesser degree.
               In the end, I seek—once again, both here and in my teaching—to encourage more sustained
               attention to the ways in which our understanding of our own material realities both
               enable and inhibit our engagements with the Romantic period and some of its key texts
               and ideas.</p>
            <p>As a student in a graduate seminar, more than twenty years ago now, while having a
               fascinating and productive group discussion about Judith Butler’s notion of performativity,
               I remember an overwhelming sense of frustration that finally made me blurt out, “But
               what about the body?!” I understood, I thought, the idea of a disconnect between sex
               and gender, that effacing the distinction was heteronormative, that what were often
               assumed to be “essential” characteristics of gendered behaviour—including, among other
               things, body language—were learned. Where I struggled, though, was in coming to terms
               with where the body was, with what it <span style="font-style:italic">meant</span>, in this dynamic: is it the stage for the performance? the costume performers wear?
               the ground upon which the struggle of identity is fought? the prize at the end of
               a contest? I have since come to realize that my frustration had less to do with a
               lack of philosophical or theoretical understanding—still, obviously a distinct possibility—and
               much more to do with my inability to effectively pose the question, to deploy a vocabulary
               of interrogation that would help to frame an answer, however tentative and temporary
               it might be. And that frustration haunts me to this day: though I have since developed
               various strategies (grounded in a material historicist approach) and encountered vocabularies
               (leaning heavily on Foucault, especially in those early days) that have helped me
               to propose certain tactical and generative ways of asking and answering such questions,
               I remain aware of how far I am from a truly satisfying answer and that students at
               all levels experience similar frustrations as they encounter the ideas and questions
               that will haunt them. It is precisely the memory of the frustration itself, that desperate
               moment when I <span style="font-style:italic">needed to know</span>, even more than the details of the conversation, that I carry with me into every
               lecture hall and seminar room. To be sure, the question I asked was prompted by my
               own idiosyncratic concerns and interests, but the <span style="font-style:italic">need </span>that drove me to shout it out is, I think, something common to all who read and think,
               perhaps especially to our students.</p>
            <p>The second moment came about a year later, when I had just begun the process of trying
               to develop a working proposal for my dissertation, which would eventually become my
               book <span style="font-style:italic">Romanticism, Medicine, and the Poet’s Body</span>. While watching a football game, I listened as the announcers talked about an injured
               player. I was told that “an MRI had revealed a partially torn ACL” and that “he probably
               won’t need surgery but will likely be out six to eight weeks.” These statements were
               delivered in as matter-of-fact a tone as can be imagined, as if both the announcers
               and everyone listening knew exactly what all of this meant. To be sure, sports fans
               have heard a great deal about players’ injuries, prognoses, and treatments, and many
               of these terms would be familiar in this context, but I was struck at this moment
               by the assumption that almost everyone listening (and, obviously, the announcers themselves—a
               broadcaster and an ex-athlete, neither a trained medical professional, one would think)
               could be assumed to have enough of a working knowledge of human anatomy, of specialized
               acronyms, of what state-of-the-art medical imaging technology could do, of specific
               medical procedures and their outcomes, that these statements could be offered without
               explanation and heard without confusion. Of course, had I not been actively thinking
               about the circulation of medical discourse in the public sphere I would not have thought
               twice about this exchange, but that’s precisely the point: our thinking about our
               own bodies, which would seem to be perhaps a most instinctive, intuitive operation
               concerning the most “natural” of things, has always been marked if not entirely dominated
               by the presence of hyperspecialized discourses—religious, scientific, etc.—that the
               majority of us have no earthly reason to know. For those of us steeped in Foucault
               and other theorists of power and discourse, this is hardly a new insight, but that
               experience provided a fantastic, real-world example that helped me to concretize my
               own thinking and that still serves a key pedagogical function in my classrooms. I
               like to frame this issue with a reference to Roy Porter’s simple and yet still profound
               claim that the body is <span style="font-style:italic">always </span>“the body in,” that the body we encounter, whether “in” flesh or text or image, is
               always medicalized or gendered or raced or classed or any one of a thousand other
               things or some combination thereof, that seeing or talking about or even imagining
               a body, even our own, as somehow pre- or non-discursive is impossible. The seeming
               immediacy of bodies often prompts immediate and understandable resistance to this
               kind of theorizing which can often just as quickly prompt the kind of examination
               of assumptions at the heart of so many pedagogical encounters.</p>
            <p>But what does any of this have to do with teaching Romanticism, with the day-to-day
               classroom experiences of survey classes and advanced seminars that are part of a degree
               in English Language and Literature? For me at least, the answer is easy: this has
               <span style="font-style:italic">everything </span>to do with teaching, and especially with teaching Romanticism. One of the running
               themes in my version of the second-year Romantics survey course<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a> at my institution (a twelve-week sprint through the period), is framed by the question
               “who controls the vocabulary?” When discussing British responses to the French Revolution,
               for example, I work to show how Burke, Wollstonecraft, Paine, Godwin, Thelwall, Williams,
               and other key players in the 1790s pamphlet wars were seeking to claim the right to
               define the key terms of the debate: “natural,” “revolution,” “nation,” and so on.
               I then carry that same framework into our readings of, for example, the “Preface”
               to <span style="font-style:italic">Lyrical Ballads</span>, Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Defence</span>, and Smith’s <span style="font-style:italic">Elegiac Sonnets</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>where we encounter similar efforts to stake the same claim with terms like “poetry,”
               “poet,” and, again, “nature.” In many cases—in Wordsworth’s loaded observation that
               “poetry” is a “word of very disputed meaning,” or Wollstonecraft’s challenge to Burke
               to remember that a nation is “people” and not an abstraction—it’s relatively easy
               to demonstrate the extraordinary self-reflexivity on display, the efforts of Romantic-era
               writers not just to use words but to interrogate their use, engage with their meanings
               and effects, and reflect on their role in making the things they were ostensibly only
               describing. Thus, when we encounter, say, texts that consciously participate in or
               critique the cultures of sensibility (More’s <span style="font-style:italic">Sensibility: A Poem</span>), or that foreground the physical acts of reading and writing (Blake’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span>), or that explore Romantic-era notions of gender (Barbauld’s “Washing Day” or Keats’
               “The Eve of St. Agnes”), it doesn’t take much to show that the same process is at
               work with the word “body” and its cognates, and to further show what that process
               does to the sense of “bodiliness” in those texts. More shows us problematic bodies
               that perform and “conscious” ones that read and critique that performance, and having
               students generate a simple list of references to bodies, body parts, and bodily responses
               (sighing, blushing, crying, etc.) either on the spot in class or in their reading
               notes prior to our meeting helps to underscore the deeply embodied nature of sensibility
               as she uses and critiques it. Blake shows us reading and writing as distinctly physical,
               material activities, not disembodied concepts, and introducing students to the plates
               as provided in the digital <span style="font-style:italic">William Blake </span><span style="font-style:italic">Archive</span> encourages them to see the centrality of embodied, sensual experience in Blake’s
               thought. Barbauld and Keats show us bodies that act and react in the world, bodies
               as subjects and as objects, and emphasizing the degree to which they foreground the
               materiality of labour, of love, of lust, and of loss to show how they mark and are
               marked by bodies encourages students to see these ideas as more than abstractions.</p>
            <p>In terms of course content, then, such efforts let us explore in a productively contained
               way some of the period’s key terms and ideas, while also ensuring that we can see
               the interconnectedness of those terms that lead some to identify enough of a sense
               of cohesion to label the period, if often problematically, as Romantic. In terms of
               classroom practice, two features of this particular class and my teaching style more
               generally come to mind. First, I’m always conscious of my own bodiliness in the classroom
               space: to teach is, of course, to perform, and that is most true and most evident
               for me in the lecture hall. I’ve been told (not as a criticism, I think!) on more
               than one occasion that my lectures are “high energy,” as I constantly move about the
               space, often using exaggerated gestures and changing the projection of my voice (I
               may or may not frequently shout and, very occasionally, sing. . . badly) for dramatic
               effect. While I am an advocate for student-centred learning, I work to make my voice
               and embodied self the focal point of the classroom, giving students a single, if moving,
               target in the space of the lecture hall—in an effort tokeep them engaged and interested,
               yes, but also to force a particular kind of deeply focussed attention without (usually)
               the distraction or relief of PowerPoint and other audio-visual technologies. The point
               is less to make my body the focus (which isn’t always ideal or productive or even
               possible for all instructors<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a>), but to use my bodiliness—gestures, voice, movements within the space, etc.—to create
               a single, dynamic point of reference to which students can return when they look up
               from their texts and notes. Second, I often encourage students to read aloud so that
               they might, first, hear things that they don’t see on the page, and, second, so that
               they develop a sense of the physicality of the reading experience: if I am to argue
               for an attention to the body consciousness of Romantic writing, I think it’s equally
               crucial to emphasize the bodies that are engaging with that writing. It helps, to
               be sure, that many of the writers and texts we spend time with often dwell on what
               it means to read aloud. Whether we’re discussing William Hazlitt’s fascination with
               Coleridge as a preacher in “My First Acquaintance with Poets” or John Thelwall’s fiery
               renditions of Godwin for crowds in the 1790s, and whether talking about the Cockney
               rhymes of Hunt and Keats that are only heard when they are spoken or Joanna Baillie’s
               demand that her plays be recognized as scripts for performance, I’m always careful
               to remind students that an attention to the bodiliness of Romantic-texts doesn’t just
               mean pointing to the bodies represented in them; it also means engaging with the bodies,
               all of them, that write, speak, and read. Until drafting this essay—and I owe profound
               thanks to the volume’s editors for this—I never really thought in depth about the
               fact that about a third of the majors in my department are actually Concurrent Education
               students, and thus in the process of becoming teachers themselves, so a more critically
               self-aware attention to the embodied nature of teaching and of learning may serve
               to help them think more reflexively about how they will lead their own classrooms
               one day, even as it foregrounds those aspects of the period that I find most fascinating.
               Thus, in relation both to the questions and topics I ask students to think about and
               in an awareness of the classroom as a communal space we bodily inhabit, I’m working
               to model ways of navigating the often maddeningly complex terrain of terms, theories,
               and approaches that make up Literary Studies by demonstrating, on one hand, that the
               Romantics themselves were faced with similar frustrations, and, on the other, how
               I as a reader, teacher, and researcher deal with them myself.</p>
            <p>Similar efforts to encourage a sense of critical self-awareness that works in tandem
               with the material are manifest in an Honours seminar I sometimes teach called “Keats
               and Romanticism.” We spend the first three of twelve three-hour sessions reading as
               many of Keats’ poems and letters as we can in the time we have (most of the selections
               in Jeffrey Cox’s splendid Norton Critical Edition), and then we spend the rest of
               the term diving into a highly selective version of “Keats Studies,” first reading
               excerpts from his early biographers and interpreters in the nineteenth century, before
               moving on to extracts from the New Critics, the Harvard Keatsians, some of the canonical
               studies of the mid-twentieth century, the textual scholarship of the 1970s, and then
               to and through the theoretical turn of the 1980s and 90s, before sampling some extraordinary
               recent work.<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a> Aside from having senior undergraduates face the demands of reading scholarship,
               the point is to see how our reading of Keats shapes and is shaped by our understanding
               of Romanticism (or, later, romanticisms), and to see how our understanding of Romanticism
               shapes and is shaped by larger shifting trends in Literary Studies. Of course, we
               could substitute almost any writer, from almost any period, to achieve much the same
               thing, but his relatively small body of work together with the popular appeal of his
               biography makes Keats, I think, an ideal choice—and since he is so often both the
               darling and the punching bag of theorists from the New Critics on, the case for “why
               Keats?” is an easy one to make.</p>
            <p>By the time they come to this course, many students are aware of some of my own research
               interests, so it comes as no surprise to them when I highlight the references to Keats’
               medical training in the letters, or trace the overt physicality of a poem like “Lamia,”
               or describe the opening, post-battle scene of “Hyperion” as “triage.” But, as always,
               I try to show that an appreciation for “bodiliness” throws a number of key critical
               questions into stark relief. For example, students are often intrigued and somewhat
               frustrated when we note how little attention the early biographies pay to the material
               realities of Keats’ life (and how almost no attention at all is paid to his early
               life); it’s true that in some cases the historical evidence wasn’t available to those
               early reviewers, but it’s also true that they often simply weren’t concerned enough
               with questions of material history to even bemoan its absence. For students who are
               particularly interested in these questions, I direct them either to later biographical
               studies (Roe’s <span style="font-style:italic">John Keats</span>, in particular) or to one or more of the critical studies that focus on Keats’ time
               at Guy’s (depending on the specifics of their interests) and encourage them to think
               not just about what new evidence became available but how existing evidence was re-valued.
               When we move from the sensual Keats of the Victorians as they try to rescue the immoral
               young Cockney to the apparently uncontexted, bodiless poet of the New Critics, to
               the deeply embodied and situated poet we’ve come to know since the ground-breaking
               work of Nicholas Roe in the mid-1990s, we can see not only the changes in what we’ve
               learned about Keats over the past two centuries but also the shifting trends in Literary
               Studies and Critical Theory (and the changing fortunes of the body as material entity
               and concept). The assignment structure for the class (for most of my classes) tends
               to be fairly traditional—article summaries and critiques, short presentations, and
               standard term papers—but some of the topics that the students have generated, almost
               always entirely on their own, speak directly to the concerns of this essay and this
               volume as a whole. One particularly memorable essay compared a number of biographical
               accounts of Keats’ time at Guy’s Hospital to examine the role of that particular time
               in Keats’ life in the “story” as the biographers were telling it. Another worked to
               read the depiction of women’s bodies in some of the later poems in relation to the
               Fanny Brawne letters to explore the seeming disconnect between Keats’ misogynistic
               tendencies in some poems with what she identified as the tenderness and vulnerability
               on display in those love letters. Another engaged with some recent critical work and
               collected references to breath and breathing in the poems and letters and made a case
               for an understanding of “inspiration” as a profoundly embodied activity. I don’t consciously
               encourage students to think specifically about bodies and embodiment, though surely
               I must often do so more-or-less unconsciously, and the critical readings I require
               as reading are derived at least as much from my own interests as they are from my
               sense of the landscape of Keats Studies. But as these senior undergraduate students
               bring their own varied theoretical and critical interests (and frustrations) to ongoing
               classroom discussions, I’m always struck by how often my insistence that we pay attention
               to the bodiliness of Keats’ work, together with some consideration of the place of
               an attention to that bodiliness in Keats Studies, helps them to come to some new realization
               not just about the poet but about their own interests and patron theorists. That is,
               even if they are not interested in connecting the bodiliness of Keats’ work to his
               medical training, reflecting on that bodiliness may help them to think more critically,
               more reflexively, about key aspects of the material dimensions of gender, class, race,
               labour, artistic expression, and so on. And I increasingly believe that such realizations
               are, perhaps not <span style="font-style:italic">only</span>, but certainly <span style="font-style:italic">more</span> possible in the shared, physical, and embodied space of the classroom.</p>
            <p>Finally, I sometimes teach a graduate seminar in our MA program called “Romantic Bodies”
               that seeks, first, to work with the transdisciplinary field of “Body Studies” (sometimes
               rendered in the literature as “Body Culture Studies,” and which I describe as a consciously
               ill-formed “field” of study that borrows and adapts from a wide range of theoretical
               perspectives, from Philosophy to Sociology to Historiography, always focussed on the
               body and bodiliness) and, second, to construct something of an “Alternative Romanticism”—“alternative”
               in the sense that I assume grad students come in with some kind of working understanding
               of the period, whether a passing familiarity with some canonical names or something
               more in depth, and I work to try to defamiliarize the period by forcing attention
               on what I claim is literally “a poetry of flesh and blood”—which is rarely, at that
               level at least, an approach that they have considered or encountered.<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a> We begin by working to recognize that a popular and still enormously influential
               understanding of “Romanticism,” by which I mean the kind of thing students glean in
               general historical surveys or in entries in dictionaries of literary terms or in the
               casual references to the period that appear in their other classes, is dominated by
               notions of the sublime, imagination, emotion, metaphysicality, the “ideal,” and the
               like. But rather than emphasize the poetics of the “spontaneous overflow of powerful
               feeling,” I then urge us to take literally Wordsworth’s expressed desire to keep his
               “Reader in the company of poetry of flesh and blood.” The primary readings for the
               course are heavily canonical, for the point is precisely to interrogate a canonical
               understanding of Romanticism: the last time I taught the course, for example, I used
               Duncan Wu’s <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Poetry</span> from the Blackwell Essential Literature Series, which includes only canonical selections
               from the Big Six, and supplemented with some selections (including, for example, “Beachy
               Head” and <span style="font-style:italic">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</span>) from Paula Feldman’s anthology <span style="font-style:italic">British Women Poets of the Romantic Era</span>. The goal is to provide a relatively specific point of access to something we all
               think we know (the treatment and depiction of “bodiliness” in widely known Romantic
               poetry), to lay bare our shared assumptions (as one student put it in a course evaluation,
               “my historical survey didn’t tell me there were so. many. bodies. in poems that I
               thought talked all about the imagination and emotion”), to introduce a set of tools
               to examine those assumptions (drawn particularly from the anthology <span style="font-style:italic">The </span><span style="font-style:italic">Body: A Reader</span>, edited by Mariam Fraser and Monica Greco, and supplemented with texts such as Paul
               Youngquist’s “Lyrical Bodies” and Alan Richardson’s “Keats and the Glories of the
               Brain”), and then to encourage the seminar’s participants to bring their eclectic
               theoretical/political/literary interests to bear. The presentations, term papers,
               and class discussions, most often generated by the students themselves, on gender
               and canonicity, selfhood and identity, poetry and aesthetics, even book history, among
               other things, have been among the most fascinating and generative I’ve experienced
               and rival even some of the best conference sessions I’ve attended. And I think the
               key is that the course is decidedly <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>focussed on medicine (though of course it comes up, usually when discussing Keats
               and Coleridge, as one can imagine, or, more likely, when I’m directing the discussion
               in the absence of student-led presentation) but rather on the body and bodiliness;
               the students, encouraged to bring their own theoretical concerns to the material,
               primary and secondary, inevitably find ways to read against the grain, make connections
               between theorists, and pursue interesting readings of the primary material that I
               could not—yes, sometimes in ways that are wildly fantastic and ill-advised, but often
               generative and novel, and always fascinating. In these circumstances, when my own
               inclination is to appeal to “the body in” medical discourse, I am always, in the best
               ways, forced to acknowledge the discursive effects of my own words on both the material
               at hand and, perhaps more crucially, on the classroom dynamic. To put it simply, and
               to cite an example that often comes up in my classes, grad and undergrad alike, just
               because I want to (and can’t seem to help but) read the opening sequence of “Hyperion”
               as a depicting the practice of triage Keats would have learned at Guy’s—to argue that
               when Thea touches Saturn “upon that aching spot / Where beats the human heart” (42-43)
               she is in effect checking his vital signs—that doesn’t mean that we have to or even
               <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> read it that way, that my doing so is a perfect example of treating “the body in”
               medical discourse. Encouraging students to think and read critically for themselves,
               I’m reminded in these moments, must include encouraging them to think and read critically
               what I as their instructor teach them.</p>
            <p>While I don’t know for sure if any of the students who have taken these classes over
               the years have had the same ultimately generative moment of exasperation that I had,
               I can say without hesitation that my own such moment at once lead me to do the work
               I do in the way that I do it and continues to impact the ways I think about teaching.
               Even when my specialized interests in the body, bodiliness, and medical history don’t
               or can’t be brought to the foreground of class discussions, they do still provide,
               first, key points of access and framing devices that help to curate the sometimes
               chaotic space of the classroom by providing key points of reference both in the room
               and in the texts, and second, constant reminders that I was once sitting in their
               seat, simultaneously fascinated and terrified by ideas that seemed completely new
               and by questions and insights that I assumed were unique to me. And it should be obvious
               to us all that such a sense of self-awareness, including the too-often mistaken but
               still overwhelming impression that one struggles in isolation, is a key element in
               any effort to foster “wellbeing”—as true for the Romantics as it for us and our students.
               Self-consciously <span style="font-style:italic">embodying </span>those struggles by engaging with the very notion of “embodying” itself demands that
               I think critically about ways to bring together my work as both researcher and teacher
               and, I always hope, makes me better at both.</p>
