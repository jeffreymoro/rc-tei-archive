               <h1><span class="head">Teaching Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies with Dorothy Wordsworth</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>A copy of a page from the journal Dorothy Wordsworth kept from February 12, 1831-September
               7, 1833 serves as the frontispiece to Susan Levin’s 1987 book <span style="font-style:italic">Dorothy Wordsworth &amp; Romanticism</span>. In the reproduction, Dorothy’s script is illegible, but the page is an evocative
               aesthetic object: the text is cross-written, with a larger, vertical script covering
               over the smaller text that runs from left to right. The image implicitly demonstrates
               one of what Levin calls the “special problems for the editor” posed by Wordsworth’s
               writing: her non-linear, recursive style (175). These late journals resist the form
               of the printed book and the values that shape the academy, both through their idiosyncratic
               structure and through their content. Wordsworth during this period was experiencing
               a range of physical and cognitive impairments, possibly deriving from complications
               from an inflamed gall bladder and a progressive mental disability that some have likened
               to or identified as Alzheimer’s or pre-senile dementia.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a> Levin connects Wordsworth’s difficult manuscripts directly to her cognitive decline,
               noting that her late journals and poetry “[provide] a fascinating record of her mind’s
               wanderings/deterioration/development” (175). These unpublished journal entries demonstrate
               that the state of Wordsworth’s mind and body—or, perhaps more precisely, critics’
               understanding of the state of her mind and body—shapes our understanding of her work.
               These interrelations between Wordsworth’s body and corpus make these “special problems”
               for the editor into unique opportunities for students in courses dedicated to studying
               disability and Romanticism.</p>
            <p>In this essay I describe an extended unit and major assignment centered on Dorothy
               Wordsworth’s published and unpublished journals in an upper-level English course I
               have designed, titled “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies.” The course will
               demonstrate, among other things, how disability studies-based interventions reveal
               the ways in which notions of normal and able bodies shape not only our ideas about
               health and wellness but also the Romantic canon and, in turn, how the traditional
               Romantic canon contributes to normative ideas about health and wellness. In this,
               I am influenced by Allison Kafer’s concept of the “curative imaginary” (27). Kafer
               distinguishes the “curative imaginary,” as an idea, from medical cure as a practice
               by highlighting the social forces that compel people with noncompliant bodies and
               minds towards rehabilitation. The curative imaginary derives from “an understanding
               of disability that not only expects and assumes intervention but also cannot imagine
               or comprehend anything other than intervention” (27). “Romanticism and Feminist Disability
               Studies” asks students to consider how these notions of health rooted in normalcy
               have shaped and continue to shape both the literary canon and access to that canon.
               Students will imagine Dorothy Wordsworth as part of a larger, more disabled Romanticism
               and will develop strategies for making her work more accessible to disabled readers
               and scholars today. In this way, “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” brings
               together two important strands of my teaching that are both informed by disability
               studies. First, it asks students to consider how thinking through disability changes
               our understanding of literature and the cultures that read it; and second, it asks
               students to engage in rhetorical strategies to make their work—in the classroom and
               in writing assignments—more accessible to an audience that can include disabled people.
               </p>
            <p>“Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” is in many ways the product of several
               years of teaching courses about disability, Romanticism, and their intersections at
               Emory University and later at Spelman College and The Georgia Institute of Technology,
               where I am currently a Brittain fellow and instructor in English. As a graduate student
               at Emory, I taught composition and literature courses aimed at attracting the school’s
               many undergraduates with plans to go on to medical school, nursing, or public health.
               In those courses, I found that teaching disability studies and Romanticism together
               proved valuable in a number of ways. The theoretical approach allows students not
               typically interested in English literature or close reading to find the stakes in
               the subject matter. My background in disability studies always informs my teaching,
               and I find that bringing disability into the conversation enhances it at all levels.
               My students at Emory who read William Hay’s 1754 essay <span style="font-style:italic">Deformity: An Essay </span>in part or in whole used Hay’s insights to better make sense of more canonical readings
               from Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. That same spirit informed our conversations
               about the Wordsworths, Coleridge, and Mary Shelley. At the same time, I rarely teach
               disability without Romanticism. My first-year writing course at Emory, “Disability
               and the Gothic,” used Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> and some of its cinematic and digital adaptations and intertexts to trace a shifting,
               complicated history of the relationships between literary and medical notions of disability
               from the early nineteenth century to today. Similarly, I taught a second-year English
               course at Emory titled “Fictions of Addiction” that traced continuities and shifts
               in attitudes about drug users from the eighteenth century to the present. Students
               considered, among other things, how Lady Delacour, the dissipated opium-user whose
               rehabilitation shapes much of the first two volumes of Maria Edgeworth’s <span style="font-style:italic">Belinda </span>(1801), and Billie Holliday, who describes discriminatory police practices that kept
               her from getting medical treatment for addiction in her memoir <span style="font-style:italic">Lady Sings the Blues </span>(1956), were subjected to medical authority ultimately undergirded less by medical
               knowledge than by gender and racial scripts.</p>
            <p>Another course that I taught at Emory, “Disability and the Gothic,” also highlighted
               continuities between standard practices for successful writers—awareness of audience
               or rhetorical situation, strategic use of multimodality—and strategies for making
               communication accessible. I builton those experiences in an ENGL 1101 course I developed
               and currently teach at Georgia Institute of Technology, “Composing Access.” In that
               class, accessibility becomes both the subject and goal of the student’s reading and
               writing. Students produce digital maps of barriers to access on their campus, audio
               description guides to on-campus art instillations for blind and low-vision users,
               and podcasts that assess the accessibility of educational practices and research opportunities
               at the school. These writing assignments draw explicitly and implicitly on Jay Dolmage’s
               call for principles of universal design to reshape our pedagogy and Georgina Kleege
               and Scott Wallin’s claim that multimodal accessibility documents like audio description
               can be used to produce interesting and valuable writing assignments. At the same time,
               these assignments force students to consider audience and the ways in which multimodal
               communication can either create or address barriers to access, depending on how they
               are deployed. </p>
            <p>Drawing on those experiences has allowed me to envision a unit on Dorothy Wordsworth’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Grasmere Journals </span>and her poetry. The journals and poems are short enough that this project could be
               adapted with slight revisions for a range of period courses, including a Romanticism
               survey, but I will be describing here how it would operate in the upper-level English
               course I’ve named “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies.” The course is framed
               by two key critical insights: first, Anne Mellor’s observation that what Romantic
               scholars have long termed “Romanticism” is, in fact, a “masculine Romanticism” that
               is shadowed by an unrecognized “feminine Romanticism”; and second, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s
               call to “transform” feminist theory by “integrating disability” (333). Students in
               this course will use Romantic texts to test Garland-Thomson’s claim that “integrating
               disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands,
               and challenges feminist theory” (335). In addition to addressing these important critical
               questions, approaching Romanticism from the intersection of gender and ability also
               addresses two key concerns raised by David Higgins and Sharon Ruston’s recent volume,
               <span style="font-style:italic">Teaching Romanticism</span>: Romanticism’s increasingly marginal position in the academy and the difficulty of
               bringing new works and authors recovered by Romantic scholars into the classroom.
               Each unit in “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” pairs Romantic women authors
               with both contextual readings from their contemporaries and twentieth- and twenty-first
               century texts on related issues. Reading Mary Wollstonecraft alongside Carole Pateman’s
               work on what she calls “Wollstonecraft’s dilemma” in the modern social safety net,
               or the cancer plot in Edgeworth’s <span style="font-style:italic">Belinda </span>alongside Susan Sontag’s <span style="font-style:italic">Illness as Metaphor</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>encourages a fuller understanding of both historical moments. In so doing, it reveals
               the value of the study of Romanticism for students with a range of academic and professional
               goals and interests.</p>
            <p>Bringing disability studies into the Romanticism classroom also helps to close what
               Higgins and Ruston call the “gap between teaching and research” in the field (2).
               Disability studies has only recently begun to make its mark on the period, with first
               book-length project on Romanticism and disability, Michael Bradshaw’s <span style="font-style:italic">Disabling Romanticism</span>, appearing in 2016. Taking up these authors in both their own and our historical
               moments allows “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” to engage in practices
               that Bradshaw and Essaka Joshua call for in their volume. Reading Romantic authors
               as part of a canon of disability literature works to disable Romantic texts, which
               Joshua and Bradshaw describe as, in part, an effort to both produce “new reading[s]”
               of texts and “un-reading[s]” of traditional accounts of the canon (1-2). By tracing
               the echoes and anticipations of contemporary conversations about health and disability
               in Romantic-era texts, “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies” also counters
               the critical tendency towards “symbolic appropriation,” that is, the tendency of critics
               to read representations of disability as symbols meant to describe other, supposedly
               more foundational or elemental experiences.</p>
            <p>The course will come to Dorothy Wordsworth after units on Wollstonecraft, Edgeworth,
               and Romantic and twentieth-century notions of independence and health. Students will
               read Wordsworth’s <span style="font-style:italic">Grasmere Journals </span>alongside relevant poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. For example,
               students of course will read William’s “Resolution and Independence” alongside Wordsworth’s
               journal entry on the leech gatherer. But in an in-class exercise I have used in the
               past, I will break students into small groups to discuss the poem in the context of
               different entries from the journal. Some will examine her account of the encounter
               with the leech gatherer. Other groups will look at later diary entries that account
               for the composition of the poem. On May 4, 1802, Wordsworth tucks an account of transcribing
               part of the poem into a longer description of William’s physical and mental dis-ease:
               "William had slept pretty well &amp; though he went to bed nervous &amp; jaded in the extreme
               he rose refreshed. I wrote the Leech Gatherer for him which he had begun the night
               before &amp; of which he wrote several stanzas in bed this Monday morning" (94). At the
               end of the entry, Wordsworth describes herself “repeat[ing] verses to William while
               he was in bed” until “he was soothed &amp; I left him” (96). A third group will take up
               an entry from three days later, wherein Wordsworth notes that William takes advantage
               of his improved state to finish the poem: "William had slept uncommonly well so, feeling
               himself strong, he fell to work at the Leech gatherer—he wrote hard at it till dinner
               time, then he gave over tired to death—he had finished the poem. I was making Derwents
               frocks" (97). In the past, students who have read the more well-known entry have discussed
               Wordsworth’s role in cataloging their walks and raised the question of the value of
               that work to William’s poetry. Groups reading the other entries considered a broader
               conception of Romantic collaboration that accounted for not only labor of composing
               and recording but also how that labor is at times complicated by and at others enabled
               by the day-to-day encroachment of bodily needs, illness, and mental distress. After
               I brought the class back together to share their journal entries and their insights,
               I asked them to speculate about which journal entry is most often published with William’s
               poem. When students had a guess—and most of them guessed correctly—we talked about
               how our understanding of authorship and literary labor is still shaped by particular
               notions of gender and bodily ability. In isolation, the exercise was useful for asking
               students to think about William’s poetry beyond the text as both the output of labor
               from a range of historical figures and as a document that we, as a class, do not receive
               in a vacuum.</p>
            <p>In “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies,” this conversation will connect to
               the larger questions of how notions of gender and bodily ability have shaped critical
               understandings of Romantic literature. Putting this conversation in the context of
               a sustained reading of the entire <span style="font-style:italic">Grasmere Journals </span>also will provide students with an opportunity to further consider William’s poetry
               as, in part, an editorial project. In the traditional Romanticism classroom, the poem
               and Wordsworth’s account of the leech gatherer enjoy a mutually supporting relationship
               in that his poem justifies the presence of her journal entry on the syllabus. But
               absent William’s poem, the “old man almost double” described in Wordsworth’s journal
               bears no immediately apparent difference or distinction from the many other itinerate,
               often disabled figures that appear throughout her journals (23). In class, students
               are prompted to consider why this figure struck William, in particular. In discussion
               boards, I will ask students to produce poetic or prose works that build from any of
               the other arguably equally striking figures that populate Wordsworth’s journal. Such
               exercises raise another important question for this class: how does the tendency to
               anthologize Wordsworth’s journal entry and “Resolution and Independence” in tandem
               shape our understanding of both Wordsworth’s and her brother’s intellectual work?</p>
            <p>Students reading the full <span style="font-style:italic">Grasmere Journals</span> can also consider the journals as an account of what critics have identified as a
               particularly feminine Romantic subjectivity and as a disabled Romantic subjectivity.
               After we read and discussed the journals together, I would assign different groups
               within the class different secondary essays about the journals. In class, we would
               pair/square/share to discuss how these critical accounts of Wordsworth’s journals
               reveal what Joshua and Bradshaw call the “symbolic appropriation” of disability to
               serve other critical purposes (1). Chief among those is what Mellor identifies as
               feminist readings of Wordsworth’s late-life cognitive disability as an “unconscious
               rebellion” against the domestic demands placed upon her (166). But even for Mellor,
               Wordsworth’s dementia becomes “a triumph of the relational self” in that it was supported
               by Mary Hutchinson Wordsworth’s thoughtful care in ways that reciprocated Wordsworth’s
               earlier commitment to caring for others (167). In “Romanticism and Feminist Disability
               Studies,” students will consider in individual writing and in group discussion whether
               these critics, in figuring gender as the primary source for Wordsworth’s fluid conception
               of identity and dementia as its symbolically resonant end point, implicitly ignore
               her experiences of disease and disability as disease and disability.</p>
            <p>But while some students will read and respond to critical works that understand Wordsworth’s
               late-life cognitive impairments as an expression of her more elemental experience
               of gender, others will be assigned secondary readings that interpret disability as
               lack or as an absence of the self.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a> These accounts of disability as lack do not map perfectly onto Wordsworth’s actual
               collected writings. While she does, at times, express frustration, hopelessness, and
               even something like depression in response to her physical and mental impairments,
               and some of her friends and family, in their own writing, connect those expressions
               with a fundamental change or loss of self, those moments are interspersed with other
               moments of enjoyment both in and out of her sickbed. This tension between Wordsworth’s
               own experience of impairment within her familial community and the critical accounting
               of it provides a coherent account of the ways that discriminatory and exclusionary
               narratives about disability, which were coming into being in the Romantic era, came
               to dominate the discourse in the succeeding decades.</p>
            <p>In untangling Wordsworth’s journals from this critical accounting of them, students
               see how these critical accounts can unwittingly reinforce notions of health and wellness
               that Wordsworth’s journals actually challenge and complicate. Through this work, students
               participate in Bradshaw and Joshua’s project of “disabling” Romantic texts, which
               requires, in their view, both “new reading[s]” of texts and “un-reading[s]” of traditional
               accounts of the canon (1-2). But the fact that much of Wordsworth’s late writing is
               available only as mediated through these secondary sources in academic journals or
               perhaps as pdfs available to those with institutional access to JStor speaks to two
               other issues of interest to scholars and students of Romanticism and disability: what
               is available to be read? And for whom is it available? These questions will allow
               the course’s major editorial assignment, with which the Wordsworth unit culminates,
               to arise naturally from our conversations about Wordsworth and her critics. </p>
            <p>The class readings of both Wordsworth and her critics ultimately inform a final project
               in which students will propose—and make a prototype for—an online, accessible collection
               of Wordsworth’s work. Such a project, thoughtfully considered and executed, can foreground
               the ways that Wordsworth challenges our notions of health and wellbeing. This work
               requires students to develop a strong understanding of not only Wordsworth’s writing
               and its history of reception and dissemination, but also of important practices in
               digital publishing and web accessibility. Through this project, students will engage
               with disability studies not only as a set of analytical tools but also as a set of
               ethical concerns and practices that bridges the gap between scholars and students
               and breaks down barriers that can keep disabled people from entering our conversations.
               This assignment draws on Stephen C. Behrendt’s useful template for doing recovery
               work with students. Behrendt provides “hands-on opportunities to do some of the things
               we do as scholars” through assignments in which students participate in the work of
               recovery and publication (123). His students transcribe microfiche or pdf copies of
               unpublished eighteenth-century work to prepare them for online publication. Although
               he does not frame them as such, these assignments are in effect access labor. Microfiche
               in academic libraries present physical barriers to able-bodied and disabled scholars
               alike. PDFs remove many of the physical barriers incurred through geographical distance
               and the built environment, but they remain difficult to access for blind and low-vision
               scholars. By transcribing them, Behrendt’s students potentially make these texts more
               accessible not only to the data mining programs of digital humanities scholars and
               readers geographically separated from the library’s physical collections, but also
               toreaders, students, and scholars who rely on screen readers or other accessibility
               technology to interact with digital materials. Behrendt’s assignments, then, offer
               a useful template for assignments that explore the potential access gains born from
               online publishing.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>In undertaking such a project, students must not only recognize but also interrogate
               the critical and scholarly practices that shape our field. To prepare for such a project,
               students will assess the usability and accessibility of existing online publications.
               The <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/">William Blake Archive</a>enables comparisons across multiple extant versions of Blake’s illuminated works.
               The <a class="link_ref" href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">Shelley/Godwin Archive</a>offers a distinct approach that highlights different authors’ additions and edits
               to manuscript materials. Dickinson College’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://michaelfield.dickinson.edu/">online edition of Michael Field’s poetry</a>uses the web to address a different challenge: how to offer twenty-first-century readers
               the context they need to make sense of Field’s ekphrastic poetry while maintaining
               something like the simple, unadorned white pages on which Katherine Bradley and Edith
               Cooper chose to publish their work as “Michael Field.” Each of these online publications—and
               there are of course numerous others—offers students examples of web design choices
               that variously increase and limit access to information. Students—very much a key
               target market for these repositories—should be empowered to draw on their reactions
               to these texts to build a set of guiding design principles to shape a strategy for
               effectively publishing some piece of Wordsworth’s writing online.</p>
            <p>After analyzing their own experience with these web-based publications, students will
               test them using WebAIM’s free <a class="link_ref" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a>(WAVE), which tests any website for common accessibility failures. The program does
               not, of course, replace full usability testing with disabled users, but it does expose
               and display the many ways in which common web design decisions can create barriers
               to access (and proposes solutions to those problems). In the past, when my students
               have used WAVE to examine the accessibility of websites, they have found that much
               of what they consider to be generally bad web design is also inaccessible for disabled
               users.<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a> But they also find unexpected (and counter-intuitive) barriers in seemingly benign
               design choices. For example, a student once discovered that the “Buy Now” button on
               a major retailer’s website was hidden for screen readers, essentially making it impossible
               for the website to sell products to blind or low-vision visitors. I also often require
               students in my composition courses to use WAVE to assess the web design and digital
               writing they have done in the class; in this context, accessibility testing becomes
               an opportunity to consider audience, revision, and strategies for multimodal (re)composition.
               In “Romanticism and Feminist Disability Studies,” it would serve a similar purpose,
               but instead of only revising their own work, students will revise the scholarly practices
               of a wider field and use their findings to produce plans for new modes of publishing
               primary documents that would enable scholars to understand more fully the intersections
               of disability and gender in the Romantic period.</p>
            <p>After comparing the strategies and outcomes at work in a range of online publications,
               students will work individually or collaboratively in small groups to produce a guiding
               ethic and rationale for e-publishing some of Wordsworth’s work in ways that increase
               accessibility for all readers. While students who code may use those skills on this
               project, groups without aspiring computer scientists can use tools like Wordpress
               or Omeka to create functional, accessible prototypes without digging into the code.
               This work would be informed by their research on previous approaches to publishing
               Wordsworth’s writing, from their initial appearance in biographies of William through
               the abridged versions of Wordsworth’s writing in the early twentieth century to Levin
               and Woof’s distinct approaches to scholarly editions in recent years. In order to
               engage critically with that history, students must connect their proposed editorial
               work to conversations about how gender and disability have shaped both the archive
               and its readers. Conversations about physical and institutional access allow students
               to derive an ethic of or rationale for new online editions of Wordsworth’s work. In
               addition to a traditional proposal, which includes both a rationale and an annotated
               bibliography of critical and editorial publications their project draws on and/or
               responds to, students produce a proof-of-concept page for a piece of Wordsworth’s
               writing—perhaps a set of poems and their various revisions or a series of journal
               entries. </p>
            <p>Such an assignment could serve as a step on the path towards something like what Behrendt
               describes, in which students produce materials ready for online publishing, while
               also showing how such projects increase the accessibility of those materials. The
               project will ask students to address the lack of unmediated access to texts important
               to the literary history of disability. In so doing, it will reinforce many of the
               key ideas and questions raised by taking up Wordsworth as a figure of interest to
               the field. Scholars in disability studies and Romantic studies have done much work
               to recover marginalized authors and to reconsider history and literary production
               accordingly, but much work remains to be done. Attuning students to the limits of
               Wordsworth’s current archive serves as useful spur for students who now more than
               ever can be empowered to participate in that recovery work.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Medical doctor Iris Gibson wrote an appendix for Robert Gittings and Jo Manton’s biography
               (1985). He offers a retrospective diagnosis that identifies Dorothy’s mental illness
               as “pre-senile dementia” (282).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Examples of this sort of reading include Robert Gittings and Jo Manton’s biography,
               which describes Wordsworth’s late poem “Thoughts on my Sickbed” as “the ghost voice
               of her true self, speaking from the ruins” (276). For Gittings and Manton, the act
               of recognizing that true self becomes “almost unbearably sad” (276). Their reaction
               to Wordsworth’s late-life mental health is emblematic of scholars’ general tendency
               to enforce a boundary between Dorothy’s more neurotypical mind from her mentally impaired
               mind. Gibson suggests that Dorothy’s habitual repetition of lines of poetry are “islets”
               into her previous mind (282). That binary distinction between the real Dorothy and
               the mentally impaired Dorothy echoes a similar divide that appears in Carl H. Ketcham’s
               1978 summary of Dorothy’s late journals. Citing a bit of verse that appears late in
               her writing, Ketcham calls it the “appalling end of the more than thirty-five years
               of close intellectual and imaginative companionship recorded in Dorothy’s journals”
               (10). Pamela Woof’s more recent assessment of Wordsworth’s late-life journal pays
               explicit attention to her writing on illness and death, but nonetheless justifies
               her interest in that late writing in opposition to disability when she asserts that
               “[t]he reader knows that even in these final years there was more than imbecility
               to Dorothy Wordsworth” (175).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In this way, these assignments participate in a recent move in disability studies
               pedagogy, in which access labor become formal classroom assignments. Georgina Kleege
               and Scott Wallin describe a series of writing assignments that ask students to participate
               in the production of audio description of images and video for blind and low-vision
               users. Such assignments require students to engage with debates about best practices
               and intent and then publish their resulting work online. The assignments, then, ask
               students to not only engage with but participate in the ongoing conversation around
               online access.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in proofreading their web writing and design by catching basic issues like mis-used
               headline formatting or missing alternative text for images. Addressing these access
               issues also offers practice in writing, more generally. Proper use of headlines in
               web texts is better for both screen readers and visual design. In crafting effective
               alternative text for their images, students must both interpret the image and reflect
