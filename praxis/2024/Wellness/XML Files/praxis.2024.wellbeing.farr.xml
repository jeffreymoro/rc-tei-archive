                <p>
                    In this essay, I explore the connections between accessibility and Romanticism to discuss how we can 
                    help the disabled students in our courses achieve well-being, something that is often difficult for 
                    them to attain in institutions of higher learning (Francis et al). As one psychological study puts it, 
                    well-being is not necessarily about health or autonomy or quality of life; rather, it is an equilibrium 
                    that one finds between the fluctuating forces of challenges and resources (Dodge et. al 230). When one's 
                    challenges overwhelm one's resources, well-being–the central component of this equation–dips, rendering it 
                    elusive. The authors of said study use a see-saw analogy to illustrate a dynamic relationship: 
                    <quote>
                        In essence, stable well-being is when individuals have the psychological, social and physical resources 
                        they need to meet a particular psychological, social and/or physical challenge. 
                        When individuals have more challenges than resources, the see-saw dips, along with their 
                        well-being, and vice-versa. (230) 
                    </quote>
                    This definition of well-being takes into account resources–or what we might think of as 
                    accessibility or access–that we extend to students. Well-being is therefore the product of a shifting, 
                    inverse association, one which we have some degree of control over in our classrooms. 
                    This is not to say that our influence in this regard is infinite, but we can play a significant 
                    role in cultivating student well-being by opening up space in our classrooms for accessibility. 
                    We regularly offer students challenges, which are necessary for their intellectual growth, 
                    but do we provide them with the resources to help them maintain their well-being? 
                    The answer to this question, I think, has to do with a pedagogical disposition that we can cultivate over time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, it is our ethical responsibility to educate ourselves about access to eradicate the barriers that we 
                    unwittingly reproduce. The Romanticism classroom is an ideal space in which we can work toward this objective 
                    because the authors we teach are often oriented in uncannily similar ways to access in the disability 
                    studies tradition. Accessibility and well-being are, in fact, at the core of some strains of Romantic thought. 
                    In the coming paragraphs, I consider how we can foster an approach to accessibility that is improvisational and 
                    inclusive and which aligns with those aspects of Romanticism in which disability is a foundation for personal and 
                    community transformation.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will begin, however, by discussing how accessibility helps me, a deaf academic. In a profession that demands constant
                    vocal exchange–in conference panels, meetings, and classrooms–my hearing profile poses challenges. 
                    I've been hearing impaired in the moderately severe range for some time now, but D/deaf studies has 
                    given me a framework for thinking about my deafness as “a distinct way of being in the world, one 
                    that opens up perceptions, perspectives, and insights that are less common to the majority of hearing persons” 
                    (Bauman and Murray xv). This powerful paradigm shift has given me new ways of understanding my deafness. 
                    Still, despite the convincing philosophical underpinnings of “Deaf Gain,” the oral landscape of academia drains me. 
                    Trying to keep up with the spoken words of colleagues and students often leaves me exhausted.

                <p>
                    In my daily run-ins with the challenging demands of verbal communication, I have learned to express my access needs 
                    to friends and strangers alike. It is in these exchanges that I experience what I think of as improvisational accessibility. 
                    In characterizing accessibility as improvisational, I mean that access often occurs “spontaneously, without preparation, or
                    on the spur of the moment” (OED Online). Access often happens when people make “do with what is available” in response to varying circumstances (OED Online). 
                    Improvisation is usually necessary when interacting with disabled people like me. Disabled bodyminds invoke extraordinary circumstances because we are not 
                    accounted for in the organization of social spaces and institutions. <note place="foot" resp="author">In using the term bodymind, I am indebted to Margaret Price’s and 
                        Sami Schalk's use of the term. Schalk writes, “the term bodymind insists on the inextricability of mind and body and highlights how processes within our being impact one another 
                        in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases” (5). 
                        Bodymind contests Cartesian dualism and, for the purposes of this essay, allows for a broad conception of student engagement in the classroom.</note> </p>
                <p>
                    In my case, improvisational accessibility occurs after I've presented a paper at a conference and the panel chair repeats a question I can’t hear during the Q&amp;A, or when colleagues readily comply with my 
                    request to use speech-to-text transcription apps on our phones if we are in a loud setting. These may seem like small tokens, but they enable me to participate in conversations that would otherwise be inaccessible. 
                    In turn, my well-being is enhanced as I access the resources necessary to meet the challenge of vocal exchange. In my experience, the well-being of disabled people–our access to resources to meet the challenges of 
                    an ableist world–is to some degree reliant on an improvisational mindset in others. 
                </p>
                <p> As in these personal examples, in which colleagues interact with me in unanticipated ways, improvisational accessibility in the Romanticism classroom denotes 
                    an openness to the unexpected as we find ways to make “do with what is available” to us at any given moment. 
                    In this political moment of austerity, we might not always have the resources that we need. We can, however, 
                    become sensitized to the access needs of our students, and we can improvise to grant them access if we develop a 
                    flexible orientation in our teaching habits. </p>
                <p> Such improvisational principles are evident in Wordsworth’s conception of inspired poetry. In his “Preface to the Lyrical Ballads (1802),” William Wordsworth writes,  
                    <quote>
                        For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached, were never produced on any variety of subjects 
                        but by a man, who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also thought long and deeply. For our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, 
                        which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings; and, as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men, 
                        so, by the repetition and continuance of this act, our feelings will be connected with important subjects, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much sensibility, such habits of mind 
                        will be produced. (598) </quote>
                    Wordsworth regards good poetry as the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.” But the act of writing such poetry does not just happen suddenly; 
                    rather, it is the product of years of studied reflection. Through feeling that is “modified and directed by…thoughts” with “repetition and continuance,” 
                    poets develop “habits of mind” that yield the creation of poems that seem spontaneous. Like the creation of excellent poetry, teaching accessibly is a 
                    craft to be studied and developed. As in Wordsworth’s preface, to teach accessibly, we must develop “habits of mind” that allow for improvisation. 
                    As we gain more experience in attending to the access needs of our students, we build this mindset, and over time we learn to skillfully stray from 
                    our lesson plans and expand our curriculum to make room for all students. </p> 
                <p>
                    When we deviate from planned time to account for all of the bodyminds in the room, we crip the classroom; that is, we confront the ableism that 
                    is embedded in our collective consciousness and pedagogical habits to build more inclusive communities with students.  Indeed, finding ways to build 
                    “crip time” into our classrooms is critical for accommodating disabled students, as Margaret Price has argued. 
                    Price argues that we break from the traditional classroom, which she thinks of as a “kairotic space.” 
                    In using “kairotic,” Price invokes the classical cognate kairos which translates to “the opportune or appropriate time.” 
                    As kairotic spaces, classrooms “tend to be run under strict time constraints” (63). 
                    A kairotic space is one in which “knowledge is produced and power is exchanged” (60). 
                    Crucially, as Price argues, this time-sensitive approach to pedagogy excludes students with mental disabilities, 
                    among others.2 To resist kairos, we should be mindful of how we organize the syllabus, how we grade 
                    participation and attendance, and how we give feedback (64). Price also encourages us to learn Universal Design 
                    principles so that we can offer multiple pathways into the content we teach. 3 All of this requires that we find 
                    “ways to move” around the classroom, and, I would add, to improvise as we interact with students and progress through the semester (58). 
                    These are no small tasks, but as Price shows, access is an objective to work toward rather than a destination to which one arrives. 
                    As we learn to establish crip time through pedagogical improvisation, we mediate kairotic space for disabled students to create more accessibility in the classroom. </p>
                <p>
                    Access never looks quite the same from class to class because contexts change according to the students that compose our classrooms. 
                    This highly individualized approach to access is one that also resonates with the phenomenological character of Romanticism. 
                    Tanya Titchkosky conceives of access as an embodied experience in which wonder plays a key role. “Access,” Titchkosky argues, “is an interpretive relation between bodies” (3). 
                    Such an approach to access requires us to be aware of the other individuals with whom we share a particular space. It requires active communication and sensitive interpretation. 
                    Titchkosky urges us to conceive of access as “collective action or exploration” (12). 
                    The “politics of wonder” that we should work toward is composed in part of “a wondering about that which organizes bodies and social spaces and their worlds of meaning” (15). 
                    Wonder is also, of course, a Romantic conceit. Samuel Taylor Coleridge conceives of wonder as central to philosophical inquiry: “In wonder all philosophy began: in wonder it ends . . . 
                    But the first wonder is the offspring of ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration” (qtd in Scott 229). 
                    According to Coleridge, childlike wonder is a catalyst to philosophical reflection, which in turn enables us to reach a “higher form of the emotion” and to access truths that 
                    produce a new kind of wonder based on rational principles.4  
                    To build the wonder of accessibility into our classrooms, we should engage in dialogue, reflect collectively, and develop multiple entry points for students to access the content we teach. 
                    This pedagogical process is at the heart of Romantic epistemologies. </p>
                <p> Moreover, access is a labor of justice and a starting point for the building of community. In their Disability Visibility Project, Sandy Ho, Mia Mingus, and Alice Wong conceive of access 
                    “as not only about logistics, but about deepening our shared humanity and dignity, growing access intimacy with each other and an opportunity to create more justice and love in our world.” 
                    Elsewhere, Mingus reminds us that access should be “collective and interdependent.” 
                    Access should not be a burden that disabled people alone carry, but ideally is a principle that is shaped among a collective. 
                    This looks different in every classroom and has much to do with who we are as instructors. </p>
