               <h1><span class="head"><span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein’s Creature in the Classroom: Disrupting Disability, Race, and Medicine</span></span></h1>
            </header><br/><br/><p>I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
               complexions: but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
               first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in
               the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that
               I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
               Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. (114)</p>
            <p>By the point in Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein </span>when we hear of the Creature startling at his own reflection, we already know the
               extent of his pain and isolation, which he has eloquently expressed to Victor. We
               also know of his rejection by his creator, who regards him as a “Devil” and “vile
               insect” (99). Nearly two centuries later, in <span style="font-style:italic">Waist-High in the World </span>(1997), Nancy Mairs described a similar scene: once, on catching a glimpse of herself
               in a mirror, she “squealed,” “Eek, a cripple!’” (46). Although Mairs recalls “laughing”
               at the time, she notes that her “humor betrayed a deeper, darker reaction” based on
               her acute sense, as a disabled woman, of bodily inadequacy (46). In most ways Mairs’s
               life could hardly be more different from the Creature’s; Mairs describes a fulfilling
               career and community, an intimate and mutually supportive marriage, two children,
               and her Catholic faith. But both moments of shock illustrate the internalization of
               embodied expectations—something Adam Smith suggested when he called society a mirror
               by which we can learn to judge ourselves—and illustrate how profoundly an awareness
               of non-normative embodiment can undermine our personal sense of wellbeing.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>In this essay, we share Martha Stoddard Holmes’s sense of “how much <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein </span>has to say about disability” and share her puzzlement about why “we rarely see it
               on those terms” (375). Stoddard Holmes incisively reads <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> “‘with’ disability”—following several scholars who have read the Creature as a metaphor
               for disability, or as defined by an unnamed deformity. <a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a> We wish to go further. Fuson Wang has aptly noted how “Shelley frustrates every attempt
               to see the creature” (4), yet when historically contextualized, the novel’s few specific
               and relatively stable descriptors of the Creature’s appearance begin to seem like
               very clear and recognizable markers of nineteenth-century disease and disability.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a> Most notably, the Creature’s “dull yellow eye” and “yellow skin” are signals of illnesses
               including yellow fever (57), and the Creature’s stature, “about eight feet” (54),
               matches the advertised height of several famous eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
               “giants.”</p>
            <p>Just as <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> engages contemporaneous scientific flashpoints such as galvanism and vitality debates,
               then, we view the novel as an early exploration of “disability” in its modern sense,
               written coincident to the consolidation of medical authority over the body and the
               development of normative ideals of embodiment.<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a> The Creature embodies deformity in a general sense, is “disabled” by virtue of his
               sociocultural and aesthetic positioning within the novel, and also gestures to specific
               types of embodiment that were pathologized during the Romantic era. Importantly, the
               novel also addresses aspects of Romantic-era discussions of race, calling attention
               to the ways that Western medicine and science similarly studied, classified, pathologized,
               and exploited disabled and non-European bodies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—a
               legacy that we still live with today.<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Using Frankenstein’s Creature as a focal point, this essay addresses three pedagogical
               situations at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM), where Emily is a faculty
               member, and from where Ashley is a graduate with a degree in English and a minor in
               biological sciences. The first is a yearlong freshman-level interdisciplinary Honors
               College seminar (henceforth “Honors Colloquium”) that Emily taught in 2018 – 2019
               and in 2019 – 2020; though themed differently, both sections of Honors Colloquium
               featured historically contextualized examinations of disability and race. The second
               is “Literature of Experimentation,” a section of the capstone to USM’s English major
               that Emily taught in the spring of 2018, with Ashley as a student. Both Honors Colloquium
               and “Literature of Experimentation” were discussion-based courses; assignments included
               research presentations, low-stakes writing assignments such as reading responses and
               journals, and a final research paper. Finally, we discuss Ashley’s 2019 Honors College
               thesis, which examined <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> alongside two responses to Shelley’s novel, James Whale’s 1931 film and Victor LaValle’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span> (2018). When possible, we integrate the voices of other of Emily’s students who have
               volunteered to reflect on the course material.</p>
            <p>In what follows, we situate the Creature as the heart of a constellation of texts,
               historical and fictional figures, and conceptual concerns that we believe can allow
               students to apprehend the importance of how we react to those bodyminds we deem non-normative—the
               bodyminds of strangers, coworkers, classmates, and loved ones, and even our own.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a> The courses and connections we discuss are all transhistorical but begin with, or
               look back to, the early nineteenth century. Implicit to this essay, then, is a claim
               that to understand how disability and race function today, we need to revisit the
               Romantic era—and Mary Shelley’s Creature provides an unusually rich locus around which
               we can focus classroom conversations. It is our belief that reading Mary Shelley’s
               Creature as disabled can allow for productive and ethically important conversations
               about embodiment—especially if in doing so we situate the Creature in non-literary
               contexts, both historical and present day. By rendering the novel’s engagements with
               medicine, disability, and race concrete, conversations about the Creature can promote—and
               in some cases disrupt, or promote through disruption—students’ and professors’ sense
               of wellbeing.<span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> invites us to do the uncomfortable work of questioning our beliefs about medicine
               and rethinking our relationships with our own bodies and the bodies that surround
               us. Perhaps most importantly, Shelley’s Creature can also provide an impetus to work
               towards actively creating more inclusive and hospitable worlds.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Creature Constructed: Romantic Medicine and Spectacular Bodies</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>From the first, Emily frames <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> as a novel that interrogates scientific perspectives on non-normative embodiment.
               This is why Emily always spends significant class time on the novel’s earliest description
               of the Creature, which appears in Letter IV as Captain Walton writes to his sister
               of having witnessed a “gigantic” figure from afar. For Walton, the Creature is clearly
               a specimen whose extraordinary body demands recording for an English audience. Walton
               is drawn to the Creature, calling him (23), describing how he watched the Creature
               until he was no longer visible, and noting that “This appearance excited our unqualified
               wonder” (24). Walton situates the Creature’s body on the boundary of humanity: the
               Creature is a “traveler” and also a “he” (24)—and later is a “man” (26)—but is also
               distanced from humanity, “a being which had the shape of a man” (24). Walton also
               discloses his interpretation of the Creature’s race: the “traveler [the Creature]
               seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island” (24)—tapping into scientific
               and cultural connections between exploration, anthropology, disability, and race theory.
               Here and elsewhere the novel suggests how easily discourses of race and disability
               slipped into one another and how in many ways these discourses were mutually constitutive.
               In the 1831 “Preface” and the creation scene, the Creature’s yellow tone can be read
               as a gesture to yellow fever, or can be read as another racial reference, possibly
               suggesting (especially alongside the Creature’s dark hair) what Johann Friedrich Blumenbach
               classified as the Mongolian race (see Anne Mellor). <a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Emily’s students have been struck by Walton’s enthusiasm—his awe at the Creature,
               but also his arctic ambition and even his brotherly “love” of Victor Frankenstein
               despite Victor’s singularly “wretched…condition” and the “wildness, and even madness”
               in his eyes (25). When contextualized alongside Romantic-era balloonists, medical
               experimenters like Humphry Davy, and explorers like Joseph Banks, the passionate and
               danger-seeking Walton—and later Victor Frankenstein—look representative of the Romantic
               sciences, rather than a perversion of them. Kori Miles writes that before Honors Colloquium,
               she had “for a long time operated under the notion that there were certain entities
               that you do not challenge: God, government, and medical professionals.” Critiquing
               Walton and Frankenstein can allow students to question this presumption, and to begin
               to apprehend that medicine is not, in the words of Honors Colloquium student Eden
               Duley, “stone-cold science preserved from the influence of human prejudice and error.”
               Rather, medicine is profoundly shaped by culture, is (in Duley’s words) “subject to
               every human flaw” of those who shape it, and is marked by frequent revisions and truths
               that shift over time. In both Honors Colloquium and “Literature of Experimentation,”
               students researched and gave short presentations on medical and scientific contexts
               for <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, from galvanism to arctic exploration to race theory. By researching and critiquing
               Romantic-era medicine—which developed many features of medicine we now take for granted—students
               can develop the critical eye that Emily hopes they will deploy in examining contemporary
               medicine and approaches to embodiment.</p>
            <p>In the context of <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein and the links between Romantic-era medicine, disability, and race, Charles
                  Byrne and Sara Baartman can provide especially salient touchstones for students. Shelley’s
                  novel centers the Creature’s narrative while raising questions of voice and agency.
                  Discussing Byrne and Baartman can help us to center the experiences of the historically
                  exploited, rather than the medical authorities whose names and innovations are still
                  celebrated, while also grappling with the ways that their stories have been filtered
                  and altered in entering the historical record </span><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a><span style="font-style:italic">In many compelling ways Byrne’s and Baartman’s stories of scientific abuse echo one
                  another. Both had their identities reduced to their ethnicity and the physical traits
                  that made them valuable medical specimens: Byrne, “The Irish Giant,” was prized and
                  pathologized for his height, an advertised 8’ (the same as Mary Shelley’s Creature,
                  although Byrne was actually 7’7”); Baartman, “the Venus Hottentot,” was diagnosed
                  with “steatopygia,” a diagnosis whose sole function was to pathologize Africans who
                  appeared to European eyes to have unusually large buttocks.</span><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a><span style="font-style:italic">Both were displayed as spectacles in London, </span><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a> and both were exploited by famous men of science (John Hunter in Byrne’s case and
               Georges Cuvier in Baartman’s) through their dissection and the collection and display
               of their remains.<a class="note_back" href="#ftn20" id="ftn20_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Knowing this history, students can readily identify shades of John Hunter and Georges
               Cuvier in both Walton and Victor.<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a> Discussing the stories of people like Byrne and Baartman underscores the danger latent
               to responses of awe and exoticization—that wonder and exploitation are in fact two
               sides of the same coin. Discussing historical figures also can allow students to more
               readily picture the Creature as a human rather than as a hybrid or otherworldly monster.
               This allows for fresh classroom interpretations of <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, especially for students who have encountered the novel—or the Creature—before. For
               Ashley, discussing and later researching the Creature alongside people like Charles
               Byrne allowed her to expunge long-held images of a monster with green skin and neck
               bolts, and to begin to more concretely imagine him as he is described in Shelley’s
               novel—as the kind of figure who, like Byrne and Baartman, was used to challenge the
               boundaries of humanity. There also is a reciprocal effect to such discussions: because
               Byrne’s and Baartman’s voices have been almost completely lost to history, in some
               ways it may be easier to center them as subjects alongside the Creature’s moving narrative.</p>
            <p>Importantly, both Byrne’s and Baartman’s remains were still held in Europe at the
               turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century: Baartman was repatriated to South Africa in 2002, after periodic display
               in Paris; until 2017, when the Hunterian Collection closed for renovations, Byrne’s
               skeleton was on display in London. Knowing that the issue of Baartman’s and Byrne’s
               bodies is contemporary allows Emily’s students to trace the influence of the Romantic
               era to the present. Honors Colloquium student Kelcie Bolden writes that Baartman “is
               an important figure because we still see her legacy in modern times,” especially in
               the continued sexualization and dehumanization of Black women.<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a>Considering Baartman and Byrne as contemporary issues also invites us to question
               our own participation in the troubling patterns of objectification that determined
               the lives of people like Byrne and Baartman. In her classes, Emily has found Suzan-Lori
               Parks’s play Venus (1996) useful in exploring such issues of complicity. The play
               writes the audience into Baartman’s exploitation in its opening “Overture,” as Venus
               “revolves” 270 degrees, then an additional 90, then 180 (1 – 2). From the first, we—theatre
               goers, but also readers—are asked to confront our own desire to stare at Venus’s extraordinary
               body. Likewise, through its extensive temporal interplay, <span style="font-style:italic">Venus</span> allows students to think through the relationship between past and present, and in
               particular the legacies of the Romantic era.<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>When writing her Honors College thesis, Ashley conducted research at Philadelphia’s
               College of Physicians. She studied records related to the anonymous 19<sup>th</sup>-century Mütter American Giant,” who at 7’6” nearly matched the height of Charles
               Byrne, and visited his skeleton at the Mütter Muesum. Not only did this allow Ashley
               to more fully appreciate the exploitation of people who have been made into medical
               specimens; it also allowed her to more fully recognize her affinity with those medical
               professionals she increasingly had come to condemn. When she encountered the bones
               of the Mütter American Giant, Ashley was intending to attend medical school, and she
               experienced an uncomfortable self-recognition: she felt that could understand Victor
               Frankenstein and Robert Walton—and even John Hunter—when she found herself transfixed
               by the towering skeleton, feeling that she couldn’t look away, wanting to know more.
               The presentation of the Mütter American Giant—as an unnamed specimen on display in
               a glass box, advertised as “the tallest skeleton on exhibit in North America”—invited
               objectification, and absolved Ashley of the sense of responsibility she may have felt
               on encountering a living man of gigantic stature. Nonetheless, in retrospect Ashley
               felt embarrassment at the fact that it took her so long to regard the skeleton as
               once having been connected to a human being. Her coursework in literary studies, Ashley
               believes, allowed her to finally imagine a human back into the skeleton; like other
               proponents of the health humanities and narrative medicine, she now wonders what would
               happen if all medical professionals were required to have similar training.</p>
            <p>In Emily’s classes, conversations about the history of medicine often reached a kind
               of climax when students watched <span style="font-style:italic">Get Out</span>, which Jordan Peele has called “sort of . . . my take on <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>.” The film’s horror hinges on medicine: the protagonist, Chris Washington, is the
               latest would-be victim of a transplantation surgery, “the Coagula,” that uses Black
               bodies as hosts for the brains and consciousness of mostly white clients. The surgery
               allows these patients to recapture youth and health, while relegating the host to
               the position of a “passenger” viewing helplessly from an inner distance in the “Sunken
               Place.” The surgery also allows clients to reap what they see as the benefits of blackness,
               including physical strength and athleticism, as well as exoticized coolness (“Black
               is in fashion!,” a potential buyer exclaims to Chris in the prelude to his auction).
               Chris is a spectacle to be admired, a Black body to be bought and sold. Like the Creature—and
               Sara Baartman and Charles Byrne—Chris’s humanity and subjectivity don’t matter to
               the medical professionals and patients who will benefit from his effective murder.<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Alongside <span style="font-style:italic">Get Out</span>, Emily’s classes have discussed Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskeegee syphilis experiments,
               and James Marion Sims, the so called “Father of Modern Gynecology” who developed groundbreaking
               technologies and techniques by experimenting on unanesthetized enslaved women in Alabama.<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                     (16)
                     </sup></a> In such contexts, Dean Armitage, the father and surgeon in <span style="font-style:italic">Get Out</span>, seems less fantastical—just as historical context can render Victor Frankenstein
               more realistic. In their focus on the value of disabled and enslaved bodies to scientific
               progress, such historical figures as John Hunter and James Marion Sims, like the fictional
               characters of Victor Frankenstein and Dean Armitage, failed to consider human beings
               as more than a means to a medical end. “Literature and Experimentation” student Hiba
               Tahir found the class’s discussions of "Western Medicine’s exploitation of non-white
               bodies . . . incredibly unsettling.” Before discussing race, Emily’s “Literature of
               Experimentation” class had discussed animal experimentation, largely through The Island
               of Doctor Moreau. Tahir reflects, “It was really disturbing to know that while we
               had struggled, through various discussions, to determine if non-human creatures deserved
               humanity, some people in history had denied actual humans their humanity in such outrageously
               cruel ways.”</p>
            <p>Such conversations can be especially difficult—and especially important—for students
               majoring in the sciences or working towards careers in medicine. One such student,
               Sonny Miles, acknowledges that his “profession has had a controversial and perhaps
               cruel past.” Miles reflects that “It is important that I keep in mind just how influential
               my opinions will be to my future patients, and that not all individuals know to seek
               a second opinion.” Forensic biology major Caroline Genius writes that “When we learn
               that our science and medicine is built off of the horrors endured by [marginalized]
               people in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries . . . it allows us to see how the systems we have today perpetuate the
               inequalities.” And yet, Genius notes, “When we can learn about the roots of this system,
               we can effectively work to reverse the damage done.” Brooklynn Smith, who intends
               to pursue an MD/PhD, writes that “Modern medicine trains people to distance themselves
               from their patients and to curb empathy in the name of science, but a lack of empathy
               and a drive for innovation is what created James Marion Sims.” Smith reflects of her
               future, “More than anything, I don’t want to be James Marion Sims. I don’t want to
               replace empathy with innovation or trade humanity for science.”</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Creature Rejected: Disability and Society</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>In both Honors Colloquium and “Literature of Experimentation” Emily has taught the
               Creature’s animation as a moment at which medicine, via Victor Frankenstein, literally
               constructs disability by creating the Creature’s non-normative body—but also, by virtue
               of Victor’s rejection of his progeny, constructs the Creature as “disabled.” As student
               responses make clear, however, the particular horror of Victor’s response in the animation
               scene is that it carries the emotional impact of a rejecting parent. <a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a>The scene therefore can be said to emblematize the ways that medicine and culture
               collaborate in shaping responses to non-normative bodyminds. After Victor’s refusal
               to acknowledge his creation, the Creature’s earliest experiences continue to be of
               unmitigated rejection—by an old man, villagers, the Delaceys, William Frankenstein,
               and the companion of a drowning girl. If Walton’s initial response to the Creature
               tracks with contemporaneous scientific responses to non-normative humans—awe, a desire
               to collect—the reactions of these other characters require additional explanations.</p>
            <p>Emily’s classes, and Ashley’s thesis, looked in part to yellow fever to help explain
               the horror the Creature elicits. We would not claim that Mary Shelley intended for
               her readers to think that the Creature was infected with yellow fever. However, jaundiced
               skin and eyes were an especially potent and fearful shorthand for illness and infectious
               disease in the 19<sup>th</sup>century: yellow fever epidemics were unpredictable and medicine had proven impotent
               at treating the disease or preventing its transmission. Yellow fever also triggered
               xenophobic fears because port cities and European travelers to tropical climates had
               proven susceptible to its deadly effects. The novel’s gestures to yellow fever can
               be seen as a factor that for 19<sup>th</sup>-century audiences may have complicated and amplified responses to the Creature’s
               gigantic stature and the general sense of deformity he conveys throughout the novel.
               To more fully account for responses to the Creature, Emily’s classes look to more
               general Romantic-era responses to disability. When discussing blind old DeLacey, as
               well as Justine’s murder trial, Emily’s classes discussed the “science” of physiognomy,
               and the implications of the belief that it is possible to limn a person’s talents,
               character, and personality by attending to their appearance. Physiognomy operates
               on a fantasy of making the interior visible, of finding moral significance in one’s
               exterior—and Victor operates according to this fantasy when he concludes that “Nothing
               in human shape could have destroyed” his brother William (76).<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                     (18)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Some students suggested that the novel caused them to think about their own interpretive
               processes, and their possible complicity in adopting troubling views of those bodyminds
               they deem non-normative. One Honors Colloquium student, Caroline Genius, noted that
               “While physiognomy may not be a scientific practice today, reading Frankenstein brought
               my attention to how much it is still a social practice. I’ve begun noticing, too,
               when people judge others based on their looks or demeanor.” A second colloquium student,
               Eden Duley, remarked that “Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> has opened an internal dialogue for me on the way I myself and the rest of the world
               view” ill and disabled people, “point[ing] out the human propensity to fear and despise
               those that look different and think differently than ourselves. In seeing the way
               Frankenstein’s monster is cast out…for no crime greater than an abnormal appearance,
               I was confronted with my own tendency to be made uncomfortable by [disability or illness].”
               And yet, Duley wrote, becoming “aware” of these tendencies “has given me the opportunity
               to address it directly and better recognize the prevalence of everyday discrimination.”</p>
            <p>Emily’s class discussions often dwell on young William Frankenstein’s response to
               the Creature, which suggests how Shelley’s 19<sup>th</sup>-century readers—just like 21<sup>st</sup>-century college students—would have received contradictory messages about disability.
               The Creature has approached William because of his young age, assuming him “unprejudiced”
               because presumably he “had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity”
               (142). But the Creature’s hope is misplaced, as William interprets him as a fearful
               “ogre” who will “eat me, and tear me to pieces” (142). This is the novel’s only reference
               to an ogre, the gigantic creature that populated children’s stories. As students can
               easily recognize, in many traditional fairy tales, bodily difference is often symbolic
               of evil intent. Asking students to list physically disabled villains in popular media—fairy
               tales, comic books, Disney movies, superhero movies, crime procedurals—can be a useful
               exercise. So, too, is asking them to think of villains whose bodies do not visibly
               reflect their evil; often these villains are explicitly diagnosed with psychiatric
               conditions that in reality do not correlate with violent crime.</p>
            <p>When discussing the moment at which the Creature is shot by the companion of a girl
               he has just saved from drowning (141), Emily has drawn links to recent police shootings
               of disabled people in the United States, as well as the mechanisms by which we determine
               that someone is a threat. For example, in 2017, Magdiel Sanchez was shot dead in his
               front yard while holding a pipe—despite cries from witnesses who told cops that he
               was deaf and could not hear their commands. In 2016 a North Miami police officer shot
               Charles Kinsey, the Black occupational therapist of an autistic man named Arnaldo
               Rios-Soto; the police officer had misapprehended Rios-Soto’s toy truck as a weapon,
               although Kinsey repeatedly explained the situation to the police. The police defended
               the shooting by saying that the autistic Rios-Soto, not Kinsey, was the intended target.
               Such incidents raise difficult questions. How and why do some misapprehend disabled
               people, whose bodies may move differently from how they expect bodies will move, or
               who might communicate in ways that they don’t recognize? And how can we account for
               the intersections between disability and race when it comes to violent police responses
               to unarmed, or legally armed, citizens?</p>
            <p>Victor LaValle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span>(2018), which Emily has assigned in Honors Colloquium and which Ashley discussed in
               her thesis, directly hinges on a police shooting. Although <span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer</span> begins in the Artic with Mary Shelley’s Creature, who has survived for two centuries,
               we also soon meet a second Creature-figure in the form of Akai, the reanimated son
               of Black experimental scientist Dr. Josephine Baker.<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (19)
                     </sup></a> Akai was shot by police officers after they mistook the 12-year-old boy’s little
               league baseball bat for a gun.<span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span>frames Akai’s death in the same way that more and more people have come to interpret
               similar events: as the product of a racism that is foundational to the history of
               the United States. (<span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span>links Dr. Baker’s loss to that of Medgar Evers’s widow, and depicts Baker in the seat
               of the Lincoln Memorial when she declares herself “the Destroyer” in avenging her
               son’s death.) Similarly,<span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span> problematizes past technological milestones as well as possible technological futures.
               We may take aspects of science and medicine for granted, but like <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein,</span> LaValle’s<span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span> invites us to cultivate skepticism.</p>
            <p>Emily’s classes pursue what she hopes are troubling conversations about the agency
               of characters in, and readers of, <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer</span>. It is difficult to hold Shelley’s Creature solely responsible for what he does—he
               had no guidance or love, as students so often note—but it is also difficult to fully
               absolve him of responsibility, especially for the murders he commits out of revenge.
               From a Disability Studies standpoint, we believe it is important that the Creature
               is not merely a villain or a victim, two stereotypes that disabled characters often
               inhabit, especially in 20<sup>th</sup>- and 21<sup>st</sup>-century media. Instead, the novel may be said to offer a stringent critique of the
               common tendency to presume character from appearance, depicting the pain and futility
               with which an individual may fight against such assumptions. Because he is neither
               victim nor villain, we are forced to recognize the Creature’s human complexity. Something
               similar may be said of Dr. Josephine Baker, who assumes the mantle of “The Destroyer”
               and takes violent revenge after tremendous struggle and loss, and after fruitlessly
               contending with the systemic misogyny that led to the loss of her job and the systemic
               racism that led to the loss of her only child.</p>
            <p>In the end, Emily’s students expressed deep feeling for Mary Shelley’s Creature, but
               also the pain of feeling for him. Honors Colloquium student Mallory Extine wrote of
               the Creature that she “hurt for him,” and felt distress at being privy to so much
               of his pain and “trauma.” Honors Colloquium student Emma Smith was most moved by the
               scene in which Victor tore apart the Creature’s mate: “All he craved was a community
               and to be loved. When Victor destroyed the mate, he destroyed the Creature’s last
               chance at being loved, which in turn destroyed his last chance of fulfilling the purpose
               that God had written on the borrowed heart inside his chest.” For Ashley, the effect
               of researching and writing about both <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Destroyer </span>in her thesis was to provoke her to confront racist and ableist assumptions she had
               been acculturated to make. She did not think of her own ingrained prejudices while
               reading Shelley’s and LaValle’s novels; rather, after reading them and reflecting
               on them, she began to much more readily identify, question, and address her own quick
               judgments and microagressions.</p>
            <p>For other students, confronting the Creature allowed them to recognize internalized
               normative values that they had wielded against themselves—much like Nancy Mairs describes
               reeling at her own reflection, and then interpreting that impulsive response. Kori
               Miles wrote about how the discussions in Honors Colloquium led her to view her own
               bodymind differently.“At some point it really hit me,” she wrote. “I might not have
               all the medical verbiage to explain what's happening in my body but in a lot of ways
               I will always understand it better than someone standing on the outside looking in.”
               Reading <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, and discussing the history of medicine, she wrote, was part of recognizing and processing
               her embodied identity, and how society had shaped her sense of wellbeing. She wrote,
               <span class="quote">‘In my own experience I had to overcome the fear not of how my declining health was
                  continuing to encroach upon and diminish my quality of life, but on how differently
                  people would see me if they knew the extent of my disability. As a young woman I had
                  to address whether or not my body’s dysfunction had at all diminished my feminine
                  beauty. As a young black woman I had to face the fact that seeking treatment and medication
                  was almost as if I was crossing an invisible barrier into an untapped sphere of vulnerability.
                  I experienced none of these difficulties separately but rather they acted in conjunction
                  with one other.’</span> What Miles describes is, Emily hopes, is an ongoing process of seeking and questioning
               and scrutinizing that may allow each of us to have more agency over how we view and
               treat ourselves as bodyminds. Such seeking and questioning and scrutinizing also may
               help us to be more accountable for the ways that we interpret—and impact—the bodyminds
               we encounter.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Creature and Crip Futures</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>As humanists, we are trained to consider the kinds of difficult questions that medicine
               necessitates, such as how we do—and could otherwise—value different kinds of bodyminds,
               and what constitutes a life worth living. Many of us teach our students to identify
               biases and critique stereotypes, and teach literature that allows our students to
               consider the perspectives of people who are different from them. As literary scholars,
               we can understand and articulate the importance of the language we use when talking
               or writing about certain kinds of bodily conditions. We also understand the importance
               of narrative and why, for example, it matters if a doctor believes their patient’s
               account of her own body, or what it might mean for technology to contradict a patient’s
               sense of his own symptoms. “Literature of Experimentation” student Zachary Wheeler
               suggests, “The world needs scientists and engineers in order to push humanity forward
               and bring to life extraordinary and impossible ideas, but we need those individuals
               in philosophy and the arts to inspire us to keep pushing and ethically guide how we
               choose to do that.” Or, as Honors Colloquium student and future medical professional
               Sonny Miles has commented, humanistic inquiry can be seen as part of a “a system of
               checks and balances” that is “necessary … in order to keep [science and medicine]
               functioning fairly and humanely.” </p>
            <p>Hiba Tahir wrote that reading <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> “forced me to contend with what it means to be human”—a line of inquiry that left
               her “disturbed” and “bewildered,” and that she had never before considered. Now a
               graduate student in creative writing, Tahir says that she was “still reeling from
               those questions” and that “they continue to haunt me in my poetry studies.” It is
               our hope that the Creature can likewise continue to haunt us, but we hope he also
               may guide us. Although he regarded his reflection with “terror,” the Creature requested
               a mate who looked like him. This request often is read as pragmatic or defeatist,
               but it also can be interpreted as resistant, or even as recuperative. Emily teaches
               it as a promise to behold disability and to not turn away. This is, of course, precisely
               what the Creature himself was denied by his creator, by strangers, and by a child,
               all of whom covered their eyes or otherwise averted their gaze; even old DeLacey,
               the one character who conditionally accepted the Creature, implied that were he not
               blind, he would “judge of [the Creature’s] countenance” (134). The Creature’s request
               of Victor is to enable his future with a similarly embodied companion, explicitly
               removed from European society in South America. In imagining this future, the Creature
               resists curative logic (see Alison Kafer), identifying the problem of disability as
               a problem with (European) society and not with his bodymind itself. We can and should
               regard the Creature’s story as a cautionary tale. But we may also look to the Creature
               as we work to imagine crip futures—the possibilities that move beyond the norms that

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Smith suggests this generally, but as Paul Kelleher has argued, Smith’s theory of
               sympathy operationally and conceptually depends on the category of deformity.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In a short reading of the novel, Lennard J. Davis lays out a provocation, “We do not
               often think of the monster in Mary Shelley’s work as disabled, but what else is he?”—and
               goes on to read the Creature as “a disruption in the visual field” (143). Yet, as
               Fuson Wang has noted, “there still exists no detailed account of [the novel’s] take
               on disability” (3). Wang’s and Stoddard Holmes’s articles have begun to fill in this
               gap, as has Jared Richman’s reading of<span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> as “both a disability narrative and a passing novel” that hinges on “elocutionary
               mastery” (190 – 1). It is worth mentioning that foundational literary disability studies
               scholars David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder view the novel as an example of the instrumental
               and exploitative use of disability as a plot device—a conclusion that scholars of
               Romanticism might find more difficult to reach, given the tendency to view Shelley’s
               Creature as complex and sympathetic, and to view the novel’s ending as unresolved.
               Also see Essaka Joshua on blindness in the novel.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Wang rightly calls attention to the novel’s ambiguous characterization of the Creature’s
               “deformity of…aspect” (76); its “unreliable narration, contradiction, half-truths,
               exaggerations, and strategic prevarication” (3); and the “flagrant contradiction”
               in the most detailed bodily description we are given of the Creature, in the animation
               scene (4).Emily teaches these features of the novel as characteristic of descriptions
               of disability: because disability can “disorder expectations” (Garland-Thomson <span style="font-style:italic">Staring</span> 37) and trigger what Ato Quayson calls “aesthetic nervousness,” it often provokes
               unstable narration.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Essaka Joshua’s <span style="font-style:italic">Physical Disability in British Romantic Literature</span> (2020) has a chapter on <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein </span>in which Joshua reads the Creature in the contexts of deformity and monstrosity while
               arguing, as her book does as a whole, that it is anachronistic to identify “disability”
               in the Romantic era. (As what Joshua calls a “pre-disability” period, she claims that
               Romanticism requires us to use another set of terms.) By contrast, Emily views Joshua’s
               thorough and compelling discussion of the Creature alongside 18<sup>th</sup>- and 19<sup>th</sup>-century accounts of monstrosity and deformity as in fact evidence of the existence
               of an operative Romantic-era concept of “disability” as a sociocultural identity and
               aesthetic category—even if it wasn’t so named by 1818. In many cases (such as <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>), literary, medical, and philosophical authors explicitly engaged, and sometimes
               even theorized, the social and aesthetic dimensions of non-normative embodiment—the
               foundation of “disability” for many contemporary Disability Studies scholars. (See
               Emily B. Stanback’s 2016 book <span style="font-style:italic">The Wordsworth-Coleridge Circle and the Aesthetics of Disability</span>.)</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In our approach to the historical intersections of race and disability, we hope to
               address Nirmalla Erevelles’s call for “more robust and complex analyses of race and
               disability” that “are necessary for us to move beyond the initial conceptual space
               of analogy.” A way to do this, Erevelles suggests, is by “engag[ing] the historical
               contexts and structural conditions within which the identity categories of race and
               disability intersect.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In using Margaret Price’s term “bodymind” here and elsewhere, we have in mind Sami
               Schalk’s note that the phrase is apt for discussions of race, in addition to disability,
               insofar as the “enmeshment of mind and body” can be useful in “discussing the toll
               racism takes on people of color” (5).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Over the course of the novel both the Creature and Victor Frankenstein speak of the
               Creature’s identity in ways that link him to contemporaneous discourse on race. This
               is a topic of discussion in Emily’s classes, although space does not permit us to
               discuss it in detail here. In addition to Anne Mellor, the several scholars who have
               read the Creature in the context of race include Allan Lloyd Smith, who explores the
               novel’s “thematics of race and slavery” in relation to “contemporary discourses on
               race, slavery, and antislavery” (209), and H. L. Malchow, who explains how characterizations
               of the Creature “drew upon contemporary attitudes towards non-whites”—what he calls
               a “hidden, or ‘coded’” dimension of the Creature’s characterization (90, 92). Just
               as many critics have read the Creature’s “deformity” as unclassifiable, some critics
               have suggested that the Creature resists racial classification. Elizabeth Bohls claims
               that the Creature exists “Beyond any specific category of difference or otherness
               – gender, race, class” and it is for this reason that he “comes to symbolise a principle
               of absolute outsiderhood” (168).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               wishes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               to the development of gynecology: “Most pioneering surgeries” in gynecology in the
               United States “happened during interactions between white southern doctors and their
               black slave patients” (4). In a similar vein, Jim Downs has argued that epidemiology
               developed in part because of the opportunities to study disease afforded by slave
               ships and plantations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">Martha Stoddard Holmes has suggested that the Creature’s awakening scene may be interpreted
               as “dramatiz[ing] an unsatisfactory parental response to the birth of a disabled child”
               (374). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">Emily teaches the 1831 edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein </span> in part because of an added passage in which Elizabeth becomes a more direct foil
               to Victor: she is invested in poetry, the sublimity of nature, and “the magnificent
               appearance of things,” while Victor is invested in “the hidden laws of nature” (36).
               Elizabeth also is no longer Victor’s cousin, and her beauty is described in greater
               detail in 1831. The later edition therefore amplifies the novel’s engagements with
               issues of embodiment and aesthetics, as well as inheritance and bloodlines.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               graphic novel gesture to Shelley’s characters in complex ways. Dr. Baker is in some
               ways a figure of Victor Frankenstein, but also resembles the Creature in her losses
               and revenge. Both Akai and the Bride (formerly Pliers, Akai’s father) are figures
               for the Creature in the scientific, experimental, hybrid constitution of their bodies.
               As a figure who seeks the advancement of science at all cost, Dr. Baker’s boss embodies
               some of Victor’s characteristics.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
