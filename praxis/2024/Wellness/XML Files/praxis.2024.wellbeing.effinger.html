            <p>For years, I have walked my dog along a winding, picturesque trail that hugs a quiet
               section of the Grand River in Kitchener, Ontario (Canada). Along this trail two institutions
               enter into view: the city’s wastewater treatment facility, and Canada’s newest and
               largest federal women’s prison, the Grand Valley Institution for Women (GVI). While
               Canadians might remember this prison as the place that housed convicted serial killer
               Karla Holmolka, the GVI has been increasingly garnering attention for its internal
               troubles, such as the case of Ashley Smith, an inmate who in 2007 took her own life
               while under watch of multiple correctional officers — a story that received national
               media coverage — and the 2016 death of Terry Baker, another incarcerated woman at
               the GVI.</p>
            <p>On these walks, I have often thought about Foucault’s remarks on heterotopic spaces,
               for surely it is symbolic that the site selected for the new prison was near the waste
               facility.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a> But it was on one particular summer stroll, while I was thinking about Romantic poetry,
               that I found myself wondering about the other insidious proximities that marked our
               spaces. Standing on the trail, looking at the prison that was jarringly framed through
               both the green canopy of the forest and the dull grey barbed wire and chain-link fence,
               what came into focus was the uneasy silence in which these two radically different
               spaces co-existed. Questions pressed me: Where were the continuities between our spaces?
               In what ways were we all — perhaps with the exception of my dog, now splashing about
               in the river — suffering from what Blake famously called our “mind-forg’d manacles”
               (Erdman 27)? Could the incarcerated women see the woods? What did nature mean to them?
               What place, if any, did nature have in prison? Did they look at the woods or perhaps
               even the walking trail as Coleridge might have in “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison”?
               What place, if any, did poetry have in their lives while in prison? These questions
               stuck with me. That moment became the germ behind a community-based experiential learning
               assignment that I developed for an undergraduate Nineteenth-Century British Literature
               course, a year-long, third-year survey class for English majors. In what follows,
               I describe the planning, development, and execution of the assignment before turning
               to a consideration of how community-based learning (CBL) initiatives, such as this
               one, activate the potential of three growing, but currently separate, sympathetic
               discourses within Romantic scholarship: the public humanities, the discourse of care,
               and the prison narrative.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a> As a pedagogy that connects the classroom and the community, while recognizing them
               as mutually informing bodies aimed at making a positive difference, CBL offers community
               partners access to a greater, engaged audience committed to social and community awareness
               and action, and offers students and scholars of Romanticism an expanded sense of how
               our field can make a positive difference in building communities when we turn our
               work inside out.</p>
            <p>In February 2016, I facilitated a one-day poetry workshop, held in a classroom at
               the GVI. Modelled, in part, on the Walls to Bridges program (W2B), a Canadian program
               rooted in the pedagogic principles of the U.S. Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program,
               the project involved bringing together incarcerated (or “inside”) students and thirteen
               university (“outside”) students from my Nineteenth-Century British Literature course
               at Huron University (London, Ontario) in order to create a brief but meaningful exchange
               between these different student bodies. In fact, one of the challenges in designing
               this activity was thinking about the outcomes for not only my own students, but the
               incarcerated students, too.</p>
            <p>I learned through my research and early discussions with the education director of
               the GVI and the staff of the Walls to Bridges program that this workshop would be
               meaningful for the inside students because education programming enhances prisoner
               wellbeing, including their mental health and personal growth (Davis <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span> 2013; Duguid and Pawson 1998; Lockwood <span style="font-style:italic">et al </span>2012; Sokoloff and Schenck-Fontaine 2017, Vacca 2004). Moreover, the benefits to their
               wellbeing extend beyond the prison walls, as exchanges between inside and outside
               students expose both groups to a multiplicity of perspectives and help challenge preconceptions.
               Through these thoughtful exchanges, the outside students may come to rethink their
               positions on crime and the prison-industrial complex. Education initiatives also contribute
               to the health of the prison system; the prison gains new learning opportunities for
               its inmates, who benefit from creative expression and collective scholarly discussion,
               which allows them to experience their voices as meaningfully engaged with non-incarcerated
               voices. Finally, in practical ways, educational activities may positively impact plans
               for release and reintegration, as participation demonstrates the inside students’
               ability to self-regulate, collaborate, and work both independently and with a diverse
               group of others. Participation in education programming, including workshops like
               this one, may thus support future job possibilities or entry into higher education
               programs (Tewksbury and Stengel 2006). With a clear sense, then, of how this workshop
               could contribute to the public good, we began.</p>
            <p>The outside students were mostly third- and fourth-year English majors in their early
               twenties. Few had ever participated in community-based learning projects, and none
               had ever visited a prison or jail or had conversations with incarcerated peoples.
               As in-class discussions prior to our workshop revealed, their understandings and expectations
               of prison were largely shaped by media representations, including popular tele-series
               like <span style="font-style:italic">Orange is the New Black</span>. Conversely, the inside students were drawn from the medium- and maximum-security
               units of the prison and ranged in ages from early twenties to thirties. They had spent
               varying durations of time (some in months, others in years) in both provincial and
               federal prisons from across the country for sentences, including life-sentences, pertaining
               to drugs, violence, and murder. They had varying degrees of education among them;
               some were working on obtaining their high-school diploma, others were taking university
               courses either in-person through W2B or online through other institutions, and one
               woman already had an undergraduate degree with plans towards graduate-level work.
               Mostly, their experiences with university courses were rooted in the social sciences,
               unlike the literature-based background of the outside students. However, what might
               be the most pragmatic difference between these inside and outside participants was
               the (in)accessibility to the internet. While outside students readily make use of
               the internet – a quick trip to Google or Wikipedia – as a way to help decipher a text,
               no such an opportunity exists for incarcerated peoples in Canadian provincial and
               federal prisons. This meant that the close readings that the incarcerated women shared
               with the class during the workshop were entirely their own – a fact not lost on the
               outside students, many of whom admitted on the bus ride back to campus that they felt
               deeply humbled by the insightful observations and comments made by the inmates. More
               on that bus ride later.</p>
            <p>While the prison workshop itself was brief, preparations were months in the making
               and essential to its success. Photocopies of the poems to be discussed were shared
               with the inside students prior to the workshop. Both inside and outside students read,
               in advance, the same selection of Romantic poems that treat the prison as experience
               or metaphor. As I explained in some introductory remarks before we launched into a
               discussion of the texts, many Romantic writers were intensely concerned with questions
               of freedom, authority, social injustices, resistance and revolution. <span style="font-style:italic">Liberté, égalité, fraternité!</span> While some writers themselves spent time behind bars or had brushes with the (in)justice
               system (cf. Thelwall, Blake, Helen Maria Williams, the Lambs, De Quincey, Shelley),
               others were drawn to the imaginative space of the prison as a way of exploring various
               states of confinement (cf. Godwin, Wollstonecraft, Byron, Coleridge).<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>While sitting in a circle (a formation designed to bring all students face-to-face
               with one another), we completed creative writing exercises, critically discussed the
               texts at hand, and shared our reflective responses to the work with one another. The
               very act of sharing responses with the group was intended to help mark the emergence
               of a reflective space, emphasizing the role that literature can play in the creation
               of community. A more detailed description of the assignment follows in the subsequent
               sections.</p>
            <p>In the planning-stage of the project, I consulted with both community and campus partners:
               the prison’s Education Director and the program coordinators from the Walls to Bridges
               Collective (W2BC), which is a think tank based in Wilfrid Laurier University’s Faculty
               of Social Work that since 2011 has offered university-based programming at the GVI.<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a> Emailing with the W2BC was essential to first determine if there was interest among
               the incarcerated women for such a collaboration. I secured funding from the RBC Foundation
               and Willie May &amp; William H. Lumpkin Community-Based Learning Grant, which covered
               the cost of transportation to and from the prison and refreshments for the event.
               Teresa Hubel, then Chair of Huron University’s English Department, generously supplied
               workshop materials for the incarcerated students, which the women were able to keep.
               Finally, all workshop participants from the university were required to complete a
               background check a few months prior to the visit before being granted permission to
               participate. Like all visitors at the GVI, our class was subject to a security screening,
               much like in an airport. Photo IDs were scrutinized and hands were swabbed for drugs
               (a major security concern).</p>
            <p>While it was a mandatory assignment for the outside students, it was strictly voluntary
               for those on the inside. Many of the inside students had prior experience in a classroom
               setting with university students, while others simply had a general interest in poetry
               and creative writing. For the outside students, this assignment consisted of three
               parts: (1) attendance and participation at the GVI; (2) participation in a post-workshop
               discussion back at the university; and (3) a formal, written reflection on the workshop
               to submitted at the end of term, as part of the final exam. The final assignment sheet
               can be found below in “Appendix A.” This assignment was designed to be an opportunity
               to include CBL opportunities for students within the parameters of a traditional literature
               survey course. This was not a specialized course exploring the campus-community connection,
               nor was it focused on Romantic prison writings – although, of course, this project
               would be at home in such courses. Instead, my goal was to design a CBL-component in
               the traditional literature survey course, as a way of exploring how individual projects
               can make connections between the classroom and the community. After all, this is part
               of the challenge many instructors perceive in making course material relevant to students
               beyond the classroom and in other areas of their lives. </p>
            <p>In the prison classroom, students sat in a circle, in keeping with the circle pedagogy
               central to both Canada’s W2B program and the US Inside-Out program. Within the circle,
               each student is equal and has a shared responsibility in the life of the class, while
               the instructor serves as group facilitator and shares, like everyone else, in the
               learning process.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a> However, outside the circle, my role in the outside classroom was more formal; I
               delivered a lecture-discussion on the history of incarceration and penal reform throughout
               the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and assigned selections from Foucault’s <span style="font-style:italic">Discipline and Punish</span>, Bentham’s <span style="font-style:italic">Panopticon</span>, and Elizabeth Fry’s <span style="font-style:italic">Observations in Visiting, Superintendence and Government of Female Prisoners</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a> This helped establish a general movement away from prisons as disorderly places in
               the eighteenth century toward orderly and strictly regulated places by the mid-nineteenth
               century. Such knowledge would further enhance our visit to a twenty-first century
               prison.</p>
            <p>I also prepared my students by lecturing on the politics of incarceration and the
               role of prison-based educational programming in Canada. For the outside students,
               whose exposure to incarceration was virtually non-existent, it was important to stress
               that incarceration in Canada differs from that in the United States (where most of
               the media representations of prisons are based). In Canada, there is what Simone Weil
               Davis calls “the blistering and tragic scale of criminalization and overincarceration
               of Indigenous people,” a group which alone makes up 23% of Canada’s prison population,
               though in some provinces Indigenous peoples make up between 90-98% of the population
               in jails and prisons (Davis, “Beyond ‘Replication’” 259-60). In Canadian federal prisons,
               educational programs are understood to “facilitate inmates’ reintegration by increasing
               educational skill levels through the provision of accredited programs.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a> While Adult Basic Education (grades 1 to 12) is Correctional Service Canada’s educational
               priority, additional education programs are available, including Additional Language
               Programs, Adapted Education Programs, and General Educational Development. Prisoners
               have access to post-secondary education programs, in most cases through paper-based
               correspondence with an accredited university, college or CEGEP, and normally pay the
               costs themselves, although the institution may cover some or all of the cost of education.<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a> However, the mid-1990s in both the US and Canada saw government cutbacks and program
               closures to postsecondary educational opportunities for incarcerated peoples.<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>While there are differences between the Canadian W2B program and the American Inside-Out
               models, what is common to both is the semi-anonymous space of the incarcerated classroom:<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a> students use only first names and are prohibited from communicating outside of the
               course or workshop. “It is important,” notes Lori Pompa, founder and director of Inside-Out,
               “that outside participants are not studying their incarcerated classmates; they are
               not serving in a counselling or teaching or advising capacity” toward the incarcerated
               students, nor are they privy to the details or circumstances surrounding their incarceration
               (“Breaking Down the Walls” 257).</p>
            <p>The three-hour workshop at the GVI consisted of two clusters of activities. First,
               we performed a number of short creative writing ice-breaker exercises that were linked
               to the readings and topics at hand. For example, one activity was to collectively
               write a story through a spoken word-chain (where one person says a word, and the next
               person says the first word that comes into their mind as quickly as possible) — an
               exercise designed to create group cohesion through sharing, but also to show language
               and storytelling as spaces of freedom. Students were encouraged to say any word that
               came to mind — a task that proved to be very challenging. Another activity was timed
               writing, which involved students writing for three minutes without stopping (then
               two minutes, then one minute), each time beginning with a single word as their inspiration
               or writing prompt. Inside and outside students took turns selecting the words. One
               word in particular, “window,” produced many moving creative reflections from the students,
               even a short poem. After each exercise ended, students were encouraged to share their
               writing out loud with the group. The incarcerated women were consistently the first
               volunteering to share, and their contributions were enthusiastic, reflective, self-expressive,
               and respectful.</p>
            <p>The second activity was an informal discussion of a few short poems from the Romantic
               period, a period that, as John Bugg notes, saw the rise and reform of prisons throughout
               Europe, and that subsequently gave birth to the genre of prison literature (50). One
               week prior to the workshop, all inside and outside students received a handout with
               the texts to be discussed. These poems, which were selected by my class, included
               Anna Barbauld’s “The Mouse’s Petition” (1773), William Blake’s “London” (1794), John
               Thelwall’s “The Cell” (1795), Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison”
               (1797), and Dorothy Wordsworth’s “Thoughts on My Sick-Bed” (1832). These poems treated
               the prison as an experience or a metaphor, drawing on themes of enclosure, confinement,
               and solitude in various senses (intellectual, emotional, political, as well as physical).
               While some of these texts treated these conditions or states in positive terms, as
               necessary conditions for artistic, creative expression, others framed them as oppressive
               architectures of power and obstacles to change. </p>
            <p>Students collectively shared their personal responses to these texts and made intertextual
               connections between them. We all shared a laugh when one inside student commented
               on how “whiny” Coleridge sounded as he complained about his lime-tree bower. He wouldn’t
               have lasted, quipped another inside student, a single day in the GVI.<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a> Conversation gravitated toward the major common threads within these poems, such
               as the positive influence of nature and the importance of the imagination. The incarcerated
               students described their own strained relationships with the natural world. A number
               of women spoke candidly about their combined efforts to save food to feed the squirrels
               and rabbits that breach the prison fences. Indeed, one inside woman, who admitted
               to being envious of animals’ freedom to cross the barbed-wire fence, reminded me of
               the Poet in Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Alastor</span> who laments the beauty and freedom of the swan flying overhead while he remains mired
               in the “wide and melancholy waste” (273). Another incarcerated woman spoke of her
               attempt to save and germinate apple seeds in her cell as a way of bringing beauty
               and life into an inhospitable environment (they were removed by the prison guards
               during a raid). Beyond reflections on nature, another incarcerated student shared
               how one of the poems we read, Dorothy Wordsworth’s “Thoughts on My Sick-Bed,” spoke
               to her own feelings of loneliness as well as the freedom afforded by her memories.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the workshop, inside students admitted that while they were not
               frequent readers of poetry (preferring mostly self-help books), they had enjoyed the
               poems and they might seek out poetry in the future.<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a> Outside students participated in a debriefing of the workshop in the class following
               the event. Back in the university classroom, outside students were asked to evaluate
               themselves, specifically their engagement and performance within the experience, and
               to share their insights and observations with the class. Numerous outside students
               described how the space of the incarcerated classroom quickly felt familiar, and how
               jarring it was to be reminded at various points, such as when an alarm went off, that
               they were inside a prison. Some outside students confessed to feeling somewhat shadowed
               by the depth and intensity of the inside students’ comments and readings of the poems.
               One outside student shared that she felt emotionally overwhelmed by their stories.
               One student later wrote on course evaluations that this experience was the highlight
               of their entire undergraduate education.</p>
            <p>I suspected this post-workshop debriefing would produce these kinds of responses,
               for what was a very energetic, boisterous bus ride from the university to the prison
               was, on the hour-long drive back, a very quiet ride. When asked about why they were
               so quiet, my students said that they were processing the experience. Some said they
               were frustrated that the experience was so short and had wanted more time to talk
               with the incarcerated women. One student shared that she was holding back tears at
               multiple points throughout the workshop, upset over the inside women’s lack of freedom.
               Many students expressed feeling guilty over being able to leave the prison with the
               knowledge that their new classmates could not. All outside students agreed that their
               expectations changed. </p>
            <p>My goal in designing this experiential activity was to recast Romantic poetry and
               inject it with new life and new lives, by bringing this poetry into meaningful connection
               with a greater public beyond the parameters of the traditional university classroom.
               Could there be a way to reduce not only the historical distance between our present
               and the Romantic past, but also the more challenging distance between the discourse
               and experience of incarceration? At its heart, this was a project about collapsing
               distances. If Romantic poetry about incarceration seemed doubly removed, discussing
               it in a prison classroom with currently incarcerated individuals helped make this
               poetry more accessible. For instance, the incarcerated women shared that in important
               ways their current conditions were not those facing Romantic prisoners. Their cells
               were not as Thelwall describes his in “The Cell,” with its “damp foul floor, the ragged
               wall / And shattered window, grated high” (5-6).<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a> And yet, for as physically different as Romantic and present-day prisons are, the
               incarcerated women were quick to connect with the poem’s “Patriot” (2), who within
               the “noxious gloom” (1) is still able to “smile” (4) because of his memories, as he
               “Looks inward to his heart and sees / The objects that must ever please” (13-14).
               While outside students immediately read the poem’s “Patriot” as a political prisoner,
               having learned about the French Revolution in the early weeks of our course, one incarcerated
               woman thoughtfully offered a different reading of the word “patriot,” as someone who
               fights for what they believe in. The challenge of incarceration, she explained, is
               to remain a patriot, that is, to stay committed to those things worth fighting for,
               such as freedom, without losing hope. Many of the women spoke about the importance
               of returning to their memories as a critical way of managing their mental health and
               personal wellbeing while serving their sentences.</p>
            <p>During the workshop, I asked the group to think about what today’s equivalent of “The
               Cell” might be, in light of these historical differences. The incarcerated women insisted
               that if written today, Thelwall’s poem would refer to the biggest problems of the
               prison industrial complex: overcrowding, interpersonal violence, lack of supports
               for mental health, and administrative segregation (otherwise known as solitary confinement).
               This discussion in particular emphasized the continuity between these historical moments;
               deplorable conditions and methods persist albeit in different forms. For those of
               us from the outside, the discussions that followed from this poem made us aware of
               a different kind of insidious dampness behind the exterior walls of a modern penal
               institution with its manicured landscaping, well-maintained parking lot, and friendly
               correctional officers’ faces.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, this workshop was a mere toe-dip into the deep waters of inside-out learning,
               but it gave me a sense of what a more sustained engagement could accomplish. The project
               has also opened doors for undergraduate students: one outside student who actively
               participated in the workshop accepted a meaningful summer research assistantship at
               Huron University where she worked to develop future community-based learning (CBL)
               opportunities. In September 2016, she travelled on behalf of the university to Norway
               to research potential international CBL-partnerships.</p>
            <p>Beyond this one individual student success story, the hope and biggest payoff of this
               kind of learning is to trigger, as Pompa puts it, “a new way of seeing the world,
               in which everyone involved shares an opportunity to work through their stereotypes
               and myths” (257), and to which I would add <span style="font-style:italic">and recognizes the importance of the humanities in building bridges across institutions
                  and communities</span>. The transformative pedagogical work of W2B and Inside-Out, and the linkages they
               create between the university and the prison, raise larger questions and new perspectives
               through which to cross-examine each institutional body. Is there a way to see their
               various crises as interlinked? For example, at a time when prisons are increasingly
               faced with growing populations, and humanities programs and classrooms the inverse
               trend, how might these two bodies in “crisis” speak <span style="font-style:italic">positively</span> to one another? <a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                     (15)
                     </sup></a> Indeed, prisons and universities might benefit from a more sustained thinking about
               the impact of humanities programming in the reduction of recidivism and in thoughtfully
               informing policies and processes around segregation and reintegration. After all,
               the number of complaints from incarcerated women at the GVI has dramatically increased
               (139%) within the last three years. Canada’s federal Correctional Investigator, Howard
               Sapers, received 344 complaints from the GVI in 2015-2016, a number that comprises
               nearly 41 percent of complaints from federally incarcerated women in all of Canada.<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Romanticists are increasingly thinking through the relationship between classrooms
               and communities, and with good reason.<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a> The payoff of community-based learning, such as that modelled in the W2B, Inside-Out
               and public humanities movements, is contributing to the public good, and to expand
               the range and impact of academic discussions beyond the parameters of the campus classroom.
               Yet one critique levelled against community-based learning is precisely on the grounds
               of this paternalistic drive to be helpful to the community Other (Mitchell 2008).
               Intentionally by design, this workshop was not curative; it was not aimed at healing
               individuals or the incarcerated community. In keeping with the spirit of W2B and Inside-Out,
               the workshop was “<span style="font-style:italic">not</span> about helping, researching, or mentoring incarcerated students; the pedagogical foundation
               is collaborative learning in which all students are equal carriers of knowledge” (Pollack
               “Building Bridges” 504). This, however, is not to deny the palliative experiences
               of this kind of learning, facilitated by our conversations of Romantic poetry. Indeed,
               as Nyki Kish notes, in reference to her experience of taking a W2B course while locked
               up in the GVI’s maximum security unit, there is “a healing quality to the circle setting”
               (Freitas, McAuley and Kish 308). In the class circles, Kish continues: <span class="quote">‘there was no hierarchy and there were not the power struggles that dominated my experience
                  with both guards and other imprisoned women in max. In class circles I felt safe to
                  think, and share, and interact, and especially as our class read texts and poetry
                  relevant to oppression, criminalization and issues of imprisonment, I began to find
                  something I had lost in the trauma of experiencing the penal system: my voice. (308)’</span> Helping incarcerated peoples to find their voices is often cited as a desired outcome
               of prison writing programs. Lisa Rhodes, reflecting on her time spent mentoring prisoners
               through Pen America’s Prison Writing Mentorship, sees writing as “the catharsis to
               help them [prisoners] through their struggles” (164). North of the border, Sylvie
               Frigon describes the goal of the creative writing prison workshops developed by the
               Ontario Francophone Authors Association as providing “les voies/voix de la fiction”
               (129;<span style="font-style:italic">the paths/voice of fiction</span>) to inmates in Québec prisons by publishing their texts on the outside. Writing is
               frequently framed as offering prisoners both a space for self-expression and a vehicle
               for reconnection to both the outside world and the self. Indeed, research specifically
               supports the impact of arts and writing programs on prisoners’ lives. In 2014, Larry
               Brewster studied projects modeled after the Arts-In-Corrections (AIC) program in four
               California state prisons and measured changes in attitude and behavior of inmates
               participating in a 12-week arts program (poetry, writing, theatre, visual arts). There
               was a positive correlation between participation in the arts programming and improved
               time management, social competence, achievement motivation, intellectual flexibility,
               emotional control and self-confidence, among others. The study also found a reduction
               in disciplinary reports and a greater participation in other academic programming.
               Thus, we can speak of education’s palliative work in the prison, and also more specifically
               of the arts.</p>
            <p>What was interesting to learn, however, was that this experience was positive not
               only for the inside students but those outside as well, and this largely rested on
               how this learning happened. As students told me during our post-workshop discussion,
               they thought it was the larger experience of sitting in a circle, collaboratively
               working with new classmates from such different lived realities as them, listening
               to first-hand experiences of incarceration, and having intense discussions over the
               shared content that made it so meaningful. For me, their answers raised some more
               questions: what role, then, did these particular poems play in creating this experience?
               What if it had been a different genre?<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                     (18)
                     </sup></a> And how did the fact that it was a one-time, intense but fleeting experience shape
               students’ impressions? What was the relationship here between the workshop’s content
               and form?</p>
            <p>I suspect that the fact that the poems were about incarceration helped shift the perceived
               authority in the space of the prison classroom away from the outside students toward
               the inside students. In giving the incarcerated women the lead in our discussions,
               in having the outside students listen to their responses to the historical differences
               and continuities of the incarcerated experience from the Romantic period to the present
               day, everyone in the room was learning with and from one another. More than anything,
               Romantic poetry ultimately served as the conduit for more profound learning outcomes:
               first, through these conversations, the outside students confronted their preconceptions
               about prisoners as dangerous, uneducated, inarticulate, and uninterested in poetry;
               and second, the outside students gained literary insights from the prisoners, as “the
               potential objects of knowledge in those jail classrooms (e.g. prisoners) become subjects
               of literary study” (Wiltse 21). In coming to recognize how they learned about the
               Romantics with and from the prisoners in these intellectual discussions about literature
               (rather than the other way around), I am pleased to think that my students experienced
               a positive disruption to their preconceptions about their sense of privilege and the
               flow of knowledge in their encounters with groups and communities beyond the campus.
               Thus, I came away from the experience thinking in broader ways about how formal or
               structural changes to pedagogy can shape our relationship to the content in profound
               ways. In this sense, the experience of teaching Romantic poetry in the prison classroom
               contributed to my own pedagogical wellbeing; it opened me up to thinking about new
               spaces and configurations for teaching within the humanities.</p>
            <p>Increasingly the mission of the humanities is an outward-looking one: a key objective
               of public humanities initiatives is “to cultivate a renewed spirit of citizenship
               and engagement through arts and humanities research and collaboration,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (19)
                     </sup></a> an objective deeply rooted in the Romantic ideals of <span style="font-style:italic">Bildung</span>. Similarly, the revaluation of Schiller’s concept of aesthetic education is at the
               heart of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s hope for the socially engaged humanities. We,
               who practice and study within the humanities, need to become, as Peter Brooks puts
               it in <span style="font-style:italic">The Humanities and the Public Life</span>, “less modest, and to stake a claim to the public importance of our task” (2). Tellingly,
               Brooks turns to a Romantic poet to sharpen his point: “Shelley was not entirely wrong
               to insist that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind: Cultural change
               carries everything in its wake” (2). Community-based learning projects, whether on
               a micro- or macro-scale, have the potential to transform and reinvigorate all those
               involved: faculty, students, community partners, research, activism, poetry and its
               publics.</p>
            <p>This workshop attempted to create an academic and experiential learning opportunity
               that would foster a greater kind of civically engaged wellbeing. As Shoshana Pollack,
               coordinator of the national W2B program argues, workshops and courses that cultivate
               an exchange between inside and outside learners help to “dispel stereotypes, create
               a sense of connection and community across perceived differences, and cultivate a
               drive for social action, both within the criminal justice system and in the wider
               community” (517). There is a place for the enmeshed academic and experiential study
               of Romanticism, and it can contribute to the enhanced personal development of all
               co-learners, inside and out.</p>

               bodies of students: the “inside” students (the inmates of the Grand Valley Institution
               for Women) and the “outside” students (Huron University students). Modelled, in part,
               on the Walls to Bridges Program (a Canadian program rooted in the pedagogic principles
               of the U.S. Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program), this project involved a one-day visit

               which provide funding for post-secondary education. In 2015, under the Obama Administration,
               the Department of Education launched the Second Chance Pell pilot program, which sees
               the return of financial assistance for incarcerated individuals pursuing higher education.
               In Canada, government cutbacks in the mid-1990s closed the University of Victoria
               (later Simon Fraser University) prison postsecondary education program in British
               Columbia. For a history of the this program in Canada, see Stephen Duguid’s <span style="font-style:italic">Can Prisons Work?, </span>chapter 5.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
