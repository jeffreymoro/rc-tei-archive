            <head>John Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>: The Lecturer as
               Journalist</head>

            <p> Why did the sixty-two-year-old Thelwall embark on the expensive and exhausting
               project of almost single-handedly writing and marketing a monthly periodical under
               the title <title level="m">The Panoramic Miscellany</title>? The venture only
               survived for six months&#8212;January to June 1826&#8212;and if readers during the
               1820s evidently gave it little attention, Romanticists and print-culture scholars
               have paid virtually none at all. Robert Lamb and Corinna Wagner, who include the
               first-ever reprints from the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> in their
               recent <title level="m">Selected Political Writings of John Thelwall</title>, remark
               that “There was a huge difference between this periodical and [Thelwall’s] earlier
               ventures” (4: 199). However, a detailed look at the contents of the <title level="m"
                  >Panoramic Miscellany</title> along with Thelwall’s editorial policy, his
               discursive tone, and his relationship with readers and contributors suggests that
               this last journalistic venture manifests the <emph>continuity</emph> of his
               commitments to political causes, public education, elocutionary training, and
               literary criticism. The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> represents
               Thelwall’s attempt to adapt these long-standing commitments to the new media context
               of the 1820s. Reflecting an awareness of the rapid changes that had taken place in
               print culture since the time he began his journalistic activities in the late
               eighteenth century, this short-lived publication opens a window onto a late-Romantic
               era notable for its experiments with print and visual media. </p>
            <p>Although there is scant documentation of any historical and biographical context
               surrounding the launch of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>,
               Thelwall’s overriding motivation for starting the journal is sufficiently clear from
               his editorial comments in its first two issues, if not from the title pages alone.
               The <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s sub-title&#8212;“Monthly Magazine and Review
               of Literature, Science, Arts, Inventions and Occurrences”&#8212;references another
               periodical publication: the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> to which
               Thelwall had contributed since its founding by Richard Phillips and Joseph Johnson in
               1796. In late 1824, Phillips sold the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and the new
               owners hired Thelwall as editor until November 1825 (Carnall 162-63). At that point
               they fired him and re-oriented the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> with a
               new series that was launched in January 1826. Thelwall’s resentment over his abrupt
               dismissal overflows onto the pages of the independent periodical he started that same
               month: the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Several of the articles in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> feature bitter editorial headnotes or
               footnotes emphasizing that these articles should have appeared in “another
               publication”&#8212;i.e., in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>&#8212;in
               order to fulfill commitments Thelwall had made when he was editor of the <title
                  level="j">Monthly</title>.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="1"> See, for
                  instance, Thelwall’s remarks on the medical article “Distortions of the Spine”
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 50-54) and on his own extended review of “The
                  Poetry of Miss Landen [sic]” (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82). Since the single
                  six-issue volume of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> uses
                  consecutive page numbering throughout, references in the present essay are given

            </p>
            <p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was evidently a long article ascribed to an
               anonymous naval officer, entitled “Hints on the Impressment of Seamen,” that Thelwall
               accepted for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Its publication was
               interrupted after the first two installments when Thelwall lost control of the <title
                  level="j">Monthly</title>; even worse, that magazine’s new owners went on to
               publish an unauthorized continuation of it, an action that Thelwall must have felt
               violated his agreement with the author. Thelwall seeks to set the record straight by
               publishing the “Impressment” treatise in its entirety in the first two issues of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. His outraged headnote and
               postscript, conspicuously signed “J. Thelwall,” suggest that he considered it
               politically urgent to publish the “Impressment” article and that this was the primary
               motivation for his decision to launch his own magazine. Thelwall’s honour demands not
               only the fulfillment of his commitment to the contributor, but also the rebuttal of
               the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title>’s “disgraceful” and “perverted” forgery
               with the “authentic article,” so that the author will not have to go to the expense
               of “republish[ing] the whole, in another form” (<title level="m">PM</title>
                  297).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="2"> Nevertheless, <title level="m">Hints
                     on the Impressment of Seamen, by a Commander of the Royal Navy</title>, did
                  appear in another form: as a two-shilling pamphlet published in 1827. </note> At
               the end of the first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> Thelwall
               actually reprints some of the acrimonious correspondence that resulted from a final
               meeting between his son, his solicitor, and the acting proprietor of the <title
                  level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> in December 1825. Thelwall’s repeated
               references to “duty,” “honour,” “responsibility,” and “fulfillment,” “<emph>my</emph> correspondents,” and “<emph>my</emph> contributors” (<title
                  level="m">PM</title> 146) leave no doubt about his sense of injury and
               helplessness over the decisions taken at the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title> and his self-justification in starting his own rival periodical
               with the same format and several of the same contributors. </p>
            <p>The contents of Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> correspond
               very closely to the regular contents of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>
               as listed on its title page for 1825. These range from the current “Topic of the
               Month” to literature and the arts (“Philosophy of Contemporary Criticism,” “Poetry,”
               “Review of the New Music”), public education (“Proceedings of Learned Societies”),
               and routine departments (“List of Bankruptcies and Dividends,” “Report of the
               Weather,” “Domestic Occurrences,” etc.). Contributors who followed Thelwall to his new
               journalistic venture include Mary Russell Mitford, medical doctors James Field and H.
               Robertson, meteorologist James Tatem, and the authors of the five-part “Egyptian
               Zodiac” series and of “History of the Captivity of a Russian Officer among the
               Turks,” another piece that Thelwall had previously accepted for the <title level="j"
                  >Monthly Magazine</title> (<title level="j">MM</title> 60 [1825]: 384). Thelwall’s
               continuing goodwill toward his “old friend” Sir Richard Phillips, the founder of the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title>, is evident in the special notice the <title
                  level="m">Panoramic</title> takes of Phillips’s new publication <title level="m"
                  >Golden Rules of Social Philosophy</title>, to which Thelwall devotes a generously
               balanced review in the February issue while confessing perplexity with some of
               Phillips’s odder ideas, such as his vegetarianism and his infamous refusal to believe
               in the force of gravity (<title level="m">PM</title> 235).</p>
            <p>In accordance with the journalistic practice of the time, nearly all the articles and
               items in the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> are unsigned or signed
               with obvious pseudonyms. This makes Thelwall’s deviations from the usual practice all
               the more revealing. Clear exceptions are the numerous headnotes and footnotes signed
               “Editor” or (occasionally) “J. Thelwall,” and the lectures on elocution included in
               most issues, each of which is identified in the title as “Mr. Thelwall’s Lecture.”
               Some of the “Original Poetry” is signed by Thelwall himself, and some of the regular
               pseudonyms used in the poetry department (“Ausonia,” for instance) seem to belong to
               him as well. He may also have followed the practice he used when editing <title
                  level="j">The Champion</title> a few years earlier, of including original and
               translated poetry that began as “school exercises of the pupils of his Institution
               for the Cure of Impediments” (Thelwall, <title level="m">Poetical Recreations</title>
               243). Other pieces likely written by Thelwall himself are a multi-part series on “The
               London University,” reports on public societies and educational institutions,
               articles on political economy, the three-part “Tour thro North Wales,” some of the
               regular features including the agricultural reports,
               and&#8212;significantly&#8212;the literary-critical articles. Foremost among his
               acknowledged contributions, however, are the leading articles that begin each issue,
               which are signed either with Thelwall’s name or with a coded symbol consisting of a
               triangle followed by three dots in the shape of a second triangle (Δ <graphic url="../images/triangle_character.bmp"/>). As
               elucidated in Thelwall’s lecture on “Elements of Prosody” in the May issue, these two
               signs represent the “<emph>Thesis</emph> and <emph>Arsis</emph> of human speech”
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 636): a long/stressed syllable followed by a
               short/unstressed one. Rhythmically (as a trochaic foot) as well as phonetically
                  (<emph>TH</emph>esis + <emph>A</emph>rsis), they stand for “Thelwall.” After
               beginning to use this cipher as his signature for the leading article, Thelwall also
               signs some shorter items with it as well. Interestingly, too, most of the repeated
               pseudonyms under which other <title level="m">Panoramic</title> articles appear fit
               the same trochaic pattern: “Civis,” “Cosmo,” “Thermes.”</p>
            <p> Apart from such clues, the only indicators as to what Thelwall did and didn’t write
               himself are his frequent editorial comments on individual articles and the “Notices
               to Correspondents” pages at the end of each issue, where he refers directly and (it
               appears) sincerely to articles contributed by other writers, although without naming
               any of these contributors. The rhetoric of editorial headnotes and footnotes
               sometimes implies that Thelwall is <emph>not</emph> the author of a given
               article&#8212;for instance, when a headnote obviously singles an article out for
               praise (presumably Thelwall would not introduce his own work to readers as
               “invaluable”), or, conversely, when he explicitly distances himself from the claims
               made in an article by adding a critical footnote. The running dialogue that he
               carries on with contributors on the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               is, in fact, a characteristic and revealing aspect of Thelwall’s editorial practice,
               evident also in the issues of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> that came
               out under his direction. Thelwall regards his editorial role as a sustained
               conversation with other writers and readers. The dialogic tone of his editorial
               interventions suggests that he places the periodical miscellany on the same continuum
               with oral media of communication such as public lectures, elocutionary training, and
               the educational institutions and debating clubs whose activities receive so much
               coverage in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>.</p>
            <p>A few collaborators and contributors are identifiable, including John Timbs
               (1801-1875)&#8212;antiquary, journalist, editor, and Richard Phillips’s secretary
               during his last years with the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (Gibbs 386).
               But it is hard to tell with which sections Timbs assisted Thelwall, since they had
               equally wide-ranging and miscellaneous interests (not to mention the same initials).
               Mary Russell Mitford contributed one short story to each of the first three issues of
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> under the signature “M.” James G. Tatem and
               the physician and medical lecturer James Field, respectively, continued to contribute
               meteorological and medical reports each month, as they had done for the <title
                  level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Nevertheless, not only does Thelwall seem to
               have produced an immense amount of copy for each 143-page issue of the <title
                  level="m">Panoramic</title> single-handedly, but his contributions seem to have
               increased as the magazine neared the end of its six-month run. Until April, he
               increasingly (and perhaps with increasing defensiveness?) refers to the overwhelming
               amount of material he has received from contributors, yet in the last (June) issue,
               which is also eight pages shorter than the others, there is little that can be
               reliably ascribed to writers other than Thelwall. Short of both contributors and
               readers, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> also suffered from the lack of a
               reliable technological infrastructure. Thelwall frequently apologizes to readers for
               errors in production: the hasty and disorganized printing of the first issue, a lost
               manuscript of music criticism, his inability to attend theatrical productions in
               person and the lack of a trusty reviewer to send in his place, multiple mix-ups at
               the printer’s. The inclusion of such references serves to give the editorial voice a
               certain conversational immediacy and even intimacy.</p>
            <p> In the competitive periodical market of the 1820s, Thelwall’s policy on
               paying&#8212;or rather <emph>not</emph> paying&#8212;for contributions differentiates
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> from some of its major rivals. According to
               Mark Parker, during the 1820s payments to contributors per sixteen-page sheet were
               made “in a fairly tight range across the industry”; he cites per-sheet rates of
               twelve to sixteen guineas (12-13). The <title level="m">Panoramic</title> confirms
               this pay scale with a rather arch mention in a regional report from Edinburgh that
               “Mr. C[onstable] is said to have paid Mr. Jeffery [sic] 700 £ for editing every
               number of the Edinburgh Review, and Sir J. Mackintosh and Mr. Brougham have sometimes
               received 100 £. each, for articles; and the lowest recompense for any contribution
               received and published, was 16 guineas per sheet” (<title level="m">PM</title> 441).
               By contrast, Thelwall reacts with high-minded disdain to potential contributors who
               inquire how much his journal pays for contributions. “Poetry, in particular,” he
               huffs, “when it is such as <emph>we require</emph>, will generally be regarded by its
               authors as above <emph>pecuniary</emph> compensation; and as for Critics&#8212;so far
               from hiring <emph>anonymous</emph> criticism by the sheet, we will take care that the
               reputation of no literary work whatever shall, in our pages, be at the mercy of any
               censor whose honor we cannot depend upon” (<title level="m">PM</title> 298). Only
               “authors of already established reputation” or those whose samples have passed a
               careful vetting might qualify for remuneration from him. Thelwall’s policy runs
               counter to standard industry practices, from the accepted pay scale to the
               near-universal habit of anonymous reviewing. While he may be making a virtue of
               necessity, by maintaining that poetry and criticism alike transcend commercial
               transactions Thelwall also sustains the image of his journal as free conversational
               exchange and promotes his vision of literary reviewing as a kind of honourable
               patronage that singles out worthy authors for non-pecuniary rewards and
               recognition.</p>
            <p>Like many other editors during the periodical-rich 1820s, Thelwall writes on the
               topic of periodical writing itself. His leading article in the inaugural issue of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> bears a title that is a virtual
               thesis statement: “On the Connexion of Periodical Literature with the Moral and
               Intellectual Progress of Society” (<title level="m">PM</title> 1). This lengthy
               editorial echoes the main goals articulated in the editorial preface of the first
               issue of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> published by Richard Phillips
               and edited by John Aikin in February 1796. Their magazine was to “open new sources of
               entertainment and instruction for their readers,” to propagate liberal principles, to
               provide a forum for the “lighter exertions of learned and ingenious writers” and to
               publish genuinely good poetry&#8212;none of which was then being offered by other
               “Periodical Miscellanies” (<title level="j">MM</title> 1 [1796]: iii-iv). Thelwall’s
               editorial statement of January 1826 re-affirms these goals by analyzing how
               periodicals like the <title level="j">Monthly</title> have revolutionized print
               culture over the intervening thirty years. His defence of periodical literature links
               the proliferation of magazines during the 1820s to the “rapid march of mind” and the
               notable increase in refinement, morality, intelligence, and taste, especially among
               the middle classes. By contrast, only one generation earlier, middle-class tradesmen
               had eschewed literature and book-learning while they deemed card-playing and drinking
               more useful and acceptable recreations, and the only “wretched flimsy and ill written
               sixpenny magazines” that were then available were read by young women (<title
                  level="m">PM</title> 1). When periodicals like (Thelwall implies) the <title
                  level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> entered this unenlightened marketplace and
               addressed a large-scale, middle-class, predominantly male readership, they joined
               with the newly formed public societies for learning, mechanics’ institutes, and
               middle-class universities in a grand mission of public improvement that is, in 1826,
               still awaiting appropriate recognition: “Of the powerful influence of periodical
               literature in forwarding the progress of general intellect, and the necessity of its
               agency to the end proposed, there are few, perhaps, who, even yet, have formed a
               proper estimate” (<title level="m">PM</title> 4). Thelwall refutes the idea that the
               brief information offered in miscellanies is superficial and displaces more profound
               scientific publications. Instead, he claims, accessible popular knowledge and serious
               research reciprocally support one another: <quote>It is the business of the
                  periodical essayist to remove this veil of mystery from science, to translate its
                  revelations into familiar language, and dispense to those who have more of thirst,
                  than leisure, or opportunity for acquisition, so much as they have time to
                  receive, or are prepared to comprehend. Is this a task for superficial minds?
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 5)</quote> It is already evident from these
               opening pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> why the aging
               Thelwall felt he had to find a way to continue the original mission of the <title
                  level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. The <title level="j">Monthly</title>’s aim to
               spread instructive and amusing information along with liberal principles has only
               gained in importance in the climate of heightened media awareness and “march of mind”
               that characterizes the 1820s, a climate that periodical literature itself has helped
               to form. Magazines, according to this mission statement, are as important an organ
               for contributing to the improvement of society as the public lecturing and
               elocutionary training with which the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> goes hand in
               hand.</p>
            <p>Against the background of Thelwall’s attempt to sustain the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>’s original principles, however, the changes he does make stand
               out in greater relief. First of all, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> expands
               and highlights its national and international scope. Whereas the 1825 <title
                  level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> represents itself simply as published in London
               by “Geo. B. Whittaker,” the title page of the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> lists a much wider geographical range of establishments where
               it can be obtained, not only in London but in Glasgow, Paris, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and
               “all booksellers in town and country.”<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="3"> Judith
                  Thompson (in private e-mail correspondence) has identified Thelwall’s primary contacts in these locations as friends
                  who hosted him in Glasgow in 1804; Maury Duval, the proprietor of the <emph>Dépôt
                     Bibliographique</emph>, whom he visited more than once in Paris; and his wife
                  Cecil’s sister in Boulogne-sur-Mer. My thanks also to Judith Thompson for
                  information about Cecil Thelwall’s likely knowledge of Italian. </note> According
               to its title page, too, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> maintains a special
               commitment to “the Science and Literature of Italy.” Why? In the absence of further
               evidence that Thelwall became an Italophile later in his life or that he had a
               collaborator with special Italian interests, it looks very much like an attempt to
               make the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> popular with readers (even if Thelwall’s
               opening editorial eschews “the cheap expedient of ministering to the caprice of
               fashion” [<title level="m">PM</title> 3]). London in the mid-1820s saw a remarkable
               spike of interest in things Italian, documented for instance in rival publications
               such as Colburn’s <title level="j">New Monthly Magazine</title> and <title level="j"
                  >Knight’s Quarterly</title>. No doubt this interest was fuelled by the presence of
               a significant intellectual and artistic community of Italian expatriates exiled from
               Italy after 1820 due to the events of the early Risorgimento. The advertisement for
               Italian literature on the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page is amply
               borne out by the “Letters on Italian Literature” included in each of the six issues,
               which are advertised as “Translated from original communications.” It is likely that
               Thelwall&#8212;or his wife Cecil&#8212;is at least the translator of these essays
               even if they originate from an Italian correspondent, perhaps a contact in the
               expatriate community. Moreover, the “Original Poetry” section often contains
               translations of Italian verse and other contributions with the by-line “Ausonia”
               (i.e., “Italy”). One of “Ausonia”’s contributions to the March issue, a “Sonnet to
               L.E.L.” that follows up Thelwall’s review of Letitia Landon’s poetry that appeared in
               the January issue, makes it very likely that Ausonia is either John or Cecil
               Thelwall.</p>
            <p> The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> also features expanded links to
               European culture through partnerships with French periodicals. Among the places where
               the magazine can be obtained, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page
               lists one foreign outlet: “the Bureau of the Revue Encyclopédique, Paris.” A
               consistent dialogue with the <title level="j">Revue Encyclopédique</title> is evident
               throughout the <title level="j">Panoramic</title>’s run. Most issues contain at least
               one article that is translated from the French journal. At the end of the April
               issue, Thelwall gratefully acknowledges a favourable notice of his <title level="m"
                  >Panoramic Miscellany</title> in the <title level="j">Revue
               Encyclopédique</title>, and reciprocates by calling the <title level="j"
                  >Revue</title> “the first literary journal of Europe” (<title level="m">PM</title>
               586). In the January issue, Thelwall mentions an intended agreement with another new
               French journal, the <title level="j">Athénée Britannique</title> (published in Paris
               and London), for “reciprocation of intelligence and communications” (<title level="m"
                  >PM</title> 130), although there is no further evidence of how active this
               exchange turned out to be. The first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               also received a favourable review in the London-based French-language periodical
                  <title level="j">Le Mercure de Londres</title>, as did Thelwall himself for being
               “l’un des hommes le plus recommandable que posséde [sic] l’Angleterre” (<title
                  level="j">Mercure</title> 1, no. 5 [25 March 1826]: 73).</p>
            <p> Favouring these Italian and French connections, the <title level="m"
                  >Panoramic</title> maintains other international interests, regularly reviewing
               literature from across Europe and featuring articles on Spanish history and culture,
               Danish superstitions, the climate of France, new developments in engineering and
               statistical surveys throughout the world, and regular attention to India and Burma
               (the latter no doubt because of the ongoing Anglo-Burmese War). Revealingly, though,
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> does not assume any knowledge of foreign
               languages on the part of its readers, but conscientiously provides English
               translations of every non-English text or phrase, however brief, that appears in its
               pages. This practice seems to reflect a dedication to accessibility and a target
               audience among male middle- and working-class readers who are not expected to have an
               education in either modern or classical languages.</p>
            <p>These international exchanges are one aspect of a dialogic orientation in Thelwall’s
               journalism that is worth exploring further in the context of the 1820s media
               environment. In his study <title level="m">Literary Magazines and British
                  Romanticism</title>, Mark Parker convincingly identifies fundamentally different
               orientations in some of the decade’s leading periodicals. He demonstrates, for
               instance, that the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> manifests a “bias . . .
               toward representation” while <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>
               is biased “toward performance” (135). By comparison, the fundamental rhetorical bias
               of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> seems best described as the
               pedagogical mode of <emph>lecture-discussion</emph>. When applied to Thelwall’s
               journalism, this means that he as editor persistently gestures toward conversational
               exchange with contributors, correspondents, and readers. Yet he maintains a
               controlling role in the conversation: his voice is that of the lecturer who initiates
               topics and frames the contributions of others by claiming the last word. Thelwall’s
               editorial stance thus differs from that of Phillips’s <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>, which, as Jon Klancher writes, used the “‘original
               correspondence’ format” to “collect[ ] readers and writers as
                  <emph>interchangeable</emph> participants” (39, italics added). It differs also
               from contemporaneous experiments with group or coterie publication, such as <title
                  level="j">Blackwood’s</title> or its London-based imitator, the short-lived <title
                  level="j">Knight’s Quarterly</title>. The <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> offers an alternative model of unequal dialogue&#8212;not among
               a coterie of editors, writers, and readers, but between a pedagogically-inclined
               editor and his reader-learners.</p>
            <p>More than other magazines of the 1820s, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> privileges the public lecture as a form of communication.
               Thelwall’s own lectures on elocution form the centerpiece of most of the issues.
               Several of the other articles in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> are printed
               versions of lectures delivered in London or elsewhere, and the “Proceedings of
               learned societies” section contains brief eyewitness reports of further lectures.
               Some of Thelwall’s articles, particularly his continuing series on “The London
               University,” include remarks on the practice of lecturing itself (e.g., <title
                  level="m">PM</title> 504-07). Thelwall is also in the habit of constructing his
               articles as responses to other people’s lectures or speeches. In the May and June
               issues, for instance, he prints long excerpts from “Mr. Jacob’s Report to the House
               of Commons, on the Trade in Foreign Corn” and develops his own counter-position in a
               passage-by-passage running commentary. Similarly, February’s leading article is a
               running commentary on a lecture recently delivered by Mr. Banks at the City and
               Western Institutions, and in March Thelwall follows the same practice with a lecture
               on geological phenomena that was delivered by Professor Brande at the Royal
               Institution. The editorials become dialogues between Thelwall and the lecturers, who
               are thereby put in the position of involuntary “contributors.” Thelwall’s frequent
               interventions as editor of articles by voluntary contributors to the <title level="m"
                  >Panoramic</title> work the same way. He carries on a dialogue with other writers
               in footnotes or endnotes to their articles, in editorial comments that are often
               rather patronizing. The conversational tone of Thelwall’s periodical writing is also
               evident in the responsive relationship between letters from contributors and the
               editor’s replies, and in the editor’s direct address to contributors on the “Notices
               to Correspondents” page at the end of each issue.</p>
            <p>In the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, Thelwall resorts to a variety
               of tactics for trying to provoke debate. He includes brief queries on etymological
               questions&#8212;asking about the origin of the terms “Grub Street” or “John Bull,”
               for instance&#8212;that solicit involvement from readers. These queries of a few
               lines in length also mark an increasing tendency after the first issue&#8212;once
               Thelwall presumably got some of his initial technical problems under control&#8212;to
               fill in blank space after a regular article with a tiny interrogative, humorous, or
               thought-provoking item, then begin the next feature article at the top of a new page.
               In the March issue, such interpolated questions become more philosophical: “What is
               eloquence?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 315), “What are metaphysics?” (<title
                  level="m">PM</title> 374), “What is time?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 306). The
               last of these queries also marks the beginning of a new mini-series consisting of
               brief items with the by-line “From the Manuscript Sketches of a Correspondent.” It is
               tempting to identify the “Correspondent” responsible for these intriguing sketches as
               Thelwall himself, for they reflect his lifelong interests in language, acting and the
               theatre, pedantry, and imagination&#8212;although, when one such item promotes “a
               little opium” as an aid to imagination, Thelwall appends a disapproving editorial
               response in defence of sober genius (<title level="m">PM</title> 761).</p>
            <p>Another variant on the lecture-discussion mode appears in Thelwall’s literary
               criticism and reviewing, and here the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>
               sets itself apart from rival magazines. The individual book reviews in the <title
                  level="m">Panoramic</title>’s long “Review of Literature” department are
               completely unsystematic and vary widely in length. They clearly reflect Thelwall’s
               own interests; for instance, reviews of fiction and poetry are likely to highlight
               linguistic and metrical aspects, and substantial column inches are devoted to books
               on language itself, such as dictionaries, grammars, and philological works. In
               contrast to the reviewing style that was nearly ubiquitous in periodicals from the
                  <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> to the <title level="j">European
                  Magazine</title>, where reviews included lengthy quotations from the primary work,
               Thelwall quotes minimally and instead offers his own evaluation. This can range from
               long, section-by-section commentary on books that particularly engage his interest to
               a brief overview paragraph of ones he considers worthy of notice but lacks time or
               linguistic abilities to review in detail (for instance, books in German). Also
               interesting is the gender perspective of Thelwall’s reviewing and literary criticism.
               Among the books he singles out for unusually lengthy treatment are publications by
               prominent women writers: Letitia Landon’s <title level="m">The Troubadour</title>
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82), Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">The Last
                  Man</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 380-86), and Joanna Baillie’s <title
                  level="m">The Martyr</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 665-68). Elsewhere in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, too, Thelwall explicitly promotes his own
               reputation as a fair and well-inclined reviewer of women’s literature. In addition to
               his characteristic mode of biased dialogue with male contributors, lecturers, or
               treatise-writers, there is a more deliberately pedagogical mode of lecturing
                  <emph>to</emph> younger female writers, who are nevertheless treated with notable
               seriousness and respect.</p>
            <p> But the most striking reflection on gender relations in the <title level="m"
                  >Panoramic Miscellany</title> is the short poem “To Maga” that appeared in the
               first issue, signed “J.T.” and evidently addressed to the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>. In an extended metaphor, Thelwall figures this magazine as a
               beloved woman that he longed to make his own even though she remained for thirty
               years “in other arms,” then was “resigned . . . to shame” and almost ruined (i.e.,
               when Phillips sold “Maga” in 1824), yet unexpectedly given over by “chance” to
               Thelwall’s loving care (when he assumed editorial responsibilities for the <title
                  level="j">Monthly</title>). Ignoring Thelwall’s tireless efforts to restore
               “Maga,” however, her new owners tear her from his arms, and he laments that she will
               now end up completely degraded: <quote><lg>
                     <l>They’ll deck thee out in trim array,</l>
                     <l rendition="#indent3">More gaudy to the eye;</l>
                     <l>But steal the inward worth away</l>
                     <l rendition="#indent3">That did thy charms supply. (<title level="m">PM</title>
                        84)</l>
                  </lg></quote> Thelwall says farewell to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> as he
               turns to “another love . . . To whom I’ll father-lover prove”&#8212;i.e., the <title
                  level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Here, in lyric form, Thelwall’s emotional
               commitment to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and its original values meets his
               judgment on early nineteenth-century print culture: running after “trim” and “gaudy”
               publications, the periodical press of the 1820s risks abandoning the ethics of public
               education and diffusion of knowledge that motivated Thelwall’s own journalism since
               the 1790s.</p>
            <p>The dedication “To Maga” remains odd, though, and not just because of the inherent
               strangeness of figuring a magazine as the object of erotic desire. Denominating the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title> with the feminine-sounding name “Maga” allows the
               conceit to work (more or less). Yet “Maga” must have been familiar to Thelwall and
               everyone else as the nickname, not of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>, but of
               another publication entirely: <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh
               Magazine</title>. Throughout the 1820s, <emph>Blackwood’s</emph> best-known
               contributor “Christopher North” used the feminine associations of “Maga” to figure
               his magazine sometimes as a coquette, sometimes as a virtuous woman.<note
                  resp="editors" place="foot" n="4"> An instance that precedes Thelwall’s “To Maga”

               </note> Why does Thelwall make use of an image and a name that would inevitably
               remind readers of a “trim,” “gaudy,” fashionable publication seemingly contrary to
               his own principles? Paradoxes like these in the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> suggest the challenges Thelwall faced in launching a
               publication that would fulfill his long-standing aims yet be viable in the 1820s
               marketplace.</p>
            <p>For his new love, Thelwall chose a title that married the well-established
               eighteenth-century designation “Miscellany” with the new nineteenth-century adjective
               “Panoramic.” First recorded by the OED in 1813, “panoramic” did not gain its abstract
               meaning of “universal” until after Thelwall’s lifetime. In the minds of his readers
               in the 1820s, it might have conjured up recollections of another recently defunct
               publication, the <title level="j">Literary Panorama</title> (1806-1819), but also
               direct associations with panoramas and other very current visual media. Like
               virtually all literary-cultural magazines of its day, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> includes reports about the new visual entertainments in London,
               particularly the Diorama (<title level="m">PM</title> 252, 396-97), the Cosmorama,
               and the Poecilorama&#8212;a “variously coloured,” supposedly time-travelling exhibit
               at the Egyptian Hall (<title level="m">PM</title> 397, 445). The link between these
               “-ramas” and the title of Thelwall’s magazine is made explicit in the April issue
               when a correspondent writes in as “John Bull” expressing appreciation for the
               Poecilorama, but ridiculing its pretentious Greek name. “John Bull” notes that
               Thelwall himself appears to share the “Greek mania” that led him to use the “scrap of
               every day Greek ‘Panoramic’” on his title page rather than calling his journal, in
               plain English, “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” (<title level="m">PM</title> 486). In a
               good-natured response, Thelwall concedes the point. But he consoles his
                  “<emph>bluff</emph> correspondent”&#8212;and puts in a brief marketing
               plug&#8212;by noting that anyone who prefers asking at his local bookseller’s for
               “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” will surely be put in possession of the publication he
               desires. Still, the reference in Thelwall’s title to the very current visual medium
               of the 1820s, the panorama, seems indicative of his engagement with another live
               experiential medium of the 1820s, the public lecture, which continues to stand at the
               centre of his commitment to rational communication, education, and public
               engagement.</p>
