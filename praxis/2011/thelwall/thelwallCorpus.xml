               <p> Almost two centuries after his death, the Romantic-period political reformer John
               Thelwall is undergoing a remarkable critical renaissance. In the past five years
               alone he has been the subject of three conferences, a four-volume selected writings,
               an inaugural collection of essays, diverse articles and chapters, a dramatic
               premiere, a special issue of the journal <title level="j">Romanticism</title>, and a
               campaign to restore his grave.<note resp="editors" place="foot">In addition to the works and editions listed below, see the recent chapters on
                  Thelwall in Davies, Allard, and Fairer.</note> In the recent opinion of one
               scholar, Michael Scrivener, “a strong argument can be made that one does not
               understand Romanticism in sufficient depth if one has not engaged seriously the
               oeuvre of Thelwall” (<ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reviews-blog/?p=411">Rev. of
                     <title level="m">Peripatetic</title>
                  </ref>). The discovery in 2004 of a
               three-volume faircopy of Thelwall’s poetry that includes several previously unknown
               compositions, notably a satire on the leading poets of the day, makes only the most
               recent addition to that strikingly diverse oeuvre.<note resp="editors" place="foot">On Judith Thompson’s discovery of the volumes, see her “Citizen
                  Juan Thelwall.” This was a “discovery” for Thelwall scholars, since not even E. P.
                  Thompson appears to have been aware of the volumes’ survival. Their existence was
                  of course known to the staff of the Derby Local Studies Library, which probably
                  acquired them from the late nineteenth-century Derby printer Mr. Bemrose. The
                  volumes are listed in the <title level="m">Location Register of English Literary
                     Manuscripts and Letters: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries</title>, edited by
                  David C. Sutton, and in the online index of the National Register of Archives. For
                  the most part only the recto pages of the volumes are inscribed, although the
                  verso pages carry some emendations and, in volume 3, portions of the satirical
                  poem <title level="m">Musalogia</title>.</note> A quintessential Romantic
               polymath, Thelwall also composed political lectures and pamphlets; a controversial
               essay on the principle of life; five collections of poetry;<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                     <title level="m">Poems on Various Subjects</title> (1787), <title level="m">Poems
                     Written in Close Confinement</title> (1795), <title level="m">Poems Chiefly
                     Written in Retirement</title> (1801), <title level="m">The Vestibule of
                     Eloquence</title> (1810), and <title level="m">The Poetical Recreations of The
                     Champion</title> (1822).</note> three anti-imperialist plays; an abolitionist,
               feminist novel; a novelistic miscellany in verse and prose; periodical essays and
               reviews; and copious writings on elocution and speech therapy. </p>
               <p> That these works have gone largely unremarked for so long is owing partly to their
               rarity, and partly to their author’s “radical” stigma. Along with Thomas Hardy and
               John Horne Tooke, Thelwall was a key defendant at the Treason Trials of 1794, when
               the Pitt government attempted to suppress the radical reform movement by depriving it
               of its leaders—and its leaders of their heads. (The penalty for “compassing”
               and “imagining” the king’s death was hanging.)<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Barrell.</note> Although the prosecution’s claims that the
               defendants had been conspiring to depose the king and establish a French-style
               republic would not stick, the “acquitted felon” label stayed with them for life<note resp="editors" place="foot">This is how the Secretary of State
                  for War, William Windham, referred to the defendants on their release. See <title level="m">Parliamentary History </title>col. 1029.</note> (for a time, however,
               friends like Coleridge preferred to think of Thelwall as a “virtuous High-Treasonist”

                  Pioneer of Democracy and Social Reform in England during the French
                  Revolution</title>, based partly on six manuscript volumes purchased at auction in
               1904 and now lost,<note resp="editors" place="foot">On the likely
                  contents of the volumes and their fate, see Roe, “Lives.”</note> Thelwall was
               largely relegated to the footnotes of history until the mid-twentieth century,
               when he emerged as a hero of the British left in E. P. Thompson’s <title level="m">The Making of the English Working Class</title> (1963). Since then, he has become
               a recurrent figure in studies of late eighteenth-century political culture. Singling
               him out as the foremost republican writer in Britain after Paine’s flight to France
               in 1792, Gregory Claeys argues in <title level="m">The Politics of English
                  Jacobinism: Writings of John Thelwall</title> (1995) that Thelwall’s adaptation of
               the Lockean natural rights tradition in response to widespread poverty resulted in a
               “new vision of economic justice” that laid a foundation for the development of
               socialist and liberal thought in the nineteenth century (liii).<note resp="editors" place="foot">On Thelwall’s “new vision of egalitarian
                  commercial republicanism,” see also Claeys, “Origins” 266. For a comparable reading of Thelwall’s part in the transition from the “nostalgic” radicalism of the
                  eighteenth century to the “progressive and forward-looking” radicalism of the
                  nineteenth, see Hampsher-Monk (20). Robert Lamb has recently consolidated the case
                  for the coherence of Thelwall’s political thought by examining his theoretical
                  defence of private property rights, particularly his seemingly contradictory debts
                  to natural rights, utilitarianism, and the Scottish Enlightenment’s “four-stages”
                  account of economic development, while Richard Sheldon has questioned the extent
                  to which Thelwall’s pro-commercial republicanism was “proto-socialist.”</note>
               Meanwhile, Thelwall’s equally innovative and prolific literary and elocutionary works
               have attracted increasing attention since the publication in 2001 of both Michael
               Scrivener’s <title level="m">Seditious Allegories: John Thelwall and Jacobin
                  Writings</title> and Judith Thompson’s edition of Thelwall’s verse-and-prose work
                  <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> of 1793. In the intervening decade,
               scholars have begun to challenge earlier dismissals of Thelwall as a “mediocre poet”
               (Thompson, <title level="m">Making</title> 172) and a prosodist-elocutionist who
               would have been “none the worse of a hanging” (Saintsbury 157). The most recent
               additions to a growing body of Thelwall scholarship include <title level="m">Incle
                  and Yarico and The Incas: Two Plays by John Thelwall</title> (2006), edited by
               Scrivener and Frank Felsenstein; the four-volume <title level="m">Selected Political
                  Writings of John Thelwall</title> (2009), edited by Corinna Wagner and Robert
               Lamb; and the collection <title level="m">John Thelwall: Radical Romantic and
                  Acquitted Felon</title> (2009), edited by Steve Poole. The latter grew out of two
               Thelwall conferences held in 2007 to mark the end of a successful campaign to restore
               his weathered gravestone in Bath, where he died of “some affection of the heart”
               while on an elocutionary lecture-tour in February 1834, age sixty-nine (“Mr.
               Thelwall”).</p>
               <p> Like the gravestone, Thelwall’s oeuvre stands in need of further attention. Indeed,
               we are only just beginning to appreciate the diversity, originality, and coherence of
               a career that spanned four decades and brought Thelwall into contact with the leading
               Romantic writers, artists, thinkers, and activists. E. P. Thompson accurately
               remarked that Thelwall “straddled the world of Wordsworth and of Coleridge, and the
               world of the Spitalfields weavers” (<title level="m">Making</title> 172). A leading
               representative of “romantic sociability,”<note resp="editors" place="foot">See, for instance, Russell and Tuite’s collection by that
                  title.</note> Thelwall also belonged to overlapping Romantic circles centred
               variously around Godwin and Holcroft; the radical publishers Daniel Isaac Eaton and
               Richard Phillips; the democrat-physicians Henry Cline, Astley Cooper, and Peter
               Crompton; the Norwich intellectuals William Taylor, Anne and Annabella Plumptre, and
               John and Amelia Opie; the Derby Philosophical Society members Erasmus Darwin and
               William and Joseph Strutt; the Westminster reformers Francis Place, Francis Burdett,
               John Hobhouse, and John Cartwright; and other figures including “the disputation
               metaphysical Hazlet [<emph>sic</emph>],” “poor Gilly” [Gilbert] Wakefield, Robert
               Southey, Charles Lamb, Thomas Noon Talfourd, and Henry Crabb Robinson.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For the references to Hazlitt and
                  Wakefield, see the letters by Thelwall reprinted in Davies, <title level="m">Presences </title>318, 301.</note> Yet Thelwall’s practice is not in the end
               strictly comparable to any of theirs. He drew self-consciously on all the major
               traditions and discourses of the day to create a body of work as “radical” and
               heterogeneous as the conjunction of political, medical, and cultural discourses that
               informed it. If, as Thelwall maintained, “style is the shadow of mind” (<title level="m">Peripatetic</title> 71), it is notable that his was consistently humane
               and democratizing, even when repression forced him to take a vow of “inviolable
               silence” on political issues (<title level="m">Retirement</title> xxxvi). </p>
               <p>The range of Thelwall’s interests and the scope for new archival discoveries are
               manifest in a “find” I made in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert
               Museum, just as I was completing the editing of this collection: a copy of George
               Wilkins’s play <title level="m">The Miseries of Inforst Marriage</title> (1629),
               owned and annotated by Thelwall.<note resp="editors" place="foot">The volume is listed in the library catalogue but, to my knowledge, has not
                  yet come to critical attention. See Dyce 26 Box 50/12, National Art Library,
                  Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</note> The play may have been part of the
               large library that Thelwall amassed on the success of his career as an elocutionist
               in the early nineteenth century, the contents of which were sold at auction in 1820,
               as detailed in Patty O’Boyle’s essay in this collection. In addition to underlining
               and marginal scoring, Thelwall’s copy of the play bears two evaluative notes. The
               first, written on the flyleaf and signed “J. T.” (with “John Thelwall” added by a
               different hand), praises the “witty foolery” of the first scene, “which reminds us so
               strongly of the characteristic humour of Shakespeare’s Clowns,” and regrets that
               later scenes fall short of this standard; the second note, written on the back of the
               last page, remarks that it was “miserable want of judgment in the author” not to give
               the play a “tragical catastrophe.” The volume thus adds to the growing body of
               Thelwall annotations and inscriptions—including those on Bowles’s <title level="m">Sonnets</title>, Coleridge’s <title level="m">Biographia
                  Literaria</title>, and Wordworth’s <title level="m">Excursion</title>—that
               candidly supplement what we already know of his professional and personal opinions.
               The volume also suggests how Thelwall was remembered in the later nineteenth century.
               A note by Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), the literary scholar who bequeathed the play
               and thousands more works to the South Kensington Museum, identifies its previous
               owner as “John Thelwall,—a person of some talents in literature, &amp; of great
               notoriety in consequence of his having been tried for high treason.” </p>
               <p> Capitalizing on this conjunction of new material and renewed critical momentum, the
               present volume aims to help restore Thelwall to his rightful place in history and
               Romantic studies by publishing a varied selection of papers from a two-day conference
               that Judith Thompson and I co-organized at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada,
               in October 2009. “The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice” sought to highlight
               the conjunction of arts and acts in Thelwall’s theory and practice, while bringing
               together the British and North American Thelwall communities in a geographically and
               historically significant location. An Atlantic midway point between the UK and the
               US, Halifax was the site of a Canadian, and more specifically Nova Scotian,
               conjunction of literature, oratory, and reform, manifest in the achievements of the
               nineteenth-century journalist and politician Joseph Howe, the inventor and speech
               scientist Alexander Graham Bell, and the adult educator and co-operative movement
               pioneer Moses Coady.</p>
               <p> Both the conference and this volume take inspiration from Thelwall’s ideal of
               unrestricted intellectual exchange in an expanded public sphere. Insisting on the
               futility of government attempts to silence the radical movement through arrests,
               surveillance, harassment, and “gagging” laws, Thelwall remarked that <quote>a sort of
                  Socratic spirit will necessarily grow up, wherever large bodies of men assemble.
                  Each brings, as it were, into the common bank his mite of information, and putting
                  it to a sort of circulating usance, each contributor has the advantage of a large
                  interest, without any diminution of capital. (“Rights” 401)</quote> Adapting
               Thelwall’s metaphor to the present day, we see <title level="m">Romantic
                  Circles</title> as the “common bank” to which scholars can each contribute their
               mite to enact “a sort of Socratic spirit” through the electronic circulation of
               ideas. This collaborative effort will, we hope, generate a “large interest” both by
               attracting a wider audience for Thelwall’s works and by taking advantage of the
               unique capacity of <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> to re-connect the
               printed word with image, voice, and gesture in the dynamic way for which Thelwall
               himself was renowned. </p>
               <p> In addition to this “Praxis” volume, the larger project <title level="m">John
                  Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments</title> will include two components in the
               “Scholarly Resources” section. “John Thelwall in Time and Text” combines a chronology
               of Thelwall’s life and times with the fullest bibliography to date of his published
               works, letters, and manuscripts. The result of a collaborative pooling of “mites” of
               information at the Thelwall conference in Halifax, this “common bank” offers a
               much-needed resource for the study of Thelwall, especially in the continuing absence
               of a modern or complete biography.<note resp="editors" place="foot">In 1837 Thelwall’s second wife published the first volume of a posthumous
                     <title level="m">Life of John Thelwall</title>, focusing on his rise to
                  political notoriety and cutting off in 1795 with the passage of the Two Acts. The
                  projected second volume, “containing an account of his domestic history and of his
                  labours in the field of literature, and of the Science of Elocution,” was never
                  published (xii). The autobiographical “Prefatory Memoir” that accompanied
                  Thelwall’s <title level="m">Poems, Chiefly Written in Retirement</title> of 1801
                  fills in the story of his path to retirement in Wales at the end of the decade but
                  deliberately avoids open discussion of his politics.</note> We hope that it will
               be updated to reflect new discoveries and connections, perhaps in conjunction with
               biannual Thelwall conferences. </p>
               <p> The second scholarly resource to be offered here is “John Thelwall in Performance:
                  <title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake</title>,” which documents the first full
               production of a Thelwall play, his Arthurian romance <title level="m">The Fairy of
                  the Lake</title> of 1801, a politically and autobiographically resonant allegory
               of the times. A co-production by the Dalhousie University Theatre Department and the
               Halifax-based Zuppa Theatre Company, the play opened in October 2009 in conjunction
               with the Thelwall conference. Footage of the performance brings to life the oral and
               performative dimensions of Thelwall’s practice discussed in several contributions to
               this volume. The accompanying interviews explore the challenges and decisions
               involved in updating a piece of radical Romantic theatre for modern audiences, while
               the essay by Judith Thompson illuminates the <title level="m">Fairy</title>’s origins
               and literary contexts, and locates it within Thelwall’s oeuvre. </p>
               <p> Together these three components of “John Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments” take
               advantage of <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>’ interconnected hypermedia
               platforms to offer an online equivalent to the multiple platforms erected at the mass
               meetings of the reform societies in the mid-1790s, where Thelwall’s voice reached
               thousands. (Thelwall objected to the political system of “virtual representation”
               championed by Burke, but had he known it as a digital phenomenon, he would surely
               have embraced it as yet another means of expanding the public sphere.) The
               caricaturist James Gillray’s depiction of Thelwall addressing the crowd that gathered
               in the fall of 1795 at Copenhagen Fields, outside London, has become iconic in
               studies of radical Romanticism.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Gillray’s <title level="m">Copenhagen House</title> appears on the covers
                  of both Nicholas Roe’s <title level="m">Wordsworth and Coleridge: The Radical

                  <lb/> A line inscribed below
               the image has him declaring, “I tell you, Citizens, we mean to new-dress the
               Constitution, and turn it, and set a new Nap upon it.”<note resp="editors" place="foot">The line is attributed to Shakespeare.</note>
               In fact he called on his audience to speak out in a “manly, determinate, and
               constitutional way” in defence of their liberties without fear of reprisals, while
               reminding them that even William Blackstone, in his <title level="m">Commentaries on
                  the Laws of England</title>, had regarded the resistance of oppression as a
               constitutional right (<title level="m">Speech-Nov</title> 19, 9). With characteristic
               rhetorical flourish he added, “it is better to have your throats cut like the Pigs
               you have been compared to, than to be hanged like the Dogs to which you have not yet
               been assimilated” (18). As Steve Poole notes in his contribution to this collection,
               Gillray depicts Orator Thelwall ambiguously: he faithfully captures Thelwall’s
               physiognomy and elevates him in dress and position above the other figures, but he
               also expresses a potentially incendiary anger in Thelwall’s clenched fists and open
               mouth. </p>
               <p> Yet firebrand orator was only one of Thelwall’s many modes and personas. Echoing
               Machiavelli, Thelwall declared that <quote>[u]niformity of principle and versatility
                  of means are perfectly reconcilable; and he who wishes to promote the public cause
                  must vary his mode of action with the change of time and circumstances: as the
                  same line of conduct may be at one time beneficial, and at another injurious.

                     see, e.g., Thelwall, “Tribune” 126-27.</note>
                  </quote> Following Thelwall through his diverse “modes of action” is one of the main
               challenges for Thelwall scholars today. How specifically did he adapt his practice to
               the times, and in keeping with what principles? In seeking to answer those questions,
               the essays collected here also aim to reassess existing Thelwall scholarship. </p>
               <p> Both objectives come into focus in Nicholas Roe’s opening contribution, which
               considers what factors might have drawn Thelwall westwards in the summer of 1797,
               when he made his watershed visit to Wordsworth and Coleridge in Somerset. In his
               groundbreaking 1990 essay “Coleridge and John Thelwall: The Road to Nether Stowey,”
               Roe recovered the story of a close friendship and political affinity that Coleridge
               tried later to suppress. Returning to this important moment in literary history, Roe
               now takes stock of two newly republished essays that Thelwall composed at this time:
               “A Pedestrian Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer
               of 1797” and “The Phenomena of the Wye, during the Winter of 1797-8.” For Roe, the
               essays’ non-chronological publication and conspicuous silence on the subject of the
               Stowey visit reflect the depth of Thelwall’s disappointment when his hope of
               friendship and intellectual fellowship among the poets failed to materialize. Roe’s
               essay thus contributes to the recent case for continuity in Thelwall’s practices
               before and after 1797, when he retreated into “exile” on a small farm in Wales, from
               which he re-emerged four years later a self-made professor of elocution and speech
               therapist. In Roe’s view, Thelwall’s excursion of 1797 did not mark a retreat from
               metropolitan radicalism so much as a reorientation toward the “more subjective
               mediated vision” of the “Wye” essay that would find fuller expression in Thelwall’s
                  <title level="m">Poems Chiefly Written in Retirement</title> of 1801.</p>
               <p> As Roe’s essay makes clear, the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Wye” essays are also
               noteworthy for giving voice to the remarkable diversity of identities that Thelwall
               adopted throughout his life and career: not only writer and orator, theorist and
               therapist, journalist and critic, but also agriculturalist, antiquarian, historian,
               economist, industrialist, painter, pedestrian, and picturesque traveller. That last,
               still largely unfamiliar persona comes to the fore in Mary Fairclough’s essay on the
               evolution of Thelwall’s engagement with the politics of the picturesque, notably in
               the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Wye” essays. Challenging E. P. Thompson’s view that
               the essays’ “conventional rehearsals” of the discourse of the picturesque demonstrate
               Thelwall’s failure to sustain his radicalism in the face of persecution, Fairclough
               argues that they in fact carry forward an attempt begun in <title level="m">The
                  Peripatetic</title> to “rethink and recalibrate such engagement” and develop
               alternative means of “seeing” the landscape. In Fairclough’s view, Thelwall achieves
               a material exploration of the landscape and its social configurations that at least
               partially reconciles it with his political radicalism and anticipates his renewed
               public engagement in the next decade, also on materialist principles. </p>
               <p> The pervasive influence of Thelwall’s scientific materialism—his belief that
               all life is a result of the modification of matter<note resp="editors" place="foot">See, notably, Thelwall’s <title level="m">Essay towards a
                     Definition of Animal Vitality</title> 34-35.</note>—is the subject of
               Molly Desjardins’s essay on the political, elocutionary, and therapeutic implications
               of Thelwall’s associationist understanding of the human mind. Reading Thelwall’s
               observations on the treatment of speech impediments in <title level="m">A Letter to
                  Henry Cline</title> (1810) alongside the earlier materialist arguments of <title level="m">An Essay towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793) and the
               associationist premises of a much later essay “On the Influence of the Scenery of
               Nature,” Desjardins calls attention to the consistency of Thelwall’s aims across
               decades and modes of action: both as a political activist and an elocutionist, she
               argues, Thelwall employed his electrifying powers of speech as a sort of “vital
               stimulus” to form and re-form associations within and between minds in an expanded
               public sphere.</p>
               <p> Thelwall’s attention to the individual body as an instrument of communication and
               microcosm of the body politic is a recurrent focus of the essays in this volume and
               of other recent scholarship.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Roe, <title level="m">Politics of Nature</title>; McCann; Scrivener, <title level="m">Seditious Allegories</title>; Allard; and Duchan.</note> With Emily
               Stanback’s contribution, however, a new dimension comes into view: the impaired body
               as the site of an ideological struggle that shaped modern attitudes towards
               disability over the next two centuries. Analysing Thelwall’s little-known writings on
               the treatment of speech impediments and “idiocy” in the context of the history of
               medicine, Stanback calls attention to alternative manifestations of Thelwall’s
               humanizing, democratizing ideals. At a time when attitudes toward illness and
               impairment were still inconsistent yet often pathologizing and marginalizing, she
               argues, Thelwall offered a strikingly progressive and egalitarian approach guided by
               a lingering Jacobin faith in the human capacity for self-improvement. In the process,
               Thelwall seems to have anticipated a modern definition of autism and ventured some of
               its earliest recorded descriptions. </p>
               <p> Thelwall’s interest in “the enfranchisement of the fettered organs” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 9) was no doubt influenced by his own efforts to overcome
               the speech impediment for which he was nicknamed the “Lisping Orator” (Mrs. Thelwall
               40); it was also shaped by his struggles with the legal and political impediments to
               free expression imposed throughout his career. Despite both forms of impairment,
               Thelwall became renowned as a powerful speaker. His epitaph records that “[i]n his
               utterance Englishmen experienced the full beauty and energy of their native speech.
               His oratorical powers were only surpassed by his devoted zeal and unflinching efforts
               to promote the best liberties of his fellow men.” Hazlitt described Thelwall more
               ambiguously, as “[t]he most dashing orator I ever heard [. . .], a volcano vomiting
               out <title level="m">lava</title>” (264).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Hazlitt contrasted Thelwall’s fiery oratory with the “dry
                  cinders” of his printed works and described him uncharitably as “the flattest
                  writer I ever read” (264).</note> Those who objected to his politics, meanwhile,
               saw Thelwall’s oratory as a ready target for satire. He appeared in the anti-Jacobin
               novels of the day as Citizen Ego, John Bawlwell, and the regicidal Mr. Rant.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For Citizen Ego, John Bawlwell,
                  and Mr. Rant, see Walker, Bisset, and D’Israeli respectively.</note> As Nicola
               Trott remarks of this last portrayal, so we might say of them all that they amounted
               to a second and arguably more successful trial for high treason (xii). And this
               “trial” was not confined to literature. </p>
               <p> In an unprecedented analysis of the role of visual satire in shaping Thelwall’s
               public profile, Steve Poole examines the often contrasting strategies by means of
               which loyalist caricaturists, notably James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank, “negotiated
               and accommodated” Thelwall’s uniquely recognizable features and demonstrative
               oratorical manner. A complex and ambiguous symbol of radical energy until his retreat
               to Wales in 1797, Thelwall thereafter became “a cartoon signifier of radical defeat
               and deflation.” Poole’s essay illuminates the iconography of the period as well as
               the philosophical and physiognomical debates that informed it, in which Thelwall
               himself was engaged. Taken together, Poole notes, these caricatures offer a visual
               commentary on what E. P. Thompson referred to as the hunting of the “Jacobin fox”
               (“Hunting”). Indeed, Poole regards Thelwall’s return to politics in the 1810s and
               1820s as “relatively unconvincing.” In his view Thelwall did not so much redirect his
               earlier energies as dissipate them in uncontroversial “professional” channels. </p>
               <p> Clearly, the nature and extent of Thelwall’s radicalism after 1800 remains an open
               question, and answering it demands closer attention to his later pursuits. This is
               precisely what Angela Esterhammer provides in her essay on Thelwall’s short-lived
               monthly periodical the <title level="j">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Launched on the
               model of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> after Thelwall’s cursory
               dismissal from its editorship in 1825, the <title level="j">Panoramic</title> aimed
               to continue the <title level="j">Monthly</title>’s mission of public information and
               improvement. Esterhammer shows that while observing many common journalistic
               practices of the time, Thelwall’s <title level="j">Panoramic</title> stood out for
               its international outlook and, above all, its “dialogic orientation.” In various
               ways, the <title level="j">Panoramic</title> sought to provoke quasi-conversational
               exchange with its male, middle- and working-class contributors and readers, while
               taking a more deliberately didactic approach to female readers. For Esterhammer, the
                  <title level="j">Panoramic</title> demonstrates the persistence of Thelwall’s
               commitment to public education, criticism, and unrestricted communication even as
               late as 1826. Her essay complements Michael Scrivener’s earlier analysis of
               Thelwall’s journalism in the <title level="j">Tribune</title>, the <title level="j">Champion</title>, and the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (“The
               Press”), and should also be read alongside Scrivener’s republication of several of
               Thelwall’s letters from this period, both for a sense of the
               financial aspects of his late ventures and for his pained awareness that by 1832 he
               was already slipping out of the “liberal remembrances of the now triumphing advocates
               of Reform” (“Letters” 149).</p>
               <p> Although the <title level="j">Panoramic Miscellany</title> was to be Thelwall’s last
               published work, his legacy as a writer, lecturer, artist, lover, and peripatetic
               adventurer found new and sometimes paradoxical expression in his children, and
               especially his son Weymouth Birkbeck (1831-1873). In her often surprising closing
               contribution to this volume, Patty O’Boyle reconstructs the story of the life and
               career of this “son of John Thelwall” as he continued and subverted his father’s
               talents and principles, carrying early nineteenth-century Romantic idealism into the
               colonial heart of darkness in Central Africa. By lifting the pall of anonymity that
               has long rested on this last direct descendant of John Thelwall—whose middle
               name was a tribute to the founder of the mechanics’ institutes at which Thelwall
               lectured around the time of Weymouth’s birth in 1831—O’Boyle also sheds light
               on his father’s life and achievements from a longer historical perspective. In tandem
               with the essays by Poole and Esterhammer, O’Boyle’s essay begins to address the vexed
               question of Thelwall’s eclipse and persistence in the nineteenth century. </p>
               <p> All together, the essays collected here mark both continuity and new directions in
               the rapidly emerging field of Thelwall studies. Much like Thelwall and Coleridge in
               the mid-1790s, they “answer and provoke”<note resp="editors" place="foot">The phrase, from Coleridge’s “The Nightingale,” also figures
                  in the title of Gurion Taussig’s chapter on Coleridge and Thelwall’s “oppositional
                  friendship” in <title level="m">Coleridge and the Idea of Friendship,
                     1789-1804</title> (2002). </note> each other on topics of mutual interest, notably Thelwall’s scientific materialism; his use,
               figuration, and treatment of the speaking body, both real and imagined; the
               connection between his printed and spoken words; his historical legacy; and the
               adaptability of his modes of action. In the context of the recent surge of interest
               in Thelwall, these essays also testify to the continuing relevance and appeal of his
               “radical” principles. Efforts are now underway to launch a Thelwall Society and erect
               a commemorative English Heritage “Blue Plaque” in London, where in 2014 a major Thelwall conferenc
               e will explore his relation to medical science and mark the 250th anniversary of his birth. The
               launch of a <ref target="http://myweb.dal.ca/jthompso/Research/citjt.html">Thelwall
                  Web site</ref>, a modern edition of his abolitionist, feminist novel <title level="m">The Daughter of Adoption</title> (1801), and the publication of two
               monographs on his work all promise to help sustain the pace of this ongoing recovery.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Judith
                  Thompson’s monograph <title level="m">John Thelwall in the Wordsworth Circle: The Silenced Partner</title> will be published in 2012; my own, provisionally

               Poole has noted, it can no longer be maintained that by 1800 the “Jacobin fox” was
               dead (Introduction 11), this volume and the larger network of activities to which it
               belongs confirm that Thelwall and his body of work are finally finding new life.</p>

               <head>John Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>: The Lecturer as
               Journalist</head>

               <p> Why did the sixty-two-year-old Thelwall embark on the expensive and exhausting
               project of almost single-handedly writing and marketing a monthly periodical under
               the title <title level="m">The Panoramic Miscellany</title>? The venture only
               survived for six months—January to June 1826—and if readers during the
               1820s evidently gave it little attention, Romanticists and print-culture scholars
               have paid virtually none at all. Robert Lamb and Corinna Wagner, who include the
               first-ever reprints from the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> in their
               recent <title level="m">Selected Political Writings of John Thelwall</title>, remark
               that “There was a huge difference between this periodical and [Thelwall’s] earlier
               ventures” (4: 199). However, a detailed look at the contents of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> along with Thelwall’s editorial policy, his
               discursive tone, and his relationship with readers and contributors suggests that
               this last journalistic venture manifests the <emph>continuity</emph> of his
               commitments to political causes, public education, elocutionary training, and
               literary criticism. The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> represents
               Thelwall’s attempt to adapt these long-standing commitments to the new media context
               of the 1820s. Reflecting an awareness of the rapid changes that had taken place in
               print culture since the time he began his journalistic activities in the late
               eighteenth century, this short-lived publication opens a window onto a late-Romantic
               era notable for its experiments with print and visual media. </p>
               <p>Although there is scant documentation of any historical and biographical context
               surrounding the launch of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>,
               Thelwall’s overriding motivation for starting the journal is sufficiently clear from
               his editorial comments in its first two issues, if not from the title pages alone.
               The <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s sub-title—“Monthly Magazine and Review
               of Literature, Science, Arts, Inventions and Occurrences”—references another
               periodical publication: the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> to which
               Thelwall had contributed since its founding by Richard Phillips and Joseph Johnson in
               1796. In late 1824, Phillips sold the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and the new
               owners hired Thelwall as editor until November 1825 (Carnall 162-63). At that point
               they fired him and re-oriented the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> with a
               new series that was launched in January 1826. Thelwall’s resentment over his abrupt
               dismissal overflows onto the pages of the independent periodical he started that same
               month: the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Several of the articles in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> feature bitter editorial headnotes or
               footnotes emphasizing that these articles should have appeared in “another
               publication”—i.e., in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>—in
               order to fulfill commitments Thelwall had made when he was editor of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>.<note resp="editors" place="foot"> See, for
                  instance, Thelwall’s remarks on the medical article “Distortions of the Spine”
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 50-54) and on his own extended review of “The
                  Poetry of Miss Landen [sic]” (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82). Since the single
                  six-issue volume of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> uses
                  consecutive page numbering throughout, references in the present essay are given
                  by the abbreviation <title level="m">PM</title> and page numbers only. </note>
               </p>
               <p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was evidently a long article ascribed to an
               anonymous naval officer, entitled “Hints on the Impressment of Seamen,” that Thelwall
               accepted for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Its publication was
               interrupted after the first two installments when Thelwall lost control of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>; even worse, that magazine’s new owners went on to
               publish an unauthorized continuation of it, an action that Thelwall must have felt
               violated his agreement with the author. Thelwall seeks to set the record straight by
               publishing the “Impressment” treatise in its entirety in the first two issues of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. His outraged headnote and
               postscript, conspicuously signed “J. Thelwall,” suggest that he considered it
               politically urgent to publish the “Impressment” article and that this was the primary
               motivation for his decision to launch his own magazine. Thelwall’s honour demands not
               only the fulfillment of his commitment to the contributor, but also the rebuttal of
               the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title>’s “disgraceful” and “perverted” forgery
               with the “authentic article,” so that the author will not have to go to the expense
               of “republish[ing] the whole, in another form” (<title level="m">PM</title>
                  297).<note resp="editors" place="foot"> Nevertheless, <title level="m">Hints
                     on the Impressment of Seamen, by a Commander of the Royal Navy</title>, did
                  appear in another form: as a two-shilling pamphlet published in 1827. </note> At
               the end of the first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> Thelwall
               actually reprints some of the acrimonious correspondence that resulted from a final
               meeting between his son, his solicitor, and the acting proprietor of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> in December 1825. Thelwall’s repeated
               references to “duty,” “honour,” “responsibility,” and “fulfillment,” “<emph>my</emph> correspondents,” and “<emph>my</emph> contributors” (<title level="m">PM</title> 146) leave no doubt about his sense of injury and
               helplessness over the decisions taken at the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title> and his self-justification in starting his own rival periodical
               with the same format and several of the same contributors. </p>
               <p>The contents of Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> correspond
               very closely to the regular contents of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>
               as listed on its title page for 1825. These range from the current “Topic of the
               Month” to literature and the arts (“Philosophy of Contemporary Criticism,” “Poetry,”
               “Review of the New Music”), public education (“Proceedings of Learned Societies”),
               and routine departments (“List of Bankruptcies and Dividends,” “Report of the
               Weather,” “Domestic Occurrences,” etc.). Contributors who followed Thelwall to his new
               journalistic venture include Mary Russell Mitford, medical doctors James Field and H.
               Robertson, meteorologist James Tatem, and the authors of the five-part “Egyptian
               Zodiac” series and of “History of the Captivity of a Russian Officer among the
               Turks,” another piece that Thelwall had previously accepted for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (<title level="j">MM</title> 60 [1825]: 384). Thelwall’s
               continuing goodwill toward his “old friend” Sir Richard Phillips, the founder of the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title>, is evident in the special notice the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> takes of Phillips’s new publication <title level="m">Golden Rules of Social Philosophy</title>, to which Thelwall devotes a generously
               balanced review in the February issue while confessing perplexity with some of
               Phillips’s odder ideas, such as his vegetarianism and his infamous refusal to believe
               in the force of gravity (<title level="m">PM</title> 235).</p>
               <p>In accordance with the journalistic practice of the time, nearly all the articles and
               items in the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> are unsigned or signed
               with obvious pseudonyms. This makes Thelwall’s deviations from the usual practice all
               the more revealing. Clear exceptions are the numerous headnotes and footnotes signed
               “Editor” or (occasionally) “J. Thelwall,” and the lectures on elocution included in
               most issues, each of which is identified in the title as “Mr. Thelwall’s Lecture.”
               Some of the “Original Poetry” is signed by Thelwall himself, and some of the regular
               pseudonyms used in the poetry department (“Ausonia,” for instance) seem to belong to
               him as well. He may also have followed the practice he used when editing <title level="j">The Champion</title> a few years earlier, of including original and
               translated poetry that began as “school exercises of the pupils of his Institution
               for the Cure of Impediments” (Thelwall, <title level="m">Poetical Recreations</title>
               243). Other pieces likely written by Thelwall himself are a multi-part series on “The
               London University,” reports on public societies and educational institutions,
               articles on political economy, the three-part “Tour thro North Wales,” some of the
               regular features including the agricultural reports,
               and—significantly—the literary-critical articles. Foremost among his
               acknowledged contributions, however, are the leading articles that begin each issue,
               which are signed either with Thelwall’s name or with a coded symbol consisting of a
               triangle followed by three dots in the shape of a second triangle (Δ <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/thelwall/images/triangle_character.bmp"/>). As
               elucidated in Thelwall’s lecture on “Elements of Prosody” in the May issue, these two
               signs represent the “<emph>Thesis</emph> and <emph>Arsis</emph> of human speech”
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 636): a long/stressed syllable followed by a
               short/unstressed one. Rhythmically (as a trochaic foot) as well as phonetically
                  (<emph>TH</emph>esis + <emph>A</emph>rsis), they stand for “Thelwall.” After
               beginning to use this cipher as his signature for the leading article, Thelwall also
               signs some shorter items with it as well. Interestingly, too, most of the repeated
               pseudonyms under which other <title level="m">Panoramic</title> articles appear fit
               the same trochaic pattern: “Civis,” “Cosmo,” “Thermes.”</p>
               <p> Apart from such clues, the only indicators as to what Thelwall did and didn’t write
               himself are his frequent editorial comments on individual articles and the “Notices
               to Correspondents” pages at the end of each issue, where he refers directly and (it
               appears) sincerely to articles contributed by other writers, although without naming
               any of these contributors. The rhetoric of editorial headnotes and footnotes
               sometimes implies that Thelwall is <emph>not</emph> the author of a given
               article—for instance, when a headnote obviously singles an article out for
               praise (presumably Thelwall would not introduce his own work to readers as
               “invaluable”), or, conversely, when he explicitly distances himself from the claims
               made in an article by adding a critical footnote. The running dialogue that he
               carries on with contributors on the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               is, in fact, a characteristic and revealing aspect of Thelwall’s editorial practice,
               evident also in the issues of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> that came
               out under his direction. Thelwall regards his editorial role as a sustained
               conversation with other writers and readers. The dialogic tone of his editorial
               interventions suggests that he places the periodical miscellany on the same continuum
               with oral media of communication such as public lectures, elocutionary training, and
               the educational institutions and debating clubs whose activities receive so much
               coverage in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>.</p>
               <p>A few collaborators and contributors are identifiable, including John Timbs
               (1801-1875)—antiquary, journalist, editor, and Richard Phillips’s secretary
               during his last years with the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (Gibbs 386).
               But it is hard to tell with which sections Timbs assisted Thelwall, since they had
               equally wide-ranging and miscellaneous interests (not to mention the same initials).
               Mary Russell Mitford contributed one short story to each of the first three issues of
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> under the signature “M.” James G. Tatem and
               the physician and medical lecturer James Field, respectively, continued to contribute
               meteorological and medical reports each month, as they had done for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Nevertheless, not only does Thelwall seem to
               have produced an immense amount of copy for each 143-page issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> single-handedly, but his contributions seem to have
               increased as the magazine neared the end of its six-month run. Until April, he
               increasingly (and perhaps with increasing defensiveness?) refers to the overwhelming
               amount of material he has received from contributors, yet in the last (June) issue,
               which is also eight pages shorter than the others, there is little that can be
               reliably ascribed to writers other than Thelwall. Short of both contributors and
               readers, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> also suffered from the lack of a
               reliable technological infrastructure. Thelwall frequently apologizes to readers for
               errors in production: the hasty and disorganized printing of the first issue, a lost
               manuscript of music criticism, his inability to attend theatrical productions in
               person and the lack of a trusty reviewer to send in his place, multiple mix-ups at
               the printer’s. The inclusion of such references serves to give the editorial voice a
               certain conversational immediacy and even intimacy.</p>
               <p> In the competitive periodical market of the 1820s, Thelwall’s policy on
               paying—or rather <emph>not</emph> paying—for contributions differentiates
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> from some of its major rivals. According to
               Mark Parker, during the 1820s payments to contributors per sixteen-page sheet were
               made “in a fairly tight range across the industry”; he cites per-sheet rates of
               twelve to sixteen guineas (12-13). The <title level="m">Panoramic</title> confirms
               this pay scale with a rather arch mention in a regional report from Edinburgh that
               “Mr. C[onstable] is said to have paid Mr. Jeffery [sic] 700 £ for editing every
               number of the Edinburgh Review, and Sir J. Mackintosh and Mr. Brougham have sometimes
               received 100 £. each, for articles; and the lowest recompense for any contribution
               received and published, was 16 guineas per sheet” (<title level="m">PM</title> 441).
               By contrast, Thelwall reacts with high-minded disdain to potential contributors who
               inquire how much his journal pays for contributions. “Poetry, in particular,” he
               huffs, “when it is such as <emph>we require</emph>, will generally be regarded by its
               authors as above <emph>pecuniary</emph> compensation; and as for Critics—so far
               from hiring <emph>anonymous</emph> criticism by the sheet, we will take care that the
               reputation of no literary work whatever shall, in our pages, be at the mercy of any
               censor whose honor we cannot depend upon” (<title level="m">PM</title> 298). Only
               “authors of already established reputation” or those whose samples have passed a
               careful vetting might qualify for remuneration from him. Thelwall’s policy runs
               counter to standard industry practices, from the accepted pay scale to the
               near-universal habit of anonymous reviewing. While he may be making a virtue of
               necessity, by maintaining that poetry and criticism alike transcend commercial
               transactions Thelwall also sustains the image of his journal as free conversational
               exchange and promotes his vision of literary reviewing as a kind of honourable
               patronage that singles out worthy authors for non-pecuniary rewards and
               recognition.</p>
               <p>Like many other editors during the periodical-rich 1820s, Thelwall writes on the
               topic of periodical writing itself. His leading article in the inaugural issue of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> bears a title that is a virtual
               thesis statement: “On the Connexion of Periodical Literature with the Moral and
               Intellectual Progress of Society” (<title level="m">PM</title> 1). This lengthy
               editorial echoes the main goals articulated in the editorial preface of the first
               issue of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> published by Richard Phillips
               and edited by John Aikin in February 1796. Their magazine was to “open new sources of
               entertainment and instruction for their readers,” to propagate liberal principles, to
               provide a forum for the “lighter exertions of learned and ingenious writers” and to
               publish genuinely good poetry—none of which was then being offered by other
               “Periodical Miscellanies” (<title level="j">MM</title> 1 [1796]: iii-iv). Thelwall’s
               editorial statement of January 1826 re-affirms these goals by analyzing how
               periodicals like the <title level="j">Monthly</title> have revolutionized print
               culture over the intervening thirty years. His defence of periodical literature links
               the proliferation of magazines during the 1820s to the “rapid march of mind” and the
               notable increase in refinement, morality, intelligence, and taste, especially among
               the middle classes. By contrast, only one generation earlier, middle-class tradesmen
               had eschewed literature and book-learning while they deemed card-playing and drinking
               more useful and acceptable recreations, and the only “wretched flimsy and ill written
               sixpenny magazines” that were then available were read by young women (<title level="m">PM</title> 1). When periodicals like (Thelwall implies) the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> entered this unenlightened marketplace and
               addressed a large-scale, middle-class, predominantly male readership, they joined
               with the newly formed public societies for learning, mechanics’ institutes, and
               middle-class universities in a grand mission of public improvement that is, in 1826,
               still awaiting appropriate recognition: “Of the powerful influence of periodical
               literature in forwarding the progress of general intellect, and the necessity of its
               agency to the end proposed, there are few, perhaps, who, even yet, have formed a
               proper estimate” (<title level="m">PM</title> 4). Thelwall refutes the idea that the
               brief information offered in miscellanies is superficial and displaces more profound
               scientific publications. Instead, he claims, accessible popular knowledge and serious
               research reciprocally support one another: <quote>It is the business of the
                  periodical essayist to remove this veil of mystery from science, to translate its
                  revelations into familiar language, and dispense to those who have more of thirst,
                  than leisure, or opportunity for acquisition, so much as they have time to
                  receive, or are prepared to comprehend. Is this a task for superficial minds?
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 5)</quote> It is already evident from these
               opening pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> why the aging
               Thelwall felt he had to find a way to continue the original mission of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. The <title level="j">Monthly</title>’s aim to
               spread instructive and amusing information along with liberal principles has only
               gained in importance in the climate of heightened media awareness and “march of mind”
               that characterizes the 1820s, a climate that periodical literature itself has helped
               to form. Magazines, according to this mission statement, are as important an organ
               for contributing to the improvement of society as the public lecturing and
               elocutionary training with which the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> goes hand in
               hand.</p>
               <p>Against the background of Thelwall’s attempt to sustain the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>’s original principles, however, the changes he does make stand
               out in greater relief. First of all, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> expands
               and highlights its national and international scope. Whereas the 1825 <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> represents itself simply as published in London
               by “Geo. B. Whittaker,” the title page of the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> lists a much wider geographical range of establishments where
               it can be obtained, not only in London but in Glasgow, Paris, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and
               “all booksellers in town and country.”<note resp="editors" place="foot"> Judith
                  Thompson (in private e-mail correspondence) has identified Thelwall’s primary contacts in these locations as friends
                  who hosted him in Glasgow in 1804; Maury Duval, the proprietor of the <emph>Dépôt
                     Bibliographique</emph>, whom he visited more than once in Paris; and his wife
                  Cecil’s sister in Boulogne-sur-Mer. My thanks also to Judith Thompson for
                  information about Cecil Thelwall’s likely knowledge of Italian. </note> According
               to its title page, too, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> maintains a special
               commitment to “the Science and Literature of Italy.” Why? In the absence of further
               evidence that Thelwall became an Italophile later in his life or that he had a
               collaborator with special Italian interests, it looks very much like an attempt to
               make the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> popular with readers (even if Thelwall’s
               opening editorial eschews “the cheap expedient of ministering to the caprice of
               fashion” [<title level="m">PM</title> 3]). London in the mid-1820s saw a remarkable
               spike of interest in things Italian, documented for instance in rival publications
               such as Colburn’s <title level="j">New Monthly Magazine</title> and <title level="j">Knight’s Quarterly</title>. No doubt this interest was fuelled by the presence of
               a significant intellectual and artistic community of Italian expatriates exiled from
               Italy after 1820 due to the events of the early Risorgimento. The advertisement for
               Italian literature on the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page is amply
               borne out by the “Letters on Italian Literature” included in each of the six issues,
               which are advertised as “Translated from original communications.” It is likely that
               Thelwall—or his wife Cecil—is at least the translator of these essays
               even if they originate from an Italian correspondent, perhaps a contact in the
               expatriate community. Moreover, the “Original Poetry” section often contains
               translations of Italian verse and other contributions with the by-line “Ausonia”
               (i.e., “Italy”). One of “Ausonia”’s contributions to the March issue, a “Sonnet to
               L.E.L.” that follows up Thelwall’s review of Letitia Landon’s poetry that appeared in
               the January issue, makes it very likely that Ausonia is either John or Cecil
               Thelwall.</p>
               <p> The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> also features expanded links to
               European culture through partnerships with French periodicals. Among the places where
               the magazine can be obtained, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page
               lists one foreign outlet: “the Bureau of the Revue Encyclopédique, Paris.” A
               consistent dialogue with the <title level="j">Revue Encyclopédique</title> is evident
               throughout the <title level="j">Panoramic</title>’s run. Most issues contain at least
               one article that is translated from the French journal. At the end of the April
               issue, Thelwall gratefully acknowledges a favourable notice of his <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> in the <title level="j">Revue
               Encyclopédique</title>, and reciprocates by calling the <title level="j">Revue</title> “the first literary journal of Europe” (<title level="m">PM</title>
               586). In the January issue, Thelwall mentions an intended agreement with another new
               French journal, the <title level="j">Athénée Britannique</title> (published in Paris
               and London), for “reciprocation of intelligence and communications” (<title level="m">PM</title> 130), although there is no further evidence of how active this
               exchange turned out to be. The first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               also received a favourable review in the London-based French-language periodical
                  <title level="j">Le Mercure de Londres</title>, as did Thelwall himself for being
               “l’un des hommes le plus recommandable que posséde [sic] l’Angleterre” (<title level="j">Mercure</title> 1, no. 5 [25 March 1826]: 73).</p>
               <p> Favouring these Italian and French connections, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> maintains other international interests, regularly reviewing
               literature from across Europe and featuring articles on Spanish history and culture,
               Danish superstitions, the climate of France, new developments in engineering and
               statistical surveys throughout the world, and regular attention to India and Burma
               (the latter no doubt because of the ongoing Anglo-Burmese War). Revealingly, though,
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> does not assume any knowledge of foreign
               languages on the part of its readers, but conscientiously provides English
               translations of every non-English text or phrase, however brief, that appears in its
               pages. This practice seems to reflect a dedication to accessibility and a target
               audience among male middle- and working-class readers who are not expected to have an
               education in either modern or classical languages.</p>
               <p>These international exchanges are one aspect of a dialogic orientation in Thelwall’s
               journalism that is worth exploring further in the context of the 1820s media
               environment. In his study <title level="m">Literary Magazines and British
                  Romanticism</title>, Mark Parker convincingly identifies fundamentally different
               orientations in some of the decade’s leading periodicals. He demonstrates, for
               instance, that the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> manifests a “bias . . .
               toward representation” while <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>
               is biased “toward performance” (135). By comparison, the fundamental rhetorical bias
               of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> seems best described as the
               pedagogical mode of <emph>lecture-discussion</emph>. When applied to Thelwall’s
               journalism, this means that he as editor persistently gestures toward conversational
               exchange with contributors, correspondents, and readers. Yet he maintains a
               controlling role in the conversation: his voice is that of the lecturer who initiates
               topics and frames the contributions of others by claiming the last word. Thelwall’s
               editorial stance thus differs from that of Phillips’s <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>, which, as Jon Klancher writes, used the “‘original
               correspondence’ format” to “collect[ ] readers and writers as
                  <emph>interchangeable</emph> participants” (39, italics added). It differs also
               from contemporaneous experiments with group or coterie publication, such as <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> or its London-based imitator, the short-lived <title level="j">Knight’s Quarterly</title>. The <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> offers an alternative model of unequal dialogue—not among
               a coterie of editors, writers, and readers, but between a pedagogically-inclined
               editor and his reader-learners.</p>
               <p>More than other magazines of the 1820s, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> privileges the public lecture as a form of communication.
               Thelwall’s own lectures on elocution form the centerpiece of most of the issues.
               Several of the other articles in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> are printed
               versions of lectures delivered in London or elsewhere, and the “Proceedings of
               learned societies” section contains brief eyewitness reports of further lectures.
               Some of Thelwall’s articles, particularly his continuing series on “The London
               University,” include remarks on the practice of lecturing itself (e.g., <title level="m">PM</title> 504-07). Thelwall is also in the habit of constructing his
               articles as responses to other people’s lectures or speeches. In the May and June
               issues, for instance, he prints long excerpts from “Mr. Jacob’s Report to the House
               of Commons, on the Trade in Foreign Corn” and develops his own counter-position in a
               passage-by-passage running commentary. Similarly, February’s leading article is a
               running commentary on a lecture recently delivered by Mr. Banks at the City and
               Western Institutions, and in March Thelwall follows the same practice with a lecture
               on geological phenomena that was delivered by Professor Brande at the Royal
               Institution. The editorials become dialogues between Thelwall and the lecturers, who
               are thereby put in the position of involuntary “contributors.” Thelwall’s frequent
               interventions as editor of articles by voluntary contributors to the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> work the same way. He carries on a dialogue with other writers
               in footnotes or endnotes to their articles, in editorial comments that are often
               rather patronizing. The conversational tone of Thelwall’s periodical writing is also
               evident in the responsive relationship between letters from contributors and the
               editor’s replies, and in the editor’s direct address to contributors on the “Notices
               to Correspondents” page at the end of each issue.</p>
               <p>In the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, Thelwall resorts to a variety
               of tactics for trying to provoke debate. He includes brief queries on etymological
               questions—asking about the origin of the terms “Grub Street” or “John Bull,”
               for instance—that solicit involvement from readers. These queries of a few
               lines in length also mark an increasing tendency after the first issue—once
               Thelwall presumably got some of his initial technical problems under control—to
               fill in blank space after a regular article with a tiny interrogative, humorous, or
               thought-provoking item, then begin the next feature article at the top of a new page.
               In the March issue, such interpolated questions become more philosophical: “What is
               eloquence?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 315), “What are metaphysics?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 374), “What is time?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 306). The
               last of these queries also marks the beginning of a new mini-series consisting of
               brief items with the by-line “From the Manuscript Sketches of a Correspondent.” It is
               tempting to identify the “Correspondent” responsible for these intriguing sketches as
               Thelwall himself, for they reflect his lifelong interests in language, acting and the
               theatre, pedantry, and imagination—although, when one such item promotes “a
               little opium” as an aid to imagination, Thelwall appends a disapproving editorial
               response in defence of sober genius (<title level="m">PM</title> 761).</p>
               <p>Another variant on the lecture-discussion mode appears in Thelwall’s literary
               criticism and reviewing, and here the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>
               sets itself apart from rival magazines. The individual book reviews in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s long “Review of Literature” department are
               completely unsystematic and vary widely in length. They clearly reflect Thelwall’s
               own interests; for instance, reviews of fiction and poetry are likely to highlight
               linguistic and metrical aspects, and substantial column inches are devoted to books
               on language itself, such as dictionaries, grammars, and philological works. In
               contrast to the reviewing style that was nearly ubiquitous in periodicals from the
                  <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> to the <title level="j">European
                  Magazine</title>, where reviews included lengthy quotations from the primary work,
               Thelwall quotes minimally and instead offers his own evaluation. This can range from
               long, section-by-section commentary on books that particularly engage his interest to
               a brief overview paragraph of ones he considers worthy of notice but lacks time or
               linguistic abilities to review in detail (for instance, books in German). Also
               interesting is the gender perspective of Thelwall’s reviewing and literary criticism.
               Among the books he singles out for unusually lengthy treatment are publications by
               prominent women writers: Letitia Landon’s <title level="m">The Troubadour</title>
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82), Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">The Last
                  Man</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 380-86), and Joanna Baillie’s <title level="m">The Martyr</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 665-68). Elsewhere in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, too, Thelwall explicitly promotes his own
               reputation as a fair and well-inclined reviewer of women’s literature. In addition to
               his characteristic mode of biased dialogue with male contributors, lecturers, or
               treatise-writers, there is a more deliberately pedagogical mode of lecturing
                  <emph>to</emph> younger female writers, who are nevertheless treated with notable
               seriousness and respect.</p>
               <p> But the most striking reflection on gender relations in the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> is the short poem “To Maga” that appeared in the
               first issue, signed “J.T.” and evidently addressed to the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>. In an extended metaphor, Thelwall figures this magazine as a
               beloved woman that he longed to make his own even though she remained for thirty
               years “in other arms,” then was “resigned . . . to shame” and almost ruined (i.e.,
               when Phillips sold “Maga” in 1824), yet unexpectedly given over by “chance” to
               Thelwall’s loving care (when he assumed editorial responsibilities for the <title level="j">Monthly</title>). Ignoring Thelwall’s tireless efforts to restore
               “Maga,” however, her new owners tear her from his arms, and he laments that she will
               now end up completely degraded: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>They’ll deck thee out in trim array,</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent3">More gaudy to the eye;</l>
                        <l>But steal the inward worth away</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent3">That did thy charms supply. (<title level="m">PM</title>
                        84)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Thelwall says farewell to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> as he
               turns to “another love . . . To whom I’ll father-lover prove”—i.e., the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Here, in lyric form, Thelwall’s emotional
               commitment to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and its original values meets his
               judgment on early nineteenth-century print culture: running after “trim” and “gaudy”
               publications, the periodical press of the 1820s risks abandoning the ethics of public
               education and diffusion of knowledge that motivated Thelwall’s own journalism since
               the 1790s.</p>
               <p>The dedication “To Maga” remains odd, though, and not just because of the inherent
               strangeness of figuring a magazine as the object of erotic desire. Denominating the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title> with the feminine-sounding name “Maga” allows the
               conceit to work (more or less). Yet “Maga” must have been familiar to Thelwall and
               everyone else as the nickname, not of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>, but of
               another publication entirely: <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh
               Magazine</title>. Throughout the 1820s, <emph>Blackwood’s</emph> best-known
               contributor “Christopher North” used the feminine associations of “Maga” to figure
               his magazine sometimes as a coquette, sometimes as a virtuous woman.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="4"> An instance that precedes Thelwall’s “To Maga”
                  is the editor Christopher North’s “An Hour’s Tete-a-Tete” in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> 8 (February 1820): 78-105; another example appears in
                  “Notices to Correspondents,” <title level="j">Blackwood’s </title>28 (July 1830):
                  136-44. My thanks to Chris Lendrum for drawing my attention to these passages.
               </note> Why does Thelwall make use of an image and a name that would inevitably
               remind readers of a “trim,” “gaudy,” fashionable publication seemingly contrary to
               his own principles? Paradoxes like these in the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> suggest the challenges Thelwall faced in launching a
               publication that would fulfill his long-standing aims yet be viable in the 1820s
               marketplace.</p>
               <p>For his new love, Thelwall chose a title that married the well-established
               eighteenth-century designation “Miscellany” with the new nineteenth-century adjective
               “Panoramic.” First recorded by the OED in 1813, “panoramic” did not gain its abstract
               meaning of “universal” until after Thelwall’s lifetime. In the minds of his readers
               in the 1820s, it might have conjured up recollections of another recently defunct
               publication, the <title level="j">Literary Panorama</title> (1806-1819), but also
               direct associations with panoramas and other very current visual media. Like
               virtually all literary-cultural magazines of its day, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> includes reports about the new visual entertainments in London,
               particularly the Diorama (<title level="m">PM</title> 252, 396-97), the Cosmorama,
               and the Poecilorama—a “variously coloured,” supposedly time-travelling exhibit
               at the Egyptian Hall (<title level="m">PM</title> 397, 445). The link between these
               “-ramas” and the title of Thelwall’s magazine is made explicit in the April issue
               when a correspondent writes in as “John Bull” expressing appreciation for the
               Poecilorama, but ridiculing its pretentious Greek name. “John Bull” notes that
               Thelwall himself appears to share the “Greek mania” that led him to use the “scrap of
               every day Greek ‘Panoramic’” on his title page rather than calling his journal, in
               plain English, “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” (<title level="m">PM</title> 486). In a
               good-natured response, Thelwall concedes the point. But he consoles his
                  “<emph>bluff</emph> correspondent”—and puts in a brief marketing
               plug—by noting that anyone who prefers asking at his local bookseller’s for
               “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” will surely be put in possession of the publication he
               desires. Still, the reference in Thelwall’s title to the very current visual medium
               of the 1820s, the panorama, seems indicative of his engagement with another live
               experiential medium of the 1820s, the public lecture, which continues to stand at the
               centre of his commitment to rational communication, education, and public
               engagement.</p>

               <p> In the early Romantic period, John Thelwall was infamous for both his defiant
               volubility and subsequent silencing.<hi/>According to E. P. Thompson, “the story
               of the silencing of Thelwall” (95) begins in 1795 with the passage of the Treasonable
               Practices Act and the Seditious Meetings Act and culminates with Thelwall’s decision
               to become a teacher of elocution—a decision signaling that “nothing survived of the
               Patriot except his fading notoriety” (123).<hi/>Perhaps no portrait better
               captures the drastic turn in Thelwall’s career than George Crabbe’s caricature of
               Thelwall as the radical lecturer Hammond in the verse tale <title level="m">The Dumb
                  Orators; or, the Benefit of Society</title>
              (1812).<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                   In assuming that Thelwall is the model for Crabbe’s Hammond, I follow
                     Thompson, “Overlooking History,” Scrivener, and Edwards. 
               </note> In <title level="m">The Dumb Orators</title>, Hammond first stupefies a
               Church-and-State orator using “Deist’s scorn” and “rebel’s wit,” but later gets his
               just deserts when the political tide turns (192). Hammond, who ironically earlier
               used “licentious words” to prove “that liberty of speech was gone,” ultimately
               devolves into a stuttering isolate (223-24). Under the critical eyes of loyalists,
               Hammond loses the liberty of speech that he prematurely lamented:
            <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I seek no favour—I—the Rights of Man!</l>
                        <l>Claim; and I—nay!—but give me leave—and I</l>
                        <l>Insist—a man—that is—and in reply,</l>
                        <l>I speak. (455-58)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            Though a smug parable, Crabbe’s tale had its basis in reality. Thelwall, who had
               overcome a speech impediment of his own, lectured to thousands in the early 1790s,
               but by the end of the decade he had been made, effectively, dumb: first by the
               “Gagging Acts” of 1795 and then by “dwindling interest” in his public lectures
               (Claeys xxvii).<note resp="editors" place="foot"> Thelwall discloses in <title level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title> that he once suffered from a lisp
                  (19). </note> Forcibly deprived of the freedom to express his political views,
               Thelwall changed careers to become an elocutionist who sought to cure speech
               impediments, mutism, and “moral idiocy”—conditions that had formerly been the
               province of “deaf and dumb” schools (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 124, 84). </p>
               <p> As Thompson’s account suggests, Thelwall’s elocutionary career has frequently been
               understood as a renunciation of his revolutionary politics. Thelwall himself
               encouraged this view, claiming that his “New Profession” returned him to the
               “calmness of physiological disquisition” he had experienced as an auditor of medical
               lectures at Guy’s Hospital before he was “hurried . . . away” by the “excentric fire
               of youth” into politics (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 2). Thelwall scholars
               such as Judith Thompson, however, have questioned this account and argued that
               Thelwall’s “speech theory emerges as part of a total system to reform the body
               politic” (“Re-sounding Romanticism” 24). Though a number of scholars have drawn
               connections between the scientific materialism that informs Thelwall’s speech theory
               and the political materialism that informs his revolutionary opinions, there has not
               yet been a thorough explanation of how Thelwall thought an “enfranchisement of
               fettered organs” would manifestly contribute to an expansion of the franchise (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 9). In other words, how did Thelwall see his work as
               an elocutionist as a continuation of his work as a political activist? In this essay
               I begin to answer this question by uncovering the model of mind that guides both
               Thelwall’s elocutionary work and his political philosophy. First, I establish the
               model of the mind Thelwall develops in elocutionary texts such as <title level="m">A
                  Letter to Henry Cline</title> (1810). Then, I turn to Thelwall’s <title level="m">An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793), an early
               “physiological disquisition” that provides the scientific basis for his model of mind
               and speech theory. Finally, I look at the rhetoric of Thelwall’s arguments in support
               of free association to show that Thelwall’s scientific interests inform both his
               political philosophy and his elocutionary theory.</p>

                  <p> In a recent article, Judith Thompson compares Coleridge’s conversation poems to
               Thelwall’s and concludes that Thelwall is “more concerned with modulations of voice
               than associations of the mind, and with building a co-responding society than with
               correspondent breezes” (“Why Kendal?” 18).<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                   For more on the poetic relationship between Thelwall and Coleridge, see
                     Thompson, “An Autumnal Blast.”
               </note> I agree with Thompson’s assessment that Thelwall, unlike Coleridge,
               maintained his political ideals even in retirement. However, as I will show, Thelwall
               also maintained a commitment to associationist psychology. In fact, I argue that it
               is precisely because of his continued commitment to associationism that Thelwall was
               able to continue his reformist agenda after he became an elocutionist. As we will
               see, for Thelwall modulations of voice are not opposed to associations of the mind
               but rather depend on them. Likewise, strong corresponding societies depend on strong
               correspondences in the brain. </p>
                  <p> Thelwall explicitly attests to the power of mental associations in “On the Influence
               of the Scenery of Nature on the Intellectual and Moral Character, as well as the
               Taste and Imagination” (1820), an essay first published in his newspaper<hi/>
                     <title level="m">The Champion</title>. Here, many years after Coleridge rejected
               Hartleian thought, Thelwall continues to appeal to associationist theory.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                   In the 1790s Coleridge had praised Hartley’s work (and even named his son
                     Hartley). But on March 16, 1801, he exclaimed that he had “overthrown the
                     doctrine of associationism, as taught by Hartley, and with it all the
                     irreligious metaphysics of modern infidels” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2: 706).
                     Later, in his notebooks, Coleridge definitively rejected “modern
                     Hartleio-Locklean Metaphysics, with its Impressions, Ideas, and Sensations, and
                     its Jack of all Trades, Association” (qtd. in Ford 16). 
               </note> In his essay, Thelwall refutes two anonymous writers who deny that our
               natural environment has any influence on our intellectual or emotional identity.
               Thelwall rejects their claims, saying that if we did not immediately see their
               denials as “Affectation” we would pronounce them to be “the verbiage of idiotism”
               (74). Neglecting the importance of scenery to our internal state is “idiotism”
               according to Thelwall because it denies “the whole doctrine of associations” and
               turns a human being into 
            <quote>a sort of abstract entity whose ideas are all innate and independent of perception;
               and whose senses are mere superfluous appendages, not ministers to his intellectual
               perfectibility: a sort of filigree on the outside of a tea caddee, that neither
               contributes to the flavour nor the preservation of the aromatic luxury within. (74) </quote>
            Unlike the filigree, or decorative work, on the outside of a tea caddy, which plays
               no part in keeping tea fresh, the senses are instead like the material of the caddy
               itself, which contributes to the flavor of the tea. The metaphor is not perfect:
               whereas the caddy isolates the tea from external influence, the senses do the exact
               opposite, allowing exterior images and scenes to enter into, impress, and change the
               mind. Yet, despite the imperfection of the metaphor, it nonetheless sheds light on
               Thelwall’s model of mind and its connection to his political theory. In Thelwall’s
               image of the mind-as-tea-caddy, perceptions associate thoughts and, through
               progressive influence, lead a person toward (or away from) what he calls
               “intellectual perfectibility” (“On the Influence” 74). Whereas Wordsworth famously
               illustrated the integration of mind and nature by tracing “the manner in which we
               associate ideas in a state of excitement” (597), Thelwall used associationism to
               provide philosophical evidence that lived conditions and intercourse with others
               influenced how citizens experienced their world and, in turn, influenced their
               ability to contribute to that world. </p>
                  <p> It is fitting that Thelwall, who sought to explain vitality itself according to “the
               simple principle of materialism,” would imagine the mind as a tangible object
                  and,<hi/>moreover, as an object of commerce (<emph>Animal Vitality</emph>
               13). By taking the “necessary luxury” of tea as his image, Thelwall universalizes
               what would normally be a private possession.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                  Here, I am referencing the title of Fromer’s book.</note> Thelwall suggests that
               though the mind, like tea, is a material object, it is not a commodity and does not
               gain value when locked against external influence.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                  In 1833, Thomas Wontner warned his readers that caddies should be locked to
                     protect tea from being stolen by servants (704). Caddies often had locks for
                     expressly this purpose.
               </note> On the contrary, he suggests that intellectual perfectibility is only
               possible when there is associative communication between the permeable borders of
               mind and world. </p>
                  <p> In his elocutionary treatises, Thelwall similarly represents the minds of those with
               speech defects as imperfect because of their impermeability. In both cases, mental
               associations are “ministers to . . . intellectual perfectibility” and, as such, can
               either create or inhibit a relationship between the body of the individual and the
               body politic (“On the Influence” 74). A speech defect occurs, Thelwall posits, when
               the mind cannot associate the intention to speak with the physical organs that
               produce speech. Those who want to talk simply cannot. Unlike many physicians of the
               time, Thelwall vehemently denies that “defects of organization have any thing to do
               with any of the various descriptions of Impediment” in speech (<title level="m">Henry
                  Cline</title> 54). Rather, Thelwall blames speech impediments on a “diseased
               association” of ideas brought on by miseducation or emotional trauma (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 59). By proposing that speech pathology originates
               in the space between ideas, or in the mental action connecting ideas, Thelwall can
               also propose that such pathology requires educational, rather than medical,
               intervention. While this theory helped Thelwall market his services as a teacher of
               elocution, it also helped him to suggest that impediments to speech were also
               impediments to sociability, and ultimately, to participation in the public sphere. </p>
                  <p> The gravest consequence of speech impediments, for Thelwall, was the enforced
               antisociality that they caused. In his case study of a young woman with a severe
               speech defect, Thelwall’s goal was not to teach her to speak properly but to “rescue
               her from the misery of being in eternal solitude, even in the midst of society” (64).
               According to Thelwall, speech impediments were necessarily restrictive to sociality
               for two reasons. Not only did they keep a person from being able to speak, but they
               also impaired a person’s willingness to speak.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                   For another view on Thelwall’s theory of speech pathology, see Langan.
               </note> Both prevented individuals from developing bonds with society. Thelwall went
               so far as to call speech impediment a kind of idiocy, a term used in the period for a
               variety of mental disorders that interfered with sociality. In his letter to Cline,
               Thelwall exclaimed: “What, but a species of idiotcy [sic], is it, to be ignorant of the
               means by which the will is to influence the simplest organs of volition, and (without
               excuse of palsy, stricture, or organic privation) to be unable to move a lip, a
               tongue, or a jaw?” (68). It is telling that Thelwall chose to call all individuals
               with speech defects “idiots” (Gk. “private person”), as the private, or isolated,
               “idiot” was necessarily excluded from the public sphere.<hi/>As Avital Ronell
               explains, from Plutarch through the nineteenth century, “the term ‘idiot’ expresses
               social and political inferiority; it is not a certificate of citizenship—the idiot is
               the one who is not a citizen (<emph>politēs</emph>)” (41).<hi/>Without
               the ability to associate the will to speak with the organs of speech, individuals
               with speech defects could not exercise their natural right of participatory
               citizenship. This right, Thelwall declared, “constitutes the essential attribute of
               our species” (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 17). One of the major tenets of
               Thelwall’s political philosophy was that “man is, by his very nature, social and
               communicative” and “whatever presses men together . . . is favorable to the diffusion
               of knowledge and ultimately promotive of human liberty” (<emph>Rights of
                  Nature</emph> 400).<hi/>For Thelwall, individuals who could not communicate
               with others were unnaturally denied social freedom. To put it simply,<hi/>impediments to speech were also impediments to liberty. </p>
                  <p> Thelwall described the process by which the teacher of elocution could cure the
               antisociality of his pupils and encourage them to rejoin society as follows:
            <quote>restore, or produce those essential links of association, between the physical
               perception and the mental volition, and between the mental volition and the organic
               action, which either have some how been broken, or have never properly been
               formed—and the stammerer, the stutterer, the throttler, the endless reiterator, and
               almost the whole order of unfortunate persons, whose impediments consist in
               obstructed utterance, are relieved from their affliction: no matter what were the
               original circumstances that broke, or interrupted those associations . . . . (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 58)</quote>
            However, Thelwall advised that in order to repair a pupil’s associative capacity, the
               teacher first had to “impress the [pupil’s] perceptive faculty” by appealing to her
               “imagination” (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 58-59). In his case studies,
               Thelwall accomplished this by making his pupils verbally request the things they
               desired. Too often, Thelwall explained, a child with a speech defect would have her
               needs predicted and met without having to open her mouth. The harmful consequence of
               this was that she never learned to regard intelligible speech as a useful means of
               satisfying her desires, and as a result, often avoided speaking at all. The teacher’s
               first task, then, was to compel the pupil to communicate. To do so, Thelwall used
               “attractive object[s]” to awaken the pupil’s imagination and “impress” her perception
               by forcefully directing her attention to objects in the world (115). For example, if
               a pupil liked to gather honey, Thelwall required her to make her goal known to others
               before she would be allowed to travel to the beehive. She had to be prevented from
               using “the mute effort of solitary ingenuity” to meet her goal (124). Rather, her
               goal had to be “socially presented, as a motive for some proper species of exertion”
               (124). Thelwall believed that by exerting themselves in social interaction, pupils
               would be forced to unite objects of perception (such as honeycombs) with ideas of
               those objects and, eventually, with intelligible signifiers for those ideas. Thelwall
               maintained that if a pupil could consciously make links between perception and will
               through speech (however imperfect) she would also unconsciously create or repair
               associations in the brain. With re-formed associations, the pupil would then be able
                  to<hi/>associate the will and the body. She would be able to connect her
               desire to move her jaw with the muscles that moved her jaw and, thus, produce more
               perfect speech. Here, as in the example of the tea caddy, Thelwall used
               associationism to explain how perception of the external world influenced the will,
               which, in turn, bound the individual to the world.<hi/>

                  <p> In attempting to strengthen the power of mental associations in his pupils, Thelwall
               was in a sense continuing his earlier efforts to strengthen the power of reformist
               associations. In <emph>Animal Vitality</emph>, Thelwall revealed the physiological
               basis of his associationist philosophy. Most notably, he established a materialist
               model of the mind that made it synonymous with the brain. As Alan Richardson has
               shown, the 1790s, like the 1990s, were “a decade of the brain,” in which models of
               the mind were revised in response to materialist advances in medicine and philosophy
               (2). The 1790s saw Joseph Priestley popularize David Hartley’s physiological
               associationism (1790), Erasmus Darwin theorize the embodied mind in
                  <emph>Zoonomia</emph> (1794‑96), and Luigi Galvani publish his initial theory of
               animal electricity (1791). Thelwall was well aware of these major developments in
               brain‑mind science and evidenced this awareness in his writings.</p>
                  <p> One of Thelwall’s central goals in <emph>Animal Vitality</emph> was to disprove John
               Hunter’s theory that blood is the source of life. Instead, Thelwall asked his
               colleagues to consider that the “life of the animal is in the brain, rather than in
               the blood” (15). Although Thelwall indicated the primacy of the brain as an organ
               that registered vitality, he made it clear he did not want to “rob the blood of its
               vital honours, to bestow them on the Brain and Nerves” (29). Rather, Thelwall
               contended, vitality issued from integrated bodily organization motivated by a
               stimulus and identified the stimulus as the “electric fluid” (41). In suggesting that
               the electric fluid stimulated life, but was not itself living, Thelwall likely
               followed Erasmus Darwin, of whose work he was clearly aware.<note resp="editors" place="foot"> In a 1795 political lecture, Thelwall praised “the sublime
                  projects of Dr. Darwin” (<emph>Tribune</emph> 114). He also discussed Darwin’s
                  theory of life with Coleridge (<emph>Letters</emph> 1: 294). </note>
                     <hi/>In his medical treatise <emph>Zoonomia</emph>, Darwin claimed that “the
               electric fluid may act only as a more potent stimulus exciting the muscular fibres
               into action, and not supplying them with a new quantity of the spirit of life”
               (1.12.83). For Darwin, the word “stimulus” referred not only to the “application of
               external bodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres . . . [but also to] desire
               or aversion when they excite into action the power of volition; and lastly, the
               fibrous contractions which precede association” (1.2.13). The electric fluid induced
               both muscular contraction and mental association. As Darwin put it, just as
               successive muscular contractions are associated with one another, ideas “are
               associated with many other trains and tribes of ideas” through excitation of the
               fibrous tissue in the body induced by the electric fluid (1.9.60). Thelwall seems to
               have agreed that the electric fluid was responsible for super-inducing absent
               associations or repairing broken ones.<hi/>In his elocutionary texts, he
               stressed “the phenomena of the action and re‑action of the physical and mental
               causes—and the operation, in particular, of mental, moral, and educational stimuli
               upon the frame and fibre—the senses and the organic function” (<emph>Results of
                  Experience </emph>172). For the most part, the educational stimuli chosen by
               Thelwall was his own speech. Like the electric fluid, his speech was meant to excite
               the body of his listener into creating new associations. Because Thelwall claimed
               that “the individual body and the social body do exactly agree,” it is reasonable to
               conclude that he understood the speech of the political activist, like the speech of
               the elocutionary master, as a vital stimulus (<emph>Tribune</emph> 114).</p>
                  <p> Indeed, much the same model of mind surfaces in Thelwall’s political rhetoric. Just
               as the voice of the teacher of elocution re-formed associations in the minds of his
               listeners, the voice of the political orator reformed how his listeners associated
               with one another. As Nicholas Roe, Michael Scrivener, and others have noted, Thelwall
               used his medical knowledge to create particularly effective Jacobin analogies between
               a vital, organized human body and a vital, organized body politic.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                   See Scrivener, Roe 173-81, Allard 63-86, and Jackson 44-58. 
               </note> To this I would add that it is the logic of associationist psychology that
               informs these analogies and makes them viable. In <emph>The Natural and
                  Constitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and
                  Freedom of Association </emph>(1795) Thelwall takes up the question of social
               association itself. Here, Thelwall argues for free association between citizens as
               the only means by which the power of the body politic can fairly counter the power of
               the king. Thelwall explains:
            <quote>For as the Royal Power is concentrated in a single person, girt and surrounded by
               Ministers of his own appointment; and as the aristocratic body is also intimately
               encorporated, if the people are not permitted to <emph>associate</emph> and
                  <emph>knit themselves together</emph> for the vindication of their
               rights, how shall they frustrate attempts which will inevitably be made against their
               liberties? The scattered million, however unanimous in feeling, is but chaff in the
               whirlwind. It must be <emph>pressed together</emph> to have any weight.
               Deny them the right of <emph>association</emph>, and a handful of powerful
               individuals, united by the common ties of interest, and grasping the wealth of the
               Nation, may easily persevere in projects hostile to the wishes, and ruinous to the
               interests of mankind . . . . (46, emphasis added) </quote>
            In this passage, Thelwall opposes the body of the King to the body of the people; the
               King’s power is consolidated in one physical body, and the power of the aristocracy
               is similarly “encorporated.” The people, however, lack such incorporation. As a
               consequence, Thelwall maintains, they must be given the freedom to associate in order
               to have the weight of a healthy body that can confront the power of the king man to
               man, as it were. James Robert Allard connects this passage to a similar passage in
                  <emph>Rights of Nature </emph>to suggest that, “Thelwall again implies that <emph>organization</emph>, ‘press[ing] men together’ is necessary for reform”
               (72, emphasis added), However, it is clear here that<hi/>what presses men
               together is <emph>association</emph> rather than <emph>organization</emph>. Though “organization” and “association” can be used
               interchangeably as nouns to mean “a body of people with a particular purpose”
               (“Organization,” def. 4a), as we saw in <emph>Animal Vitality</emph>, “organization”
               for Thelwall means the arrangement of elements within a larger system, such as organs
               in the body. But by “association,” as it is developed here and in the elocutionary
                  texts,<hi/>Thelwall likely means the <emph>act</emph> of people
               coming together to form a group with a common purpose. That is, only when citizens
               are allowed to gather together in the same space can they achieve what Georgina Green
               calls “embodied communication” (80). Although distinguishing between arrangement and
               act may seem like a minor point, it allows us to differentiate between the material
               structure of a system and the stimulus that joins together the elements of that
               system, allows communication between them, and thus vitalizes the whole.<hi/>For
               Thelwall, it is not so much the structure that vitalizes the state, but the dynamic
               connections between people within that structure. As in the body, these dynamic
               connections are figured as material associations and, as we will see, the stimulus is
               figured as electricity. With the passage of the Seditious Meetings Act (which
               prohibited public meetings of over 50 people), associations became “diseased” and the
               speech of the citizens as “one heart, one voice, one sentiment” became as defective
               and antisocial as that of the individuals Thelwall would later treat (“Peaceful
               Discussion” 226). </p>
                  <p> The cure for the diseased associations of society, as for the diseased associations
               of the individual, was the intervention of a political teacher who could communicate
               the electric stimulus to his listeners. Noel Jackson persuasively suggests that, for
               Thelwall, the stimulus or electric spark that animates the state and keeps it vital
               is the printed press. As evidence, Jackson cites Thelwall’s development of Burke’s
               metaphor of the press as an electrical conductor.<hi/>Burke regretted that the
               press encouraged middle-class ambition by carrying “electrick communication”
               throughout pre-revolutionary France (186). But Thelwall esteemed “that prompt
               conductor and disseminator of intellect, the press,” for the same reason
                  (<emph>Rights of Nature</emph> 426). Moreover, Thelwall represented himself, and
               the press, as the instruments through which “electrick communication” traveled.
               Although Thelwall thought the printed word was important for associating people, he
               also made it clear that the press had limited efficacy when people were “scattered”
               throughout Britain and not allowed to gather in the same space (<emph>Natural
                  Right</emph> 46). Thelwall cautioned that without the ability to publicly
               associate and, as a group, determine a course of action, people would be driven to
               form factions and exchange violent crime for peaceful protest. Without “<emph>public association,</emph>” Thelwall warned, 
               there would be “<emph>private cabals</emph>” (<emph>Natural Right</emph> 46). Without the
               ability to speak with a collective voice, individuals would brood “over thoughts they
               dare not utter” (<emph>Natural Right</emph> 46). When Thelwall used his lectures to
               rouse “a sluggish and insensate people” from a “drowsy stupor, creeping over the
               frozen nerve of misery,” then, he did not so much suggest that the materiality of the
               printed word educated people by acting on their bodies, but rather that the spoken
               word carried a material current that allowed electricity to move freely from body to
               body (<emph>Rights of Nature</emph> 391). As in his account of a 1795 political
               lecture where “every sentence darted from breast to breast with electric contagion” (qtd. in C. Thelwall 367),
               Thelwall represented his sentences as electric because they associated word to
               thought and speaker to listener. Like the electric fluid
               acting on the animal body, the electric word sustained vitality by catalyzing
               associations in the body politic. This vital transmission was only possible when
               people were allowed to come together in the same space to speak and to hear others
               speak.</p>
                  <p> As an orator, Thelwall intervened between his listeners’ perceptions and their wills
               in order to reform the associations of the state’s diseased body. As a teacher of
               elocution, he extended his reformist associationism. Far from being the dumb orator
               Crabbe mocked, Thelwall instead continued to encourage free speech and defeat
               antisociality. Antisociality, which could stem from “regret, repining melancholy, and
               dissatisfaction,” impeded reform because the “man who considers himself as an
               isolated individual . . . [becomes] barren to himself and injurious, or at least
               unproductive, to society” (<emph>Tribune</emph> 224-5). This antisociality, Thelwall
               claimed, was a by-product of “the selfish system” of an increasingly capitalist
               economy and was only exacerbated by the prohibition against public meetings
                  (<emph>Tribune</emph> 224). Like those restricted from speaking because of
               governmental legislation, those with speech impediments suffered from “diseased
               associations” that hindered them from contributing to public discourse (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 59). As Michael Scrivener has shown, for Thelwall,
               “mind is not individualistic but a product of ‘associated intellect’ within the
               public sphere” (181). Thus, once we understand Thelwall’s material model of mind, we
               see that ministering to the speech defects of others was a political act. As a
               teacher of elocution and as a political activist, Thelwall was pursuing a common end:
               strengthening the associations of the minds that inhabited, and created, the public
               sphere. </p>

               <p>John Thelwall was, for E. P. Thompson, one of the most remarkable figures and
               “considerable theorists” of the British reform movement in the 1790s (<title level="m">Making</title> 172-73). But Thompson asserts that Thelwall’s
               achievements were not sustained in the sequel to the metropolitan radical phase of
               his career, in which between 1798 and 1801 he published a series of articles in the
                  <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>,<emph/>“A Pedestrian Excursion
               through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer of 1797” and “The
               Phenomena of the Wye, During the Winter of 1797-8.” For Thompson, Thelwall’s
               “Pedestrian Excursion” “is unremarkable, being largely devoted to conventional
               rehearsals of the ‘romantic and picturesque’” (“Hunting” 105). Thompson criticises
               Thelwall’s apparent failure to sustain the progressive social and political tenets of
               his earlier publications and lectures, reading the pedestrian tour as evidence of the
               “success” of attempts by the authorities to “drive” Thelwall “out of the reform
               business” (104). Thelwall’s love of the “romantic and picturesque” is, for Thompson,
               incompatible with his political activism, which demands interaction and co-operation,
               rather than detached contemplation. This essay will reassess the grounds of
               Thompson’s censure, and will argue that Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque
               should be read not as a retreat from political engagement but as an attempt to
               rethink and recalibrate such engagement in the face of extreme pressure. Thelwall’s
               treatment of the picturesque demonstrates his sustained if evolving dedication
                  to<hi/>his reformist principles. It also reveals the under-acknowledged ways
               in which Thelwall adapts and modifies aesthetic conventions in order to temper their
               political implications. </p>
               <p> Eighteenth-century aesthetic modes do generate certain reactionary political
               effects. Thompson’s critique of Thelwall echoes critical censure of the damaging
               results of aesthetic spectatorship. John Barrell and Ann Bermingham have argued that
               the aesthetic observer tends to mimic the position of a privileged landowner who
               disdains active intervention in the lives of the poor (Barrell, <title level="m">Dark</title> 70-76, <title level="m">Pandora</title> 96-98; Bermingham
                  68-69).<note resp="editors" place="foot">This condemnation has been revised
                  by critics who argue for the indeterminate, playful quality of the picturesque
                  (Michasiw 76-100; Jarvis 54; de Bolla 119-20).</note> Elizabeth Bohls notes that
               such spectatorship produces a “powerful abstracting impulse” which reinforces a
               “symbolic connection between material particulars and groups of people traditionally
               thought of as trapped in them, defined by their bodies, as opposed to their minds:
               the labouring classes and women” (13). The focus of Thelwall’s political activism
               during the mid-1790s had been the broadening of the intellectual franchise and the
               diffusion of knowledge to such groups, and his early scientific training had armed
               him with a sophisticated sense of the importance of material analyses of physical and
               political structures (<title level="m">Tribune</title> 102). Thelwall’s engagement
               with aesthetic forms appears to work against his own political practice. </p>
               <p> Michael Scrivener has recently defended Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” against
               Thompson’s charges, asserting that Thelwall’s frustration with the working people he
               encounters is a direct result of the political pressures under which he was
               struggling, which the text of the “Pedestrian Excursion” carefully suppresses
               (74-75). Scrivener argues that the essay is not restricted to accounts of the
               picturesque, but rather offers detailed analysis of the effects of agricultural
               monopoly and war on the condition of the poor. But in order to argue for this
               politically engaged Thelwall, Scrivener plays down the significance of his use of
               aesthetic conventions in the “Pedestrian Excursion,” noting that though it “has a
               minor aesthetic connoisseur dimension, the essay’s most distinctive feature is its
               sociological focus” (77). Thelwall’s landscape description is presented as a
               digression from rather than a component of the “sociological” work of the essay, and
               Scrivener does not engage with the reactionary implications of the picturesque
               itself.</p>
               <p>However, Thelwall’s exploration of the “romantic and picturesque” does not represent
               a marker of his disillusionment with political activism, but rather arms him with a
               new means of articulating his social and political goals of intellectual enquiry and
               sympathetic co-operation. Long before his excursion of 1797 Thelwall had explored in
               print whether aesthetic contemplation and political activism could prove productive
               partners. <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, Thelwall’s novel, travel
               narrative and reformist tract, published at the outset of his political career in
               1793, makes repeated use of visual conventions. However, <title level="m">The
                  Peripatetic</title>’s radically mixed mode does not lend itself to sustained
               engagement with aesthetic tropes, and the passages in which Thelwall evokes the
               picturesque are characterised by an ironic tone. Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion”
               and “Phenomena of the Wye” engage in more detail with the picturesque; however, they
               are no mere “conventional rehearsals” of the discourse. In these essays Thelwall
               demonstrates a sophisticated appropriation of and deviation from aesthetic
               conventions to suit his political aims. As Judith Thompson has suggested, Thelwall
               challenges the distinction between an aesthetic and a sociological approach to
               landscape by emphasising the material basis of both (“Citizen” 79). For Thelwall the
               ideal viewing consciousness is never a disembodied, abstracting entity, but rather
               one which maintains a material connection with the landscape of which it forms a
                  part.<note resp="editors" place="foot">As Lamb and Wagner suggest, an
                  interesting comparison piece to Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” is Mary
                  Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and
                     Denmark</title> (15). Bohls describes how Wollstonecraft unsettles standard
                  aesthetic viewpoints and “works toward a corporeally and political situated mode
                  of perception” (142, 152).</note> His ongoing engagement with the picturesque
               demonstrates his gradual steps to overcoming the abstracting effects of aesthetic
               contemplation and toward synthesising the representation of landscape with his
               political activism.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>In the preface to <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, Thelwall declares his
                  “design of uniting the different advantages of the novel, the sentimental journal,
                  and the miscellaneous collection of essays and poetical effusions” (72). Despite
                  the heterogeneous form of the work, structural coherence is conferred through the
                  walking tours which Thelwall’s protagonist Sylvanus Theophrastus undertakes to
                  Saint Albans in Hertfordshire, and to Rochester in Kent. So, like Thelwall’s
                  essays for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>, <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title> describes the practice of “pedestrian excursion” (115).
                  Sylvanus states the advantages of such excursions, declaring that he and his
                  companion will “compare our remarks on such monuments of antiquity, and such
                  picturesque benefits of art and nature, as the road, or its environs might
                  present” (115). But Thelwall differentiates the pedestrian excursions undertaken
                  in <title level="m">The Peripatetic </title>from the practice of picturesque
                  tourism set out in the publications of William Gilpin: “It was not to be a mere
                  excursion of pleasure: for nothing is, in general, more delusive or insipid.
                  Information and improvement were to constitute the principle feature of our
                  expedition” (115). Though sensitive to its “benefits,” <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title> maintains a sceptical attitude to aesthetic tourism;
                  therefore, the aesthetic value of landscape is rarely considered in isolation.
                  Sylvanus admits that his “observations” on the beauties he encounters “may perhaps
                  be neither very original nor profound,” but he insists on their social value,
                  generated by and recorded in “those conversations, that . . . stole the miles so
                  imperceptibly away” (115). For Thelwall, pedestrian travel should be the occasion
                  not for isolated spectatorship, but for conversation and interaction, prompting
                  both individual and collective “information and improvement.” As Judith Thompson
                  notes, Thelwall’s commitment to “friendly converse” is reflected in the “dialogic
                  form” of <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, in which contrasting discourses
                  are juxtaposed and combined to create an “intergeneric” conversational mode
                  (Introduction 38-39, 41).</p>
                  <p> Thelwall’s “intergeneric” discursive method ensures that though <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> makes many references to the picturesque, the
                  descriptions that follow are rarely purely aesthetic. Rather, Thelwall adopts a
                  topographical approach, describing the historical, economic and agricultural
                  condition of the landscape, though, as Thompson notes, <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title> appropriates this discourse to “reorient” the reader’s
                  political preconceptions (Introduction 33). Descriptions of picturesque scenes at
                  Greenwich, Shooter’s Hill and Rochester thus digress swiftly to the “historical
                  allusions” or “flights of fancy” that they prompt (99, 162-64, 257-74). In several
                  episodes Sylvanus praises gothic ruins for their picturesque effect, but these
                  ruins are not pure “objects of art” as Gilpin would have it (<title level="m">Essays</title> 46). Instead they are physical reminders of the “instability of
                  grandeur” as well as relics of “ancient political institutions” (158, 199). The
                  ruins of Rochester castle “mingle” different effects to produce “one grotesque
                  picture of sylvan nature, of horticulture, and antiquities” (260). The aesthetic
                  effects of the ruins are inseparable from the intellectual stimulus prompted by
                  the castle’s antiquarian significance, and the social effects of the horticulture
                  practiced in its grounds. The picturesque is merely one component of the political
                  “information” to be derived from the peripatetic tour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> does not seek a comfortable synthesis of
                  such diverse responses to visual scenes. Immediately after praising “the
                  picturesque varieties of a British horizon,” Sylvanus notes that “the scene is
                  changed; and the topographer must, for a while, take the place of the sentimental
                  admirer of picturesque beauty” (142). So sudden are the changes of “scene” in
                     <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> that they often serve an ironic
                  function, undercutting Sylvanus’s rhapsodic response to visual landscapes (151).
                  The enjoyment of visual scenes in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> is
                  never a simple “pleasure.” Thelwall’s mixed mode generates ironic juxtapositions
                  which undercut the assumed authority of the aesthetic observer, and question
                  whether visual observation alone can stimulate “information and improvement.”</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>’s sceptical attitude to aesthetic
                  observation complicates those scenes which come closest to the conventions of the
                  picturesque tour. Sylvanus’s descriptions never generate the authority of a
                  commentator such as Gilpin. Rather, an ironic distance between Sylvanus’s voice
                  and Thelwall’s authorial presence is implied. At Shooter’s Hill Sylvanus praises
                  the “picturesque beauties” around him, but he actually describes a “prospect of
                  the widening Thames, the rich champaign, the villages and villas which lay before
                  me” (163). Thelwall is perhaps amusing himself at Sylvanus’s lack of aesthetic
                  connoisseurship here. But Sylvanus’s failure to distinguish between the
                  conventions of the prospect view and the picturesque has significant political
                  consequences. As Barrell has shown, the metaphor of the prospect was a means
                  through which an eighteenth-century gentleman could demonstrate his suitability
                  for a life of public virtue (Barrell, <title level="m">Pandora</title> 52; Labbe
                  xi-xii). Though a culturally powerful viewing position, the prospect view is
                  anathema to Thelwall’s participatory political agenda. The “bird’s eye prospect”
                  eradicates all specificity from the landscape, which compromises the activist
                  strain of <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> (<title level="m">Peripatetic</title> 150, 163). At times Sylvanus seems aware of the damaging
                  effects of the prospect view, and posits the picturesque as a more wholesome
                  alternative, declaring: “Let us turn, then, from this overgrown Metropolis, its
                  spreading streets and rising palaces; the trophies . . . of public misery and
                  oppression; and contemplate the picturesque home scenery with which this garden of
                  a heath abounds” (153). The intimate scale of a picturesque scene and its focus on
                  material objects mitigates the abstracting effect of the prospect. But the fact
                  that Sylvanus often fails to distinguish between these two discourses signals the
                  dangerous effects of such spectatorship. </p>
                  <p>Despite its defence of the picturesque over the prospect view on political
                  grounds, <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> demonstrates clear suspicion of
                  the abstracting effects of all aesthetic tropes. Reformist sentiments are
                  articulated through the adoption of the mixed mode signalled in Thelwall’s
                  preface, rather than through a treatment of the aesthetic in isolation. Though the
                  picturesque has the potential to represent the interests of the humblest members
                  of society, Thelwall demonstrates the dangers of aestheticising the lives of any
                  group. He takes gypsies as his example, perhaps because Gilpin had asserted their
                  picturesque effect (<title level="m">Observations</title> II 44, 46). Thelwall
                  appears to agree when he notes that for “a hunter of the picturesque,” gypsies
                  “contribute, in no small degree, to the embellishment of rural scenery” (196). But
                  he interrogates this statement over a course of digressions which end with
                  Sylvanus’s recollection of encountering another group of gypsies. Sylvanus
                  declares an aesthetic appreciation of “the yellow misty light that gleamed over
                  the southern horizon,” but when describing the gypsies themselves, adopts a
                  vocabulary of social configuration: “I saw . . . the cheerful family of vagrants
                  sitting on the grass, around their crackling fire, and enjoying their repast, and
                  to me unintelligible conversation; with their rude, lowly tents in the rear . . .
                  and the patient 'mute companions of their toils' grazing in social familiarity by
                  their sides” (208). These people do not merely “embellish” the scene; indeed,
                  Thelwall rejects aesthetic appreciation altogether. The scene includes “none of
                  that marvellous novelty necessary to fix the demure, half-vacant eye of reverend
                     <emph>Gravity</emph>” (208-09). For Thelwall these “vulgar objects” do not
                  elicit aesthetic admiration but stimulate “a concatenation of ideas” encompassing
                  imaginative engagement, antiquarian investigation and social and political
                  activism (209). Thelwall rejects the distancing effect of the aesthetic gaze and
                  instead asserts the gypsies’ historic bonds with societies from which they are now
                  ostracised. Aesthetic “pleasure” is dismissed as Thelwall reiterates his aim of
                  promoting “information and improvement” in order to better the lives of
                  marginalised groups.</p>
                  <p> Despite <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>’s repeated engagement with the
                  picturesque, the models of political and social improvement that Thelwall
                  advocates often reject visual forms altogether. Thelwall is adamant that visual
                  scenes alone are not sufficient to prompt the sympathetic sociability that enables
                  social improvement (121). An important lyric declaring lavish admiration of the
                  natural landscape ends with the assertion that “nor all the pleasures of the
                  ravish’d sight, / Like <emph>friendly Converse</emph> wake the raptur’d glow!”
                  (115-16). Such “converse” is the stimulus for a material investigation of the
                  physical and by extension the social and political landscape, which does not rely
                  on the abstracting forms of visual observation but incorporates different “ways of
                  seeing” (Jarvis 44). Thelwall’s political activism and his training in physiology
                  provide the basis for his exploration of modes of vision which challenge the
                  distance between the observer and the landscape. Thelwall declares in a political
                  lecture delivered the year after the publication of <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title> that “This is a season for inquiry and instruction, not for
                  pastime and jocularity; and it is therefore that I . . . stimulate you to enquire
                  into the nature of your rights as Britons and as men; and to investigate the
                  nature and causes of that unhappiness which we cannot but feel too sensibly”
                     (<title level="m">Political</title> 2). <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title>, too, demands a material engagement with the conditions of
                  social life. In a “Digression for the Anatomists,” which draws on Thelwall’s
                  physiological training, though enquiry is prompted by the splendours of nature,
                  “the scientific eye” reveals “wider fields of wisdom and delight” than those
                  presented by the aesthetic gaze (146).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Several episodes in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> which begin with
                     the contemplation of the visual landscape end with Thelwall advocating an
                     alternative “scientific view” (226-27).</note>
                     <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> reveals the limitations of the “pleasure”
                  of picturesque tourism. Rather than celebrating the picturesque in isolation,
                  Thelwall suggests that it should form part of a multifaceted critical
                  investigation of the landscape. <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> posits
                  the kind of material critique that Bohls finds in the work of Mary Wollstonecraft,
                  which establishes a “connection between aesthetic practices and the material,
                  social, and political conditions of human experience” (9). However, <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, structured by ironic juxtaposition and
                  shifts of “scene,” has no interest in synthesising its diverse elements. As a
                  result <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> tends to regard aesthetic effects
                  as limited and potentially deceptive. The picturesque does not yet have a positive
                  political function in Thelwall’s work.</p>

                  <p>“A Pedestrian Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the
                  Summer of 1797” describes a walking tour from London to the West Country, which
                  Thelwall undertook during the summer in which his metropolitan radical career
                  seemed finally to have been crushed (Scrivener 74-75). The “Pedestrian Excursion”
                  is undoubtedly a politically engaged text, but one in which Thelwall adapts his
                  methods to a new form, the picturesque tour. In doing so, he imbues that form with
                  renewed political significance. In contrast to the mixed mode of <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” is a sustained
                  interrogation of the picturesque which seeks to find a means to reconcile and even
                  integrate an analysis of visual forms with his political activism. While <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> makes only glancing allusions to Gilpin’s
                  work, the “Pedestrian Excursion” develops a self-conscious response to the
                  strictures of the picturesque, making reference not only to Gilpin’s schema, but
                  also those of the picturesque’s arch-theorists, Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale
                     Price.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Thelwall investigates the power
                     of the picturesque to elicit “curiosity,” an important term for Price and Payne
                     Knight.</note> Thelwall declares himself one of the “pedestrian hunters of the
                  picturesque and sentimental,” but the picturesque is no mere fashionable object of
                  scorn (52). Rather, the opening of the “Pedestrian Excursion” suggests a function
                  for picturesque tourism which seems to achieve a synthesis between political and
                  aesthetic concerns. Thelwall notes that “circumstances [have] produced another
                  species of curiosity well calculated to go hand in hand with a passion for the
                  picturesque and romantic. Every fact connected with the history and actual
                  condition of the laborious classes had become important to a heart throbbing with
                  anxiety for the welfare of the human race” (17). The physiologically situated
                  fellow feeling urged in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> recurs here, but
                  Thelwall now aligns it with “a passion for the picturesque.” In contrast with the
                  distrust of the abstracting effects of spectatorship in <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title>, the “Pedestrian Excursion” advocates the appreciation of
                  landscape as a means of generating sociability. </p>
                  <p> The “Pedestrian Excursion” develops <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>’s
                  suggestion that the picturesque should be valorised over the prospect view, adding
                  a technical rigour to those conjectures. At East Knoyle in Wiltshire, Thelwall and
                  his companion are conducted to a “commanding eminence” from which “we commanded
                  one of the most pleasant views I had ever seen.” Thelwall praises the hills which
                  “dimly descried through mists, bounded the prospect and mingled with the horizon”
                  (44-45). But this “bird’s-eye prospect” cannot compare to that which follows when
                  the travellers descend from the hilltop and indulge in “the enjoyment of the
                  picturesque, and the beauty and fertility of the home-scene, in the lowlands, with
                  their embowered and scattered cottages” (45). The “home-scene” of the picturesque
                  is valued for its humble, inclusive qualities. Thelwall emphasises this point in
                  an earlier episode which praises “the solemn grandeur and shady sequestration of
                  [the] descending path” from the summit at Richmond Hill: “That pomp of scenery,
                  that expanse and publicity of prospect . . . fascinate, indeed the occasional
                  observer: but in the picturesque of nature, as in the intercourses of life, it is
                  principally in the lowly vales and shades of sober sequestration we must seek the
                  pleasures that cloy not on repetition” (18-19). Thelwall’s enthusiasm for the
                  occluded viewpoint of “lowly vales” echoes Gilpin and his successors (Gilpin,
                     <title level="m">Observations</title> 186; Price 33; Knight 30). However, his
                  alignment of “the picturesque of nature” with the social “intercourses of life” is
                  original (18-19). Thelwall uses landscape description to support his assertion
                  that the social “pleasures which cloy not on repetition” must be cherished and
                  protected from the destructive effects of political and economic monopoly. </p>
                  <p>Thelwall’s preference for the picturesque over the prospect view is not merely a
                  marker of an unrealised social ideal, but forms part of his critique of actual
                  institutions. His speaker describes the “scene of fertility” visible from the road
                  from Shepperton, and notes that “from every eminence the mansions of opulence
                  overlook the prospect with exultation. But man, aggregate man, seems little
                  benefitted by this abundance . . . everything has the appearance of that
                  desolating monopoly which makes fertility itself a desert” (20). Thelwall
                  demonstrates that this “prospect” is not only myopic but deliberately
                  exploitative. He demands that the observer instead adopt the perspective of “man,
                  aggregate man” and engage with the material particularities of social
                     existence.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Several critics note the
                     political implications of detail in landscape description (Bohls 13, Labbe
                     38).</note> Thelwall’s call for the recognition of “aggregate man” enlists
                  aesthetic description for a democratic cause, echoing as it does the rhetoric of
                  his 1796 tract <title level="m">The Rights of Nature</title>, in which the
                  “aggregate reason” of obscure individuals establishes a common interest, and forms
                  the basis of civil society (459-60). </p>
                  <p>However, the “Pedestrian Excursion” also suggests an alteration in Thelwall’s
                  social and political objects since the high water mark of his metropolitan
                  radicalism. The term to which Thelwall returns again and again when advocating
                  picturesque “intercourses of life” is “sequestration.” This echoes the opening of
                  the “Pedestrian Excursion” in which Thelwall reveals the object of his journey to
                  be an “immediate and intimate communication of sentiment” with his friend Samuel
                  Taylor Coleridge in Somerset (17). Thelwall’s poem “Lines Written at Bridgwater,”
                  written just after his abortive stay with Coleridge during the tour described in
                  the “Pedestrian Excursion,” demonstrates the endurance of this ideal: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Commentators have emphasised a lyric turn in the “Pedestrian
                  Excursion” which expresses Thelwall’s understandable desire for retreat in the
                  face of harassment (Jarvis 35-36; Scrivener 76). However, it is important to
                  scrutinise any critical narrative which, like E. P. Thompson’s, polarises
                  Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque and his political activism. Another
                  poem dating from the summer of 1797 “On Leaving the Bottoms of Gloucestershire”
                  asserts that “sequester’d musings” must be “tho sylvan, yet not solitary” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 136). Even in rural “sequestration,” Thelwall’s social
                  ideal and the basis of his political commitment is “converse,” which enables
                  “Culture and the Arts” and “social decoration” (136). But this community is too
                  secluded, untouched by “Factory” or associated commercial “Opulence” (137).
                  Thelwall’s preference for “sequestration” in “Pedestrian Excursion,” as in the
                  poems written during that summer, does not nullify the text’s political
                  engagement, but does complicate that engagement. Though Thelwall declares a
                  universal social sympathy as his political aim, the picturesque generates
                  intimate, rather than inclusive social relations.</p>
                  <p> In certain episodes, the “Pedestrian Excursion” articulates a fully-formed
                  account of sympathetic sociability prompted by the picturesque landscape, but not
                  alienated by the distancing effect of the aesthetic gaze. Passing through a
                  village on the edge of Salisbury Plain, Thelwall’s speaker views a “range of
                  villages scattered along the valley, that opens in a long perspective to the
                  right.” He notes that “the hour was favourable to the emotions these objects were
                  calculated to inspire . . . the light was softened, and the shadows were
                  lengthening: circumstances that cherish a pensive serenity, and pre-dispose the
                  heart to the social sympathies of our nature” (39). The picturesque scene itself
                  awakens “social sympathies” in the travellers, but this state is not sustained.
                  Thelwall’s speaker then bemoans the “jealous caution” of working people he
                  encounters, which deadens any social intercourse (39). Thelwall’s sense of
                  alienation lies at the root of Thompson’s objections to the “Pedestrian
                  Excursion.” However, Thompson separates Thelwall’s treatment of the picturesque
                  from his political activities too starkly. Thelwall’s engagement with the
                  picturesque in the “Pedestrian Excursion” is itself a political move prompted by
                  the inequalities and hostility that he meets on his tour. But though Thelwall
                  finds the picturesque an effective means of articulating protest in the face of
                  political adversity, the “Pedestrian Excursion” struggles to articulate how it
                  might contribute to widespread political amelioration. </p>

                  <p>“The Phenomena of the Wye, During the Winter of 1797-8” continues and develops
                  Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque. Thelwall wrote the essay after the
                  completion of his pedestrian tour of summer 1797 but it appeared in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> before the “Pedestrian Excursion.” Since the
                  publication of Gilpin’s <title level="m">Observations on the River Wye</title>
                  (1789), the Wye Valley had “acquired a due celebrity” as a picturesque tourist
                  destination, as Thelwall acknowledges in “The Phenomena of the Wye” (3). But
                  Thelwall clearly distinguishes his account from that of Gilpin. Thelwall writes
                  not as a tourist but as a resident of the Wye Valley, having moved with his family
                  to a riverside farm at Llyswen in Breconshire during the autumn of 1797. In his
                  memoir of 1801, Thelwall declares that the chief reason for “the election of this
                  spot” was “the wild and picturesque scenery of the neighbourhood” (<title level="m">Poems</title> xxxv). Thelwall’s memoir presents Llyswen as the
                  realisation of the secluded “retreat” to which the “Pedestrian Excursion” seems at
                  times to gesture, a place in which “the agitations of political feeling might be
                  cradled to forgetfulness” (xxxvi). But “The Phenomena of the Wye” presents a very
                  different account of the picturesque at Llyswen, which complicates this narrative.
                  Thelwall’s speaker is not an isolated spectator of the landscape, but rather a
                  situated, embodied participant in the scenes that surround him. As a result of
                  this material engagement with the landscape, Thelwall adopts a new vocabulary in
                  his treatment of the picturesque. </p>
                  <p>Thelwall’s speaker rejects the touring seasons of summer and autumn to recount the
                  beauties of the Wye in winter, and in doing so offers a novel account of the
                  picturesque. Thelwall’s focus is not the surfaces and shades of the landscape, but
                  rather its “anatomy,” revealed in “the leafless grove, the dismantled hill, nay,
                  the very gloom of night itself, when nothing is discernible but the mere outline
                  of surrounding mountains” (3). Such anatomical observation “is as essential to the
                  landscape painter, as that of the human form to the historical branch of the art”
                  (3). Thelwall’s “Digression for the Anatomists” in <title level="m">The
                     Peripatetic</title> had declared that the anatomical insights of the
                  “scientific eye” were vital even for “the elegant votary of the polite arts,”
                  namely portrait and historical painting (146). But here for the first time
                  Thelwall connects anatomical study with the analysis of landscape. In contrast to
                  Gilpin, who makes human figures decorative appendages to the landscape, Thelwall
                  asserts that the landscape can only be understood through analogy with the
                  investigation of the “human form.” The material analysis of physical forms
                  suggests a means of overcoming the gulf between Thelwall’s political aims and the
                  abstracting conventions of aesthetic contemplation. What this formal comparison
                  lacks is a sense of the social exchange fundamental to Thelwall’s political aims. </p>
                  <p> Thelwall suggests the means to make analysis of the picturesque a socially and
                  politically engaged phenomenon in the next passage of the “Phenomena of the Wye,”
                  which sustains his assertion that the appreciation of landscape is informed by the
                  material analysis of physical forms, but also suggests that social configurations
                  might be understood in the same way. The “bold and prominent” features of the Wye
                  valley are particularly suited to examination during winter because:
                     <quote>Scenery of this description may be compared to those superior orders of
                     shape and feature which constitute the perfection of the human form; in which
                     transparent tints and the most perfect symmetry are graces of inferior
                     magnitude, and beauty itself is the smaller part of loveliness—where the
                     whole countenance beams expression, every feature has its animation and
                     character, every line is descriptive of some kind or elevated passion, and
                     every glance, every gesture, every motion is eloquent of sympathy and
                     intelligence. (4)</quote> This passage begins with a comparison between the
                  form of the landscape and that of the human figure. But the landscape changes from
                  a static object of contemplation to an active, co-responding companion. Thelwall
                  employs a vocabulary of reciprocal exchange of energy and emotions that echoes his
                  most engaged political lecturing.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See for
                     example Thelwall’s lecture of 6 November 1795 (<title level="j">Tribune</title>
                     327).</note> Vitally, it not only recalls Thelwall’s investigations of
                  alternate “ways of seeing” in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>, but also
                  anticipates his engagement with a related form of material “inquiry” in his
                  elocutionary practice of the next decade. In his 1805 tract <title level="m">An
                     Introductory Discourse on the Nature and Objects of Elocutionary
                     Science</title> Thelwall notes that language must be incorporated into the
                  body’s physical expression: “Language alone is not sufficient: nature’s epitome,
                  like nature’s self, must sympathize through every element: motion and look and
                  attitude must manifest the inspiration of genuine feeling; and every portion of
                  the frame must be vital with expressive eloquence” (24). The “Phenomena of the
                  Wye” sustains and develops Thelwall’s critique of visual forms dating back to
                     <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>. But here Thelwall demonstrates that a
                  formal appreciation of landscape is not separable from other kinds of material
                  analysis, of physiological, social, or political forms, and even suggests that the
                  aesthetic might encourage the conditions for political engagement rather than
                  isolated abstraction.<note resp="editors" place="foot">I am sympathetic to
                     Terry Eagleton’s assertion that the later eighteenth century is a moment at
                     which the material particularity of aesthetic forms enables a “dangerously
                     radical” “ideal of compassionate community” (60).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the close to this passage Thelwall demonstrates that such inclusive forms of
                  investigation can assimilate the distinct discourses of aesthetic contemplation
                  and social and political activism: “Such are the forms that owe not their
                  attraction to the wardrobe—the charms that never cloy—that fade not
                  even in the winter of old age—the sublime of human nature!” (4). Here
                  landscape description and social interaction are so profoundly synthesised as to
                  be inseparable. Thelwall echoes his assertion in the “Pedestrian Excursion” that
                  picturesque “sequestration” produces “pleasures that cloy not on repetition.” But
                  despite the sheltered location of his “little cottage,” Thelwall’s speaker in the
                  “Phenomena of the Wye” does not demand seclusion (5). In contrast to the often
                  isolated protagonist of the “Pedestrian Excursion,” Thelwall’s speaker exchanges
                  stories with “my predecessor in this little farm” (5). As Scrivener notes, the
                  “grand” natural phenomena that the speaker witnesses are discussed in terms of
                  their effects on the social and economic conditions in the valley (Scrivener 82;
                  “Wye” 6-7). Through the language of material analysis and sympathetic social
                  engagement, Thelwall ensures that the “romantic and picturesque” scenes of the Wye
                  do not represent pure “retreat” but rather gesture forward to Thelwall’s renewed
                  engagement in public life in the next decade.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <quote>Unto Us a Son Is Born who looks more like a fine boy of a year and a half than
                  one of a half an hour old. You have now therefore another brother whom I hope to
                  see you in the course of the next month nursing. My dear Cecil has had an
                  excellent good time of it and appears likely to do very well—Eliza is
                  weeping for joy; and her dear affectionate heart makes her think it the most
                  wonderfully lovely babe that ever was born—I will leave it to others, when
                  they can find time, to tell you what sort of an old fool I am–</quote>
               </epigraph>
               <p> Thus a delighted John Thelwall wrote to his daughter Sara, on August 4, 1831, on the
               birth of his son Weymouth Birkbeck, who seems almost to have attempted to catch up
               with his father before he was an hour old.<note resp="editors" place="foot">I
                  would like to thank Judith Thompson for sending me a transcript of this letter and
                  for the invaluable help she has given me during the preparation of this article.
               </note> As if fated to live at the same breathless, belated pace, Weymouth went on to
               recapitulate his father’s eccentric career and talents, inheriting his gift of
               oratory, realizing his thwarted artistic and theatrical ambitions, and setting forth
               on even more bizarre adventures in amorous, peripatetic and scientific discovery. His
               very life span ironically mirrors the forty-six years preceding his birth that
               had taken John Thelwall from an abandoned career in law to his trial for treason in
               1794, and to the brink of success in realising his long deferred political hopes in
               the Great Reform Bill of 1832. Forty-six years years later the new life so joyfully announced in 1831 was to end in an unmarked “white
               man’s grave,” archetypal symbol of the folly of imperialist ambitions that the elder
               Thelwall had rejected, along with the often bigoted religious institutions that
               partly inspired them.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For a comprehensive
                  account of the role of missionaries in the formation of the Empire, see Cox. On
                  Thelwall’s anti-imperialism, see the chapter “Against Empire” in Scrivener
                  233-56.</note> Victim of his own romantic radical inheritance, Weymouth Thelwall
               was swallowed by the heart of darkness it led him into.</p>
               <p>Sixty-seven years old at Weymouth’s birth, John Thelwall may have felt himself an
               “old fool,” but he was still an enthusiastic political agitator and orator. In the
               letter announcing the birth, he informs Sara that “alternations of public exertions,
               a little tuition and much propensity to enjoy the long forbidden charm of quiet
               study” have preoccupied him over the previous weeks. Those public exertions included
               his work as a leader of the St. Mary le Bone and St. Pancras parish committee, in
               support of the Political Union of the Working Classes (Place sec. 23). The following
               October he was to play an important role in the successful organisation of a huge
               procession of the union’s members, involving tens of thousands of disaffected
               supporters of the first Reform Bill from all the parishes in London who marched
               through the city in protest at its defeat by the House of Lords (Place sec. 23). One
               of the reforms Thelwall had supported as early as 1795, the religious and political
               emancipation of Irish Catholics,<note resp="editors" place="foot">See, for

               through the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Bill of 1829, though it was bitterly
               contested by other denominations and Irish protestants. Here the personal and the
               political were once more to meet in John Thelwall’s life and affect the lives of the
               son whose nativity he heralds and of his Catholic mother Cecil, whose father had been
                  Irish.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Patrick Boyle, who died in 1808, was

               <p>The religious toleration that had always marked the work of John Thelwall (catholic
               in the sense of liberal and broad-minded) would shape the lives of his sons in very
               different ways. Though there is little evidence that he ever converted, his marriage
               to Henrietta Cecil Boyle in 1817 indicates a softening in his earlier staunch
                  atheism.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Two unattributed blank verse

                  they were likely composed) experienced a “movement towards grace” as he grew
                  older.</note> Perhaps in deference to her religious freedom, the wedding at St.

               first marriage: Algernon Sydney, John Hampden, Manon Roland, Sara Maria and Edwin
               Northumbrian. His eldest sons, both of whom went on to take orders in the Anglican
               Church, show very different sides of the “Thelwall” personality. In 1831 Hampden had
               just begun a life of rural “poverty and seclusion personified” as the charitable
               Rector of Oving in Buckinghamshire (Kelly 181); his older brother Algernon was a
               militant evangelist who had recently returned from trying to convert the Jews of
               Amsterdam. While Hampden’s quiet social conscience found an outlet in supplying the
               poor lace-makers of his village with materials and markets, and teaching their
               children to read (Kelly 181),<note resp="editors" place="foot">Hampden sought
                  the support of his father’s old friend Birkbeck in this endeavour. </note>
               Algernon’s outspoken activism expressed itself in polemical tracts against Catholics
               and almost any dissenting Church that did not acknowledge the Trinity. As paid
               secretary of the Trinitarian Bible Society (TBS) formed in 1831, he engaged in a
               pamphlet war against the editor of <title level="m">The Christian Observer,</title> a
               supporter of the long-established British and Foreign Bible Society—a battle of words
               which rivalled any his father had fought. Even years after John Thelwall’s death his
               opponents were still calling his respectability in doubt. Algernon summons up the
               ghost of his own father by calling his well-known antagonist’s anonymity a
               “questionable shape”—a borrowing from <title level="m">Hamlet</title> that his
               father had used in his arguments against Burke (<title level="m">Statement

               “fatherly authority” in not having bishops on its committee but having as its paid
               secretary “a son of John Thelwall” (50, 16).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Samuel Charles Wilkes, the editor of the <title level="m">Christian</title>

                  pamphlet.</note> Curiously, the President of the TBS was the judge Thomas Erskine,
               son of the very barrister who had so ably defended John Thelwall at his trial in
               1794. One of the main charges against Algernon was that he spent more of the
               subscribers’ money on polemical pamphlets than on printing Bibles for the lost souls
               of Britain. The implied objection to him, however, was quite obviously that he was
               simply “a son of John Thelwall.”<note resp="editors" place="foot">That “a son

               <p>Growing up in the Church that his stepbrother so fiercely attacked, Weymouth
               Thelwall’s nature combined Algernon’s restlessness and Hampden’s practicality with
               the many-minded creativity of their common sire. Only three years old when his father
               died, he and his mother were left almost destitute, dependent upon Hampden and other
               relatives and friends.<note resp="editors" place="foot">The novelist Barbara

               Catholics, who were still excluded from Oxford and Cambridge, could get into London
               University or the Civil Service.</p>
               <p>The little we know of Weymouth’s schooldays comes from the drama critic Percy
               Hetherington Fitzgerald in his <title level="m">Stonyhurst Memories; or, Six Years at
                  School </title>(1895). He was one of only a half-dozen boys Fitzgerald considered
               worth noting as “characters.” Like his father, Weymouth was a good actor, an
               accomplished artist, and something of a democratic orator: <quote>And what odd types
                  there were! Such was Thelwall, son of the great Radical agitator and elocutionist,
                  the friend of Charles Lamb. There was a son of Thelwall’s “speaker” and I must say
                  he inherited the parental gift and could declaim with great tragic feeling. I
                  remember his spending weeks carving a Roman head on a piece of stone with a
                  penknife, and a clever performance it was. (Fitzgerald 41)</quote> More ominously
               in the light of later events, Weymouth was also the “money taker” for bets made on
               the students’ cricket matches, one of which was the cause of a rift between
               Fitzgerald and Thelwall when a school-wide political feud was running based on
               divisions of loyalty during the land league agitation.</p>
               <p>Upon his departure from Stonyhurst in 1847-48, Weymouth Thelwall immediately joined
               the Foreign Office. In 1859, whilst working as a clerk in the War Office, he married
               Marian Wrather, firstly in a Catholic and then in an Anglican Church; and a daughter,
               Edith Fanny Thelwall, was born in 1862.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Edith
                  died unmarried in Kensington in 1942.</note> By October 1864, though, Weymouth had
               declared himself bankrupt in his own petition, with debts of between two and three
               thousand pounds owed mostly in bills. This was possibly through gambling, sign of a
               reckless streak that would contribute to Weymouth’s unfortunate fate.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                     <title level="m">The Coursing Calendar</title> for 1864 lists a Mr. Thelwall as

                  (131, 171).</note> After he promised he would pay his creditors whatever remained
               above £200 of his £375 salary, including his annual increase, the judge accepted this
               “very creditable” offer and made an order of discharge (“Court of Bankruptcy” 9). He
               is cited as living in Keppel Terrace, Windsor, at this time.<note resp="editors" place="foot">According to a report of bankruptcies in <title level="m">The

               bankrupt there was little possibility that he could remain in the civil service
               without the support of his superior officers, and it is likely that he had been
               dismissed, leaving him with no means of support for his wife and child.</p>
               <p>Weymouth’s misfortunes were compounded by the death of his mother, announced in
                  <title level="m">The Gentleman’s Magazine</title> in 1865: <quote>At Windsor in
                  great distress, Mrs Thelwall, widow of John Thelwall, so well known for the part
                  he took in the political struggles at the end of the last century, and who was
                  tried for high treason and acquitted. (“Deaths” 529)</quote> Her death occurred in
               February, just two months after Weymouth’s bankruptcy hearing, in a squalid little
               backstreet, Grove Place, where the cost of unfurnished rooms was in the order of four
               shillings a week. This was a huge step down for the beautiful and talented woman who
               had once welcomed London literati to Thelwall’s gracious house in Lincoln’s Inn
               Fields, boasting “a capital grand piano,” fine paintings and prints, a library of
               over six thousand books and quality mahogany furniture, all of which, along with the
               valuable lease, had been put up for auction in 1820 (“Sales” 4). Cecil’s death
               certificate, signed by Weymouth, states that she died “of general decay,” which
               perhaps makes her obituary an indictment of those who had declined to offer a pension
               to John Thelwall in later life, when the fruits of the reform movement’s early
               struggles were beginning to be enjoyed by those who had often resisted them,
               including those who had caused Weymouth to be dismissed.<note resp="editors" place="foot">I quote this from a certified copy of Cecil Thelwall’s entry

               <p>Yet with the rakish resilience of Thelwall’s genius, Incubus, in his play <title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake, </title>Weymouth emulated his father’s capacity
               for regeneration through vocational (and amorous) reinvention. In 1871, the former
               war-office clerk reappeared in London as a landscape artist, aged forty, living in
               Westminster; and, according to the census record, his “wife” was a woman called
               Helena, birthplace not known, twenty-four years old and a dancer.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See the entry for “Weymouth B. Thelwall” in the Census Returns
                  of England and Wales, 1871. </note> It is uncanny how Weymouth’s mid-life
               behaviour mirrored that of his father. At the age of forty-two, John Thelwall had
               returned to London after an eight-year exile, having transformed himself from a
               political lecturer into an elocutionist; and ten years later he too took up with a
               much younger woman, an actress (though, unlike his son, John waited until his first
               wife was dead before he remarried). As a painter of landscapes, Weymouth resurrected
               the thwarted ambitions of his father, gaining success, respect and even a measure of
               fame thereby, for his water colours were exhibited at the Royal Academy, and he even
               appeared at court, where he presented “drawings and sketches” of Norway to the Queen
               in 1873 (“Court Circular” 5). He also shared the theatricality which was so strong a
               feature of John Thelwall’s personality and oeuvre, as is shown by the fact that he
               was granted a patent in 1872 on a “theatrical monster device.” Such “colossal and
               other figures of men, monsters, and animals, for stage purposes” were popular in the
               pantomimes and spectacular shows of the period (Rees and Wilmore 25-26). Weymouth’s
               might almost have been intended for <title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake</title>,
               as evidenced in the play’s spectacular premiere in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in October
               2009.

               <hi>”&gt;</hi> --></p>
               <p> But it was not only in his amorous, artistic and theatrical passions that Weymouth
               revived the spirit of his father. During this same period, he travelled in Norway and
               contributed notes to the Norwegian Tourist Club, giving details of an intrepid trek
               across a glacial valley in extremely harsh weather, and an account of a visit to the
               Voring waterfall (“Notes and Suggestions” 104-06). Here the son of the Peripatetic
               has succeeded the youthful actor, and the painter of words also begins to flourish.
               His description of the valley, reached only after an heroic attempt to overcome the
               dangers of a hostile environment, recalls the mix of touristic sublime and
               socio-scientific pragmatism that characterized his father’s groundbreaking pedestrian
               excursions: <quote>The beauties of this magnificent foss are now by no means
                  appreciated, as visitors are obliged to rush at it from Viig, reaching it tired
                  and taking the chance of seeing it at its best or its worst according to the mercy
                  of the weather or the guides. I saw it with a 3/4 rainbow spanning the whole mist
                  filled chasm, and nothing could exceed its poetic grandeur. The payments &amp;c.
                  for guides ought also to be regulated . . . . (105-06)</quote> Like his father’s
               mock-heroic Peripatetic dangling from cliff tops and battlements, Weymouth presents
               himself as a bold and occasionally reckless adventurer rather than merely a tourist,
               then undercuts his heroism by drawing attention to his failures (his ascent of the
               Justedal Glacier was left unfinished because he forgot to wear nailed boots). He also
               makes practical “suggestions” for “improvements” for the benefit of tourists, such as
               chiselled-out footholds, stepping stones, and cromlech-style route markers
               (107-08).</p>
               <p> While Weymouth was in Norway, back in London Helena danced, touring much of England
               with her troupe of “Hungarian” dancers and receiving good reviews. The reason that
               this is known is rather surprising. There is a fine leather-bound folio in the
               Foreign Office archives containing over forty pages of correspondence on the <title level="m">Case of Mr Thelwall and Miss Fielding, alias Girofle. </title>It
               includes a note written hastily on the back of an advertising flier with newspaper
               reviews, in reply to the British Vice Consul in Moscow, where Helena had been
               performing at the Theatre Bouffe as part of the Moscow Trade Fair. The nature of
               Helena’s performances is partly elucidated by the racy account of the dancing of
               “Mademoiselle Froufrou,” published in H. A. Munro Johnstone’s <title level="m">A Trip
                  up the Volga to the Fair </title>

                  <title level="m">Novgorod.</title> Johnstone refers to the fair’s “amusements” as a
               “Saturnalia” and describes the riotous behaviour of the theatre’s cosmopolitan
               audience of merchants in a manner which would certainly have raised alarm bells for
               Weymouth Thelwall <title level="m">if</title> it were not already known to him
               (108-09). But he seems to have had plans afoot for an adventurous journey of his
               own.</p>
               <p> Weymouth had written to the Foreign Office in September 1875, extremely worried
               about his “niece, Miss Helen Fielding” <quote>who was taken to Moscow by a Mr Becker
                  of whom I have not heard very pleasing accounts. I know her to be entirely without
                  money and therefore request that a telegram be sent to ask the Vice Consul to
                  ascertain her whereabouts and her safety and asking the assistance of the foreign
                  office in paying for her passage home and those of her troupe as may need it. (At
                  my expense of course). <note resp="editors" place="foot">See the letter of
                     Sept. 21, 1875, in <title level="m">Case</title>.</note>
                  </quote> In due course a telegram and letters flew between Moscow and Nizhniy
               Novgorod, between Lord Derby and his senior civil servants, and between the said
               Helena and a special agent who was sent from Moscow to “find her out.” She refused to
               return to England as she had found “engagements for the Winter,” but two of her
               troupe wished to do so, and she said she would be obliged if they could be
               repatriated under the distressed British subjects scheme. The problem was that
               Weymouth objected to paying for the (obviously delighted) agent sent to accompany
               these “helpless girls” on their perilous winter journey to the coast, and despite the
               Vice Consul’s protests he did not pay. Eventually a court order for prosecution
               issued from the Treasury and an agreement was reached in which he promised payment of
               the £61 by a bill drawn on the proprietor of the<title level="m"> Illustrated London
                  News </title>on the basis of commissions for drawings he was to send from Lake
               Nyassa in Central Africa, “should I survive the journey.” <note resp="editors" place="foot">See the letter of May 22, 1876, in <title level="m">Case</title>.</note>

               <p>In the “Helena Fielding” affair and its African aftermath, we see the complicated
               conjunction of international trade and travel, colonial bureaucracy, artistic
               entrepreneurship and sheer, stubborn recklessness that would shape the final chapter
               in the curious life of Weymouth Thelwall. Though now an additional motive for his
               African journey was to pay for Helena’s expenses, he seems to have had the trip in
               mind for some time, possibly inspired in part by the heroic example of David
               Livingstone, whose immensely popular travels, themselves displaying the same mix of
               commercial and cultural enterprise, had ended with his death in 1873, followed by a
               huge state funeral at Westminster Abbey (Ross 247). In addition to his contract with
               the <title level="m">Illustrated London News</title>, Weymouth twice sought support
               from the Royal Geographical Society (where Livingstone had lain in state), banking on
               his reputation as an artist, but also stressing the philanthropic and scientific
               object of his journey (and name-dropping to imply he had contacts in high places):

               just received a letter from Captain Burton, <quote>by which I see I may meet him at
                  Zanzibar and have the advantage of his council and experience. <note resp="editors" place="foot">See W. B. Thelwall’s letter to Sir Harry
                     Rawlinson of Dec. 15, 1875. </note>
                  </quote> To see a son of John Thelwall associating himself with Morton Stanley (the
               journalist who had done so much to create Livingstone’s heroic reputation) and
               Richard Burton (the heroic but rakish scholar-explorer who captivated the Victorian
               imagination while challenging Victorian pieties), underlines the connection between
               the romantic idealism of the early nineteenth century and the colonial and commercial
               explorations and exploitations to which it gave birth. Just as Stanley gravitated to
               Livingstone, so Thelwall intends to “succour” Stanley, one in a long line of
               peripatetic journalist-adventurers belatedly following in the footsteps of
               charismatic father/brother-figures, whose quest leads them into the moral quagmire of
               ambitions, expectations, opportunities, and disillusionments that was colonial
               Africa. </p>
               <p> The line between the Romantic peripatetic and the Victorian explorer is deepened by
               the curious coincidence that among the groups whose support Weymouth sought for his
               African adventure were Scottish dissenters whose mission was built on the same
               progressive educational foundations that John Thelwall had helped lay. Weymouth wrote
               to the Livingstonia committee of the Free Church of Scotland, which with the support
               of several wealthy Glasgow industrialists had established their first Livingstonia
               mission station at Lake Nyassa in 1875, in honour of Livingstone’s dream of educating
               and converting the African tribes he encountered, and of eradicating slavery by
               setting up “industrial” educational missions. In this endeavour, Livingstone drew on
               his own background as a working-class boy whose self-education was capped by his
               studies at Anderson’s College in Glasgow (Ross 11-13). Founded in 1796, this
               institution was the home of George Birkbeck’s famous mechanics’ classes of 1800-04,
               which after 1823 grew into the mechanics’ institute movement that did so much to
               shape the British system of colonial education and industry (Kelly 26-36). This was
               the very institution that John Thelwall visited in 1804, where he and Birkbeck
               discussed the “operations and cooperations” that led to the founding of his own
               Institute (Letter to Anderson). Indeed, Thelwall’s lifelong friendship with Birkbeck
               is honoured in the middle name of his son. Thus in his very identity, Weymouth
               embodies the principles that Victorian colonialism inherited from Romantic
               radicalism. </p>
               <p> Weymouth’s letters to the Livingstonia Committee also show the complex and morally
               ambivalent geopolitical realities, commercial interests and religious tensions in
               which this idealistic and progressive effort was tangled. For in one letter he
               proposes “to bring 20 sniders [rifles] with me, and to form a well armed little
               party, as fast as I can find trustworthy men,” adding that he has been a very
               “zealous Sergeant of volunteers, having gone through the Hythe course, and hold[s] a
               certificate of qualification as Sergeant instructor of musketry.” Moreover, he is not
               “without hope that the presence of a Roman Catholic well accredited by his own
               ecclesiastical superiors may have a valuable effect on the Portuguese there, as
               showing the united earnestness of all Britain in this business” (<title level="m">Correspondence</title> 131). The “business” was the eradication of the slave
               trade, still dominating the local economy and culture of central Africa, by the
               introduction of “honest” trade in ivory, and the creation of cotton plantations; but
               it was equally the business of men like James Stevenson, the Glasgow industrialist
               who bankrolled much of it, and was seeking new sources of trade and the opening up of
               mineral resources to his company in a territory controlled by the Portuguese.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See McCracken 222. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Thelwall got the answer he was looking for from the Livingstonia Committee; urged to
               join a reinforcement party travelling to the Cape, he gladly agreed, eager to
               “acquaint himself with all the members of the party” and to “share equitably in all
               expenses of transport etc. up to the arrival at the Nyassa Station” (<title level="m">Correspondence</title> 131). He drafted a letter of introduction, which the
               committee agreed to endorse, stating that without taking any responsibility for the
               acts of an independent traveller, “they are of the opinion that my journey will be of
               valuable assistance to the object they have in view, and that they will therefore be
               glad that I shall receive all the support that I can legitimately secure” (<title level="m">Correspondence </title>138). Having now had his passage paid and letters
               of introduction to suppliers provided, he planned to finance the rest of his trip by
               accepting commissions, and sent the committee a sample advertisement flier aimed at
               collectors and lovers of the fine arts, claiming that several titled dignitaries had
               already contributed, among them Lady Rothschild (<title level="m">Correspondence</title> 138). There is, as yet, no confirmation of how many
               commissions Weymouth received or executed, but given the glow that Livingstone’s
               celebrity cast over the entire decade, it is likely that a good home market existed
               for the products of Thelwall’s African enterprise.</p>
               <p> Weymouth Thelwall sailed from London on the <title level="m">Windsor Castle</title>
               in May 1876, heading for the heart of Central Africa amidst the well-reported
               excitement of adventure and missionary zeal which the expedition aroused, and with
               the rapturous good wishes extended to the party in England and Scotland supplemented
               by press reports which were picked up by colonial newspapers from Sydney to Cape
                  Town.<note resp="editors" place="foot">The progress of the expedition was
                  regularly reported in the national and local press, as well as colonial papers
                  such as <title level="m">The Sydney Herald</title> and <title level="m">The Cape
                     Town Argos</title>. </note> But he had been in Africa for only six months when
               ominous cracks began to appear in the façade of cooperation between the independent
               artist-adventurer and the industrious missionaries. James Stewart, the founder of
               Livingstonia, complained that Thelwall had bought goods in Port Elizabeth using “the
               same worthless bills” that Thelwall’s original correspondent on the committee,
               Alexander Duff, had reported to Stewart in a letter. More damning, he had heard via
               his brother-in-law in England that Thelwall had left his wife and child destitute:
                  <quote>He is an agreeable, plausible man but I fear not a good one . . . . I wish
                  he could be shipped home as if he goes on ordering goods without any means of
                  paying for them he will give the place a bad name. (Stewart, Letter to
                  Duff)</quote> Stewart’s nephew, the civil engineer James Stewart, recorded in his
               published journal for January 1878 that Thelwall’s visit to the Established Church of
               Scotland’s Blantyre Mission in the Shire Highlands had made a bad impression. Stewart
               had been “distinctly told not to trust him.” According to Stewart, “Thelwall seemed
               dissatisfied about something but made no complaint. He left without saying goodbye”
                  (<title level="m">From Nyassa</title> 49). A short time later Weymouth Thelwall
               was dead. </p>
               <p>Published accounts refer merely to a hunting accident. Thelwall tried to save
               ammunition by finishing off a wounded baboon with his rifle butt. The force of the
               blow, however, discharged the second bullet into his chest. The Livingstonia mission
               journal, however, goes into more detail in a report given by the native porters who
               had been with him. It tells a tale of isolation and probable despair. Whatever funds
               Thelwall had begun with and stores he may have managed to buy initially, he was at
               this stage unable to secure porters, who worked for lengths of calico cloth. He had
               been travelling for about nine days out of the Livingstonia mission, in March 1878,
               when he camped a day’s march from a village: <quote>Further particulars from the men
                  are to the effect that all went well until Mangombi’s village was reached. From
                  that time forward Mr Thelwall appeared in a desponding state of mind. When he
                  rested he buried his face in his hands and generally kept muttering to himself.
                  His appetite seemed to fail him and he subsisted chiefly on native beer and wine.
                  He became less active than formerly seldom rising before ten o’clock. <note resp="editors" place="foot">See the <title level="m">Journal of the
                        Livingstonia Mission</title> for March 26, 1878.</note>
                  </quote> According to the men, he had risen shortly before noon and, not delaying to
               dress (his blood-stained shirt was submitted as evidence), had armed himself and one
               of his men with rifles and another with a fowling piece. They had then set off a
               hundred yards to the foot of a hill to hunt baboons. Reading between the lines, it
               appears that Thelwall may have been lacking stores, and from the account given by the
               two Stewarts it is possible that he was not given much assistance at Blantyre. But
               one must also suspect that Thelwall may have pondered taking his own life. </p>
               <p>After his death, his followers trekked back to “Mponda’s village” on the lake where
               they were given a canoe to return by. They transported Thelwall’s body back there
               during a storm, but were refused permission to bury it until they paid the chief,
               Mponda, with Thelwall’s supplies of gunpowder and wine. He was buried some distance
               from the village (now a town in central Malawi) under a great baobab tree. Robert
               Laws, the leader of Livingstonia, later pulled down a Union Jack marking the grave,
               saying Mponda would use it on one of his raids (Livingstone 133-34). Thus, the last
               direct descendant of John Thelwall lies in an unmarked grave, even further off the
               beaten track of British history than his father’s gravesite in Bath, itself
               long-forgotten until Steve Poole’s recent restoration campaign. It is a far cry from
               the national honours paid to Livingstone, who had profited from the reforms that John
               Thelwall, without recognition, had helped to institute.</p>
               <p> Like his father’s, Thelwall’s fate was in some part sealed by his refusal to conform
               to contemporary pieties and proprieties. None of the missionaries who mention him
               seems to have had a good word for him, and this may have been partly due to his
               Catholicism. Edward Young, the first Livingstonia expeditionary leader and captain of
               the mission’s <title level="m">Illala</title> steamboat, recounts the day they
               engaged five hundred natives to carry the reinforcement party’s goods to the head of
               the rapids in 1876. He ordered silence while they sang a hymn and conducted a service
               together <quote>—save only—must I say it—with one exception; for an
                  individual who had arrived out from England with this missionary detachment of
                  labourers in Christ’s field felt himself debarred by conscientious scruples from
                  doing as we did. (Young 238) </quote> This “individual” was obviously Weymouth,
               but Young cannot even give his name. Like his father, Weymouth is almost erased from
               history. Yet tellingly, the liberty of conscience for which the Thelwall name has
               always stood, lives on in this record.</p>
               <p>There is very little information about what actually did come out of Thelwall’s
               African expedition. There are numerous records of the specimens he sent back:
               butterflies, lizards and plants, including some listed with his name in the
               catalogues of the British Museum and several journals of the time. Some paintings too
               may survive, though it is difficult to know which, if any, of the watercolours that
               anchor his continuing reputation as a minor English artist were among the effects
               sold in the months after his death. Like his father’s, Weymouth’s archive has been
               scattered and lost (and this includes any mementoes of his father’s that he may have
               carried with him). And yet, while neither name, nor goods, nor even an epitaph lives
               on, Weymouth Birkbeck Thelwall may have had a broader influence than we realize, in
               part through his very Catholicism (in both senses of the word). </p>
               <p>While the Scottish missionaries disapproved of his manner and morals, there is some
               evidence that Weymouth Thelwall found friends or at least sympathizers among
               Catholics in Africa. He is mentioned specifically as having influenced the setting-up
               of the first Jesuit missionary station in central Africa after he had “a long
               conversation” with Bishop James Ricards in Cape Town on his way to the Lake Nyassa
               mission station in 1876. Ricards wrote to Father Alfred Weld, another old Stonyhurst
               boy, enthusing about a plan of sending missionary priests to Lake Nyassa, which had
               apparently been Thelwall’s suggestion (Dachs and Rea 17). Likewise Frederick, Baron
               Lugard, gives Thelwall a measure of sympathy in an account written ten years after
               Thelwall’s death, by which time, as one of the few and first Europeans on Lake
               Nyassa, his story must have become part of local history. Lugard probably heard of
               him from Laws, with whom he stayed whilst leading an expeditionary force of natives
               for the newly formed African Lakes Company against Arab slave traders intent on
               driving out the merchants who had settled there. The tone is almost wistful. “On
               Nyassa poor Thelwall shot one [baboon] and was immediately attacked by the drove”
               (Lugard 271). This is not what happened according to the Livingstonia Mission
               journal, but it suggests that the story had already taken on a certain romantic,
               larger-than-life allure. Lugard appears to have had little time for the missionaries
               in general, but he does extol the virtues of Laws, whose kindliness and literary
               tastes are acknowledged. Laws had been absent from Livingstonia for some time when
               Thelwall died, and he heard of his death as he passed Mponda’s village, where Miller,
               one of the station’s Scottish artisans, had gone to see to his remaining goods. As
               they approached on the steamer Miller shouted from the shore, “Thelwall shot himself
               by accident.” Laws then set off for Thelwall’s grave. These “goods,” whatever they
               were, were sold at Livingstonia for fifty-eight pounds, five shillings and five pence
               in 1878, and the money was sent to Thelwall’s widow Marian, who signed a receipt in
               1880 (<title level="m">Correspondence </title>171). </p>
               <p> Re-reading Conrad’s Marlow relating the story of Mr. Kurtz in <title level="m">Heart
                  of Darkness</title>, I was struck by the characteristics which link Weymouth
               Thelwall with Kurtz. He too is a painter, a journalist, a hunter, an idealist with
               “expansive views,” and above all an eloquent speaker. But the overriding attraction
               for the younger Marlow lay in Kurtz’s “<title level="m">imagined”</title> voice. An
               unheard yet famous and powerful voice also links Weymouth Thelwall with his father
               John. “He too could declaim,” says Fitzgerald of his schoolmate at Stonyhurst. In the
               few writings that Weymouth left behind we too can “imagine” a voice, far removed as
               it may be from his father’s fiery oratory, already turned ashen by the belatedness of
               textuality (at least if Hazlitt is to be believed).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Hazlitt contrasts Thelwall’s writing unfavourably with his oratory in “On
                  the Difference Between Writing and Speaking.” </note> John Thelwall’s is always an
               imagined voice, a something missed, and it is this belatedness that Weymouth
               Thelwall, who never really knew his father, had to live with and through. It is this
               legacy, always already lost, that he carried into Africa with him. </p>
               <p>Reading Weymouth’s story and thinking of Conrad’s Kurtz, I was reminded too of
               Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Excursion,</title> and the Pastor’s depiction of a
               brutal and pagan Britain (bk. 9, lines 679-719), which has much in common with
               Marlow’s reference to England as a once “dark place of the earth” in the opening
               paragraphs of <title level="m">Heart of Darkness</title> (33)<title level="m">.
               </title>“He was a seaman but he was a wanderer too,” the frame narrator says, as
               Marlow directs his listeners to <quote>think of a citizen in a toga—perhaps too
                  much dice, you know—coming out here in the train of some prefect, or
                  tax-gatherer, or trader, even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp, march
                  through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery
                  had closed around him. (33) </quote>
                  <title level="m">The Excursion</title> concludes with the colonial zeal of the
               Wanderer’s “discourse,” the same kind of “discourse” that characterises the fatal
               attraction of Kurtz for Marlow and for his Intended, who listens like the unnamed
               “gentle lady” to Wordsworth’s Wanderer: <quote>

               Romanticism’s colonial legacies, we may discover that both Thelwall and Wordsworth
               had more influence than we have ever suspected upon the modernist novelist who draws
               us into to a deeper understanding of that heart of darkness that lurks in all
               “civilized” beings, romantics and radicals alike.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See particularly Thorburn on the influence of Wordsworth<title level="m"/>on Conrad’s work. Thorburn does not refer to <title level="m">The

                  <title level="m">Heart of Darkness</title> was published in 1902, two years before
               Charles Cestre bought John Thelwall’s papers at a Sotheby’s sale. In May 1903,
                  the<title level="m"> New Zealand Tablet</title> published an article that provides
               an apt epitaph for Weymouth Birkbeck Thelwall, and a fitting summary of the
               circuitous route which this essay has taken: <quote>An interesting conversion (says
                  The London “Tablet,” March 28) took place last week. Mrs Thelwall, widow of the
                  well-known water-colour artist, Weymouth Thelwall, was received into the church by
                  the Rev. Father Coventry O.S.M. of the Fulham Priory. Mrs Thelwall is herself a
                  connection of Sir Walter Scott’s family, and her husband was the youngest son of
                  the celebrated John Thelwall, the Reformer, who together with Horne Tooke and
                  Hardy was tried for high treason in 1795. This conversion offers a curious
                  instance of the links of history. John Thelwall, the new convert’s father-in-law,
                  was the friend of Coleridge, Lamb, Hazlitt and Condorcet, and yet here is the
                  daughter in law living and hale at the dawn of the twentieth century. No man, in
                  his time, did more to advance Catholic Emancipation than John Thelwall, and, by a
                  curious coincidence, his son died a Catholic, and his grandchild is a pious
                  Catholic, whose influence has brought her mother into the fold. (“Returning to the
                  Fold”)</quote>

               <p>This essay examines the role of loyalist visual satire in the making and shaping of
               political notoriety during the period 1795-1825. Its subject is John Thelwall, the
               first non-elite English radical to be caricatured with reference to a recognisable
               physiognomy in the 1790s and, by contemporary reputation at least, the most
               influential and politically dangerous of the English Jacobins. It will be argued that
               Thelwall presented loyalist caricature with a particular set of problems. First,
               Thelwall enjoyed a particularly high public profile as a platform orator and lecturer
               in the 1790s, which meant that his face was well enough known to justify
               representation in more precise terms than those customarily used to depict the
               anonymous “Jacobin beast.” Even those that had never seen him might still recognise
               an accurate caricature because at least two engraved portraits and one bust on a
               commemorative conder coin were in circulation by the time of the 1794 Treason Trials
               and these likenesses share many physiognomical features in common. Second, much of
               Thelwall’s notoriety derived from his animated manner and volatility on the platform,
               which, taken together with his relatively small physical stature, offered
               caricaturists a vehicle for attitudinal, rather than simply facial, representation;
               but if Thelwall’s energetic manner was a subject for derogatory satire, it was also,
               conversely, the very thing that made him attractive to audiences. Third, Thelwall’s
               physiognomy was not remotely bestial. As contemporary biographers like John Aiken
               well understood, the heavy facial characteristics of a famously swarthy target like
               Fox, or Pitt, a man who “possessed no advantages of person or physiognomy, the first
               of which was ungraceful, the second repulsive” (200), were far more easily
               exaggerated and lampooned by caricaturists. In Thelwall’s case, the most likely
               effect of the sort of grotesque or sub-human representation commonly afforded in
               caricature to stock Jacobin figures would be personal anonymity rather than
               recognition, while faithful portraiture ran the equally undesirable risk of flattery.
               It will therefore be argued here that strategies are identifiable in the practice of
               James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank by which Thelwall’s physiognomy and bodily energy
               were (differently) negotiated and accommodated within a broadly loyalist discourse,
               although neither artist found the assimilation particularly easy. Only when Thelwall
               announced his retirement from public life and retreated to Llyswen at the end of 1797
               did caricaturists settle upon a common form of unambiguous representation and, from
               this moment on, Thelwall became a cartoon signifier of radical defeat and
               deflation.</p>
               <p>Since most plebeian English Jacobins of the 1790s were unrecognisable to the wider
               public, caricature representations tended to adopt a familiar visual language.
               Jacobins, like Frenchmen, were invariably ragged, ignorant, unkempt, ungainly and
               cowardly with poor complexions, Neanderthal brows and gaping mouths. In both attitude
               and physiognomy, they were unprepossessing. Although the relatively respectable
               reformers Horne Tooke and Joseph Priestley had both been the subject of likeness
               caricatures prior to Thelwall’s rise to prominence in 1794, the only plebeian English
               Jacobin deemed worthy of personal attention between 1792 and 1793 was Tom Paine. But
               Paine was a writer, not an orator, and since most people had no idea what he looked
               like, caricaturists did not trouble themselves with his likeness. Consequently, Paine
               was recognisable in caricature only by his proximity to objects with which he was
               associated, most commonly a copy of <title level="m">Rights of Man</title>, an excise
               book, or a pair of stays.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Paine’s portraiture has been discussed by
                     John Barrell in an unpublished paper, “Portraits and Caricatures of Paine.”
                  </note>
                Besides Thelwall, the London Corresponding Society’s best known public figure
               in 1795 was John Gale Jones, another radical whose fame was dependent upon his
               oratory. But, perhaps because he was not tried for treason in 1794, Jones’s profile
               never appeared on commemorative tokens, and no engraved portrait is known before
               1798. Consequently, when occasional reference was made to him in anti-Jacobin
               caricatures he was no more identifiable from his features than Paine had been. </p>
               <p>The pseudo-science of physiognomy reached the height of its popularity in England at
               precisely the same time that Thelwall was honing his oratorical style and Gillray,
               Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson were fully developing the art of political
               caricature. Johann Caspar Lavater’s <title level="m">Essays on Physiognomy</title>,
               originally published in German some twenty years earlier, were available to English
               readers in twelve versions and in five different translations during the 1790s.
               Lavater’s theories linking the body and the structure of the face to standards of
               morality and intellect were extraordinarily influential, not only among artists and
               their teaching academies, but among popular radicals seeking rational and scientific
               pathways to social and political virtue on the one hand and physiology on the other.
               Thelwall, who had signalled his interest in definitions of vitality by publishing a
               controversial essay on the subject in 1793, was an advocate and so too was Godwin.
               Indeed, the most popular of the 1790s editions of Lavater’s <title level="m">Essays</title> was translated by the playwright Thomas Holcroft, a member of the
               Society for Constitutional Information and, like Thelwall, indicted and committed to
               Newgate for treason in 1794.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Graham 562; Karr 431-33; and Thelwall,
                     “An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality.” </note>
                Nor did the popularisation of Lavater occur in a vacuum. A related attempt to
               “scientifically” measure intelligence and beauty against such material variables as
               head shape, nose length or the depth of the forehead was first published by the
               Dutchman Petrus Camper in 1791, for instance, and then translated for an edited and
               popular English edition in 1794. Camper’s work, moreover, was specifically concerned
               with the replication of these physiological ideas in the arts. Given public
               familiarity with both Thelwall’s physiognomy and his explosive bodily performance,
               caricaturists had every opportunity to adopt a more personal approach in their
               handling of Thelwall than they had deployed against Paine, and every encouragement to
               fully pursue it. As Gillray’s elderly friend, the one-time Tory MP Viscount Bateman,
               would later remind him, “It is in your hands to lower the opposition. Nothing
               mortifies them so much as being ridiculed and exposed in every window” (qtd. in
               Donald 170). However, although the two most prominent print satirists of the period,
               Gillray and Cruikshank, both made use of physiognomical likeness in dealing with
               Thelwall, they addressed the problem of his physical energy in diverging ways.

               <p>Thelwall’s first appearance in caricature is also his best known. Gillray’s <title level="m">Copenhagen House </title>(1795) depicts the mass outdoor LCS meeting of
               12 November 1795 and was published four days after it. Thelwall is not named in the
               print, nor is he identified from speech bubbles or rolls of paper with “lectures”
               written on them, as he would sometimes be in later efforts. But he is clearly
               identifiable from his physiognomy and from what we might term his oratorical
               attitude. Gillray, who had studied physiognomy in the Royal Academy schools, was,
               like any trained artist of the period, well acquainted with the contents of Lavater’s
                  <title level="m">Essays</title>, and in 1798 would make direct reference to them
               in a satire entitled <title level="m">Dublures of Characters or Striking Resemblances
                  of Physiognomy</title>, in which members of the Foxite Opposition were made to
               reveal a series of satanic alter-egos. The association made by Gillray between face,
               expression and body in his depiction of Thelwall for <title level="m">Copenhagen
                  House</title> closely echoed Lavater’s assertion that “the affections of the mind
               should express themselves by the voice, the gestures, but especially by the
               countenance, and man should thus communicate to man his love, his resentment and the
               other emotions of his soul by a language perfectly infallible and universally
               understood” (Lavater 51). Thelwall understood platform performance in these cohesive
               terms too, for as he saw it, it is “uniformity and animation which should give life
               to [these] lectures” (<title level="m">Tribune</title> 3: 137). Only a month before
               the Copenhagen House meeting, he had apologised to an audience when poor health
               inherited from prison forced him, “a shattered feeble remnant of a man” (3:137), to
               deliver lectures reduced to “a statement of facts and principles and the conclusions
               that result from them,” rather than “enter into digressions that would arouse my
               passions and feelings and occasion me to speak with particular warmth and animation”
               (3: 17). Without the uniform engagement of heart and body with mind and voice, he
               feared, a lecture lost its capacity to inspire. This uniform engagement is deeply
               embedded in Gillray’s representation of Thelwall, accentuated by a profound
               separation from both the collective grotesquerie<title level="m"/>of his
               dullard audience and the more prosaic attitudes of the less accomplished orators on
               the other two platforms. While the lowly status of his platform colleagues is
               indicated by their shabby clothing and trades (butcher, dissenting minister and
               barber), Thelwall appears dressed as a gentleman of sorts, elevated materially and
               figuratively from the LCS and its audience, in a greatcoat and a ruffled stock.

               <p>If we are invited to read a degree of irrational anger in the clenching of his fists,
               and uncouthness in the gaping of his mouth, it remains a considerably kinder
               portrayal than the oddly twisted form given to Thomas Erskine, Thelwall’s principal
               defender a year earlier during the Treason Trials, by Isaac Cruikshank in <title level="m">Cool Arguments!!!</title> (1794). Gillray’s Thelwall retains a degree of
               balance and self-possession that Cruikshank’s Erskine has almost lost, the
               barrister’s awkward body satirically betraying the “cool argument” of the title, and
               rendering him in the process considerably more comic than the <title level="m">bête
                  noir</title> of Jacobinism. Thelwall was no stranger to the political dynamics of
               empiricism and distortion in the manufacture of “likeness,” or the delicate balance
               between truth, poetic licence and caricature, and wrote about it at some length. In
               the course of his pedestrian tour from London to the West Country to visit Coleridge
               in 1797, he studied the classical busts at Wilton House and noted discrepancies
               between the recorded features of various Roman heroes and villains and their
               historical reputations. He was fascinated by the conflicting messages suggested by
               Seneca’s “open mouth and the mixture of voluptuousness and intellectual power blended
               in the lines and solid parts of the face” because he regarded Seneca as a genius too
               flawed “to live with the purity of a philosopher.” But two busts of Brutus, whose
               love of liberty and virtue Shakespeare and a great many historians had been so
               careful to record, presented a physiognomy that was “assassination personified.” Here
               was cause for thought. “What shall we say to this? Are the portraits fictitious? Or
               have we been imposed upon by legendary panegyrics?” The latter, he decided, was the
               more likely answer. The politically motivated distortions of history might always be
               exposed by returning to the evidence of the face itself. “Perhaps our admiration of
               Brutus or Cassius may have been carried too far,” he reflected. “For my own part,
               establish the authenticity of the likeness and I will believe the testimony of a
               man’s countenance in preference to his historian” (“Pedestrian” 30-32).

               <p>By the time of the Copenhagen House meeting, Gillray had at least two serious
               portraits of Thelwall upon which to draw, both derived from sketches taken in the
               Tower by Henry Richter, the brother of Thelwall’s co-defendant, John. These two
               engravings are equally careful in their recording of Thelwall’s slim body, long nose,
               strong chin, slight pinching of the brow (both this and the rolled scroll recalling
               classical representations of Demosthenes), thin, fashionably cropped hair cut back
               from the forehead but just over the ears, and an elaborately ruffled stock. It is
               fair to assume that this is a close enough approximation to Thelwall’s actual
               appearance at the age of thirty, and as portraits they correspond quite convincingly
               with the sharp featured bust of Thelwall that appeared on commemorative conder
               tokens at roughly the same time.

             To these we can add John Hazlitt’s portrait in oils, and
               the miniature profile line drawing that accompanied his appearance in <title level="m">Public Characters</title>, both made about six years later when Thelwall
               had “retired” from politics. These various portraits may be read as self-conscious
               attempts to emphasise physical signs, not of oratorical enthusiasm or of reason lost
               but of reason secured. They emphasise the performative element of Thelwall’s public
               persona as transitory and self-controlled, and provide a balance both to the <title level="m">appearance </title>of spasmodic excitability on the platform and to some
               of the crude representations of the diseased and emaciated Jacobin body so
               characteristic of the visual language of loyalism.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For a fuller discussion of radical
                     attitudes to visual propaganda, see Barrell, “Radicalism.”</note>
                Although Gillray made no attempt in this print to miniaturise his subject,
               Thelwall was the first to admit his own “want of figure” and “feeble constitution”
               (“Prefatory” 64), for as we learn from his second wife, Cecil, “his chest was narrow;
               part of his pleura had firmly adhered to his ribs” (Mrs. Thelwall 40). Thomas Noon
               Talfourd regarded Thelwall as “small” and “compact” (298), and the Bow Street Officer
               James Walsh concurred; he was “a little stout man with dark cropt hair,” quite unlike
               the dominant figure in <title level="m">Copenhagen House</title>. This smallness of
               stature did not make him <title level="m">appear</title> feeble, however, for he was
               strongly built and held himself well. Talfourd, in fact, also remembered Thelwall as
               “muscular,” with a body sturdy enough to support “a head denoting indomitable
               resolution, and features deeply furrowed by the ardent workings of the mind” (298). </p>
               <p>The perception of balance between passion and reason was of particular concern for
               public speakers like Thelwall for, as Godwin would have it, every orator was prone to
               “a due mixture of spices and seasoning” in his delivery, since “quiet disquisition
               and mere speculative enquiry will not answer his purpose” (20). Bombastic enthusiasm,
               Godwin feared, led to exaggeration and over-emphasis and risked a counter-productive
               incitement to irrational acts of violence. It is well known that Thelwall challenged
               Godwin over these allegations during the public debates over Pitt’s Gagging Bills in
               1795, and it is clear that Godwin felt his case proven by the intemperate nature of
               Thelwall’s rebuttals, and the “angry temper” that gave rise to them. “It is
               impossible for me to answer the farrago of abusive language you send me,” Godwin
               retorted (Cestre 203-04). Godwin was not alone among Thelwall’s political
               sympathisers in airing his misgivings about the orator’s volcanic temper. Talfourd
               put it this way: “Thelwall spoke boldly and vehemently at a time when indignation was
               thought to be a virtue . . . . [S]peech was, in him, all in all, his delight, his
               profession, his triumph, with little else than passion to inspire or colour it”
               (296). More than once Thelwall intimated that the passions of the heart should not be
               held accountable to the reasonings of the head, but rather the two should be
               Socratically harmonized, though few thought he had achieved it. An inevitable
               consequence of oratorical passion, it was argued in one anti-Jacobin tract, was that
               “the multitude echo the variable will of the demagogue, he wields their dreadful
               caprice and hurls it at whatever opposes his own interests. The multitude is the
               unenlightened part of a Nation; and the multitude is the tool of the demagogue”
                  (<title level="m">Rights of Citizens</title> 116).</p>
               <p>If the representation of Thelwall’s features in Richter and Hazlitt’s portraits was
               intended to invoke a calm and intellectual counterpoint to platform energy, it was
               nevertheless subject to alternative readings by loyalist writers who saw in it less a
               revelation of the self than a concealment. The anti-Jacobin novelist George Walker,
               for example, who used Thelwall undisguisedly as a model for his sinister and
               classically minded democratic orator in <title level="m">The Vagabond</title> (1799),
               considered these same features to reveal “a little dark-complexioned man with a most
               hypocritical countenance and a grin of self-applause mingled with contempt”
                  (79).<note resp="editors" place="foot">The character alludes to ancient Rome
                  as a cipher for England.</note> Physiognomical interpretation was, unsurprisingly,
               of considerable interest to Thelwall, who confirmed his belief in Lavater’s
               strictures on more than one occasion, and took more than a passing interest in the
               facial and cranial peculiarities of his own family. To Peter Crompton of Liverpool he
               assessed his son Algernon in 1798: “I have a thousand Shandean notions about him—the peculiar form of his head, the remarkable cast of his features, and the thousand
               antic forms into which he is every now and then distorting them fill me with many a
               proud and many an anxious thought.” In fact, Thelwall was confident enough of his own
               features to seek comment from Coleridge on a now lost self-portrait, either written
               or drawn in 1796, and the satisfaction with which he regarded the strong lines of his
               own nose and chin may be judged from the rude remarks he would later make about the
               supposed weaknesses of his literary adversary Francis Jeffrey’s.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Coleridge was “interested” in Thelwall’s
                     self description, but confined his response to a series of observations about
                     the inadequacies of his own physiognomy (Letter to Thelwall). Of Jeffrey, whose
                     critical reviews of the <title level="m">Poems</title> of 1801 hugely irritated
                     Thelwall, he wrote, “To all the advantage to be derived from the shortness of
                     his chin, Mr Jeffrey is most certainly entitled, and it may perhaps be of some
                     importance to those whose <title level="m">forwardness</title> is more
                     conspicuous than their <title level="m">understanding</title>, that their
                        <title level="m">chins</title> as well as their <title level="m">noses</title>, should not be over prominent” (<title level="m">Reply</title> 163).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Since Jacobin self-representation was partly to be a balancing act between base
               demagoguery and Demosthenian assertion, Thelwall was careful to embrace and improve
               upon Lavater’s unification of voice, gesture and countenance in the construction of
               his own public self as well as in the advice he later gave to his elocution students.
               There was an important distinction to be made between histrionic excess or the
               “theatrical elocution” of the stage, and the sort of expressive oratory that arose
               from “the <title level="m">harmony</title> of features, voice and action.” Controlled
               gesticulation, moreover, was natural to the “deportment of all persons when excited,”
               a “natural part of eloquence” in fact, and its “habitual restraint the chief cause of
               graceless and extravagant action” (<title level="m">Selections</title>-York 2).
               Thelwall’s students were lectured on physiognomy and encouraged to cultivate facial
               expression as a natural accompaniment to vocal inflection and bodily stance. The
               “fashionable insipidity” of an “inexpressive countenance,” Thelwall told them,
               suggested only a “vacancy of mind” (<title level="m">Selections</title>-Hull).
               Moreover, insipid oratory was the consequence of a conspiracy amongst modern
               elocutionists “to reduce almost all public speaking but that of the stage to one
               sympathetic monotony of tone and look and attitude” so that “all expression of
               attitude and feature . . . ought to be confined to the mummeries for which they are
               supposed to have been invented” (<title level="m">Vestibule</title> 20).</p>
               <p>A holistic approach to vitality and character is a constant trait in Thelwall’s
               writing. From our introduction to his imaginary companion and virtual alter-ego,
               Ambulator, in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> of 1793, with his “small, but
               erect and manly form, his open brow, his strong but softened features, and his
               forward-darting eye, which reveal to the physiognomist the internal graces and
               dignity of his mind” (88-89), to the manifesto-like appeals of the <title level="m">Vestibule of Eloquence</title> seventeen years later, Thelwall consistently
               linked the science of physiognomy with improving elocution, deportment and intellect.
               Language alone would not suffice; on the contrary, “nature’s epitome, like nature’s
               self, must sympathise through every element: motion and look and attitude must
               manifest the inspiration of genuine feeling; and every portion of the frame must be
               vital with expressive eloquence” (<title level="m">Vestibule</title> 21). Gillray,
               whose own practice was largely based upon an appreciation of exaggerated animation
               and physiognomical distortion, was clearly fascinated by Thelwall and his attitude
               towards him remained characteristically ambiguous. In <title level="m">Copenhagen
                  House</title>, the dynamic contrast between Gillray’s Thelwall and Gillray’s crowd
               is not intended to confer much credit upon the latter; indeed, the argument of the
               print is dependent upon the accentuation of distance between the two. Understandably,
               Thelwall rejected any association between his crowd and Burke’s swinish multitude,
               and used physiognomy once again to refute the charge. “I am not speaking to an
               unenlightened and uninformed auditory,” he declared, “I can perceive countenances,
               many of which I know, and in many of which, though I do not know them, I can read the
               lines of intelligence and education” (<title level="m">Tribune</title> 3: 248).
               Gillray may not have been prepared to accept that but, like Coleridge, he was not
               unaware that “Thelwall is the voice of tens of thousands” (Coleridge, <title level="m">Plot</title> 20-21), and the clear evidence of Thelwall’s personal
               magnetism did not present obvious strategies for hostile loyalist caricature. </p>
               <p>Thelwall certainly felt his own persuasive genius, “for he had the satisfaction of
               seeing persons filling considerable stations in society who had at first gone to hear
               him with every hostile intention, become his warmest approvers; and very frequently,
               in after life, he was greeted by men of first-rate intellect and staunch reformers,
               with their acknowledgement that he was their political father” (Mrs. Thelwall
               405-06).

               <p>
            
            The exceptionalism implicit in Gillray’s image can be demonstrated by comparing it to
               the only previous attempt by a caricaturist to represent LCS oratory, the anonymous
                  <title level="m">Billy’s Hobby Horse</title> (1795) in which the St. George’s
               Fields meeting of 29 June 1795 forms part of the background. The only speaker that
               day was John Gale Jones, visible in the print with his arm raised, but no attempt has
               been made at likeness or oratorical posture and the meeting’s marginal position
               behind the principal figures of Pitt and John Bull reduces its role to one of
               commentary and context rather than argument and agency. We might also note the
               immediate and wholesale plagiarism of Gillray’s figure by Cruikshank in <title level="m">The Royal Extinguisher</title> (1795), published a few days after <title level="m">Copenhagen House</title>, and avoiding the political ambiguity
               underpinning Gillray’s print. In Cruikshank’s hands, Thelwall, though bodily
               identical, has become ridiculously Lilliputian; railing punily against Pitt’s
               towering Gulliver while the shelter of Gillray’s sun umbrella has been replaced by
               a gigantic candle snuffer. By contrast, Gillray’s ambivalent refusal to treat the LCS
               as a serious threat was not particularly helpful to ministerial arguments for the
               suppression of free speech and public assembly in the wake of the attack on the
               King’s coach a few weeks earlier. Indeed, some of the most diminutive and ineffectual
               figures in <title level="m">Copenhagen House</title> are the central representations
               of Fox and Pitt as children chancing their luck on an EO table while an unrestrained
               Thelwall thunders above their heads. Perhaps to avoid the ambiguity of presenting the
               public with the sort of irrepressibly energetic Thelwall they might actually
               recognise, therefore, Cruikshank changed tack after the passage of the Two Acts,
               divorced the orator from his popular constituency and re-fashioned him as a dupe of
               the Foxite Whigs.</p>
               <p>Rumours of a closer working relationship between the Fox and the LCS began to
               circulate publicly late in 1795. Cruikshank had already placed Fox, Sheridan and
               Stanhope in the Lilliputian crowd surrounding Thelwall in the <title level="m">Royal
                  Extinguisher</title>, and Gillray had made them leaders of the mob that attacked
               the King’s coach on October 29th in his highly ambiguous <title level="m">Republican Attack</title>. These rumours gathered pace, however, after
               Fox and several of his parliamentary allies attended Thelwall’s speech against the
               Gagging Bills at the last mass outdoor meeting of the Society on 7 December (<title level="m">Morning Post</title> 8 Dec. 1795). This was followed by a series of
               debates on “the most probable means left of saving the country from the despotism of
               the minister” in the Westminster Forum at which John Gale Jones claimed he had been
               waited upon by prominent Whigs and invited to join a general coalition against Pitt
               (Thale 330). In fact, according to Cecil Thelwall’s account, “Thelwall was the means
               of this union which now took place between the Whig Club and the London Corresponding
               Society,” for each had become “necessary to the preservation of the other,” although
               the LCS officially denied having anything to do with it (Mrs. Thelwall 399). Rumours
               circulated during the general election campaign of 1796 that Thelwall was intending
               to contest war minister William Windham’s seat at Norwich, but in fact he busied
               himself in supporting Fox at Westminster, where the Whig leader and the Pittite
               Admiral Allan Gardner were involved in a three-cornered contest with Thelwall’s first
               political mentor, John Horne Tooke. Thelwall had quarrelled with Tooke after the
               Treason Trials, but hoped now to see him elected with Fox at Gardner’s expense. He
               used the campaign to make a number of speeches calling for cross-party radical unity
               to defeat the ministry, but although Fox was returned, Gardner forced Tooke into
               third place.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For reports of these developments, see

                     June 1796. Thelwall shared Tooke’s philological interest in creating a devolved
                     non-elite language of politics and, like Tooke, was frequently taken to task by
                     the loyalist press for dangerously addressing plebeian audiences in non-elite
                     language. On this subject, see Jenks. For Thelwall’s relationship with Tooke,
                     see Mrs. Thelwall 343-44. William Windham was notorious for referring to
                     Thelwall and his fellow treason trial defendants of 1794 as “acquitted
                     felons.”</note>
                Despite appearances, Tooke and Fox had not in fact entered into a coalition,
               but government supporters made capital from it and were quick to point out that,
               “among the worthy electors in the interest of our senator were to be numbered Citizen
               John Thelwall, Citizen John Gale Jones, and not a few members of the Corresponding
               Society” (Bisset 3: 381). This too was the theme of Thomas Rowlandson’s <title level="m">Sir Alan Gardiner at Covent Garden</title> (1796) in which, not for the
               last time, Thelwall’s unwise associations left him headless, along with both Hardy
               and Tooke. This was the first caricature print to use the verbal joke “tell-well,” a
               nick-name for the lecturer that first surfaced in <title level="m">The Times</title>
               in 1794.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See <title level="m">New Times</title> 6

               <p>Shortly after this, Thelwall left London for his first provincial lecture tour and
               ceased for a time to be of interest to the capital’s satirists. However, when Fox
               found himself as without influence in the reconstituted parliament as he had been in
               the previous one, he led his party into a symbolic secession from the House, citing
               as causes Pitt’s retreat into cabinet government and the intransigence of the
               ministry over reform and the continuation of the war. Instead, he proposed
               co-operation with the extra-parliamentary reform movement who would otherwise be
               either “too weak to resist the Court” or, more ominously, prone to dangerous
               “excesses” (<title level="m">Public Advertiser</title> 8 Aug. 1797). Unsurprisingly,
               Fox’s loyalist critics suspected darker motives, for “telling the People that their
               parliament will not listen to reason” was “little short of an invitation to civil
               war” (Wells 65-66). The suspicion that radicals like Thelwall and Tooke were secretly
               plotting with disaffected parliamentarians like Fox, Stanhope, Sheridan and the Duke
               of Bedford to overthrow the State proved irresistible to satirists and in June,
               Thelwall reappeared as a pivotal figure in a series of critical prints by
               Cruikshank.

               <p>   These prints do not address Thelwall’s bodily energy, however, partly perhaps because
               other ministerial propagandists were emphasising the success of the Gagging Acts in
               stopping his mouth. “It is all over with me,” he is made to lament in one pamphlet,

                  </quote>
            For Cruikshank, however, Thelwall was more dangerous without his lectern than with
               it. In these prints, he may be recognised from his likeness and from textual
               allusions to lecturing, but he is otherwise unremarkable as he consorts privately
               with his influential new allies. In the first of them, <title level="m">The
                  Diversions of Purley</title>, Thelwall appears as part of the secessionist
               coalition with Erskine, Fox, Sheridan, Stanhope and Grey. He is no longer the orator
               but the secretive plotter, in a busy nursery, scissoring “old fashioned” aristocratic
               ermine to make swaddling for Fox’s monstrous offspring, master Revolution and miss
               Sedition. Should his profile be insufficient to identify him, he addresses a figure
               who breaks into the frame from the left with a query, “Did you hear my last lecture?”
               This figure is Horne Tooke, whose best known work provides the satire with its title,
               and who answers Thelwall with another question, “Have you heard from Sheerness”?
               Together, Tooke’s question and his peripheral position provide a commentary on
               Thelwall’s role as intermediary between Fox and Tooke on the one hand and between
               Jacobinism and the naval mutinies on the other. The mutiny at the Nore, close to the
               Kent coast at Sheerness, had broken out simultaneously with the second mutiny at
               Spithead, Portsmouth. John Gale Jones had been sent on a lecturing mission to the
               Kentish dockyards in 1796 and the LCS had gone to some trouble to encourage radical
               societies at Portsmouth. They were now widely suspected in the loyalist press of
               agitating amongst the sailors and schooling them in political and democratic demands.
               In May, <title level="m">The True Briton</title> had claimed Thelwall was on the Isle
               of Wight, “not an indifferent spectator, doubtless, of the late proceedings at
               Spithead,” and Cruikshank’s allusion is not unpredictable (12 May 1797). <title level="m">Diversions of Purley</title> was followed four days later by a second
               comment on the mutinies, <title level="m">The Delegates in Council</title>. Thelwall,
               having flitted from his Janus-like role between Fox and Tooke to the lower deck HMS
               Sandwich at the Nore, was now placed in a more sinister position as familiar,
               prompter and grog-server to the mutineers in the negotiation of terms with Admiral
               Buckner. Tooke resumes his rightful position under the table with the Foxite
               parliamentarians, but Thelwall stands openly beside his grotesquely drawn plebeian
               associates, fixes the Admiral squarely in the eye and issues instructions: “Tell him
               we intend to be masters,” he says, “I”ll read him a lecture.” Here, Cruikshank
               persuades his audience, was a man uniquely comfortable in both Opposition and
               insurrectionary circles and apparently able not only to move between them with ease
               but to direct operations from an assumed position of authority.

               <p>Later in the month, Cruikshank produced a third related image, <title level="m">The</title>
                  <title level="m">Watchman of the State</title>. As in <title level="m">Diversions of
                  Purley</title>, Fox is the central figure, this time in the character of an
               absconding watchman, deserting his post and abdicating his responsibility to keep the
               more extreme wing of the democratic coalition under control. Lauderdale and Bedford
               watch and applaud while Horne Tooke, Sheridan, and Stanhope lay gunpowder trails to
               destroy the constitution, the Commons and the Lords. A diminutive Thelwall, with a
               paper marked “Norwich lectures” in his pocket, once again provides the link with
               extra-parliamentary mischief making, this time lighting a taper from Stanhope’s
               lantern in a bid to destroy aristocracy. </p>
               <p>In all three of these prints, Cruikshank’s approach is different from Gillray’s.
               Thelwall’s physiognomy is reproduced with sufficient accuracy to make him
               recognisable, and his features do not undergo even the slight comedic distortions
               made use of by Gillray. But no allusion is made to his oratorical voice or to his
               bodily energy. He is in fact quite unremarkable, and this, perhaps, is Cruikshank’s
               point. What makes Thelwall dangerous is not the bluster and posturing of his high
               profile public performances but his chameleon-like ability to flit between various
               reform parties, belonging to none but at ease in any. Given Thelwall’s self-evident
               personal attractions and his polymathical intellectual dabblings in science,
               philosophy and the arts, some loyalist approaches to Jacobinism identified a
               framework of fluidity, sophistry and adaptability in the belly of the beast. As the
               arch-loyalist Robert Bisset put it, seemingly with Thelwall in mind: 
            <quote>One prominent feature often mentioned in Jacobinism is its versatility . . . . He is at
               one time a pamphleteer . . . we have him next as a novel-monger . . . next the Jacobin tries
               his hand at play-writing . . . the Jacobin now changes himself into the form of a
               lecturer, and from his tub his nightly nonsense pours . . . dabbling a little in
               metaphysics which are too deep for being fathomed by his line of understanding, he
               next comes upon us as a political philosopher . . . he turns critic next, and as a
               reviewer attempts to spread the beneficial doctrines and precepts of the various
               works he brings out in his other manifold capacities . . . he is a Socinian, a Methodist,
               a Seceder, a Presbyterian, a Roman Catholic, or a Mahometan; he has projected to be a
               Hindoo; he has been seen in the mosque and on his way to the pagoda, he struts at the
               school desk, he pops upon us in the conventicle, and assails us on the roadside.
               (Bisset 2: 242-43)</quote>
            Duplicity of this kind is rarely betrayed by low appearance or bad physiognomy; on
               the contrary, when understood on these terms, the Jacobin may be anonymous, prosaic,
               unnoticed. The Jacobin was not the first folk-devil to be constructed in this way for
               it had also been the fate of the eighteenth-century sodomite, another sinister figure
               variously imagined to be recognisable from his posture, speech and clothing, or
               alternatively concealed by outward shows of the ordinary. Sodomites did not always
               conform to the popular stereotype, lamented the pamphleteer Emanuel Collins in 1756;
               on the contrary, their insidious posturing as something they were not made them
               doubly dangerous. They “fly generally to large cities to hide themselves in the
               multitude, and seek security in the crowd . . . . Undaunted and upright they crowd our
               publick walks, unaw’d by guilt, and unappal’d by the fears of any impeachment” (1,
               7). Like Jacobins, they were masters of facade and pretence, “lurking,” as one
               newspaper put it in an attempt to forewarn its readers, “under the different
               characters and disguises of a solicitor, a gentleman of an estate, a steward to a
               nobleman, a cook, a tapster, and other shapes” (<title level="m">Newcastle
                  Courant</title> 24 Sept. 1737).

            </p>
               <p>The contrast between Cruikshank and Gillray’s practice at this time was further
               demonstrated in the latter’s complex and highly finished <title level="m">Promis’d
                  Horrors of the French Invasion – or – Forcible reasons for Negotiating a Regicide Peace</title>
               (1796). In this print, Gillray’s captivation by Thelwall’s energy and his ambivalence
               towards him is clear once again. Small in body but active and highly spirited, a
               recognisably sharp-featured Thelwall takes the Great Bedfordshire Ox (his opposition
               ally, the Duke of Bedford) by the tail and, with a well-aimed kick and a wave from a
               rolled copy of his lectures, encourages him to up-end a flailing Edmund Burke at the
               doorway of Brookes’s club in St James. Like Cruikshank, Gillray uses Thelwall more as
               an abettor and instigator than a direct agent, but he is possessed by a comic <title level="m">joie de vivre</title> that scarcely suggests the “promis’d horrors” of
               the design. The loyalist message of the print is compromised in any case by Gillray’s
               insistence on using dice, playing cards and an EO table in White’s Club to cloud our
               sympathies for the misfortunes of a dissolute Royal Family (the Prince of Wales and
               the Dukes of Clarence and York).

               <p>Gillray was not uninterested in the Corresponding Society’s relationship with the
               seceding Foxites, but unlike Cruikshank, he used the unlikely coalition as a vehicle
               for light comedy, doomed to failure, and ultimately the cause of Thelwall’s undoing.
               He is never a threatening figure in Gillray’s work; rather, he is transformed from a
               fountain of energy in 1795-96, to the representation of Jacobin defeat by the
               beginning of 1797. In<title level="m"> The End of the Irish Invasion</title> (1797),
               a comment on the dispersal of Hoche’s invasion fleet off the coast of Ireland in
               1796, French complicity with the Foxite/Jacobin coalition founders in storm-tossed
               seas and Thelwall is figuratively shipwrecked alongside Erskine and the Whig
               secceders. With his lectures in his pocket, and a pack of playing cards bobbing on
               the water behind him, Thelwall’s political “gamble” has failed and he is, quite
               literally, out of luck and out of his depth. A few days later in another Gillray
               satire, <title level="m">The Tree of Liberty must be Planted Immediately

               <p> Thelwall is once again a victim of hubris. Having failed to learn the lessons of his
               own lectures on classical history, his severed head lies slightly to the side of
               those of the Whigs, meaningfully separated from them by the executioner’s axe and
               resting upon a signifier of his own folly, a notice announcing “lectures upon the
               fall of the republic.” It is true that Gillray featured a revitalised Thelwall the
               following year in <title level="m">The New Morality</title> (1798), 
               <figure>

               <p>   but this was a
               directed commission for the <title level="m">Anti-Jacobin</title> magazine and prompted as
               much by a specific reference in Canning’s accompanying verse as any decision of his
               own. The revitalisation is in any case compromised once again by defeat, robbing
               Thelwall of power and influence despite his deportment. As assorted English Jacobins
               pay homage to Larevelliere Lepaux—the “High Priest,” as Canning put it, of the French
               cult of “Theophilanthropy”—Thelwall, portrayed as a railing imp on Bedford’s
               Leviathan shoulders, has become more feeble-bodied than before. In severely
               mud-spattered clothing, Thelwall is clearly no longer the “voice of thousands” and
               there is now an absurdity to his animation. The mud is an allusion to Thelwall’s
               hostile reception from loyalist mobs during recent provincial lecturing engagements
               at Derby, Norwich, Stockport and Ashby de la Zouch, and referred to in Canning’s
               verse: “Thelwall and ye that lecture as ye go, / And for your pains get pelted, praise
               Le Paux . . . .” By the time of this print’s appearance, Thelwall had in any case ceased
               to pose any significant threat because he had publicly announced his retirement to
               Llyswen, Wales, at the end of 1797.

               <p>The <title level="m">Anti-Jacobin’s</title> prime target in 1798-99 was not the
               individual influence of the charismatic lecturer in any case, but Opposition
               newspapers and essayists. Apart from the usual Whig suspects, Thelwall’s companions
               in the <title level="m">New Morality’s</title> procession of villains include Godwin,
               Coleridge, Southey, Holcroft, and Priestley besides representations of the <title level="m">Morning Chronicle</title>, the <title level="m">Courier</title>, the

               procession of radicals presides over a seditious cauldron heated by a bonfire of
               Jacobin texts, including Thelwall’s <title level="m">Rights of Nature</title>, to a
               fare blown by a newsboy from the <title level="m">Courier</title>. But this is a
               print that celebrates radical defeat; it is anything but alarmist. Thelwall stands in
               line, prematurely aged, his lectures tucked under one arm but effectively silenced.
               “I’m off to Monmouthshire,” he says. In loyalist discourse, the withdrawal of voice
               left Thelwall an empty windbag, his vitality extinguished, his lectures ineffective
               when committed to print. <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin</title> was in buoyant

            As Llyswen recluse and then professional elocutionist over the subsequent twenty
               years, Thelwall received little attention from satirists. When he did, it was only to
               suggest confluence between respectable cover and Jacobin intent, and only because the
               next generation of Whigs after Fox’s death were finding it no easier to exert lasting
               political influence. In <title level="m">The School of Eloquence and Grace</title>
               (1808), a complex engraving for the <title level="m">Satirist</title>, a large party
               of washed up Whig parliamentarians, defeated in the election of 1807, have booked
               themselves into Thelwall’s Bedford Square Institute to have their inarticulacy and
               other ineptitudes examined. Thelwall opened the Institute in 1806 to “pupils who have
               impediments of utterance, of whatever description . . . who may either labour under the
               like imperfections or be desirous of improvement in the accomplishments of reading
               and recitation, conversational fluency, public oratory, and the principles of
               criticism and composition,” and in a later prospectus he made specific overtures to
               parliamentarians who, “may depend upon every attention that can be instrumental
               either to the improvement of their oratorical powers or the direction of their
               studies” (qtd. in Duchan 139).<note resp="editors" place="foot">See also Thelwall, <title level="m">Plan
                        and Objects </title>9.</note>
                Given an Opposition that still included erstwhile political colleagues of
               Thelwall’s like Erskine, Burdett, and Horne Tooke (all of whom appear in the print),
               the <title level="m">Satirist’s </title>suggestion that a little Thelwallian
               eloquence and grace wouldn’t go amiss was sharply observed. Grenville’s political
               failings, it is suggested here, were compounded by his lack of figure as much as his
               defective oratory, and it is as appropriate to Thelwall’s holistic theories of
               vitality that Grenville must submit to having extraneous flesh carved from his
               buttocks to improve his balance, as it is for Lord Henry Petty to be taught how to
               stand for dancing by Thelwall’s wife. The failure of men like these to carry
               political argument is signified most clearly by the ungainly oratorical attitude of
               Thelwall’s old adversary, William Windham, so unsuccessful in his attempts to shame
               ministers over the British bombardment of Copenhagen that a bust of Demosthenes falls
               from the wall behind him. </p>
               <p>Thelwall’s failure to recapture the political limelight when he re-emerged into
               public life at the end of the Napoleonic Wars can be measured by the indifference of
               the early nineteenth century caricature trade after the death of both Isaac
               Cruikshank and Gillray. Thelwall came out of retirement to lend support to the
               moderate reformer John Cam Hobhouse at Westminster during the election of 1818 and
               spoke on a number of platforms as a “veteran” reformer. As the newly appointed editor
               of <title level="m">The Champion</title> newspaper, he appeared occasionally in
               satirical prints as a wizened and ineffectual figure in the radical crowd, in stark
               contravention of suggestions in sympathetic journals like the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title> that his return to the political stage was
               “characterised by his usual eloquence and energy” (48 [1819]: 566). George Cruikshank
               included him in two caricatures during these years, <title level="m">The Funeral
                  Procession of the Rump</title> (1819), and <title level="m">Coriolanus Addressing
                  the Plebeians</title> (1820), in the first of which his sorry figure traipses
               along in the wake of Hobhouse’s election defeat, expressing itself “ashamed of [his]
               company,” who include not only Burdett but some unidentified “acquitted felons.” In
               the second, he lines up with the radical crowd’s more moderate wing (the elderly
               Cartwright, Hobhouse and Hone), and looks more inconsequential than ever. Thelwall’s
               marginalised position in the radical canon reached new heights, however, in what was
               probably the last caricature ever to feature him, <title level="m">The Reign of
                  Humbug</title> (1825).

               <p>Uniquely, this was no loyalist print, but one composed as a frontispiece by Thomas
               Howell Jones for the radical republican William Benbow’s short-lived satirical
               journal, <title level="m">The Town</title>. The very prominent Thelwall, posturing
               once again as a gentleman elocutionist, takes his place amongst a pantheon of public
               figures regarded by Benbow as modern irritants, time-wasters and imposters. Having
               taken fright and abandoned the <title level="m">Champion</title> when the fiercely
               loyalist Constitutional Association threatened to prosecute him for seditious libel
               in 1820, and having at the same time loosened his political ties even with moderate
               men like Hobhouse, Thelwall was dismissed more readily than ever before by popular
               and less “respectable” stalwarts. In Howell Jones’s print, Thelwall has only his
               continuing association with the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title> to
               (literally) support his compromised political apostasy, and finds himself surrounded
               by every kind of frivolous financial speculator, corrupt politician, disingenuous
               bishop and confidence trickster (including Brougham and Burdett) in Benbow’s firing
               line. In fact, he occupies a central position in a “humbug” world characterised in
               Benbow’s prospectus by “every species of imposture, dupery and quackery” and whose
               inhabitants “shall stand exposed in their native deformity.”<note resp="editors" place="foot">See advertisement in <title level="m">Morning Post</title> 31 May 1825. I have not been able to trace a copy of
                     the journal but the print survives in the British Museum’s collection. </note>
               The wider public, to whom Thelwall had once directed his political energies,
               are shown facing away from his misdirected oratorical flourish to become dupes of the
               revived campaign against Catholic emancipation instead of making demands for reform.
               Thelwall’s irrelevant cry from atop his barrel, “My lectures on elocution . . . ,” goes,
               literally, over everyone’s head. </p>
               <p>We may conclude then not only that Thelwall’s caricatured persona stayed consistently
               true to his actual physiognomy over a thirty year period (which is interesting in
               itself), but that, during the early years when it most mattered, both Gillray and
               Isaac Cruikshank—albeit in different ways—were far too interested in the apparent
               contradictions in their subject’s persona to reduce him unproblematically to an ugly
               Jacobin signifier like Paine. Thelwall emerges instead as a complex caricature,
               either a man whose slight frame, masked expression and quiet adaptability negate the
               strength of his oratory and reveal a political chameleon who is not, perhaps, the
               one-dimensional firebrand of popular construction, or alternatively a man whose
               credentials as a firebrand are unquestionable but whose darker motives and seditious
               character are far from clear. These ambiguities were only reconciled by Thelwall’s
               running to ground in 1797-98, due largely to the concerted efforts of the
               legislature, the connivance of the judiciary and the brute force of loyalist mobs.
               More than a decade ago, E. P. Thompson persuasively traced the multi-layered
               silencing of the “Jacobin Fox” in these terms, and it has been suggested here that
               both James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank’s satires offer a visual commentary on the
               process by which this was achieved as well as the language in which it was expressed.
               However, the success of Pitt’s ministry in engineering the silence and defeat of
               Thelwall in 1798 has yet to be measured as a factor in his relatively unconvincing
               return to politics in 1818-20. The re-embodiment of the most feared democratic orator
               of the 1790s as the patron saint of lost causes, diluted principles and political
               humbug began in visual satire with Gillray in 1797. For all of Gillray’s oft-cited
               political ambivalence, his deflated Thelwall was perhaps of greater service to
               loyalist discourse than was Cruikshank’s alarmism, an approach to the problem that defied
               any obvious solution and which tended not only to question the effectiveness of the
               Gagging Acts but to suggest they had actually prompted clandestine plotting.
               Thelwall’s portrayal in print satire as the embodiment of radical defeat remained
               current for almost two more decades and did nothing to ease his assimilation back
               into the reform pantheon. Despite the re-energised mass platform movement for the
               popular franchise in the period between the close of the French wars and the passing
               of the Great Reform Act, Thelwall had come to stand for the failure of Jacobin
               aspiration. Alienated from former allies in the LCS like John Gale Jones and
               Alexander Galloway, who both threw in their lot with the new leaders of the reform
               movement—Cobbett, Hunt and even some of the Spenceans—Thelwall took his place
               alongside middle-class advocates for a limited extension of the suffrage and remained
               easy prey to charges of apostasy. For loyalist and radical illustrators alike,
               Thelwall’s reappearance in the early nineteenth century was marked by the forging of
               political alliances, as hopeless as they were disingenuous, and in the adoption of
               uncontroversial “professional” channels for the dissipated expression of what had
               once seemed a most terrible and dangerous energy. </p>

               <p>Recent Thelwallian conversations have grown from and reflected back upon the essays
               in <title level="m">John Thelwall: Radical Romantic and Acquitted Felon</title>.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Poole.</note> Conversational exchange was
               congenial to Thelwall himself, as the medium of “philosophic amity” he anticipated at
               the end of his West Country tour in summer 1797 (<title level="m">Retirement</title>
               129). Both Robin Jarvis and Michael Scrivener have shown how Thelwall’s “Pedestrian
               Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer of 1797”
               expressed an “intellectual mobility” that combined remarks on picturesque beauty with
               “the social labor and political conflicts that also are part of the land’s meaning”
               (Scrivener 224). The “Pedestrian Excursion” and its postscript “The Phenomena of the
               Wye, During the Winter of 1797-8” are exemplary instances of what Scrivener terms
               the “social creativity” of Jacobin writing (295), a creativity also manifest in what
               Judith Thompson has noted as the democratic temper of Thelwall’s experiments with
               form and genre in <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> (11, 18, 29).</p>
               <p>“The Phenomena of the Wye” records a late stage of Thelwall’s west country excursion.
               It was published in the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title> for May and July
               1798, before the other instalments of the “Pedestrian Excursion” appeared between
               1799 and 1801. This arrangement is peculiar. Perhaps Thelwall intended it to distract
               attention from the missing segment of his excursion—what occurred between
               Thelwall setting-off from Bath with “solitary step” (“Pedestrian” 55) and his arrival
               in the middle of the autumn at the Wye Valley on his “first visit to [those] parts”
               (“Wye” 5). If that was indeed the design, it didn’t work. The missing section of the
               tour was in fact its principal purpose, as announced by Thelwall in his prefatory
               remarks: a visit to his “invaluable friend” Samuel Taylor Coleridge at Nether Stowey
                  (“Pedestrian”<title level="m"/>17). </p>
               <p>As reconstructed without reference to the “Pedestrian Excursion” the visit to Stowey
               has been seen to mark Thelwall’s retreat from metropolitan radicalism and ‘“the
               vortex of public contention” to become the “new Recluse” of Liswyn Farm, and, later,
               a Lecturer on Elocution (<title level="m">Retirement</title> xxiii, xxxviii).<note resp="editors" place="foot">See for example my account in <title level="m">Wordsworth and Coleridge</title> 234-62, focusing on Thelwall’s response to
                  the spy, James Walsh, who tracked him from London to Nether Stowey.</note> That
               “turn” might summarise Thelwall’s trajectory from London in 1795 through to Liswyn in
               1801, a trajectory impelled negatively by persecution, disappointment, and
               marginalisation and positively by the wish for friendship, correspondence, and
               affection. The subsequent lapse of “philosophic amity” leads to “retreat,”
               “retirement,” and “reinvention,” from which Thelwall re-emerges with a new identity
               as an elocutionist. Several essays in <title level="m">John Thelwall: Radical
                  Romantic</title> challenge this profile, by pointing to continuities between
               Thelwall’s political lectures and his practice as an elocutionist. Simply put, as a
               political lecturer in the 1790s, Thelwall was the voice of the inarticulate; in later
               years his elocution helped the tongue-tied to speak for themselves. As the popular
               orator of the Corresponding Society Thelwall had lisped and stammered at the tribune;
               Thelwall the speech therapist lectured on “Bonaparte and the Spanish Patriots” at the
               Angel Inn, Tiverton. </p>
               <p>When in the mid-1790s the London Corresponding Society was forced underground it
               adopted the cover of the “School of Eloquence,” a school in which Thelwall—had
               he chosen to do so—might have continued his political lectures. He didn’t so
               choose. He set off first to East Anglia, and was rebuffed by riots. He then trekked
               north to Derby, to find the offer of a newspaper editorship had been foreclosed. With
               London in 1797 a no-go area for him, there was little option but to step westwards on
               a walking tour towards a correspondent, not as yet encountered in person, who
               appeared to promise all that Thelwall was denied elsewhere in England: familiarity,
               affection and intellectual fellowship. </p>
               <p>In this article I want to offer some further arguments for a continuity between
               Thelwall up to the “Pedestrian Excursion” in 1797, and the Thelwall who re-emerged
               from Liswyn Farm. I want to attend to Thelwall and the sense of place, and to ask
               what it meant at that moment to step westwards in the hope of establishing “a more
               immediate and intimate communication” with friends settled in the West Country
               (“Pedestrian” 17). Within that narrative of continuity, I want also to speculate
               about the breaks and fractures signalled by the published version of Thelwall’s
               “Pedestrian Excursion.” As presented in the <title level="m">Monthly
               Magazine</title>, the anticipated “communication” with his friend produces a
               dislocation in the “Excursion” narrative that prompted Thelwall to publish the
               “Phenomena of the Wye” first, and separately from, the “Excursion” it should have
               concluded. In this arrangement of the narrative, the episode of friendly
               communication with Coleridge is completely excised. </p>

                  <head>*</head>
                  <p>Thursday, 29 June 1797. Thelwall and his friend Wimpory set off from London between
               nine and ten o’clock in a heavy shower of rain. Their route will take them out of
               London to Windsor, Basingstoke, Andover, Salisbury, Amesbury, Stonehenge, Winterborne
               Stoke, Wylye, Fonthill, Wardour Castle, Mere, Frome, Bristol and Bath . . . and
               eventually to the Wye Valley. Broadly speaking Thelwall was following earlier
               travellers such as Thomas Gray and William Gilpin, and William Wordsworth on his 1793
               venture westwards from London, via the Isle of Wight, Salisbury and the Plain, to
               Bath and Bristol. If we include Wordsworth’s wider poetic migrations between 1793 and
               1798 we might say that Thelwall was tracking a topography of the imagination that led
               from the desolate vistas represented by an early poem like <title level="m">Salisbury
                  Plain</title> to the human landscapes of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>.
               Thelwall, likewise, abandoned the persecutions of London and headed westward in the
               hope of human community, and for Thelwall, too, the westward journey would produce
               significant challenges and transformations.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For more on Thelwall’s and Wordsworth’s
                     West Country tours, see <title level="m">English Romantic Writers and the West
                        Country</title>, ed. Roe, especially the introduction and Carol Kyros
                     Walker’s essay, “Wordsworth’s 1793 Journey to the West Country and
                     Wales.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The social, cultural and political observations that inform Thelwall’s “Pedestrian
               Excursion” have been widely noted, and comparisons have rightly been made with Arthur
               Young and William Cobbett.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See, for instance,
                  E. P. Thompson 104-07; Scrivener 222-28; and Lamb and Wagner 15. </note> More can
               I think be said, and one keynote is Thelwallian diversity. Thelwall is familiar to us
               as a journalist poet, orator, lecturer, leader of popular societies, speculative
               scientist, and elocutionist. He was also a published dramatist, pamphleteer,
               autobiographer, novelist, and diarist. His other identities include Thelwall the
               political agent, songwriter, editor, pedestrian, naturalist, farmer, and collector.
               To these we can add his early years in his father’s silk business; apprentice
               to a master-tailor; epic poet; trainee lawyer; aspirant actor, and would-be
               historical painter. I wrote in “The Lives of John Thelwall” about his various
               identities as a “private citizen,” “Citizen Thelwall,” “Brother Thelwall,” Sylvanus
               Theophrastus, John Beaufort, “the new Recluse,” “Citizen John,” “Citizen Jack,” “the
               famous Thelwall,” and “the lisping orator.” And I suggested that it is possible to
               map a comparable diversity in other areas of Thelwall’s life—for example in his
               travels and tours throughout England. It’s worth emphasising these earlier selves,
               because we overhear many of their voices in the course of his “Pedestrian
               Excursion.”</p>
                  <p>Who are they? A non-exhaustive list, arranged alphabetically, includes the following
               Thelwalls, all of whom we hear from in the course of the “Excursion”: 
            <list>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Agriculturalist</hi>, concerned with crops, farm and land
               maintenance, and the condition of the soil.</item>

                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Art Historian</hi>, who appears throughout the “Excursion,” comments
               on the chapel paintings at Amesbury House and finds occasion to remark on
               contemporary painters such as West, Barry, Northcote and Fuseli (34-36). </item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Architect</hi>, ready with an opinion on “the fine florid
               Normo-Gothic style” of St. Mary Redcliffe at Bristol, the interior of Salisbury Cathedral and “[t]he many-shafted pillars and Saracenic (or Normo-Gothic) arches
               that divide the nave and circles . . . handsome, uniform and in excellent proportion”
               (53, 28).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Classical Historian </hi>“nurtured with the love of Roman liberty,”
               whose appreciation of Roman busts, coloured by his knowledge of the times, gives us
               “the bloated, intemperate, licentious, effeminate, mischief-meditating countenance of
               Nero, with his pursed-up, pouting, distorted mouth, and assassin arm wrapped up in
               his cloak” (31). </item>
                        <item>Thelwall the “confidential correspondent” of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (17).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Economist</hi> prepared to expatiate on “<title level="m">National
                  Debt</title>,” “<title level="m">Circulating Medium</title>,” “<title level="m">Waste Lands</title>,” and the rural wages of labourers (“Wye” 10-12). </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Farmer</hi> Thelwall, as concerned as the agriculturalist about “the state,
               cultivation, and the fertility of pastures,” drainage, the size of farms and the
               condition of farm buildings (“Pedestrian” 22).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Gallant</hi>, with an eye to the “mistress of the house” who is
               “somewhat handsome” (24-25).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Industrialist</hi>, whose childhood experiences inform his remarks
               about the silk-mill near Basingstoke, and the cloth mill at Frome (26-27, 48-49).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Journalist</hi>—the published text of the “Excursion” is a
               gleaning from his more extensive “observations” (17).</item>
                        <item>Then there is Thelwall the <hi>Landscape Painter</hi> and <hi>Gardener</hi>, ready
               with comments on Poussin, Claude, and the layout of Windsor Great Park (“Wye” 3;
               “Pedestrian” 21). </item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Pedestrian</hi>, the <hi>Peripatetic</hi>, and the <hi>Picturesque
                  Traveller</hi>. </item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Politician</hi> who remarks briefly on liberty and justice and
               resists an “elaborate dissertation” (“Pedestrian” 32).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Public Figure</hi> or “<hi>Celebrity</hi>” who is recognised at
               Frome and suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself “in the midst of friends” (48).</item>
                        <item>Thelwall the <hi>Utopian Thinker</hi>, who “formed Utopian plans of retirement and
               colonisations” (21).</item>
                        <item>And finally, to round up this list, there is Thelwall the <hi>Bon Viveur</hi> on the
               watch for his next meal: bread and milk (20); tea and rolls and cream (21); eggs,
               bacon, and ale (25); new milk (26); “animal food” (27); ham, eggs, salad, gooseberry
               pies and ale (41-42); a cold leg of lamb, lamb chops and salad (46). All of this
               country fare is sampled en route to Stowey. </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Thelwall assumes diverse identities and discourses, adapts himself to occasion,
               and, except for the moment when he is recognised at Frome, travels across country
                  <title level="m">incognito</title>. And we hear accordingly little of what
               Thelwall felt in himself—the “Excursion” concerns itself with the physical,
               material detail of landscapes, buildings and contents, soil, wages, the condition of
               rivers, the cleanliness or otherwise of inns, and the palatability of food. When we
               part company from him at Bath, he is headed further west into Somerset, to meet his
               confidential correspondent “well known in the literary world” (17). We shall meet
               Thelwall again as the different creature of the “Phenomena of the Wye” articles, and
               as Thelwall himself leaves a gap in his narrative I am going to take this opportunity to
               offer a few conjectures about what it meant to step westward to Nether Stowey in
               summer 1797. </p>
                  <p>Thelwall’s “eccentric ramble” westwards was exactly that: a trajectory outwards from
               the city towards a location off-centre, away from the uproar of public life towards a
               “more immediate and intimate communication” with a private friend (“Pedestrian” 17).
               The Quantock Hills, two days from London by the fastest coach, offered the
               geographical and psychological sense of remove and reassurance that had already
               attracted Coleridge from Bristol and, more recently, Wordsworth and his sister from
               London via Dorset. Here, as Richard Holmes’s biography of Coleridge showed us, were
               the provincial landscape and culture that inspired Coleridge’s early visions.</p>
                  <p>One question occurs. Why the Quantocks? Wouldn’t another region of England, Wales or
               Scotland have served as well? At a period of political and social unrest the
               Quantocks might be thought to have offered shelter from political persecution such as
               Thelwall had endured, and the shaded coombs and windswept uplands both nurtured and
               disciplined literary composition. This is the landscape Coleridge celebrates in
                  <title level="m">Fears in Solitude</title> and yet, rather than offering a remove
               from the centre of unrest in London, Somerset was the historical heartland of
               rebellion—as Coleridge, a Devonshire man, certainly knew. A dozen miles from
               Nether Stowey was Taunton, a parliamentary stronghold during the Civil War and an
               important centre for Non-conformity with an academy (c. 1670-1759) linked to the
               network of dissent that criss-crossed the country. The Duke of Monmouth’s challenge
               for the throne in 1685 had gathered momentum in Dorset, only to meet defeat at “sad
               Sedge-Moor”—Thomas Hardy’s phrase (line 8). Hundreds were executed in Judge
               Jeffreys’s “bloody assizes” that followed. When the French planned an invasion
               attempt in 1797, they targeted a remote area of the Somerset coast close to
               Coleridge’s home at Nether Stowey. Was this fortuitous? A matter of wind and tide? Or
               did the French anticipate a welcome from locals whose forebears had experienced murderous
               retribution? Certainly Coleridge and Wordsworth found a like-minded friend in Thomas
               Poole, the tanner of Nether Stowey who had founded a poor man’s club in the village
               (Poole’s enemies thought of the club as a private army over which he had “intire
                  command”).<note resp="editors" place="foot">See the report from the spy James Walsh in
                     my <title level="m">Wordsworth and Coleridge </title>260-61. </note>
                For Thelwall, the excursion to Somerset was less an escape from the dangers of
               London than a homecoming in a provincial landscape long associated with
               resistance—a resistance that in the days of King Alfred had arguably led to the
               foundation of England itself. The geopolitical history of the West Country was
               unquestionably a factor in the Home Office decision to dispatch the
               spy—Coleridge’s “Spy Nosy”—to report on “the famous Thelwall” and the
               “nest of democrats” at Alfoxden, and we can see those associations continued in the
               next generation. Ten years later, in 1808, Leigh Hunt’s friend J. P. Marriott founded
               the <title level="m">Taunton Courier</title>—a liberal newspaper, modelled on
               Hunt’s London <title level="m">Examiner</title>, that circulated throughout the West
               Country. On the first page of the first issue, 22 October 1808, the <title level="m">Taunton Courier</title> carried an advertisement for Thelwall’s forthcoming
               lecture on “Bonaparte and the Spanish patriots” at the Angel Inn, Tiverton. Hunt’s
               brother John, publisher of the <title level="m">Examiner</title>, actually made his
               home in 1819 a few miles from Taunton at Cheddon Fitzpaine: it was a settlement long
               postponed, for the Hunt brothers were descendants of an ancient Devonshire family
               from South Molton. The assertive political-cultural independence of <title level="m">The Examiner</title> in which Shelley and Keats found their first readers was a
               West Country inheritance, and that inheritance is arguably why Thelwall, Coleridge
               and Wordsworth had also relocated from London to the Quantocks at a moment of
               political crisis and impending repression in the mid-1790s. Often thought of in terms
               of “retreat,” “retirement,” and “disengagement,” the road to Nether Stowey was taken
               by those, like Thelwall, who sought continuity, confidentiality, and communication at
               a time of “default” in the centre. Thelwall’s “eccentricity” signalled his refusal to
               abandon the cause: his wayward trajectory to the west was a homing-in on the one area
               of the country likely to prove receptive to his democratic campaign. If that was
               indeed his expectation, the experience proved somewhat different from what he had
               anticipated—hence the fracture in the published narrative of the
               “Excursion.”</p>
                  <p>Thelwall’s “familiar and confidential correspondence” with Coleridge was the conversation of t
                  wo friends whose political ideals overlay intractable differences. Thelwall was a materialist, as his <title level="m">Essay on Animal Vitality</title> and the “Pedestrian Excursion” demonstrated. The
                  <title level="m">Essay</title> argued that spirit “must be material,” possibly the
               mysterious “electrical fluid” that was simultaneously “a fine and subtle, or aeriform
               essence” that is “<title level="m">superadded to matter</title>” (116-17). In the
               “Excursion” Thelwall’s concern is “observations”—social, topographical,
               picturesque, architectural, economic, agricultural, gastronomic. Indeed, apart from
               the state of his stomach, we hear almost nothing about Thelwall himself—no
               impressions, no hint of personal feelings, no imaginative response. As a single
               suggestion of what might have been possible, Wordsworth evidently heard about or
               looked over Thelwall’s journal and noted his observation of how “tasteless
               inhabitants . . . have daubed their houses, and one in particular, the very colonnade
               before his door, with green paint” (“Pedestrian” 19). “Tintern Abbey” removes all
               inhabitants from the scene, and restores a natural continuity between the landscape
               and “pastoral farms / Green to the very door.” Thelwall is concerned with taste, or
               its lack, as materialised by “the country houses of persons long immured in large
               cities” (20). Wordsworth’s more impressionistic vision tells us of his wish to see a
               landscape in which human presences almost pass unnoticed.</p>
                  <p>At Stowey Thelwall, Coleridge, and the Wordsworths talked, walked, dined, and recited
               poems and plays, and as David Fairer has recently argued, it rapidly became clear
               that Thelwall’s materialism was at odds with Coleridge’s idealism and
                  spirituality. That apparent conflict did not preclude some
               interassimilation, as I suggested in tracing “Tintern Abbey”’s conversation with
               Thelwall’s “Lecture on Animal Vitality” (<title level="m">Politics of Nature</title> 93-95). Thelwall, likewise, obliged to quit Nether Stowey, was aware of
               Coleridge’s experiments with landscapes of feeling in his recent poem “This Lime-Tree
               Bower my Prison.” That awareness is apparent in Thelwall’s own blank verse poems,
               “Lines Written at Bridgewater” and “To the Infant Hampden,” and also in “The
               Phenomena of the Wye, during the Winter of 1797-8” to which I now want to turn by way
               of concluding.</p>
                  <p>There are some continuities between the narrative of the “Pedestrian Excursion” that
               in chronological terms preceded the “The Phenomena of the Wye” but, as indicated
               already, saw print rather later. As apparent are some notable differences. In
               particular, “The Phenomena of the Wye” shows us Thelwall moving towards a more
               subjective, mediated vision that discovers emblems or symbols of his own feelings in
               the landscape. The “eccentric ramble” of Thelwall’s recent past greets the “intricate
               meanders” of the Wye in a moment of self-recognition that is also an acknowledgement
               of survival amid “eternal diversity” (“Wye” 4). If we do not hear the thoughts and
               feelings of the “pensive wanderer” who saunters along the banks, the sight of
               “successive strata of sand, of gravel, and of rock” glimpsed through the “transparent
               stream” is suggestive of depth and retrospection (as in Coleridge’s sonnet “To the
               River Otter”) (4). Thelwall the materialist is now prepared to grant that a scene may
               be “enchanting” and may result in “curiosity inflamed”; the atmosphere can be “thick,” and a sky
               “sullen” (3). Here are “mingled impressions” (4), a “transparent veil” (7), “rays of
               sun tingling with transient glow” (6), and “a sort of wild and awful music”
               reminiscent of the poems of Ossian (8). Thelwall was on the way to realising how the
               language and rhythms of poetry offered the release, the response, and the “intimate
               communication” he had sought in making his “Excursion” to meet Coleridge at Stowey
               (“Pedestrian” 17). As he tapped into his own experiences and feelings in the
               post-Nether Stowey <title level="m">Poems Written in Retirement</title> of 1801,
               Thelwall was already alert to poetry’s potential to liberate those whose speech was
               as fractured as his own. Thelwall’s “road to Nether Stowey” led beyond the village
               limits, to the Wye, to Liswyn, and, ultimately, to his Institute of Elocution at
               Lincoln’s Inn Fields. </p>

               <p>Recent scholarship has demonstrated the rich possibilities of Romantic science and
               the political, philosophical, and social significance of its diverse lines of
               inquiry. In the early 1790s John Thelwall participated in the ideologically charged
               conversations of science, medicine, and materialism while attending lectures at St.
               Thomas’s and Guy’s hospitals and as a member of the Physical Society.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Notably, Thelwall lent his voice to the debate
                  surrounding the vital principle, which was often cast as a conflict between
                  traditional values and the radical, Jacobin ideals represented by materialism.
                  Nicholas Roe convincingly ventures that Thelwall’s materialist <title level="m">An
                     Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793), as well as an
                  essay on sensation, may have been key contributing factors to his 1794 treason
                  charge (188).</note> After his 1794 treason trial and the government repression
               that followed, Thelwall turned to elocutionary science, “the <title level="m">New
                  Profession</title>, to which I have devoted my maturer years” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 2). This “<title level="m">New Profession</title>” has been
               understood as ideologically neutral in comparison to Thelwall’s earlier involvement
               in radical politics and materialist science—yet the political and humanistic
               implications of his elocutionary project are significant, and reveal an enduring
               dedication to democratic ideals.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Michael
                  Scrivener, Andrew McCann, Nicholas Roe, and J. R. Allard have all argued for some
                  sense of political continuity across Thelwall’s diverse career. For Scrivener,
                  however, Thelwall’s elocutionary writings “are largely apolitical—or political in
                  an allegorical way” (285); similarly, for McCann, “As an elocutionist . . .
                  Thelwall had cast off politics” (223). It was a sense that Thelwall himself
                  certainly strove to cultivate, and in <title level="m">A Letter to Henry
                     Cline</title> he distances himself from “the excentric fire of youth,” which
                  had interrupted his early study of science and medicine and “hurried me away to
                  other topics” (2). </note> Thelwall came into professional contact with “idiots,”
               “mutes,” and “stutterers” at a key moment in the development of modern medicine and
               modern attitudes towards “disability,” and in these contexts we may more fully
               appreciate the importance of his therapeutic endeavor.<note resp="editors" place="foot">In keeping with contemporary disability theory, I use the term
                  “disability” to invoke the complex social position of those with medicalized
                  biological differences—as opposed to the biological differences, or “impairments,”
                  themselves. As Susan Wendell has argued, “the biological and the social are
                  interactive in creating disability” insofar as “the social response to and
                  treatment of biological difference . . . determin[es] both the nature and the
                  severity of disability” (35, 42).</note> Ultimately, Thelwall’s approach to his
               practice and his patients may be understood as deeply—and provocatively—egalitarian,
               and his major elocutionary texts—<title level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title>
               (1810), <title level="m">The Vestibule of Eloquence</title> (1810), and <title level="m">Results of Experience in the Treatment of Cases of Defective
                  Utterance</title> (1814)—may be read as actively resisting the normative views of
               disability that were beginning to consolidate during the era.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Practitioner and his Practice</head>
                  <p>As Roy Porter and other medical historians have detailed, the practice of medicine
                  became increasingly effective, standardized, regulated, and scientific over the
                  course of the nineteenth century.<note resp="editors" place="foot">The 1815
                     Apothecaries Act, for example, required the certification of all apothecaries
                     and outlined a required course of academic and clinical training. Diagnostic
                     criteria and practices would become ever more standardized, in large part
                     because of increased anatomical, laboratorial, and clinical expertise, and in
                     large part because of technological innovations including René Laennec’s 1816
                     invention of the stethoscope.</note> During the eighteenth century, however,
                  and extending into Thelwall’s time practicing elocutionary science, there was
                  little regularity to medicine, and doctors had relatively little to offer in the
                  way of effective treatments for most illnesses and impairments. Quack doctors and
                  alternative healers—folk, religious, magical—flourished alongside those striving
                  for institutional authority, regulation, and professionalization. The diversity of
                  Romantic medicine particularly calls to mind Porter’s phrase “histories of the
                  medicines,” appropriate because “there has never been a single, homogenous body of
                  theory and practice answering to the name ‘medicine’” (<title level="m">Popularization </title>1).<note resp="editors" place="foot">For longer
                     accounts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medicine, see Porter, <title level="m">Benefit</title>, Lawrence, and Bynum. For an account of speech
                     therapy at Thelwall’s time, see Rockey, “Origins.”</note> Because of the
                  openness of the age, Thelwall was in a position to carve out his own distinct
                  place in the medical landscape, and he situates his elocutionary project in a
                  careful—but often uneasy—relationship with his diverse medical
                  contemporaries. </p>
                  <p>Determined to establish the legitimacy of “the Science of Curing Impediments” and
                  to appeal to his professional peers (<title level="m">Results</title> 74),
                  Thelwall addresses two lengthy elocutionary texts to a medical professor (Henry
                  Cline), describes his early exposure to medical education, and admits that he is
                  “desirous of calling the attention of the professional and scientific world” to
                  the “researches and experimental exertions of ten successive years” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 1, 5). Thelwall asserts, however, that the treatment of
                  speech impediments “is not, and, it is obvious, cannot be, the province of the
                  surgeon or the physician” (<title level="m">Cline </title>60). He also criticizes
                  dental prosthetics and oral surgery for causing greater “difficulties” and
                  “mischiefs” than impairments themselves do, and for even causing “serious
                  accidents” and “irreparable injury” in some cases (<title level="m">Results</title> 4-5, <title level="m">Cline</title> 50-51). Such critiques may
                  be partly accounted for by the economic realities of eighteenth- and
                  nineteenth-century medicine. Mary E. Fissell describes the “profusion of
                  health-care providers eager for [each patient’s] custom” (37), which would have
                  put acute pressure on Thelwall to actively market his product, just as his
                  competitors did.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Similarly, Dorothy and Roy
                     Porter have demonstrated that “Wherever money was to be made out of medicine,
                     the opportunity was seized,” and Thelwall’s professional success testifies to
                     the “genuine alternatives” presented to patients by the diversity of early
                     nineteenth-century medical practitioners (24, 26). For a detailed account of
                     the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medical market, see Digby.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thelwall’s textual positioning is no less vexed in relation to those medical
                  contemporaries whose practices reflected the ideals of democracy and dissent. By
                  conspicuously withholding details of his therapeutic methods from otherwise
                  comprehensive elocutionary texts—“the key to his system is missing” (Rockey,
                  “Origins” 156)—Thelwall distinguishes them from self-help manuals, a primary
                  medium for the dissemination of medical information in the eighteenth and early
                  nineteenth centuries. Popular and influential publications including John Wesley’s
                     <title level="m">Primitive Physick</title> and William Buchan’s <title level="m">Domestic Medicine</title> promised to allow patients to become their
                  own physicians. <title level="m">Primitive Physick</title>, for example, “set down
                  cheap, and safe, and easy Medicines; easy to be known, easy to be procured, and
                  easy to be applied by plain, unlettered men,” in contrast to expensive and
                  esoteric medical texts. Wesley’s manual provides simple remedies for conditions
                  ranging from breast cancer (“Use the <title level="m">Cold Bath</title>”) to
                  vertigo (“Take a <title level="m">Vomit</title> or two”) (xxiv, xiv, 40,
                     110).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Multiple editions were published
                     of Wesley’s and Buchan’s texts—originally of 1747 and 1769, respectively—and
                     new editions of the latter were available well into the nineteenth century.
                     Ginny Smith notes that “[f]or a large number of people [medical self-help
                     manuals] could well have been a far more familiar source of information than
                     the personal advice of the trained physician” (250). Thelwall’s French
                     contemporaries are also worth noting here as their careers were shaped by the
                     democratic ideals of the Revolution. British medicine as a whole imported—and
                     many would say benefited from—the medical developments of Revolutionary and
                     Imperial France. For more on Thelwall’s French contemporaries, see
                     Weiner.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although Thelwall’s elocutionary texts could never serve as such manuals, he was
                  not opposed to the transparency Wesley endorsed. Thelwall remarks of <title level="m">The Vestibule of Eloquence</title> that its price and limited print
                  run may restrict its circulation, but “it is the wish of the professor that every
                  thing relating to the exercises of his pupils should be open to public inspection”
                  (iv). Indeed, Denyse Rockey speculates that practical concerns—first a lack of
                  time and later a lack of money—may partly account for the gaps in Thelwall’s
                  elocutionary texts (“Origins” 174). They may also be partly explained by
                  proprietary concerns in the competitive medical market—or perhaps, like Thomas
                  Beddoes, Thelwall feared the misapplication of medical treatments.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Grinnell on Beddoes’s complex
                     relationship with self-help medical texts and his distrust of the practices
                     they encouraged.</note> Because of the interactive—and, judging by his case
                  studies, individualized—nature of his elocutionary therapy, moreover, Thelwall’s
                  methods may have been impossible to generalize and describe at all, much less
                     effectively.<note resp="editors" place="foot">It also bears mention that
                     self-help manuals did not necessarily live up to their democratic goals: “they
                     could reinforce the authority of the medical elite or they might encourage
                     independence of judgment, breeding that ‘health protestantism’ which fired

                  </p>
                  <p>By remaining silent as to his specific therapeutic techniques, Thelwall draws
                  attention to the philosophy underlying his practice, which is more clearly aligned
                  with populist medicine like Wesley’s. In striking contrast to doctors who use
                  diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy to “establish, exercise, and perpetuate their
                  power” (Couser 19), Thelwall demonstrates his devotion to transparency and
                  communication, as well as his resistance to pathologizing his “pupils.” He
                  asserts, <quote>Impress the perceptive faculty, clearly and strongly; demonstrate,
                     step by step, your theory to the understanding; and interest, at the same time,
                     the imagination; leave nothing obscure or unaccounted for, that the capacity of
                     the pupil can comprehend, or that, from the nature and structure of his frame
                     and faculties, is capable of illustration; give him a system on which he can
                     see and feel that he may depend . . . . (<title level="m">Cline
                     </title>58-59)</quote> Thelwall’s commitment to meaningful discourse is
                  similarly evident in his reflection that “the successful practitioner must have
                  looked with scrutinizing eye into the motions of the heart, and of the
                  understanding” (<title level="m">Results</title> 74).<note resp="editors" place="foot">As G. Thomas Couser underscores, “discourse between patient
                     and doctor occurs in a way that may be at odds with the root meaning of <title level="m">communication</title>, the making common of information”—because
                     of specialized discourse and because of the medical imperative to maintain
                     authority (20-21). Also see Freidson on power and authority in medicine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise, Thelwall underscores the importance of the patient’s contributions to
                  the therapeutic process even as he stresses the therapist’s authority. In this he
                  echoes William Buchan, who claims, “It is always in the power of the patient, or
                  of those about him, to do as much towards his recovery as can be effected by the
                  physician” (x). According to Thelwall, “it is desirable that the elocutionary
                  tutor should have the entire direction and superintendance of the pupil—even to
                  the extent of absolute domestication” (<title level="m">Results </title>10)—yet
                  much depends on “the susceptibility, diligence, previous attainments, and
                  dispositions of the Pupil” (<title level="m">Vestibule </title>7), and “where
                  determined effort and enthusiastic diligence are not wanting, the blemishes of
                  physical nature effectively disappear” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 33).
                  Tellingly, Thelwall remarks that “mental and moral causes step in to the
                  explanation” of what he calls his most successful elocutionary case: “I have never
                  met with so devoted an attention, and so entire a confidence” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 64).<note resp="editors" place="foot">This is a point to
                     which Thelwall devotes a conspicuous amount of space and emphasis, and marks a
                     departure from many of his peers including Thomas Beddoes, who stresses the
                     authority of the physician and “describes the role of the patient as preventing
                     rather than curing complaints” (Grinnell 235).</note> Michael Scrivener reads
                  evidence of Jacobin values in Thelwall’s faith in the collaborative therapeutic
                  process: “each successful case” may become an “allegorical illustration of
                  self-improvement and the rational application of knowledge” (197). </p>
                  <p>By courting and simultaneously challenging his medical contemporaries, Thelwall
                  defended his principles and economic concerns, participated in medical discourse,
                  and framed his elocutionary techniques as safe, effective, professional, and
                  rigorously scientific alternative therapies. In illuminating his therapeutic
                  philosophy, Thelwall made his democratic tendencies clear; like his populist
                  contemporaries, Thelwall pursued partnership rather than absolute authority, and
                  clarity of communication rather than esoteric discourse. We may then say of
                  Thelwall what George C. Grinnell says of Thomas Beddoes: he “model[s] . . . a
                  reorganization of medical practice in Georgian England” (224). The consequence of
                  Thelwall’s distinct therapeutic approach is in the intersection of democracy and
                  disability.</p>

                  <p>In nineteenth-century medicine, an increase in institutional authority,
                  professionalization, and standardized practices led to ever more ideologically
                  consistent approaches to disability. If eighteenth-century medicine largely
                  depended on relative and individualized notions of health and illness, “medical
                  men” of the following century “were developing a language (which we still use) for
                  situating all people in relation to each other, for measuring their deviation from
                  the <emph>normal</emph>, and, increasingly, for managing their deviations from
                  that norm” (Lawrence 45). As Lennard J. Davis has demonstrated, the concept of the
                  “norm” became a fully realized and socially defining construct in the 1840s and
                  1850s, after which those with various impairments were increasingly seen as
                  abnormal “deviants,” and biological differences were increasingly regarded as
                  indelible identity markers. </p>
                  <p>Paul Youngquist has shown, however, that “by the late eighteenth century medical
                  science was consolidating its authority over deviant flesh,” and “[t]he last
                  decades of the eighteenth century witness the installation of this turn from
                  contingency to norm” (9, xxv). The forces of normativity were therefore ones that
                  Thelwall would have confronted as an elocutionary scientist, and in several
                  important ways Thelwall stands in conflict with contemporary trends. His early
                  life helps to explain his direction: Thelwall was a lisper “from the imperfection
                  and irregular position of my teeth,” and he benefited from the techniques he
                  promoted as a speech therapist (<title level="m">Cline </title>19); he also
                  experienced voicelessness of a different kind as the subject of violent government
                  repression. Having experienced impairment and the inability to communicate freely,
                  Thelwall broke with many of his peers by developing an inclusive therapeutic
                  approach that addresses the social and functional consequences of “disability”
                  while humanizing the disabled. </p>
                  <p>Thelwall demonstrates a particular interest in those whose marginalized status was
                  largely due to their misunderstood speech impediments; for Thelwall these cases
                  were treatable, although they were “universally” thought to be beyond “remedy” or
                  “relief” (<title level="m">Results </title>2, 28). Thelwall “reject[s],
                  altogether, as far as the organization of the mouth is concerned, all distinction
                  of curable and incurable impediments” (<title level="m">Cline </title>145),
                  emphasizing and illustrating that what may appear to be biological and
                  inherent—and thus untreatable—may be at least partly accounted for by conditional
                  factors such as education, the influence of family members, fear, habit, and
                  trauma. He asserts that speech impediments are, “Most assuredly . . . with very
                  few exceptions,” “complicated with Moral and Intellectual causes” (<title level="m">Cline </title>61); “Impediments are, in a great degree, contagious”
                     (<title level="m">Vestibule</title> 9); and “very many” cases are “purely
                  mental and moral” (<title level="m">Cline </title>61). The word “apparent” appears
                  frequently throughout his elocutionary texts—e.g. “<title level="m">apparent
                  </title>deficiencies of mind,” “<title level="m">apparently</title> defective
                  faculties,” “apparent ineptitude”—signaling both the diagnostic failure of his
                  medical contemporaries and his pupils’ unrecognized potential (<title level="m">Cline</title> 44, 5, 59). Accordingly, Thelwall’s prognosis for nearly all
                  speech impediments is uniform, regardless of context and cause: “a correct and
                  impressive elocution is attainable by all” (<title level="m">Vestibule</title>
                     8).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Rockey indicates that when compared
                     to Victorian elocutionists, whose professional attention seemed to be focused
                     on “stuttering, lisping, and provincialisms” (“Logopaedic” 89), Thelwall’s
                     interests were remarkably broad, suggesting his optimism and willingness to
                     include a wide range of patients in his therapeutic project.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In practice, Thelwall’s insistence on the universal curability of speech
                  impediments imposes an obligation on impaired individuals to seek treatment. This
                  sense is underscored by his frequent references to disabilities as “evils” and,
                  less frequently, “calamities.” Although it may be professionally and economically
                  understandable, Thelwall’s emphasis on treatment is potentially problematical.
                  Disability scholars suggest that the imperative to treat or cure impairments often
                  goes hand in hand with the profound social exclusion of the disabled,<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Garland-Thomson and Wendell on the broad
                     social implications of an emphasis on treating and curing disabilities. In
                     discussing “[t]he widespread message that they [the disabled] are not good
                     enough until they are ‘cured,’” Wendell argues that “the drive to find ‘cures’
                     for disabilities can be seen, by those who appreciate disabilities as
                     differences, to be as much an attempt to wipe out difference as an effort to
                     relieve suffering” (83). </note> and that therapies and cures themselves can be
                  understood as “efforts to control or eradicate” undesirable “human attribute[s]”
                  (Freidson 212).</p>
                  <p>The framing of Thelwall’s elocutionary project, however, establishes his
                  professional services and techniques as ones that do not promote normative
                  assumptions or adhere to standard social hierarchies. “[N]ormative notions of
                  health produce a healthy bourgeois subject primarily by forcefully producing
                  others as infirm” (Grinnell 225); in contrast, Thelwall’s elocutionary principles
                  are not only therapies for the impaired, but techniques for improving the speech
                  of the able-bodied. They may “loose the tongue of the stammerer, and enable the
                  literary student to command, and the critic to comprehend, with certainty, the
                  genuine sources of grace and mellifluence” (<title level="m">Cline </title>4).
                  Here Thelwall not only resists pathologizing and marginalizing his impaired
                  patients, but goes so far as to suggest that their difference from the
                  respected—and presumably able-bodied—student and critic is a matter of degree, not
                  kind. Likewise, by treating politicians and clergymen alongside the congenitally
                  impaired, Thelwall relieves the stigma that often accompanies medical treatment,
                  creating in his London institution an alternate medico-educational system—one
                  might even say an alternate microcosmic democracy—in which the disabled and
                  able-bodied are part of a common project of self-improvement.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Thelwall reveals his continuing sense of sympathy and even
                     allegiance with the impaired when he asserts that they will rightly understand
                     the value of his techniques even if “senators, barristers, and divines may be
                     content to whine, and croak, and scream, in feeble and exhausting discord”
                        (<title level="m">Cline </title>27).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It also seems that the “evils” and “calamities” Thelwall seeks to address are not
                  his patients’ physical differences but rather the cultural and political
                  implications of their impairments. Throughout his elocutionary texts Thelwall
                  asserts that biological differences are separate from—and often less disabling
                  than—the social responses to those differences (e.g. indulgent parents, inadequate
                  education, personal fears). Thelwall resists surgery and dental prosthetics,
                  mainstream medical techniques that sought to replicate structural “normalcy” but
                  could hinder or altogether prevent a patient’s elocutionary progress. Instead he
                  emphasizes natural compensation, accommodation, and functional improvement—and
                  thus often leaves his patients’ physical variations unaffected.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Indeed, Thelwall asserts that “more serious
                     and irremediable mischiefs [are] produced . . . by giving the tongue too much
                     liberty” by medical intervention “than ever resulted from its too great
                     restriction” (<title level="m">Cline </title>50-51).</note> Thelwall’s
                  conception of therapeutic success is clear when he notes, not without
                  satisfaction, that despite the limits of a teenaged pupil’s progress “he has
                  already done that which, with a little care and attention, will enable him to pass
                  through life with extended means of comfort, utility and social enjoyment” (<title level="m">Results</title> 24). </p>
                  <p>Andrew McCann rightly identifies Thelwall’s elocutionary project as “equip[ping]
                  hitherto marginalized and disempowered subjects for active public life” (223), and
                  it is important that Thelwall did so not by forcing his patients to achieve “a
                  norm of embodiment—call it ‘the proper body’” (Youngquist xiv). Rather, he sought
                  to help his pupils participate in society by attaining “[g]eneral intelligibility”
                     (<title level="m">Results</title> 15). By insisting that physical differences
                  need not lead to speechlessness, and that impairments need not amount to permanent
                  social exclusion, Thelwall challenged the limits of mainstream medicine. He also
                  challenged normative beliefs, and thereby sought to change the constitution of the
                  public world.<note resp="editors" place="foot">The importance of social
                     participation should not be underestimated. As Susan Wendell underscores, there
                     is a fundamental connection between the exclusion of the disabled from the
                     public world and their lack of access to—and a lack of social and governmental
                     recognition of—their political and human rights (40-41). This is one of many
                     insights that leads Wendell to conclude that the devastating social
                     consequences of “disability” may warrant an individual’s desire for a cure,
                     even when the immutable realities of an impairment itself may not. It is on all
                     of these grounds that I do not wholly agree with McCann’s contention that
                     Thelwall’s gentlemen pupils and their professional ambitions suggest that
                     “assimilation into the institutions of bourgeois public life was the goal . . .
                     indicating an urge to bring students into the ambit of official political and
                     cultural authority, rather than an attempt to subvert its institutions” (225).
                  </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thelwall most strikingly deviates from normative beliefs by suggesting that
                  incurable impairments may, in fact, prove personally and communally beneficial. He
                  does so by describing the capacities and impact of two blind men: John Milton and
                  John Gough. Of course, it was not unusual to view blindness ambivalently, or even
                  positively, in Thelwall’s time. William R. Paulson argues that “The romantics
                  rediscover, or at least revive, the ancient topos of the blind poet or seer, a
                  visionary whose sight, having lost this world’s presence, is directed entirely
                  beyond to the spiritual” (14). Ossian, Milton, and Homer are obvious templates for
                  the trope, and Edward Larissy underscores the sense of nostalgia and “inward
                  vision” common to Romantic depictions of blindness (1).<hi rend="sup">
                        <note resp="editors" place="foot">According to Larissy, “The age . . .
                        understood that phenomenon as an historical one. Such visions were
                        appropriate to an earlier age” (1).</note>
                     </hi> But for Thelwall, unlike many of his contemporaries, Milton is very much of
                  this world, and Thelwall’s praise, unlike others’, is based on the impact of
                  sensory compensation on the poet’s literary technique: “is it not unlikely that
                  [Milton’s] blindness . . . might have given an increased portion of that strength,
                  that natural and copious melody, and that variety, to the rhythms and numbers of
                  his divine poem” (<title level="m">Cline </title>8). </p>
                  <p>Thelwall also describes the blindness of John Gough, whom he had met years before
                  in Kendal. Gough was a scientist, not a poet—a researcher depending on
                  empirical principles, not visionary powers—and Thelwall focuses on Gough’s
                  profession and his everyday life: <quote>Cut off, in his earliest infancy, from
                     all intercourse with the world of knowledge and observation, through the
                     customary inlet, the organ of sight, Mr. Gough has been induced . . . to
                     cultivate, with extreme diligence, the supplementary faculties of hearing and
                     of touch. The acute perfection to which the latter of these has been improved
                     and expanded, has been sufficiently demonstrated by the extent to which he has
                     carried his practical researches into the minutiae of the science of botany;
                     and the exquisiteness of his perceptions in the other kind—the promptitude with
                     which he discovers the stature of the merest stranger by the first resoundings
                     of his voice (of which I have myself been witness), and the facility with which
                     he recognizes the presence, and discriminates the identity of his acquaintance,
                     by merely listening to their respective breathings, equally illustrate the
                     unprecedented degree of improvement to which he has expanded his hearing
                     faculties: so that Mr. Gough is, in reality, one of those <title level="m">demonstrative instances</title> of the omnipotency of mental energy . . . .

                  of Jacobin self-improvement, effort, and perseverance. It seems, too, that Gough
                  has succeeded not in spite of his blindness, but in some measure because of it.
                  Indeed, Thelwall treats Gough’s compensatory senses as
                  singular—“unprecedented”—but also with a kind of reverence, referring to “the
                  exquisiteness of his perceptions in the other kind.” </p>
                  <p> Thelwall’s progressive attitude toward Milton’s and Gough’s blindness recalls
                  Susan Wendell’s assertion that disability may be seen as a “difference” with
                  “intrinsic value” and “sometimes extrinsic advantages” (67). Biological
                  differences themselves are not inherently negative characteristics for Thelwall.
                  He critiques and seeks to rectify the social conditions of “disability” and
                  emphasizes natural compensation rather than the elimination of physical
                  variations—and thus stands in opposition to those who cast impairments as
                  permanent, and even socially dangerous, defects. Thelwall’s elocutionary project
                  promotes the vision of a democracy in which all individuals may enjoy full
                  citizenship and all may have access to, may participate in, and may contribute to
                  society—with adequate support and to the best of their diverse abilities.</p>

                  <head>Idiocy and the Bounds of Human Improvement</head>
                  <p>Thelwall’s acceptance of biological difference is challenged when he turns his
                  attention to the cognitively impaired, whose place in society had long been
                  marginal. From the fourteenth century on, the “natural fool,” later called the
                  “idiot,” was known as an individual who permanently lacked any semblance of
                  “reason.” This definition remained surprisingly static, as did the list of things
                  that could earn an individual the title of “idiot,” first legally and later
                  medically. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, idiots were typically
                  cared for by their families and communities, and it was only at the close of the
                  eighteenth century that efforts to educate the cognitively impaired gained
                     popularity.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For an account of the

                  </p>
                  <p>Dominant cultural views about idiots largely determined their treatment. Without
                  “reason,” the idiot was without what John Locke defined as “That Faculty, whereby
                  Man is supposed to be distinguished from Beasts, and wherein it is evident he much
                  surpasses them” (434), providing an Enlightenment rationale for the common belief
                  that the idiot was more akin to animals than to man. Closer to Thelwall’s time,
                  Adam Smith theorized that the rational subject cannot sympathize with the
                  unreasoning man, “the poor wretch . . . who laughs and sings . . . and is
                  altogether insensible of his own misery” (15).<note resp="editors" place="foot">Elsewhere in this passage Smith refers specifically to the “madman,”
                     that other class of humanity thought to lack reason—though not from birth, and
                     not necessarily permanently. Although Smith registers particular horror at the
                     idea of losing one’s reason, his discussion of sympathy here hinges on the
                     state of unreason itself and its social implications—and not its
                     etiology.</note> In “The Idiot” (1798), Robert Southey adopted the phrase
                  “poor wretch” to describe Ned, the poem’s title character, whose macabre actions
                  and lack of understanding cannot but alienate the reader: unable to comprehend
                  death, he unearths his mother’s corpse and brings it home. Yet Ned’s abiding love
                  for his mother preserves for him some place in the human community, and the poem
                  consequently evinces a deep ambivalence towards the idiot that was typical of the
                  time. </p>
                  <p>Like many of his contemporaries, Thelwall hesitates when he turns his attention to
                  the cognitively impaired.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Though Southey
                     published his poem anonymously shortly before <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads
                     </title>(1798), Mary Jacobus has convincingly argued that he had the means and
                     motive to write his poem as a corrective response to the more progressive—and
                     thus unusual—“The Idiot Boy” by William Wordsworth. </note> Although he
                  accepted some idiots into treatment at his Institute, he notes that “Extreme cases
                  . . . for obvious reasons, cannot be admitted under my roof,” adding that “the
                  admission of disgusting objects” would detract from his own personal and
                  professional experience (<title level="m">Results </title>35). Nonetheless,
                  Thelwall maintains his goal of identifying patients whose impairments are not
                  beyond amelioration. In <title level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title> Thelwall
                  seeks to conceptualize and describe “moral” as opposed to “physical” idiocy, in
                  part by reprinting his correspondences with the blind scientist John Gough, who,
                  like Thelwall, was in an ideal position to understand the consequences of
                  “disability” and critique normative ideologies. Both men emphasize the
                  intellectual potential of moral idiots; as Thelwall explains, “there is a power in
                  educational folly and mistake, to distemper the brain, that might have been
                  tranquillized to consistency” (71). Gough asks of the Selborne idiot and his
                  obsessive interest in bees, “Was there not a time, when the activity and ingenuity
                  of this young idiot might have been diverted to nobler designs?” (111). Thelwall’s
                  descriptions of his educable idiots are supplemented by descriptions of his
                  sophisticated approach to specialized instruction, which requires “modes of
                  regulation, of stimulus, and restriction” carried out “by private superintendence
                  and direction of the education of the party” (146-147). Thelwall and Gough were
                  certainly not alone in their belief in the potential of idiots, nor in their
                  argument that some cases of apparent idiocy were due to improper education or
                  insufficient socialization. Although not a proponent of education for all idiots,
                  Jean Itard gained fame by insisting that circumstance was the cause of imbecility
                  for Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron, and that he was therefore educable.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Itard ultimately achieved some level of
                     success with his pupil, confirming the validity of his approach in the
                     public—and medical—eye. There is the strong suggestion that Itard’s goal with
                     Victor was largely intellectual, and his therapeutic approach implies a desire
                     to verify his philosophical beliefs about human development. This may help to
                     explain why Thelwall criticized his educational techniques (Rockey, “Origins”
                     164). For more on Victor and Itard, see McDonagh and Lane. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As with the earliest accounts of Victor, however, both Thelwall and Gough’s
                  descriptions of “moral idiots” hardly suggest improvability. Gough writes of the
                  “moral idiot” that “all his views [are] confined to his own person,” and
                  illustrates “this worst of human evils” by recalling the case of the Selborne
                  idiot, whose sole, solitary interest was in “hunting bees and wasps; which he
                  caught with surprising address, disarmed them with his naked hands, and sucked
                  their bodies” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 122, 110-11). He also describes M.
                  Barker, a “female idiot” from Kendal who would “cram” her “favourite food,” oat
                  bread, into her mouth so eagerly that it often had to be removed “by force, to
                  prevent suffocation” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 119). Thelwall introduces the
                  anti-social “unfortunate Augusta,” detailing “the calamities of this unhappy
                  child” as she climbs over furniture and sits on the ground, swaying her head and
                  “hum[ming], in a low and plaintive tone” in a “monotony of . . . action and . . .
                  tone” that puzzles Thelwall (<title level="m">Cline </title>93-94).</p>
                  <p>These moral idiots compellingly prefigure Leo Kanner’s groundbreaking 1943
                  descriptions of autism, suggesting Thelwall’s and Gough’s prescience and providing
                  an important context in which we can better understand their views of the
                  cognitively impaired. According to specialists, the Selborne idiot, M. Barker, and
                  Augusta “fall within the scope of modern definitions of autism” (van Balkom),<note resp="editors" place="foot">Retrospective diagnoses are necessarily
                     speculative, largely because of the incomplete psychological profiles afforded
                     by centuries-old documents. Nevertheless, having read <title level="m">A Letter
                        to Henry Cline</title>, Ingrid van Balkom, a specialist in autism spectrum
                     disorders and community mental health professional in the Netherlands, came to
                     her conclusions about the Selborne idiot, M. Barker, and Augusta based on a
                     number of diagnostic criteria. Michaeline Bresnahan, a psychiatric
                     epidemiologist at Columbia University, concurs. I am currently collaborating
                     with van Balkom and Bresnahan on a manuscript that will detail the ways that
                     Thelwall’s descriptions of “moral idiocy” anticipate twentieth century
                     understandings of autism. It should be noted that Rockey, too, comments in
                     passing that M. Barker may be autistic (“Logopaedic” 91), and that at the
                     conference “The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice” in October, 2009,
                     Gordon Bottomley explored the possibility that Augusta may have been autistic.
                     The 1938 descriptions of Hans Asperger also bear note here; they, along with
                     Kanner’s descriptions, form the foundation of current understandings about
                     autism spectrum disorders.</note> and are among the earliest such descriptions
                  on record.<note resp="editors" place="foot">A number of historical figures
                     have been recently associated with what we now call “autism,” as in the
                     now-famous mid-eighteenth-century legal case of Hugh Blair, the son of a
                     Scottish landowner. (See Houston and Frith’s analysis of the case.) Lorna Wing
                     asserts of Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron—whom, crucially, Thelwall connects
                     to Augusta—“There can be no doubt that [he] was autistic” (14), and another of
                     Thelwall’s contemporaries, John Haslam, included a possible case of autism in
                        <title level="m">Observations on Madness and Melancholy </title>(1809).
                  </note> Thelwall and Gough also may well provide the first “description of the key
                  characteristics of autism in a group of children” (van Balkom). Moreover, by
                  focusing on social disconnection, their category of “moral idiocy” significantly
                  captures a central feature of autism.<hi rend="sup">
                        <note resp="editors" place="foot">It should be noted that Thelwall and
                        Gough also describe cases of “moral idiocy” that deviate from modern
                        definitions of “autism,” although they do possess key autistic features and
                        behaviors. </note>
                     </hi> Because autism continues to pose unique and often acute challenges to
                  doctors, teachers, and families, we may better understand the difficulties and
                  frustrations that likely led Thelwall to remark that “no species of imbecility
                  appears to us so hopeless as that which is complicated with vicious habits, and
                  the absence of social sympathy” (<title level="m">Results</title> 47). </p>
                  <p>In the context of autism we may also more fully appreciate Thelwall’s and Gough’s
                  determination to educate moral idiots and their faith in human improvement—even in
                  the least hopeful of cases, which they depict in the starkest of terms. Gough, for
                  example, describes a mute moral idiot who “had been reduced by injudicious
                  tenderness, to the state of a parasitical being” (<title level="m">Cline
                  </title>112-113); his emphasis, however, is on his sense that early intervention
                  could have altered the course of the man’s life. And Thelwall, while admitting
                  that he is “exceedingly doubtful” that Augusta, “this poor child,” will ever be
                  capable of “intelligible speech,” nevertheless asserts that there is some small
                  hope to be had in the “persevering assiduity of an intelligent superintendant”
                     (<title level="m">Cline</title> 94, 96). There is even perceptible hope and
                  determination when Thelwall introduces two extreme cases of moral idiocy: “In one,
                  those faculties, tho not actually extinct, were an inert and unvivified mass, that
                  required the Promethean torch; in the other, they seemed to exist only in
                  scattered particles; or, at best only in fragments, or disjointed parts, that
                  needed the articulation of connective ligament” (<title level="m">Results</title>
                     64).<note resp="editors" place="foot">In their desire to suggest the
                     improvability of “moral idiots,” Gough and Thelwall also anticipated Leo
                     Kanner’s unfortunate misunderstanding about the etiology of autism. Though
                     Gough leaves open the possibility of natural antisocial inclinations, he also
                     remarks on the “mischief” that “may be done to the faculties by an improper
                     education” (<title level="m">Cline </title>110), and Thelwall more emphatically
                     connects moral idiocy to educational failures, insisting “<title level="m">the
                        parents are sometimes the disease</title>” (<title level="m">Results</title>
                     56). Kanner similarly “stress[ed] the contributory effects of parental lack of
                     warmth on constitutionally predisposed children” (Wolff 204). Interestingly,
                     Thelwall is much more forgiving of the parents of a nine-year-old moral idiot
                     in <title level="m">Results of Experience</title>: “If any thing had been
                     wrong, it was that which almost inevitably resulted from the kind sympathies
                     and best feelings of an amiable family” (67). It is unclear whether this
                     represents a development in Thelwall’s attitudes or a fondness for those
                     particular parents, though the text strongly suggests both.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his project to “rescue . . . my unhappy fellow beings from Idiocy,” Thelwall
                  aspires, “even in cases the most unfavourable,” to appeal to the “general
                  necessities, arising out of the mere animal appetites” which “may be made
                  instrumental . . . to a considerable degree” (<title level="m">Cline </title>105,
                  124). Thus even the most organically impaired physical idiot or most withdrawn
                  moral idiot may learn to communicate his hunger or his pain more effectively,
                  potentially life-altering improvements, even if they do not guarantee full
                  participation in public discourse. Particularly in <title level="m">Results of
                     Experience</title>, moreover, Thelwall’s language is deeply humanizing, as when
                  he comments that in cases of idiocy, whenever “the moral and social sympathies . .
                  . can be properly awakened, there is always hope: for the heart is the best
                  rectifier of the head; as, in certain cases, the head is also of the heart”
                     (<title level="m">Results </title>59-60).</p>
                  <p>The ideological significance of Thelwall’s and Gough’s view of idiocy becomes
                  apparent when considered in light of nineteenth-century developments in the care
                  of idiots. In keeping with Jean Itard’s principles, five voluntary institutions
                  for the care, education, and training of idiot children were created in Britain
                  between the late 1840s and late 1860s. According to David Gladstone, these
                  charitable institutions “were established within a climate of optimistic
                  expectations of improvement” (139), though their admissions process—they
                  considered only those young idiots who were thought to be the most highly
                  educable—suggests more modest optimism and determination than Thelwall and Gough
                  displayed. </p>
                  <p>In the decades that followed, the normative views that Thelwall and Gough resisted
                  gave rise to increasingly exclusionary attitudes towards idiots—attitudes with
                  widespread social, medical, and political consequences. In the latter half of the
                  nineteenth century, individuals and eugenics groups began to advocate publicly for
                  the permanent institutional confinement of idiots, insisting on their
                  unimprovability and even danger. One such advocate, Mary Dendy, declared
                  feeble-mindedness an “evil which will, if unchecked, bring ruin upon our nation,
                  and that before very long” (758). Such ideas were discussed in mainstream medical
                  journals including <title level="m">The Lancet</title> and <title level="m">The
                     British Medical Journal</title>, and helped to secure the successful passage of
                  the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913, whereby state funding for facilities replaced
                  charitable funding, institutional residence for idiots became lifelong, and the
                  government took control over admissions.<note resp="editors" place="foot">In the wake of the act, idiots could be removed from their families under the
                     charge of “neglect,” and family wishes—and even objections—were often ignored.
                     For an excellent survey of the broad impact of the 1913 Act, see Thomson, who
                     indicates that there are cases on record in which individuals attempted to help
                     idiot family members escape from involuntary confinement in asylums. Also see
                     Jackson.</note> Thus institutions for idiots “became essentially segregative,
                  isolating ‘defectives’ to stop them from breeding” (Porter, <title level="m">Benefit</title> 507), and by the 1930s there were campaigns in Britain for the
                  voluntary sterilization of those with cognitive impairments.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Such attitudes were by no means confined to discussions of
                     idiocy. As the nineteenth century progressed, Darwinian theories of evolution
                     became increasingly important to attitudes about diverse medicalized classes
                     and the progress of the human race; as Janet Browne notes, <title level="m">Origin of Species</title> “provid[ed] a biological backing for human
                     warfare and notions of racial superiority” (107). In the 1880s Francis Galton
                     began to publish material on his theory of eugenics, and the late nineteenth
                     and early twentieth centuries witnessed the institutional confinement,
                     sterilization, and even death of countless individuals whose impairments were
                     deemed dangerous to the present and future wellbeing of society. For an
                     examination of disability and eugenics—and speculations as to why it remains a
                     largely unacknowledged topic—see chapter three of Snyder and Mitchell. Also see

                  <head>“Disability” and Thelwall’s Democratic Legacy</head>
                  <p>Key aspects of twenty-first century medicine took shape in the decades after John
                  Thelwall’s death, and we are still all too familiar with the legacy left us by the
                  Victorian medical establishment. Disability theorists contend that we still live
                  under the assumption that impairments are always deficits, that the impaired are a
                  drain to society, and that a cure is always preferable to living with an
                  impairment. In this context the Romantics require another look for their diverse
                  figurations of the impaired body and impaired mind, and few matched Thelwall in
                  his progressive treatment of medicalized individuals. Thelwall articulates a
                  humane and humanizing method of interacting with his pupils, one that is
                  characterized by a democratic sense of respect and the pursuit of common goals. In
                  seeking to identify cases in which improvement is possible, Thelwall brought the
                  impaired in from the margins—and along the way seems to have anticipated what we
                  now know of as autism. Finally, he recognizes the benefits of certain impairments,
                  prefiguring current approaches to disability as a potentially valuable, enriching
                  human variation. It is almost certain that Thelwall’s elocutionary career was
                  meant to keep him at a safe distance from politics. Yet in this, “the <title level="m">New Profession</title>, to which [he] devoted [his] maturer years,”
                  Thelwall lent his voice to an ideological struggle, one that, like the political
                  struggles of the 1790s, came to shape the treatment of whole classes of Western
                  society for the next two centuries.</p>
