               <affiliation>University of Northern Colorado</affiliation></byline>

            <p> In the early Romantic period, John Thelwall was infamous for both his defiant
               volubility and subsequent silencing.<hi> </hi>According to E. P. Thompson, “the story
               of the silencing of Thelwall” (95) begins in 1795 with the passage of the Treasonable
               Practices Act and the Seditious Meetings Act and culminates with Thelwall’s decision
               to become a teacher of elocution—a decision signaling that “nothing survived of the
               Patriot except his fading notoriety” (123).<hi> </hi>Perhaps no portrait better
               captures the drastic turn in Thelwall’s career than George Crabbe’s caricature of
               Thelwall as the radical lecturer Hammond in the verse tale <title level="m">The Dumb
                  Orators; or, the Benefit of Society</title>
              (1812).<note resp="editors" place="end" n="1">
                   In assuming that Thelwall is the model for Crabbe’s Hammond, I follow
                     Thompson, “Overlooking History,” Scrivener, and Edwards. 
               </note> In <title level="m">The Dumb Orators</title>, Hammond first stupefies a
               Church-and-State orator using “Deist’s scorn” and “rebel’s wit,” but later gets his
               just deserts when the political tide turns (192). Hammond, who ironically earlier
               used “licentious words” to prove “that liberty of speech was gone,” ultimately
               devolves into a stuttering isolate (223-24). Under the critical eyes of loyalists,
               Hammond loses the liberty of speech that he prematurely lamented:
            <quote><lg><l>I seek no favour—I—the Rights of Man!</l>
               <l>Claim; and I—nay!—but give me leave—and I</l>
               <l>Insist—a man—that is—and in reply,</l>
               <l>I speak. (455-58)</l></lg></quote>
            Though a smug parable, Crabbe’s tale had its basis in reality. Thelwall, who had
               overcome a speech impediment of his own, lectured to thousands in the early 1790s,
               but by the end of the decade he had been made, effectively, dumb: first by the
               “Gagging Acts” of 1795 and then by “dwindling interest” in his public lectures
               (Claeys xxvii).<note resp="editors" place="end" n="2"> Thelwall discloses in <title
                     level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title> that he once suffered from a lisp
                  (19). </note> Forcibly deprived of the freedom to express his political views,
               Thelwall changed careers to become an elocutionist who sought to cure speech
               impediments, mutism, and “moral idiocy”—conditions that had formerly been the
               province of “deaf and dumb” schools (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 124, 84). </p>
            <p> As Thompson’s account suggests, Thelwall’s elocutionary career has frequently been
               understood as a renunciation of his revolutionary politics. Thelwall himself
               encouraged this view, claiming that his “New Profession” returned him to the
               “calmness of physiological disquisition” he had experienced as an auditor of medical
               lectures at Guy’s Hospital before he was “hurried . . . away” by the “excentric fire
               of youth” into politics (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 2). Thelwall scholars
               such as Judith Thompson, however, have questioned this account and argued that
               Thelwall’s “speech theory emerges as part of a total system to reform the body
               politic” (“Re-sounding Romanticism” 24). Though a number of scholars have drawn
               connections between the scientific materialism that informs Thelwall’s speech theory
               and the political materialism that informs his revolutionary opinions, there has not
               yet been a thorough explanation of how Thelwall thought an “enfranchisement of
               fettered organs” would manifestly contribute to an expansion of the franchise (<title
                  level="m">Henry Cline</title> 9). In other words, how did Thelwall see his work as
               an elocutionist as a continuation of his work as a political activist? In this essay
               I begin to answer this question by uncovering the model of mind that guides both
               Thelwall’s elocutionary work and his political philosophy. First, I establish the
               model of the mind Thelwall develops in elocutionary texts such as <title level="m">A
                  Letter to Henry Cline</title> (1810). Then, I turn to Thelwall’s <title level="m"
                  >An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793), an early
               “physiological disquisition” that provides the scientific basis for his model of mind
               and speech theory. Finally, I look at the rhetoric of Thelwall’s arguments in support
               of free association to show that Thelwall’s scientific interests inform both his
               political philosophy and his elocutionary theory.</p>
            <div type="section"><head>1.</head>
            <p> In a recent article, Judith Thompson compares Coleridge’s conversation poems to
               Thelwall’s and concludes that Thelwall is “more concerned with modulations of voice
               than associations of the mind, and with building a co-responding society than with
               correspondent breezes” (“Why Kendal?” 18).<note resp="editors" place="end" n="3">
                   For more on the poetic relationship between Thelwall and Coleridge, see
                     Thompson, “An Autumnal Blast.”
               </note> I agree with Thompson’s assessment that Thelwall, unlike Coleridge,
               maintained his political ideals even in retirement. However, as I will show, Thelwall
               also maintained a commitment to associationist psychology. In fact, I argue that it
               is precisely because of his continued commitment to associationism that Thelwall was
               able to continue his reformist agenda after he became an elocutionist. As we will
               see, for Thelwall modulations of voice are not opposed to associations of the mind
               but rather depend on them. Likewise, strong corresponding societies depend on strong
               correspondences in the brain. </p>
            <p> Thelwall explicitly attests to the power of mental associations in “On the Influence
               of the Scenery of Nature on the Intellectual and Moral Character, as well as the
               Taste and Imagination” (1820), an essay first published in his newspaper<hi> </hi>
               <title level="m">The Champion</title>. Here, many years after Coleridge rejected
               Hartleian thought, Thelwall continues to appeal to associationist theory.<note
                  resp="editors" place="end" n="4">
                   In the 1790s Coleridge had praised Hartley’s work (and even named his son
                     Hartley). But on March 16, 1801, he exclaimed that he had “overthrown the
                     doctrine of associationism, as taught by Hartley, and with it all the
                     irreligious metaphysics of modern infidels” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2: 706).
                     Later, in his notebooks, Coleridge definitively rejected “modern
                     Hartleio-Locklean Metaphysics, with its Impressions, Ideas, and Sensations, and
                     its Jack of all Trades, Association” (qtd. in Ford 16). 
               </note> In his essay, Thelwall refutes two anonymous writers who deny that our
               natural environment has any influence on our intellectual or emotional identity.
               Thelwall rejects their claims, saying that if we did not immediately see their
               denials as “Affectation” we would pronounce them to be “the verbiage of idiotism”
               (74). Neglecting the importance of scenery to our internal state is “idiotism”
               according to Thelwall because it denies “the whole doctrine of associations” and
               turns a human being into 
            <quote>a sort of abstract entity whose ideas are all innate and independent of perception;
               and whose senses are mere superfluous appendages, not ministers to his intellectual
               perfectibility: a sort of filigree on the outside of a tea caddee, that neither
               contributes to the flavour nor the preservation of the aromatic luxury within. (74) </quote>
            Unlike the filigree, or decorative work, on the outside of a tea caddy, which plays
               no part in keeping tea fresh, the senses are instead like the material of the caddy
               itself, which contributes to the flavor of the tea. The metaphor is not perfect:
               whereas the caddy isolates the tea from external influence, the senses do the exact
               opposite, allowing exterior images and scenes to enter into, impress, and change the
               mind. Yet, despite the imperfection of the metaphor, it nonetheless sheds light on
               Thelwall’s model of mind and its connection to his political theory. In Thelwall’s
               image of the mind-as-tea-caddy, perceptions associate thoughts and, through
               progressive influence, lead a person toward (or away from) what he calls
               “intellectual perfectibility” (“On the Influence” 74). Whereas Wordsworth famously
               illustrated the integration of mind and nature by tracing “the manner in which we
               associate ideas in a state of excitement” (597), Thelwall used associationism to
               provide philosophical evidence that lived conditions and intercourse with others
               influenced how citizens experienced their world and, in turn, influenced their
               ability to contribute to that world. </p>
            <p> It is fitting that Thelwall, who sought to explain vitality itself according to “the
               simple principle of materialism,” would imagine the mind as a tangible object
                  and,<hi> </hi>moreover, as an object of commerce (<emph>Animal Vitality</emph>
               13). By taking the “necessary luxury” of tea as his image, Thelwall universalizes
               what would normally be a private possession.<note resp="editors" place="end" n="5">
                  Here, I am referencing the title of Fromer’s book.</note> Thelwall suggests that
               though the mind, like tea, is a material object, it is not a commodity and does not
               gain value when locked against external influence.<note resp="editors" place="end"
                  n="6">
                  In 1833, Thomas Wontner warned his readers that caddies should be locked to
                     protect tea from being stolen by servants (704). Caddies often had locks for
                     expressly this purpose.
               </note> On the contrary, he suggests that intellectual perfectibility is only
               possible when there is associative communication between the permeable borders of
               mind and world. </p>
            <p> In his elocutionary treatises, Thelwall similarly represents the minds of those with
               speech defects as imperfect because of their impermeability. In both cases, mental
               associations are “ministers to . . . intellectual perfectibility” and, as such, can
               either create or inhibit a relationship between the body of the individual and the
               body politic (“On the Influence” 74). A speech defect occurs, Thelwall posits, when
               the mind cannot associate the intention to speak with the physical organs that
               produce speech. Those who want to talk simply cannot. Unlike many physicians of the
               time, Thelwall vehemently denies that “defects of organization have any thing to do
               with any of the various descriptions of Impediment” in speech (<title level="m">Henry
                  Cline</title> 54). Rather, Thelwall blames speech impediments on a “diseased
               association” of ideas brought on by miseducation or emotional trauma (<title
                  level="m">Henry Cline</title> 59). By proposing that speech pathology originates
               in the space between ideas, or in the mental action connecting ideas, Thelwall can
               also propose that such pathology requires educational, rather than medical,
               intervention. While this theory helped Thelwall market his services as a teacher of
               elocution, it also helped him to suggest that impediments to speech were also
               impediments to sociability, and ultimately, to participation in the public sphere. </p>
            <p> The gravest consequence of speech impediments, for Thelwall, was the enforced
               antisociality that they caused. In his case study of a young woman with a severe
               speech defect, Thelwall’s goal was not to teach her to speak properly but to “rescue
               her from the misery of being in eternal solitude, even in the midst of society” (64).
               According to Thelwall, speech impediments were necessarily restrictive to sociality
               for two reasons. Not only did they keep a person from being able to speak, but they
               also impaired a person’s willingness to speak.<note resp="editors" place="end" n="7">
                   For another view on Thelwall’s theory of speech pathology, see Langan.
               </note> Both prevented individuals from developing bonds with society. Thelwall went
               so far as to call speech impediment a kind of idiocy, a term used in the period for a
               variety of mental disorders that interfered with sociality. In his letter to Cline,
               Thelwall exclaimed: “What, but a species of idiotcy [sic], is it, to be ignorant of the
               means by which the will is to influence the simplest organs of volition, and (without
               excuse of palsy, stricture, or organic privation) to be unable to move a lip, a
               tongue, or a jaw?” (68). It is telling that Thelwall chose to call all individuals
               with speech defects “idiots” (Gk. “private person”), as the private, or isolated,
               “idiot” was necessarily excluded from the public sphere.<hi> </hi>As Avital Ronell
               explains, from Plutarch through the nineteenth century, “the term ‘idiot’ expresses
               social and political inferiority; it is not a certificate of citizenship—the idiot is
               the one who is not a citizen (<emph>politēs</emph>)” (41).<hi> </hi>Without
               the ability to associate the will to speak with the organs of speech, individuals
               with speech defects could not exercise their natural right of participatory
               citizenship. This right, Thelwall declared, “constitutes the essential attribute of
               our species” (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 17). One of the major tenets of
               Thelwall’s political philosophy was that “man is, by his very nature, social and
               communicative” and “whatever presses men together . . . is favorable to the diffusion
               of knowledge and ultimately promotive of human liberty” (<emph>Rights of
                  Nature</emph> 400).<hi> </hi>For Thelwall, individuals who could not communicate
               with others were unnaturally denied social freedom. To put it simply,<hi
               > </hi>impediments to speech were also impediments to liberty. </p>
            <p> Thelwall described the process by which the teacher of elocution could cure the
               antisociality of his pupils and encourage them to rejoin society as follows:
            <quote>restore, or produce those essential links of association, between the physical
               perception and the mental volition, and between the mental volition and the organic
               action, which either have some how been broken, or have never properly been
               formed—and the stammerer, the stutterer, the throttler, the endless reiterator, and
               almost the whole order of unfortunate persons, whose impediments consist in
               obstructed utterance, are relieved from their affliction: no matter what were the
               original circumstances that broke, or interrupted those associations . . . . (<title
                  level="m">Henry Cline</title> 58)</quote>
            However, Thelwall advised that in order to repair a pupil’s associative capacity, the
               teacher first had to “impress the [pupil’s] perceptive faculty” by appealing to her
               “imagination” (<title level="m">Henry Cline</title> 58-59). In his case studies,
               Thelwall accomplished this by making his pupils verbally request the things they
               desired. Too often, Thelwall explained, a child with a speech defect would have her
               needs predicted and met without having to open her mouth. The harmful consequence of
               this was that she never learned to regard intelligible speech as a useful means of
               satisfying her desires, and as a result, often avoided speaking at all. The teacher’s
               first task, then, was to compel the pupil to communicate. To do so, Thelwall used
               “attractive object[s]” to awaken the pupil’s imagination and “impress” her perception
               by forcefully directing her attention to objects in the world (115). For example, if
               a pupil liked to gather honey, Thelwall required her to make her goal known to others
               before she would be allowed to travel to the beehive. She had to be prevented from
               using “the mute effort of solitary ingenuity” to meet her goal (124). Rather, her
               goal had to be “socially presented, as a motive for some proper species of exertion”
               (124). Thelwall believed that by exerting themselves in social interaction, pupils
               would be forced to unite objects of perception (such as honeycombs) with ideas of
               those objects and, eventually, with intelligible signifiers for those ideas. Thelwall
               maintained that if a pupil could consciously make links between perception and will
               through speech (however imperfect) she would also unconsciously create or repair
               associations in the brain. With re-formed associations, the pupil would then be able
                  to<hi> </hi>associate the will and the body. She would be able to connect her
               desire to move her jaw with the muscles that moved her jaw and, thus, produce more
               perfect speech. Here, as in the example of the tea caddy, Thelwall used
               associationism to explain how perception of the external world influenced the will,
               which, in turn, bound the individual to the world.<hi> </hi>

            <div type="section"><head>2.</head>
            <p> In attempting to strengthen the power of mental associations in his pupils, Thelwall
               was in a sense continuing his earlier efforts to strengthen the power of reformist
               associations. In <emph>Animal Vitality</emph>, Thelwall revealed the physiological
               basis of his associationist philosophy. Most notably, he established a materialist
               model of the mind that made it synonymous with the brain. As Alan Richardson has
               shown, the 1790s, like the 1990s, were “a decade of the brain,” in which models of
               the mind were revised in response to materialist advances in medicine and philosophy
               (2). The 1790s saw Joseph Priestley popularize David Hartley’s physiological
               associationism (1790), Erasmus Darwin theorize the embodied mind in
                  <emph>Zoonomia</emph> (1794‑96), and Luigi Galvani publish his initial theory of
               animal electricity (1791). Thelwall was well aware of these major developments in
               brain‑mind science and evidenced this awareness in his writings.</p>
            <p> One of Thelwall’s central goals in <emph>Animal Vitality</emph> was to disprove John
               Hunter’s theory that blood is the source of life. Instead, Thelwall asked his
               colleagues to consider that the “life of the animal is in the brain, rather than in
               the blood” (15). Although Thelwall indicated the primacy of the brain as an organ
               that registered vitality, he made it clear he did not want to “rob the blood of its
               vital honours, to bestow them on the Brain and Nerves” (29). Rather, Thelwall
               contended, vitality issued from integrated bodily organization motivated by a
               stimulus and identified the stimulus as the “electric fluid” (41). In suggesting that
               the electric fluid stimulated life, but was not itself living, Thelwall likely
               followed Erasmus Darwin, of whose work he was clearly aware.<note resp="editors"
                  place="end" n="8"> In a 1795 political lecture, Thelwall praised “the sublime
                  projects of Dr. Darwin” (<emph>Tribune</emph> 114). He also discussed Darwin’s
                  theory of life with Coleridge (<emph>Letters</emph> 1: 294). </note>
               <hi> </hi>In his medical treatise <emph>Zoonomia</emph>, Darwin claimed that “the
               electric fluid may act only as a more potent stimulus exciting the muscular fibres
               into action, and not supplying them with a new quantity of the spirit of life”
               (1.12.83). For Darwin, the word “stimulus” referred not only to the “application of
               external bodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres . . . [but also to] desire
               or aversion when they excite into action the power of volition; and lastly, the
               fibrous contractions which precede association” (1.2.13). The electric fluid induced
               both muscular contraction and mental association. As Darwin put it, just as
               successive muscular contractions are associated with one another, ideas “are
               associated with many other trains and tribes of ideas” through excitation of the
               fibrous tissue in the body induced by the electric fluid (1.9.60). Thelwall seems to
               have agreed that the electric fluid was responsible for super-inducing absent
               associations or repairing broken ones.<hi> </hi>In his elocutionary texts, he
               stressed “the phenomena of the action and re‑action of the physical and mental
               causes—and the operation, in particular, of mental, moral, and educational stimuli
               upon the frame and fibre—the senses and the organic function” (<emph>Results of
                  Experience </emph>172). For the most part, the educational stimuli chosen by
               Thelwall was his own speech. Like the electric fluid, his speech was meant to excite
               the body of his listener into creating new associations. Because Thelwall claimed
               that “the individual body and the social body do exactly agree,” it is reasonable to
               conclude that he understood the speech of the political activist, like the speech of
               the elocutionary master, as a vital stimulus (<emph>Tribune</emph> 114).</p>
            <p> Indeed, much the same model of mind surfaces in Thelwall’s political rhetoric. Just
               as the voice of the teacher of elocution re-formed associations in the minds of his
               listeners, the voice of the political orator reformed how his listeners associated
               with one another. As Nicholas Roe, Michael Scrivener, and others have noted, Thelwall
               used his medical knowledge to create particularly effective Jacobin analogies between
               a vital, organized human body and a vital, organized body politic.<note

                   See Scrivener, Roe 173-81, Allard 63-86, and Jackson 44-58. 
               </note> To this I would add that it is the logic of associationist psychology that
               informs these analogies and makes them viable. In <emph>The Natural and
                  Constitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and
                  Freedom of Association </emph>(1795) Thelwall takes up the question of social
               association itself. Here, Thelwall argues for free association between citizens as
               the only means by which the power of the body politic can fairly counter the power of
               the king. Thelwall explains:
            <quote>For as the Royal Power is concentrated in a single person, girt and surrounded by
               Ministers of his own appointment; and as the aristocratic body is also intimately
               encorporated, if the people are not permitted to <emph>associate</emph> and
                  <emph>knit themselves together</emph> for the vindication of their
               rights, how shall they frustrate attempts which will inevitably be made against their
               liberties? The scattered million, however unanimous in feeling, is but chaff in the
               whirlwind. It must be <emph>pressed together</emph> to have any weight.
               Deny them the right of <emph>association</emph>, and a handful of powerful
               individuals, united by the common ties of interest, and grasping the wealth of the
               Nation, may easily persevere in projects hostile to the wishes, and ruinous to the
               interests of mankind . . . . (46, emphasis added) </quote>
            In this passage, Thelwall opposes the body of the King to the body of the people; the
               King’s power is consolidated in one physical body, and the power of the aristocracy
               is similarly “encorporated.” The people, however, lack such incorporation. As a
               consequence, Thelwall maintains, they must be given the freedom to associate in order
               to have the weight of a healthy body that can confront the power of the king man to
               man, as it were. James Robert Allard connects this passage to a similar passage in
                  <emph>Rights of Nature </emph>to suggest that, “Thelwall again implies that <emph>organization</emph>, ‘press[ing] men together’ is necessary for reform”
               (72, emphasis added), However, it is clear here that<hi> </hi>what presses men
               together is <emph>association</emph> rather than <emph>organization</emph>. Though “organization” and “association” can be used
               interchangeably as nouns to mean “a body of people with a particular purpose”
               (“Organization,” def. 4a), as we saw in <emph>Animal Vitality</emph>, “organization”
               for Thelwall means the arrangement of elements within a larger system, such as organs
               in the body. But by “association,” as it is developed here and in the elocutionary
                  texts,<hi> </hi>Thelwall likely means the <emph>act</emph> of people
               coming together to form a group with a common purpose. That is, only when citizens
               are allowed to gather together in the same space can they achieve what Georgina Green
               calls “embodied communication” (80). Although distinguishing between arrangement and
               act may seem like a minor point, it allows us to differentiate between the material
               structure of a system and the stimulus that joins together the elements of that
               system, allows communication between them, and thus vitalizes the whole.<hi> </hi>For
               Thelwall, it is not so much the structure that vitalizes the state, but the dynamic
               connections between people within that structure. As in the body, these dynamic
               connections are figured as material associations and, as we will see, the stimulus is
               figured as electricity. With the passage of the Seditious Meetings Act (which
               prohibited public meetings of over 50 people), associations became “diseased” and the
               speech of the citizens as “one heart, one voice, one sentiment” became as defective
               and antisocial as that of the individuals Thelwall would later treat (“Peaceful
               Discussion” 226). </p>
            <p> The cure for the diseased associations of society, as for the diseased associations
               of the individual, was the intervention of a political teacher who could communicate
               the electric stimulus to his listeners. Noel Jackson persuasively suggests that, for
               Thelwall, the stimulus or electric spark that animates the state and keeps it vital
               is the printed press. As evidence, Jackson cites Thelwall’s development of Burke’s
               metaphor of the press as an electrical conductor.<hi> </hi>Burke regretted that the
               press encouraged middle-class ambition by carrying “electrick communication”
               throughout pre-revolutionary France (186). But Thelwall esteemed “that prompt
               conductor and disseminator of intellect, the press,” for the same reason
                  (<emph>Rights of Nature</emph> 426). Moreover, Thelwall represented himself, and
               the press, as the instruments through which “electrick communication” traveled.
               Although Thelwall thought the printed word was important for associating people, he
               also made it clear that the press had limited efficacy when people were “scattered”
               throughout Britain and not allowed to gather in the same space (<emph>Natural
                  Right</emph> 46). Thelwall cautioned that without the ability to publicly
               associate and, as a group, determine a course of action, people would be driven to
               form factions and exchange violent crime for peaceful protest. Without “<emph>public association,</emph>” Thelwall warned, there would be “<emph>private cabals</emph>” (<emph>Natural Right</emph> 46). Without the
               ability to speak with a collective voice, individuals would brood “over thoughts they
               dare not utter” (<emph>Natural Right</emph> 46). When Thelwall used his lectures to
               rouse “a sluggish and insensate people” from a “drowsy stupor, creeping over the
               frozen nerve of misery,” then, he did not so much suggest that the materiality of the
               printed word educated people by acting on their bodies, but rather that the spoken
               word carried a material current that allowed electricity to move freely from body to
               body (<emph>Rights of Nature</emph> 391). As in his account of a 1795 political
               lecture where “every sentence darted from breast to breast with electric contagion” (qtd. in C. Thelwall 367),
               Thelwall represented his sentences as electric because they associated word to
               thought and speaker to listener. Like the electric fluid
               acting on the animal body, the electric word sustained vitality by catalyzing
               associations in the body politic. This vital transmission was only possible when
               people were allowed to come together in the same space to speak and to hear others
               speak.</p>
            <p> As an orator, Thelwall intervened between his listeners’ perceptions and their wills
               in order to reform the associations of the state’s diseased body. As a teacher of
               elocution, he extended his reformist associationism. Far from being the dumb orator
               Crabbe mocked, Thelwall instead continued to encourage free speech and defeat
               antisociality. Antisociality, which could stem from “regret, repining melancholy, and
               dissatisfaction,” impeded reform because the “man who considers himself as an
               isolated individual . . . [becomes] barren to himself and injurious, or at least
               unproductive, to society” (<emph>Tribune</emph> 224-5). This antisociality, Thelwall
               claimed, was a by-product of “the selfish system” of an increasingly capitalist
               economy and was only exacerbated by the prohibition against public meetings
                  (<emph>Tribune</emph> 224). Like those restricted from speaking because of
               governmental legislation, those with speech impediments suffered from “diseased
               associations” that hindered them from contributing to public discourse (<title
                  level="m">Henry Cline</title> 59). As Michael Scrivener has shown, for Thelwall,
               “mind is not individualistic but a product of ‘associated intellect’ within the
               public sphere” (181). Thus, once we understand Thelwall’s material model of mind, we
               see that ministering to the speech defects of others was a political act. As a
               teacher of elocution and as a political activist, Thelwall was pursuing a common end:
               strengthening the associations of the minds that inhabited, and created, the public
               sphere. </p></div>
