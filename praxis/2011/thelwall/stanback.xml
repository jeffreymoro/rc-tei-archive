            <head>Disability and Dissent: Thelwall’s Elocutionary Project</head>

               <affiliation>CUNY Graduate Center</affiliation></byline>
            <p>Recent scholarship has demonstrated the rich possibilities of Romantic science and
               the political, philosophical, and social significance of its diverse lines of
               inquiry. In the early 1790s John Thelwall participated in the ideologically charged
               conversations of science, medicine, and materialism while attending lectures at St.
               Thomas’s and Guy’s hospitals and as a member of the Physical Society.<note
                  resp="editors" place="foot" n="1">Notably, Thelwall lent his voice to the debate
                  surrounding the vital principle, which was often cast as a conflict between
                  traditional values and the radical, Jacobin ideals represented by materialism.
                  Nicholas Roe convincingly ventures that Thelwall’s materialist <title level="m">An
                     Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793), as well as an
                  essay on sensation, may have been key contributing factors to his 1794 treason
                  charge (188).</note> After his 1794 treason trial and the government repression
               that followed, Thelwall turned to elocutionary science, “the <title level="m">New
                  Profession</title>, to which I have devoted my maturer years” (<title level="m"
                  >Cline</title> 2). This “<title level="m">New Profession</title>” has been
               understood as ideologically neutral in comparison to Thelwall’s earlier involvement
               in radical politics and materialist science—yet the political and humanistic
               implications of his elocutionary project are significant, and reveal an enduring
               dedication to democratic ideals.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="2">Michael
                  Scrivener, Andrew McCann, Nicholas Roe, and J. R. Allard have all argued for some
                  sense of political continuity across Thelwall’s diverse career. For Scrivener,
                  however, Thelwall’s elocutionary writings “are largely apolitical—or political in
                  an allegorical way” (285); similarly, for McCann, “As an elocutionist . . .
                  Thelwall had cast off politics” (223). It was a sense that Thelwall himself
                  certainly strove to cultivate, and in <title level="m">A Letter to Henry
                     Cline</title> he distances himself from “the excentric fire of youth,” which
                  had interrupted his early study of science and medicine and “hurried me away to
                  other topics” (2). </note> Thelwall came into professional contact with “idiots,”
               “mutes,” and “stutterers” at a key moment in the development of modern medicine and
               modern attitudes towards “disability,” and in these contexts we may more fully
               appreciate the importance of his therapeutic endeavor.<note resp="editors"
                  place="foot" n="3">In keeping with contemporary disability theory, I use the term
                  “disability” to invoke the complex social position of those with medicalized
                  biological differences—as opposed to the biological differences, or “impairments,”
                  themselves. As Susan Wendell has argued, “the biological and the social are
                  interactive in creating disability” insofar as “the social response to and
                  treatment of biological difference . . . determin[es] both the nature and the
                  severity of disability” (35, 42).</note> Ultimately, Thelwall’s approach to his
               practice and his patients may be understood as deeply—and provocatively—egalitarian,
               and his major elocutionary texts—<title level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title>
               (1810), <title level="m">The Vestibule of Eloquence</title> (1810), and <title

                  Utterance</title> (1814)—may be read as actively resisting the normative views of
               disability that were beginning to consolidate during the era.</p>

               <head>The Practitioner and his Practice</head>
               <p>As Roy Porter and other medical historians have detailed, the practice of medicine
                  became increasingly effective, standardized, regulated, and scientific over the
                  course of the nineteenth century.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="4">The 1815
                     Apothecaries Act, for example, required the certification of all apothecaries
                     and outlined a required course of academic and clinical training. Diagnostic
                     criteria and practices would become ever more standardized, in large part
                     because of increased anatomical, laboratorial, and clinical expertise, and in
                     large part because of technological innovations including René Laennec’s 1816
                     invention of the stethoscope.</note> During the eighteenth century, however,
                  and extending into Thelwall’s time practicing elocutionary science, there was
                  little regularity to medicine, and doctors had relatively little to offer in the
                  way of effective treatments for most illnesses and impairments. Quack doctors and
                  alternative healers—folk, religious, magical—flourished alongside those striving
                  for institutional authority, regulation, and professionalization. The diversity of
                  Romantic medicine particularly calls to mind Porter’s phrase “histories of the
                  medicines,” appropriate because “there has never been a single, homogenous body of
                  theory and practice answering to the name ‘medicine’” (<title level="m"
                     >Popularization </title>1).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="5">For longer

                     therapy at Thelwall’s time, see Rockey, “Origins.”</note> Because of the
                  openness of the age, Thelwall was in a position to carve out his own distinct
                  place in the medical landscape, and he situates his elocutionary project in a
                  careful&#8212;but often uneasy&#8212;relationship with his diverse medical
                  contemporaries. </p>
               <p>Determined to establish the legitimacy of “the Science of Curing Impediments” and
                  to appeal to his professional peers (<title level="m">Results</title> 74),
                  Thelwall addresses two lengthy elocutionary texts to a medical professor (Henry
                  Cline), describes his early exposure to medical education, and admits that he is
                  “desirous of calling the attention of the professional and scientific world” to
                  the “researches and experimental exertions of ten successive years” (<title
                     level="m">Cline</title> 1, 5). Thelwall asserts, however, that the treatment of
                  speech impediments “is not, and, it is obvious, cannot be, the province of the
                  surgeon or the physician” (<title level="m">Cline </title>60). He also criticizes
                  dental prosthetics and oral surgery for causing greater “difficulties” and
                  “mischiefs” than impairments themselves do, and for even causing “serious
                  accidents” and “irreparable injury” in some cases (<title level="m"
                     >Results</title> 4-5, <title level="m">Cline</title> 50-51). Such critiques may
                  be partly accounted for by the economic realities of eighteenth- and
                  nineteenth-century medicine. Mary E. Fissell describes the “profusion of
                  health-care providers eager for [each patient’s] custom” (37), which would have
                  put acute pressure on Thelwall to actively market his product, just as his
                  competitors did.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="6">Similarly, Dorothy and Roy
                     Porter have demonstrated that “Wherever money was to be made out of medicine,
                     the opportunity was seized,” and Thelwall’s professional success testifies to
                     the “genuine alternatives” presented to patients by the diversity of early
                     nineteenth-century medical practitioners (24, 26). For a detailed account of
                     the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medical market, see Digby.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thelwall’s textual positioning is no less vexed in relation to those medical
                  contemporaries whose practices reflected the ideals of democracy and dissent. By
                  conspicuously withholding details of his therapeutic methods from otherwise
                  comprehensive elocutionary texts—“the key to his system is missing” (Rockey,
                  “Origins” 156)—Thelwall distinguishes them from self-help manuals, a primary
                  medium for the dissemination of medical information in the eighteenth and early
                  nineteenth centuries. Popular and influential publications including John Wesley’s
                     <title level="m">Primitive Physick</title> and William Buchan’s <title
                     level="m">Domestic Medicine</title> promised to allow patients to become their
                  own physicians. <title level="m">Primitive Physick</title>, for example, “set down
                  cheap, and safe, and easy Medicines; easy to be known, easy to be procured, and
                  easy to be applied by plain, unlettered men,” in contrast to expensive and
                  esoteric medical texts. Wesley’s manual provides simple remedies for conditions
                  ranging from breast cancer (“Use the <title level="m">Cold Bath</title>”) to
                  vertigo (“Take a <title level="m">Vomit</title> or two”) (xxiv, xiv, 40,
                     110).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="7">Multiple editions were published
                     of Wesley’s and Buchan’s texts—originally of 1747 and 1769, respectively—and
                     new editions of the latter were available well into the nineteenth century.
                     Ginny Smith notes that “[f]or a large number of people [medical self-help
                     manuals] could well have been a far more familiar source of information than
                     the personal advice of the trained physician” (250). Thelwall’s French
                     contemporaries are also worth noting here as their careers were shaped by the
                     democratic ideals of the Revolution. British medicine as a whole imported—and
                     many would say benefited from—the medical developments of Revolutionary and
                     Imperial France. For more on Thelwall’s French contemporaries, see
                     Weiner.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Although Thelwall’s elocutionary texts could never serve as such manuals, he was
                  not opposed to the transparency Wesley endorsed. Thelwall remarks of <title
                     level="m">The Vestibule of Eloquence</title> that its price and limited print
                  run may restrict its circulation, but “it is the wish of the professor that every
                  thing relating to the exercises of his pupils should be open to public inspection”
                  (iv). Indeed, Denyse Rockey speculates that practical concerns—first a lack of
                  time and later a lack of money—may partly account for the gaps in Thelwall’s
                  elocutionary texts (“Origins” 174). They may also be partly explained by
                  proprietary concerns in the competitive medical market—or perhaps, like Thomas
                  Beddoes, Thelwall feared the misapplication of medical treatments.<note
                     resp="editors" place="foot" n="8">See Grinnell on Beddoes’s complex
                     relationship with self-help medical texts and his distrust of the practices
                     they encouraged.</note> Because of the interactive—and, judging by his case
                  studies, individualized—nature of his elocutionary therapy, moreover, Thelwall’s
                  methods may have been impossible to generalize and describe at all, much less
                     effectively.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="9">It also bears mention that
                     self-help manuals did not necessarily live up to their democratic goals: “they
                     could reinforce the authority of the medical elite or they might encourage
                     independence of judgment, breeding that ‘health protestantism’ which fired
                     nineteenth-century alternative medicine” (Porter, <title level="m"
                        >Benefit</title> 283).</note>
               </p>
               <p>By remaining silent as to his specific therapeutic techniques, Thelwall draws
                  attention to the philosophy underlying his practice, which is more clearly aligned
                  with populist medicine like Wesley’s. In striking contrast to doctors who use
                  diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy to “establish, exercise, and perpetuate their
                  power” (Couser 19), Thelwall demonstrates his devotion to transparency and
                  communication, as well as his resistance to pathologizing his “pupils.” He
                  asserts, <quote>Impress the perceptive faculty, clearly and strongly; demonstrate,
                     step by step, your theory to the understanding; and interest, at the same time,
                     the imagination; leave nothing obscure or unaccounted for, that the capacity of
                     the pupil can comprehend, or that, from the nature and structure of his frame
                     and faculties, is capable of illustration; give him a system on which he can
                     see and feel that he may depend . . . . (<title level="m">Cline
                     </title>58-59)</quote> Thelwall’s commitment to meaningful discourse is
                  similarly evident in his reflection that “the successful practitioner must have
                  looked with scrutinizing eye into the motions of the heart, and of the
                  understanding” (<title level="m">Results</title> 74).<note resp="editors"
                     place="foot" n="10">As G. Thomas Couser underscores, “discourse between patient
                     and doctor occurs in a way that may be at odds with the root meaning of <title
                        level="m">communication</title>, the making common of information”—because
                     of specialized discourse and because of the medical imperative to maintain
                     authority (20-21). Also see Freidson on power and authority in medicine.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, Thelwall underscores the importance of the patient’s contributions to
                  the therapeutic process even as he stresses the therapist’s authority. In this he
                  echoes William Buchan, who claims, “It is always in the power of the patient, or
                  of those about him, to do as much towards his recovery as can be effected by the
                  physician” (x). According to Thelwall, “it is desirable that the elocutionary
                  tutor should have the entire direction and superintendance of the pupil—even to
                  the extent of absolute domestication” (<title level="m">Results </title>10)—yet
                  much depends on “the susceptibility, diligence, previous attainments, and
                  dispositions of the Pupil” (<title level="m">Vestibule </title>7), and “where
                  determined effort and enthusiastic diligence are not wanting, the blemishes of
                  physical nature effectively disappear” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 33).
                  Tellingly, Thelwall remarks that “mental and moral causes step in to the
                  explanation” of what he calls his most successful elocutionary case: “I have never
                  met with so devoted an attention, and so entire a confidence” (<title level="m"
                     >Cline</title> 64).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="11">This is a point to
                     which Thelwall devotes a conspicuous amount of space and emphasis, and marks a
                     departure from many of his peers including Thomas Beddoes, who stresses the
                     authority of the physician and “describes the role of the patient as preventing
                     rather than curing complaints” (Grinnell 235).</note> Michael Scrivener reads
                  evidence of Jacobin values in Thelwall’s faith in the collaborative therapeutic
                  process: “each successful case” may become an “allegorical illustration of
                  self-improvement and the rational application of knowledge” (197). </p>
               <p>By courting and simultaneously challenging his medical contemporaries, Thelwall
                  defended his principles and economic concerns, participated in medical discourse,
                  and framed his elocutionary techniques as safe, effective, professional, and
                  rigorously scientific alternative therapies. In illuminating his therapeutic
                  philosophy, Thelwall made his democratic tendencies clear; like his populist
                  contemporaries, Thelwall pursued partnership rather than absolute authority, and
                  clarity of communication rather than esoteric discourse. We may then say of
                  Thelwall what George C. Grinnell says of Thomas Beddoes: he “model[s] . . . a
                  reorganization of medical practice in Georgian England” (224). The consequence of
                  Thelwall’s distinct therapeutic approach is in the intersection of democracy and
                  disability.</p>

               <head>Lispers, Stutterers, Stammerers, and the Blind: Citizens, Patients</head>

               <p>In nineteenth-century medicine, an increase in institutional authority,
                  professionalization, and standardized practices led to ever more ideologically
                  consistent approaches to disability. If eighteenth-century medicine largely
                  depended on relative and individualized notions of health and illness, “medical
                  men” of the following century “were developing a language (which we still use) for
                  situating all people in relation to each other, for measuring their deviation from
                  the <emph>normal</emph>, and, increasingly, for managing their deviations from
                  that norm” (Lawrence 45). As Lennard J. Davis has demonstrated, the concept of the
                  “norm” became a fully realized and socially defining construct in the 1840s and
                  1850s, after which those with various impairments were increasingly seen as
                  abnormal “deviants,” and biological differences were increasingly regarded as
                  indelible identity markers. </p>
               <p>Paul Youngquist has shown, however, that “by the late eighteenth century medical
                  science was consolidating its authority over deviant flesh,” and “[t]he last
                  decades of the eighteenth century witness the installation of this turn from
                  contingency to norm” (9, xxv). The forces of normativity were therefore ones that
                  Thelwall would have confronted as an elocutionary scientist, and in several
                  important ways Thelwall stands in conflict with contemporary trends. His early
                  life helps to explain his direction: Thelwall was a lisper “from the imperfection
                  and irregular position of my teeth,” and he benefited from the techniques he
                  promoted as a speech therapist (<title level="m">Cline </title>19); he also
                  experienced voicelessness of a different kind as the subject of violent government
                  repression. Having experienced impairment and the inability to communicate freely,
                  Thelwall broke with many of his peers by developing an inclusive therapeutic
                  approach that addresses the social and functional consequences of “disability”
                  while humanizing the disabled. </p>
               <p>Thelwall demonstrates a particular interest in those whose marginalized status was
                  largely due to their misunderstood speech impediments; for Thelwall these cases
                  were treatable, although they were “universally” thought to be beyond “remedy” or
                  “relief” (<title level="m">Results </title>2, 28). Thelwall “reject[s],
                  altogether, as far as the organization of the mouth is concerned, all distinction
                  of curable and incurable impediments” (<title level="m">Cline </title>145),
                  emphasizing and illustrating that what may appear to be biological and
                  inherent—and thus untreatable—may be at least partly accounted for by conditional
                  factors such as education, the influence of family members, fear, habit, and
                  trauma. He asserts that speech impediments are, “Most assuredly . . . with very
                  few exceptions,” “complicated with Moral and Intellectual causes” (<title
                     level="m">Cline </title>61); “Impediments are, in a great degree, contagious”
                     (<title level="m">Vestibule</title> 9); and “very many” cases are “purely
                  mental and moral” (<title level="m">Cline </title>61). The word “apparent” appears
                  frequently throughout his elocutionary texts—e.g. “<title level="m">apparent
                  </title>deficiencies of mind,” “<title level="m">apparently</title> defective
                  faculties,” “apparent ineptitude”—signaling both the diagnostic failure of his
                  medical contemporaries and his pupils’ unrecognized potential (<title level="m"
                     >Cline</title> 44, 5, 59). Accordingly, Thelwall’s prognosis for nearly all
                  speech impediments is uniform, regardless of context and cause: “a correct and
                  impressive elocution is attainable by all” (<title level="m">Vestibule</title>
                     8).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="12">Rockey indicates that when compared
                     to Victorian elocutionists, whose professional attention seemed to be focused
                     on “stuttering, lisping, and provincialisms” (“Logopaedic” 89), Thelwall’s
                     interests were remarkably broad, suggesting his optimism and willingness to
                     include a wide range of patients in his therapeutic project.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In practice, Thelwall’s insistence on the universal curability of speech
                  impediments imposes an obligation on impaired individuals to seek treatment. This
                  sense is underscored by his frequent references to disabilities as “evils” and,
                  less frequently, “calamities.” Although it may be professionally and economically
                  understandable, Thelwall’s emphasis on treatment is potentially problematical.
                  Disability scholars suggest that the imperative to treat or cure impairments often
                  goes hand in hand with the profound social exclusion of the disabled,<note
                     resp="editors" place="foot" n="13">See Garland-Thomson and Wendell on the broad
                     social implications of an emphasis on treating and curing disabilities. In
                     discussing “[t]he widespread message that they [the disabled] are not good
                     enough until they are ‘cured,’” Wendell argues that “the drive to find ‘cures’
                     for disabilities can be seen, by those who appreciate disabilities as
                     differences, to be as much an attempt to wipe out difference as an effort to
                     relieve suffering” (83). </note> and that therapies and cures themselves can be
                  understood as “efforts to control or eradicate” undesirable “human attribute[s]”
                  (Freidson 212).</p>
               <p>The framing of Thelwall’s elocutionary project, however, establishes his
                  professional services and techniques as ones that do not promote normative
                  assumptions or adhere to standard social hierarchies. “[N]ormative notions of
                  health produce a healthy bourgeois subject primarily by forcefully producing
                  others as infirm” (Grinnell 225); in contrast, Thelwall’s elocutionary principles
                  are not only therapies for the impaired, but techniques for improving the speech
                  of the able-bodied. They may “loose the tongue of the stammerer, and enable the
                  literary student to command, and the critic to comprehend, with certainty, the
                  genuine sources of grace and mellifluence” (<title level="m">Cline </title>4).
                  Here Thelwall not only resists pathologizing and marginalizing his impaired
                  patients, but goes so far as to suggest that their difference from the
                  respected—and presumably able-bodied—student and critic is a matter of degree, not
                  kind. Likewise, by treating politicians and clergymen alongside the congenitally
                  impaired, Thelwall relieves the stigma that often accompanies medical treatment,
                  creating in his London institution an alternate medico-educational system—one
                  might even say an alternate microcosmic democracy—in which the disabled and
                  able-bodied are part of a common project of self-improvement.<note resp="editors"
                     place="foot" n="14">Thelwall reveals his continuing sense of sympathy and even
                     allegiance with the impaired when he asserts that they will rightly understand
                     the value of his techniques even if “senators, barristers, and divines may be
                     content to whine, and croak, and scream, in feeble and exhausting discord”
                        (<title level="m">Cline </title>27).</note>
               </p>
               <p>It also seems that the “evils” and “calamities” Thelwall seeks to address are not
                  his patients’ physical differences but rather the cultural and political
                  implications of their impairments. Throughout his elocutionary texts Thelwall
                  asserts that biological differences are separate from—and often less disabling
                  than—the social responses to those differences (e.g. indulgent parents, inadequate
                  education, personal fears). Thelwall resists surgery and dental prosthetics,
                  mainstream medical techniques that sought to replicate structural “normalcy” but
                  could hinder or altogether prevent a patient’s elocutionary progress. Instead he
                  emphasizes natural compensation, accommodation, and functional improvement—and
                  thus often leaves his patients’ physical variations unaffected.<note
                     resp="editors" place="foot" n="15">Indeed, Thelwall asserts that “more serious
                     and irremediable mischiefs [are] produced . . . by giving the tongue too much
                     liberty” by medical intervention “than ever resulted from its too great
                     restriction” (<title level="m">Cline </title>50-51).</note> Thelwall’s
                  conception of therapeutic success is clear when he notes, not without
                  satisfaction, that despite the limits of a teenaged pupil’s progress “he has
                  already done that which, with a little care and attention, will enable him to pass
                  through life with extended means of comfort, utility and social enjoyment” (<title
                     level="m">Results</title> 24). </p>
               <p>Andrew McCann rightly identifies Thelwall’s elocutionary project as “equip[ping]
                  hitherto marginalized and disempowered subjects for active public life” (223), and
                  it is important that Thelwall did so not by forcing his patients to achieve “a
                  norm of embodiment—call it ‘the proper body’” (Youngquist xiv). Rather, he sought
                  to help his pupils participate in society by attaining “[g]eneral intelligibility”
                     (<title level="m">Results</title> 15). By insisting that physical differences
                  need not lead to speechlessness, and that impairments need not amount to permanent
                  social exclusion, Thelwall challenged the limits of mainstream medicine. He also
                  challenged normative beliefs, and thereby sought to change the constitution of the
                  public world.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="16">The importance of social
                     participation should not be underestimated. As Susan Wendell underscores, there
                     is a fundamental connection between the exclusion of the disabled from the
                     public world and their lack of access to—and a lack of social and governmental
                     recognition of—their political and human rights (40-41). This is one of many
                     insights that leads Wendell to conclude that the devastating social
                     consequences of “disability” may warrant an individual’s desire for a cure,
                     even when the immutable realities of an impairment itself may not. It is on all
                     of these grounds that I do not wholly agree with McCann’s contention that
                     Thelwall’s gentlemen pupils and their professional ambitions suggest that
                     “assimilation into the institutions of bourgeois public life was the goal . . .
                     indicating an urge to bring students into the ambit of official political and
                     cultural authority, rather than an attempt to subvert its institutions” (225).
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Thelwall most strikingly deviates from normative beliefs by suggesting that
                  incurable impairments may, in fact, prove personally and communally beneficial. He
                  does so by describing the capacities and impact of two blind men: John Milton and
                  John Gough. Of course, it was not unusual to view blindness ambivalently, or even
                  positively, in Thelwall’s time. William R. Paulson argues that “The romantics
                  rediscover, or at least revive, the ancient topos of the blind poet or seer, a
                  visionary whose sight, having lost this world’s presence, is directed entirely
                  beyond to the spiritual” (14). Ossian, Milton, and Homer are obvious templates for
                  the trope, and Edward Larissy underscores the sense of nostalgia and “inward
                  vision” common to Romantic depictions of blindness (1).<hi rend="sup">
                     <note resp="editors" place="foot" n="17">According to Larissy, “The age . . .
                        understood that phenomenon as an historical one. Such visions were
                        appropriate to an earlier age” (1).</note>
                  </hi> But for Thelwall, unlike many of his contemporaries, Milton is very much of
                  this world, and Thelwall’s praise, unlike others’, is based on the impact of
                  sensory compensation on the poet’s literary technique: “is it not unlikely that
                  [Milton’s] blindness . . . might have given an increased portion of that strength,
                  that natural and copious melody, and that variety, to the rhythms and numbers of
                  his divine poem” (<title level="m">Cline </title>8). </p>
               <p>Thelwall also describes the blindness of John Gough, whom he had met years before
                  in Kendal. Gough was a scientist, not a poet&#8212;a researcher depending on
                  empirical principles, not visionary powers&#8212;and Thelwall focuses on Gough’s
                  profession and his everyday life: <quote>Cut off, in his earliest infancy, from
                     all intercourse with the world of knowledge and observation, through the
                     customary inlet, the organ of sight, Mr. Gough has been induced . . . to
                     cultivate, with extreme diligence, the supplementary faculties of hearing and
                     of touch. The acute perfection to which the latter of these has been improved
                     and expanded, has been sufficiently demonstrated by the extent to which he has
                     carried his practical researches into the minutiae of the science of botany;
                     and the exquisiteness of his perceptions in the other kind—the promptitude with
                     which he discovers the stature of the merest stranger by the first resoundings
                     of his voice (of which I have myself been witness), and the facility with which
                     he recognizes the presence, and discriminates the identity of his acquaintance,
                     by merely listening to their respective breathings, equally illustrate the
                     unprecedented degree of improvement to which he has expanded his hearing
                     faculties: so that Mr. Gough is, in reality, one of those <title level="m"
                        >demonstrative instances</title> of the omnipotency of mental energy . . . .
                        (<title level="m">Cline</title> 32-33)</quote> Here Gough becomes a figure
                  of Jacobin self-improvement, effort, and perseverance. It seems, too, that Gough
                  has succeeded not in spite of his blindness, but in some measure because of it.
                  Indeed, Thelwall treats Gough’s compensatory senses as
                  singular—“unprecedented”—but also with a kind of reverence, referring to “the
                  exquisiteness of his perceptions in the other kind.” </p>
               <p> Thelwall’s progressive attitude toward Milton’s and Gough’s blindness recalls
                  Susan Wendell’s assertion that disability may be seen as a “difference” with
                  “intrinsic value” and “sometimes extrinsic advantages” (67). Biological
                  differences themselves are not inherently negative characteristics for Thelwall.
                  He critiques and seeks to rectify the social conditions of “disability” and
                  emphasizes natural compensation rather than the elimination of physical
                  variations—and thus stands in opposition to those who cast impairments as
                  permanent, and even socially dangerous, defects. Thelwall’s elocutionary project
                  promotes the vision of a democracy in which all individuals may enjoy full
                  citizenship and all may have access to, may participate in, and may contribute to
                  society—with adequate support and to the best of their diverse abilities.</p>

               <head>Idiocy and the Bounds of Human Improvement</head>
               <p>Thelwall’s acceptance of biological difference is challenged when he turns his
                  attention to the cognitively impaired, whose place in society had long been
                  marginal. From the fourteenth century on, the “natural fool,” later called the
                  “idiot,” was known as an individual who permanently lacked any semblance of
                  “reason.” This definition remained surprisingly static, as did the list of things
                  that could earn an individual the title of “idiot,” first legally and later
                  medically. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, idiots were typically
                  cared for by their families and communities, and it was only at the close of the
                  eighteenth century that efforts to educate the cognitively impaired gained
                     popularity.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="18">For an account of the

               </p>
               <p>Dominant cultural views about idiots largely determined their treatment. Without
                  “reason,” the idiot was without what John Locke defined as “That Faculty, whereby
                  Man is supposed to be distinguished from Beasts, and wherein it is evident he much
                  surpasses them” (434), providing an Enlightenment rationale for the common belief
                  that the idiot was more akin to animals than to man. Closer to Thelwall’s time,
                  Adam Smith theorized that the rational subject cannot sympathize with the
                  unreasoning man, “the poor wretch . . . who laughs and sings . . . and is
                  altogether insensible of his own misery” (15).<note resp="editors" place="foot"
                     n="19">Elsewhere in this passage Smith refers specifically to the “madman,”
                     that other class of humanity thought to lack reason—though not from birth, and
                     not necessarily permanently. Although Smith registers particular horror at the
                     idea of losing one’s reason, his discussion of sympathy here hinges on the
                     state of unreason itself and its social implications—and not its
                     etiology.</note> In “The Idiot” (1798), Robert Southey adopted the phrase
                  “poor wretch” to describe Ned, the poem’s title character, whose macabre actions
                  and lack of understanding cannot but alienate the reader: unable to comprehend
                  death, he unearths his mother’s corpse and brings it home. Yet Ned’s abiding love
                  for his mother preserves for him some place in the human community, and the poem
                  consequently evinces a deep ambivalence towards the idiot that was typical of the
                  time. </p>
               <p>Like many of his contemporaries, Thelwall hesitates when he turns his attention to
                  the cognitively impaired.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="20">Though Southey
                     published his poem anonymously shortly before <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads
                     </title>(1798), Mary Jacobus has convincingly argued that he had the means and
                     motive to write his poem as a corrective response to the more progressive—and
                     thus unusual—“The Idiot Boy” by William Wordsworth. </note> Although he
                  accepted some idiots into treatment at his Institute, he notes that “Extreme cases
                  . . . for obvious reasons, cannot be admitted under my roof,” adding that “the
                  admission of disgusting objects” would detract from his own personal and
                  professional experience (<title level="m">Results </title>35). Nonetheless,
                  Thelwall maintains his goal of identifying patients whose impairments are not
                  beyond amelioration. In <title level="m">A Letter to Henry Cline</title> Thelwall
                  seeks to conceptualize and describe “moral” as opposed to “physical” idiocy, in
                  part by reprinting his correspondences with the blind scientist John Gough, who,
                  like Thelwall, was in an ideal position to understand the consequences of
                  “disability” and critique normative ideologies. Both men emphasize the
                  intellectual potential of moral idiots; as Thelwall explains, “there is a power in
                  educational folly and mistake, to distemper the brain, that might have been
                  tranquillized to consistency” (71). Gough asks of the Selborne idiot and his
                  obsessive interest in bees, “Was there not a time, when the activity and ingenuity
                  of this young idiot might have been diverted to nobler designs?” (111). Thelwall’s
                  descriptions of his educable idiots are supplemented by descriptions of his
                  sophisticated approach to specialized instruction, which requires “modes of
                  regulation, of stimulus, and restriction” carried out “by private superintendence
                  and direction of the education of the party” (146-147). Thelwall and Gough were
                  certainly not alone in their belief in the potential of idiots, nor in their
                  argument that some cases of apparent idiocy were due to improper education or
                  insufficient socialization. Although not a proponent of education for all idiots,
                  Jean Itard gained fame by insisting that circumstance was the cause of imbecility
                  for Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron, and that he was therefore educable.<note
                     resp="editors" place="foot" n="21">Itard ultimately achieved some level of
                     success with his pupil, confirming the validity of his approach in the
                     public—and medical—eye. There is the strong suggestion that Itard’s goal with
                     Victor was largely intellectual, and his therapeutic approach implies a desire
                     to verify his philosophical beliefs about human development. This may help to
                     explain why Thelwall criticized his educational techniques (Rockey, “Origins”
                     164). For more on Victor and Itard, see McDonagh and Lane. </note>
               </p>
               <p>As with the earliest accounts of Victor, however, both Thelwall and Gough’s
                  descriptions of “moral idiots” hardly suggest improvability. Gough writes of the
                  “moral idiot” that “all his views [are] confined to his own person,” and
                  illustrates “this worst of human evils” by recalling the case of the Selborne
                  idiot, whose sole, solitary interest was in “hunting bees and wasps; which he
                  caught with surprising address, disarmed them with his naked hands, and sucked
                  their bodies” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 122, 110-11). He also describes M.
                  Barker, a “female idiot” from Kendal who would “cram” her “favourite food,” oat
                  bread, into her mouth so eagerly that it often had to be removed “by force, to
                  prevent suffocation” (<title level="m">Cline</title> 119). Thelwall introduces the
                  anti-social “unfortunate Augusta,” detailing “the calamities of this unhappy
                  child” as she climbs over furniture and sits on the ground, swaying her head and
                  “hum[ming], in a low and plaintive tone” in a “monotony of . . . action and . . .
                  tone” that puzzles Thelwall (<title level="m">Cline </title>93-94).</p>
               <p>These moral idiots compellingly prefigure Leo Kanner’s groundbreaking 1943
                  descriptions of autism, suggesting Thelwall’s and Gough’s prescience and providing
                  an important context in which we can better understand their views of the
                  cognitively impaired. According to specialists, the Selborne idiot, M. Barker, and
                  Augusta “fall within the scope of modern definitions of autism” (van Balkom),<note
                     resp="editors" place="foot" n="22">Retrospective diagnoses are necessarily
                     speculative, largely because of the incomplete psychological profiles afforded
                     by centuries-old documents. Nevertheless, having read <title level="m">A Letter
                        to Henry Cline</title>, Ingrid van Balkom, a specialist in autism spectrum
                     disorders and community mental health professional in the Netherlands, came to
                     her conclusions about the Selborne idiot, M. Barker, and Augusta based on a
                     number of diagnostic criteria. Michaeline Bresnahan, a psychiatric
                     epidemiologist at Columbia University, concurs. I am currently collaborating
                     with van Balkom and Bresnahan on a manuscript that will detail the ways that
                     Thelwall’s descriptions of “moral idiocy” anticipate twentieth century
                     understandings of autism. It should be noted that Rockey, too, comments in
                     passing that M. Barker may be autistic (“Logopaedic” 91), and that at the
                     conference “The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice” in October, 2009,
                     Gordon Bottomley explored the possibility that Augusta may have been autistic.
                     The 1938 descriptions of Hans Asperger also bear note here; they, along with
                     Kanner’s descriptions, form the foundation of current understandings about
                     autism spectrum disorders.</note> and are among the earliest such descriptions
                  on record.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="23">A number of historical figures
                     have been recently associated with what we now call “autism,” as in the
                     now-famous mid-eighteenth-century legal case of Hugh Blair, the son of a
                     Scottish landowner. (See Houston and Frith’s analysis of the case.) Lorna Wing
                     asserts of Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron—whom, crucially, Thelwall connects
                     to Augusta—“There can be no doubt that [he] was autistic” (14), and another of
                     Thelwall’s contemporaries, John Haslam, included a possible case of autism in
                        <title level="m">Observations on Madness and Melancholy </title>(1809).
                  </note> Thelwall and Gough also may well provide the first “description of the key
                  characteristics of autism in a group of children” (van Balkom). Moreover, by
                  focusing on social disconnection, their category of “moral idiocy” significantly
                  captures a central feature of autism.<hi rend="sup">
                     <note resp="editors" place="foot" n="24">It should be noted that Thelwall and
                        Gough also describe cases of “moral idiocy” that deviate from modern
                        definitions of “autism,” although they do possess key autistic features and
                        behaviors. </note>
                  </hi> Because autism continues to pose unique and often acute challenges to
                  doctors, teachers, and families, we may better understand the difficulties and
                  frustrations that likely led Thelwall to remark that “no species of imbecility
                  appears to us so hopeless as that which is complicated with vicious habits, and
                  the absence of social sympathy” (<title level="m">Results</title> 47). </p>
               <p>In the context of autism we may also more fully appreciate Thelwall’s and Gough’s
                  determination to educate moral idiots and their faith in human improvement—even in
                  the least hopeful of cases, which they depict in the starkest of terms. Gough, for
                  example, describes a mute moral idiot who “had been reduced by injudicious
                  tenderness, to the state of a parasitical being” (<title level="m">Cline
                  </title>112-113); his emphasis, however, is on his sense that early intervention
                  could have altered the course of the man’s life. And Thelwall, while admitting
                  that he is “exceedingly doubtful” that Augusta, “this poor child,” will ever be
                  capable of “intelligible speech,” nevertheless asserts that there is some small
                  hope to be had in the “persevering assiduity of an intelligent superintendant”
                     (<title level="m">Cline</title> 94, 96). There is even perceptible hope and
                  determination when Thelwall introduces two extreme cases of moral idiocy: “In one,
                  those faculties, tho not actually extinct, were an inert and unvivified mass, that
                  required the Promethean torch; in the other, they seemed to exist only in
                  scattered particles; or, at best only in fragments, or disjointed parts, that
                  needed the articulation of connective ligament” (<title level="m">Results</title>
                     64).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="25">In their desire to suggest the
                     improvability of “moral idiots,” Gough and Thelwall also anticipated Leo
                     Kanner’s unfortunate misunderstanding about the etiology of autism. Though
                     Gough leaves open the possibility of natural antisocial inclinations, he also
                     remarks on the “mischief” that “may be done to the faculties by an improper
                     education” (<title level="m">Cline </title>110), and Thelwall more emphatically
                     connects moral idiocy to educational failures, insisting “<title level="m">the
                        parents are sometimes the disease</title>” (<title level="m">Results</title>
                     56). Kanner similarly “stress[ed] the contributory effects of parental lack of
                     warmth on constitutionally predisposed children” (Wolff 204). Interestingly,
                     Thelwall is much more forgiving of the parents of a nine-year-old moral idiot
                     in <title level="m">Results of Experience</title>: “If any thing had been
                     wrong, it was that which almost inevitably resulted from the kind sympathies
                     and best feelings of an amiable family” (67). It is unclear whether this
                     represents a development in Thelwall’s attitudes or a fondness for those
                     particular parents, though the text strongly suggests both.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In his project to “rescue . . . my unhappy fellow beings from Idiocy,” Thelwall
                  aspires, “even in cases the most unfavourable,” to appeal to the “general
                  necessities, arising out of the mere animal appetites” which “may be made
                  instrumental . . . to a considerable degree” (<title level="m">Cline </title>105,
                  124). Thus even the most organically impaired physical idiot or most withdrawn
                  moral idiot may learn to communicate his hunger or his pain more effectively,
                  potentially life-altering improvements, even if they do not guarantee full
                  participation in public discourse. Particularly in <title level="m">Results of
                     Experience</title>, moreover, Thelwall’s language is deeply humanizing, as when
                  he comments that in cases of idiocy, whenever “the moral and social sympathies . .
                  . can be properly awakened, there is always hope: for the heart is the best
                  rectifier of the head; as, in certain cases, the head is also of the heart”
                     (<title level="m">Results </title>59-60).</p>
               <p>The ideological significance of Thelwall’s and Gough’s view of idiocy becomes
                  apparent when considered in light of nineteenth-century developments in the care
                  of idiots. In keeping with Jean Itard’s principles, five voluntary institutions
                  for the care, education, and training of idiot children were created in Britain
                  between the late 1840s and late 1860s. According to David Gladstone, these
                  charitable institutions “were established within a climate of optimistic
                  expectations of improvement” (139), though their admissions process—they
                  considered only those young idiots who were thought to be the most highly
                  educable—suggests more modest optimism and determination than Thelwall and Gough
                  displayed. </p>
               <p>In the decades that followed, the normative views that Thelwall and Gough resisted
                  gave rise to increasingly exclusionary attitudes towards idiots—attitudes with
                  widespread social, medical, and political consequences. In the latter half of the
                  nineteenth century, individuals and eugenics groups began to advocate publicly for
                  the permanent institutional confinement of idiots, insisting on their
                  unimprovability and even danger. One such advocate, Mary Dendy, declared
                  feeble-mindedness an “evil which will, if unchecked, bring ruin upon our nation,
                  and that before very long” (758). Such ideas were discussed in mainstream medical
                  journals including <title level="m">The Lancet</title> and <title level="m">The
                     British Medical Journal</title>, and helped to secure the successful passage of
                  the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913, whereby state funding for facilities replaced
                  charitable funding, institutional residence for idiots became lifelong, and the
                  government took control over admissions.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="26"
                     >In the wake of the act, idiots could be removed from their families under the
                     charge of “neglect,” and family wishes—and even objections—were often ignored.
                     For an excellent survey of the broad impact of the 1913 Act, see Thomson, who
                     indicates that there are cases on record in which individuals attempted to help
                     idiot family members escape from involuntary confinement in asylums. Also see
                     Jackson.</note> Thus institutions for idiots “became essentially segregative,
                  isolating ‘defectives’ to stop them from breeding” (Porter, <title level="m"
                     >Benefit</title> 507), and by the 1930s there were campaigns in Britain for the
                  voluntary sterilization of those with cognitive impairments.<note resp="editors"
                     place="foot" n="27">Such attitudes were by no means confined to discussions of
                     idiocy. As the nineteenth century progressed, Darwinian theories of evolution
                     became increasingly important to attitudes about diverse medicalized classes
                     and the progress of the human race; as Janet Browne notes, <title level="m"
                        >Origin of Species</title> “provid[ed] a biological backing for human
                     warfare and notions of racial superiority” (107). In the 1880s Francis Galton
                     began to publish material on his theory of eugenics, and the late nineteenth
                     and early twentieth centuries witnessed the institutional confinement,
                     sterilization, and even death of countless individuals whose impairments were
                     deemed dangerous to the present and future wellbeing of society. For an
                     examination of disability and eugenics—and speculations as to why it remains a
                     largely unacknowledged topic—see chapter three of Snyder and Mitchell. Also see

               <head>“Disability” and Thelwall’s Democratic Legacy</head>
               <p>Key aspects of twenty-first century medicine took shape in the decades after John
                  Thelwall’s death, and we are still all too familiar with the legacy left us by the
                  Victorian medical establishment. Disability theorists contend that we still live
                  under the assumption that impairments are always deficits, that the impaired are a
                  drain to society, and that a cure is always preferable to living with an
                  impairment. In this context the Romantics require another look for their diverse
                  figurations of the impaired body and impaired mind, and few matched Thelwall in
                  his progressive treatment of medicalized individuals. Thelwall articulates a
                  humane and humanizing method of interacting with his pupils, one that is
                  characterized by a democratic sense of respect and the pursuit of common goals. In
                  seeking to identify cases in which improvement is possible, Thelwall brought the
                  impaired in from the margins—and along the way seems to have anticipated what we
                  now know of as autism. Finally, he recognizes the benefits of certain impairments,
                  prefiguring current approaches to disability as a potentially valuable, enriching
                  human variation. It is almost certain that Thelwall’s elocutionary career was
                  meant to keep him at a safe distance from politics. Yet in this, “the <title
                     level="m">New Profession</title>, to which [he] devoted [his] maturer years,”
                  Thelwall lent his voice to an ideological struggle, one that, like the political
                  struggles of the 1790s, came to shape the treatment of whole classes of Western
                  society for the next two centuries.</p>
