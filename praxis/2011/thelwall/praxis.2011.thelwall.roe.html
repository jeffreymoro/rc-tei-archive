               <p>Recent Thelwallian conversations have grown from and reflected back upon the essays
                  in <em>John Thelwall: Radical Romantic and Acquitted Felon</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Conversational exchange was congenial to Thelwall himself, as the medium of “philosophic
                  amity” he anticipated at the end of his West Country tour in summer 1797 (<em>Retirement</em> 129). Both Robin Jarvis and Michael Scrivener have shown how Thelwall’s “Pedestrian
                  Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer of 1797” expressed
                  an “intellectual mobility” that combined remarks on picturesque beauty with “the social
                  labor and political conflicts that also are part of the land’s meaning” (Scrivener
                  224). The “Pedestrian Excursion” and its postscript “The Phenomena of the Wye, During
                  the Winter of 1797-8” are exemplary instances of what Scrivener terms the “social
                  creativity” of Jacobin writing (295), a creativity also manifest in what Judith Thompson
                  has noted as the democratic temper of Thelwall’s experiments with form and genre in <em>The Peripatetic</em> (11, 18, 29).</p>
            </div>
            <p>“The Phenomena of the Wye” records a late stage of Thelwall’s west country excursion.
               It was published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> for May and July 1798, before the other instalments of the “Pedestrian Excursion”
               appeared between 1799 and 1801. This arrangement is peculiar. Perhaps Thelwall intended
               it to distract attention from the missing segment of his excursion—what occurred between
               Thelwall setting-off from Bath with “solitary step” (“Pedestrian” 55) and his arrival
               in the middle of the autumn at the Wye Valley on his “first visit to [those] parts”
               (“Wye” 5). If that was indeed the design, it didn’t work. The missing section of the
               tour was in fact its principal purpose, as announced by Thelwall in his prefatory
               remarks: a visit to his “invaluable friend” Samuel Taylor Coleridge at Nether Stowey
               (“Pedestrian”<em> </em>17).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As reconstructed without reference to the “Pedestrian Excursion” the visit to Stowey
                  has been seen to mark Thelwall’s retreat from metropolitan radicalism and ‘“the vortex
                  of public contention” to become the “new Recluse” of Liswyn Farm, and, later, a Lecturer
                  on Elocution (<em>Retirement</em> xxiii, xxxviii).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See for example my account in Wordsworth and Coleridge 234-62, focusing on Thelwall’s
                           response to the spy, James Walsh, who tracked him from London to Nether Stowey.</span></div>
                  </div> That “turn” might summarise Thelwall’s trajectory from London in 1795 through to Liswyn
                  in 1801, a trajectory impelled negatively by persecution, disappointment, and marginalisation
                  and positively by the wish for friendship, correspondence, and affection. The subsequent
                  lapse of “philosophic amity” leads to “retreat,” “retirement,” and “reinvention,”
                  from which Thelwall re-emerges with a new identity as an elocutionist. Several essays
                  in <em>John Thelwall: Radical Romantic</em> challenge this profile, by pointing to continuities between Thelwall’s political lectures
                  and his practice as an elocutionist. Simply put, as a political lecturer in the 1790s,
                  Thelwall was the voice of the inarticulate; in later years his elocution helped the
                  tongue-tied to speak for themselves. As the popular orator of the Corresponding Society
                  Thelwall had lisped and stammered at the tribune; Thelwall the speech therapist lectured
                  on “Bonaparte and the Spanish Patriots” at the Angel Inn, Tiverton.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When in the mid-1790s the London Corresponding Society was forced underground it adopted
               the cover of the “School of Eloquence,” a school in which Thelwall—had he chosen to
               do so—might have continued his political lectures. He didn’t so choose. He set off
               first to East Anglia, and was rebuffed by riots. He then trekked north to Derby, to
               find the offer of a newspaper editorship had been foreclosed. With London in 1797
               a no-go area for him, there was little option but to step westwards on a walking tour
               towards a correspondent, not as yet encountered in person, who appeared to promise
               all that Thelwall was denied elsewhere in England: familiarity, affection and intellectual
               fellowship. </p>
            <p>In this article I want to offer some further arguments for a continuity between Thelwall
               up to the “Pedestrian Excursion” in 1797, and the Thelwall who re-emerged from Liswyn
               Farm. I want to attend to Thelwall and the sense of place, and to ask what it meant
               at that moment to step westwards in the hope of establishing “a more immediate and
               intimate communication” with friends settled in the West Country (“Pedestrian” 17).
               Within that narrative of continuity, I want also to speculate about the breaks and
               fractures signalled by the published version of Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion.”
               As presented in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>, the anticipated “communication” with his friend produces a dislocation in the “Excursion”
               narrative that prompted Thelwall to publish the “Phenomena of the Wye” first, and
               separately from, the “Excursion” it should have concluded. In this arrangement of
               the narrative, the episode of friendly communication with Coleridge is completely
               excised.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thursday, 29 June 1797. Thelwall and his friend Wimpory set off from London between
                     nine and ten o’clock in a heavy shower of rain. Their route will take them out of
                     London to Windsor, Basingstoke, Andover, Salisbury, Amesbury, Stonehenge, Winterborne
                     Stoke, Wylye, Fonthill, Wardour Castle, Mere, Frome, Bristol and Bath . . . and eventually
                     to the Wye Valley. Broadly speaking Thelwall was following earlier travellers such
                     as Thomas Gray and William Gilpin, and William Wordsworth on his 1793 venture westwards
                     from London, via the Isle of Wight, Salisbury and the Plain, to Bath and Bristol.
                     If we include Wordsworth’s wider poetic migrations between 1793 and 1798 we might
                     say that Thelwall was tracking a topography of the imagination that led from the desolate
                     vistas represented by an early poem like <em>Salisbury Plain</em> to the human landscapes of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. Thelwall, likewise, abandoned the persecutions of London and headed westward in
                     the hope of human community, and for Thelwall, too, the westward journey would produce
                     significant challenges and transformations.

                     </div> More can I think be said, and one keynote is Thelwallian diversity. Thelwall is familiar
                     to us as a journalist poet, orator, lecturer, leader of popular societies, speculative
                     scientist, and elocutionist. He was also a published dramatist, pamphleteer, autobiographer,
                     novelist, and diarist. His other identities include Thelwall the political agent,
                     songwriter, editor, pedestrian, naturalist, farmer, and collector. To these we can
                     add his early years in his father’s silk business; apprentice to a master-tailor;
                     epic poet; trainee lawyer; aspirant actor, and would-be historical painter. I wrote
                     in “The Lives of John Thelwall” about his various identities as a “private citizen,”
                     “Citizen Thelwall,” “Brother Thelwall,” Sylvanus Theophrastus, John Beaufort, “the
                     new Recluse,” “Citizen John,” “Citizen Jack,” “the famous Thelwall,” and “the lisping
                     orator.” And I suggested that it is possible to map a comparable diversity in other
                     areas of Thelwall’s life—for example in his travels and tours throughout England.
                     It’s worth emphasising these earlier selves, because we overhear many of their voices
                     in the course of his “Pedestrian Excursion.”</p>

                     (“Pedestrian” 32).</li>

                  <li class="item" id="d1609e343">Thelwall the <span class="hi">Utopian Thinker</span>, who “formed Utopian plans of retirement and colonisations” (21).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d1609e347">And finally, to round up this list, there is Thelwall the <span class="hi">Bon Viveur</span> on the watch for his next meal: bread and milk (20); tea and rolls and cream (21);
                     eggs, bacon, and ale (25); new milk (26); “animal food” (27); ham, eggs, salad, gooseberry
                     pies and ale (41-42); a cold leg of lamb, lamb chops and salad (46). All of this country
                     fare is sampled en route to Stowey.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>So Thelwall assumes diverse identities and discourses, adapts himself to occasion,
                  and, except for the moment when he is recognised at Frome, travels across country
                  <em>incognito</em>. And we hear accordingly little of what Thelwall felt in himself—the “Excursion”
                  concerns itself with the physical, material detail of landscapes, buildings and contents,
                  soil, wages, the condition of rivers, the cleanliness or otherwise of inns, and the
                  palatability of food. When we part company from him at Bath, he is headed further
                  west into Somerset, to meet his confidential correspondent “well known in the literary
                  world” (17). We shall meet Thelwall again as the different creature of the “Phenomena
                  of the Wye” articles, and as Thelwall himself leaves a gap in his narrative I am going
                  to take this opportunity to offer a few conjectures about what it meant to step westward
                  to Nether Stowey in summer 1797.</p>
               <p>Thelwall’s “eccentric ramble” westwards was exactly that: a trajectory outwards from
                  the city towards a location off-centre, away from the uproar of public life towards
                  a “more immediate and intimate communication” with a private friend (“Pedestrian”
                  17). The Quantock Hills, two days from London by the fastest coach, offered the geographical
                  and psychological sense of remove and reassurance that had already attracted Coleridge
                  from Bristol and, more recently, Wordsworth and his sister from London via Dorset.
                  Here, as Richard Holmes’s biography of Coleridge showed us, were the provincial landscape
                  and culture that inspired Coleridge’s early visions.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One question occurs. Why the Quantocks? Wouldn’t another region of England, Wales
                     or Scotland have served as well? At a period of political and social unrest the Quantocks
                     might be thought to have offered shelter from political persecution such as Thelwall
                     had endured, and the shaded coombs and windswept uplands both nurtured and disciplined
                     literary composition. This is the landscape Coleridge celebrates in <em>Fears in Solitude</em> and yet, rather than offering a remove from the centre of unrest in London, Somerset
                     was the historical heartland of rebellion—as Coleridge, a Devonshire man, certainly
                     knew. A dozen miles from Nether Stowey was Taunton, a parliamentary stronghold during
                     the Civil War and an important centre for Non-conformity with an academy (c. 1670-1759)
                     linked to the network of dissent that criss-crossed the country. The Duke of Monmouth’s
                     challenge for the throne in 1685 had gathered momentum in Dorset, only to meet defeat
                     at “sad Sedge-Moor”—Thomas Hardy’s phrase (line 8). Hundreds were executed in Judge
                     Jeffreys’s “bloody assizes” that followed. When the French planned an invasion attempt
                     in 1797, they targeted a remote area of the Somerset coast close to Coleridge’s home
                     at Nether Stowey. Was this fortuitous? A matter of wind and tide? Or did the French
                     anticipate a welcome from locals whose forebears had experienced murderous retribution?
                     Certainly Coleridge and Wordsworth found a like-minded friend in Thomas Poole, the
                     tanner of Nether Stowey who had founded a poor man’s club in the village (Poole’s
                     enemies thought of the club as a private army over which he had “intire command”).

                     </div> For Thelwall, the excursion to Somerset was less an escape from the dangers of London
                     than a homecoming in a provincial landscape long associated with resistance—a resistance
                     that in the days of King Alfred had arguably led to the foundation of England itself.
                     The geopolitical history of the West Country was unquestionably a factor in the Home
                     Office decision to dispatch the spy—Coleridge’s “Spy Nosy”—to report on “the famous
                     Thelwall” and the “nest of democrats” at Alfoxden, and we can see those associations
                     continued in the next generation. Ten years later, in 1808, Leigh Hunt’s friend J.
                     P. Marriott founded the <em>Taunton Courier</em>—a liberal newspaper, modelled on Hunt’s London <em>Examiner</em>, that circulated throughout the West Country. On the first page of the first issue,
                     22 October 1808, the <em>Taunton Courier</em> carried an advertisement for Thelwall’s forthcoming lecture on “Bonaparte and the
                     Spanish patriots” at the Angel Inn, Tiverton. Hunt’s brother John, publisher of the <em>Examiner</em>, actually made his home in 1819 a few miles from Taunton at Cheddon Fitzpaine: it
                     was a settlement long postponed, for the Hunt brothers were descendants of an ancient
                     Devonshire family from South Molton. The assertive political-cultural independence
                     of <em>The Examiner</em> in which Shelley and Keats found their first readers was a West Country inheritance,
                     and that inheritance is arguably why Thelwall, Coleridge and Wordsworth had also relocated
                     from London to the Quantocks at a moment of political crisis and impending repression
                     in the mid-1790s. Often thought of in terms of “retreat,” “retirement,” and “disengagement,”
                     the road to Nether Stowey was taken by those, like Thelwall, who sought continuity,
                     confidentiality, and communication at a time of “default” in the centre. Thelwall’s
                     “eccentricity” signalled his refusal to abandon the cause: his wayward trajectory
                     to the west was a homing-in on the one area of the country likely to prove receptive
                     to his democratic campaign. If that was indeed his expectation, the experience proved
                     somewhat different from what he had anticipated—hence the fracture in the published
                     narrative of the “Excursion.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Thelwall’s “familiar and confidential correspondence” with Coleridge was the conversation
                  of t wo friends whose political ideals overlay intractable differences. Thelwall was
                  a materialist, as his <em>Essay on Animal Vitality</em> and the “Pedestrian Excursion” demonstrated. The <em>Essay</em> argued that spirit “must be material,” possibly the mysterious “electrical fluid”
                  that was simultaneously “a fine and subtle, or aeriform essence” that is “<em>superadded to matter</em>” (116-17). In the “Excursion” Thelwall’s concern is “observations”—social, topographical,
                  picturesque, architectural, economic, agricultural, gastronomic. Indeed, apart from
                  the state of his stomach, we hear almost nothing about Thelwall himself—no impressions,
                  no hint of personal feelings, no imaginative response. As a single suggestion of what
                  might have been possible, Wordsworth evidently heard about or looked over Thelwall’s
                  journal and noted his observation of how “tasteless inhabitants . . . have daubed
                  their houses, and one in particular, the very colonnade before his door, with green
                  paint” (“Pedestrian” 19). “Tintern Abbey” removes all inhabitants from the scene,
                  and restores a natural continuity between the landscape and “pastoral farms / Green
                  to the very door.” Thelwall is concerned with taste, or its lack, as materialised
                  by “the country houses of persons long immured in large cities” (20). Wordsworth’s
                  more impressionistic vision tells us of his wish to see a landscape in which human
                  presences almost pass unnoticed.</p>
               <p>At Stowey Thelwall, Coleridge, and the Wordsworths talked, walked, dined, and recited
                  poems and plays, and as David Fairer has recently argued, it rapidly became clear
                  that Thelwall’s materialism was at odds with Coleridge’s idealism and spirituality.
                  That apparent conflict did not preclude some interassimilation, as I suggested in
                  tracing “Tintern Abbey”’s conversation with Thelwall’s “Lecture on Animal Vitality”
                  (<em>Politics of Nature</em> 93-95). Thelwall, likewise, obliged to quit Nether Stowey, was aware of Coleridge’s
                  experiments with landscapes of feeling in his recent poem “This Lime-Tree Bower my
                  Prison.” That awareness is apparent in Thelwall’s own blank verse poems, “Lines Written
                  at Bridgewater” and “To the Infant Hampden,” and also in “The Phenomena of the Wye,
                  during the Winter of 1797-8” to which I now want to turn by way of concluding.</p>
               <p>There are some continuities between the narrative of the “Pedestrian Excursion” that
                  in chronological terms preceded the “The Phenomena of the Wye” but, as indicated already,
                  saw print rather later. As apparent are some notable differences. In particular, “The
                  Phenomena of the Wye” shows us Thelwall moving towards a more subjective, mediated
                  vision that discovers emblems or symbols of his own feelings in the landscape. The
                  “eccentric ramble” of Thelwall’s recent past greets the “intricate meanders” of the
                  Wye in a moment of self-recognition that is also an acknowledgement of survival amid
                  “eternal diversity” (“Wye” 4). If we do not hear the thoughts and feelings of the
                  “pensive wanderer” who saunters along the banks, the sight of “successive strata of
                  sand, of gravel, and of rock” glimpsed through the “transparent stream” is suggestive
                  of depth and retrospection (as in Coleridge’s sonnet “To the River Otter”) (4). Thelwall
                  the materialist is now prepared to grant that a scene may be “enchanting” and may
                  result in “curiosity inflamed”; the atmosphere can be “thick,” and a sky “sullen”
                  (3). Here are “mingled impressions” (4), a “transparent veil” (7), “rays of sun tingling
                  with transient glow” (6), and “a sort of wild and awful music” reminiscent of the
                  poems of Ossian (8). Thelwall was on the way to realising how the language and rhythms
                  of poetry offered the release, the response, and the “intimate communication” he had
                  sought in making his “Excursion” to meet Coleridge at Stowey (“Pedestrian” 17). As
                  he tapped into his own experiences and feelings in the post-Nether Stowey <em>Poems Written in Retirement</em> of 1801, Thelwall was already alert to poetry’s potential to liberate those whose
                  speech was as fractured as his own. Thelwall’s “road to Nether Stowey” led beyond
                  the village limits, to the Wye, to Liswyn, and, ultimately, to his Institute of Elocution
                  at Lincoln’s Inn Fields.</p>
