                     “Introduction”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay introduces the Romantic-period political reformer and polymath John Thelwall
                  and takes stock of his rapid critical renaissance over the past decade. The announcement
                  of a new archival find, a copy of a seventeenth-century play owned and annotated by
                  Thelwall, serves to highlight the range of his interests and activities. Presenting
                  Thelwall as a leading representative of “romantic sociability,” I situate him within
                  wider social and intellectual networks than have hitherto been mapped, and I raise
                  questions about the coherence and continuity of his diverse pursuits—literary, political,
                  and scientific—that demand further attention. My brief overview of the essays collected
                  here emphasizes how they address those questions, engaging with one another, with
                  existing Thelwall scholarship, and with Romantic studies more generally. This introduction
                  also sets forth the rationale for the volume as part of the larger project <em>John Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments</em> (forthcoming) and explains why Romantic Circles is an especially appropriate venue
                  for that project’s efforts to advance Thelwall studies by reconnecting text, voice,
                  and image in the dynamic way for which Thelwall himself was renowned.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This article presents arguments for continuities in John Thelwall’s life and career
                  from the early 1790s through to the new century, post-1800. Thelwall’s westward migration
                  in 1797 is explored in detail, as is the publication of his essay "The Phenomena of
                  the Wye" in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> for May and July of 1798. Consideration is given to Thelwall’s various identities,
                  and to the political/cultural significances of England’s west country between 1797
                  and 1819. Thelwall’s friendship with Coleridge is assessed in the light of intractable
                  differences between the two men.</p>

                     “John Thelwall and the Politics of the Picturesque”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay explores the political significance of John Thelwall’s engagement with
                  the discourse of the picturesque in his travel writing of the 1790s. E. P. Thompson
                  asserted that Thelwall’s turn to travel writing in the immediate aftermath of his
                  metropolitan radical career demonstrated the success of the authorities in driving
                  him out of politics. For Thompson, Thelwall’s essays “A Pedestrian Excursion” and
                  “The Phenomena of the Wye” (1798-1801) were “conventional” and “unremarkable” examples
                  of the picturesque tour, in which Thelwall reneged on his reformist principles by
                  failing to engage with the working people he encountered. Recent critical accounts
                  have defended Thelwall against Thompson’s charge by accentuating the sociological
                  emphasis of the pedestrian tours and playing down Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque.
                  This essay argues that it is precisely through an exploration of the picturesque that
                  Thelwall finds a new medium for the articulation of his political ideals. Thelwall’s
                  turn to the picturesque is not just a response to political harassment. <em>The Peripatetic</em> (1793) demonstrates Thelwall’s long-held fascination with visual forms, though it
                  expresses distrust at the abstracting effects of spectatorship. In <em>The Peripatetic</em>, Thelwall begins an exploration of alternative means of “seeing,” namely the material
                  exploration of both the landscape and social configurations. This exploration is continued
                  and refined in the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Phenomena of the Wye,” where the language
                  of Thelwall’s descriptions of landscape anticipate his engagement with the politics
                  of free speech in his elocutionary writings of the next decade.</p>

               <p class="noCount">John Thelwall’s elocutionary career has frequently been understood as a renunciation
                  of his revolutionary politics. This essay questions such an assessment. I argue that
                  once we understand the associationist model of mind that guides both Thelwall’s elocutionary
                  work and his political philosophy, we see that throughout his career Thelwall was
                  pursuing a common end: strengthening associations in the minds that inhabited, and
                  created, the public sphere.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This essay argues for a reassessment of John Thelwall’s career as an elocutionary
                  scientist in light of recent work in the history of medicine and Disability Studies.
                  Traditionally understood as apolitical—at least in comparison to his involvement in
                  radical politics and materialist science—Thelwall’s therapeutic endeavor should instead
                  be recognized as significantly demonstrating his continued dedication to democratic
                  ideals. Thelwall’s elocutionary texts are, in fact, provocatively egalitarian, and
                  as an elocutionary scientist Thelwall actively resisted the normative views of disability
                  that were beginning to consolidate during the era.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In the years following his acquittal for High Treason in 1794, John Thelwall came
                  to personify all that English loyalists most feared about the plebeian democrats of
                  the London Corresponding Society. In loyalist discourse, he became at one and the
                  same time, an intemperate but horribly effective Jacobin orator, and a covert conspirator
                  working quietly behind the scenes to ally the Foxite opposition with the LCS and some
                  of its insurrectionary fellow travellers. The apparent disjuncture in Thelwall's character
                  between public bluster and private plotting presented a unique set of problems for
                  loyalist caricature, explicitly demonstrated in the practice of the best known ministerial
                  cartoonists of the period, Rowlandson, Cruikshank and Gillray. This essay explores
                  some of the ways in which this dichotomy was resolved in visual culture, and assesses
                  the impact of popular prints like these on the manufacturing of Thelwall's political
                  reputation. </p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">From January to June 1826, Thelwall edited, wrote, and marketed <em>The Panoramic Miscellany</em>, a monthly periodical that demonstrates his ongoing commitment to political causes,
                  public education, elocutionary training, and literary criticism. This essay examines
                  the context and contents of the little-known <em>Panoramic Miscellany</em>, showing that Thelwall’s editorial policy and discursive practice depend heavily
                  on his experience as lecturer and educator and that the <em>Panoramic Miscellany</em> stands out for its international perspective, its attention to women writers, and
                  the integrity of its book reviews. The unsuccessful attempt of Thelwall the lecturer
                  to become an independent journalist offers insights into the experimental and volatile
                  media context of the 1820s.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay traces the meandering career of Weymouth Birkbeck Thelwall, the son of
                  John Thelwall and his former pupil and second wife, the young and beautiful Henrietta
                  Cecil Boyle. Born on the eve of reform and near the end of John Thelwall’s life, Weymouth
                  followed in his father’s artistic, adventurous and amorous footsteps; creating his
                  own peripatetic journey which led him eventually to a tragic and isolated death in
                  colonial Nyasaland. His life narrative graphically illustrates how the Romantic idealism
                  espoused by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century radicals; the reforms in education,
                  and the civil and religious liberties which they campaigned for had unlooked for consequences,
                  culminating in the late Victorian grab for Africa figured in Joseph Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em>. In Weymouth Thelwall we have a true “son of John Thelwall” and a strangely prophetic
                  model of Mr. Kurz: citizen, artist, journalist and romantic idealist—with an eye to
                  the main chance and a defiant propensity to take one too many risks.</p>
