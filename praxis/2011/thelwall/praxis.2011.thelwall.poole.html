               <h1><span class="head">Gillray, Cruikshank &amp; Thelwall: Visual Satire, Physiognomy and the Jacobin Body</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>This essay examines the role of loyalist visual satire in the making and shaping of
               political notoriety during the period 1795-1825. Its subject is John Thelwall, the
               first non-elite English radical to be caricatured with reference to a recognisable
               physiognomy in the 1790s and, by contemporary reputation at least, the most influential
               and politically dangerous of the English Jacobins. It will be argued that Thelwall
               presented loyalist caricature with a particular set of problems. First, Thelwall enjoyed
               a particularly high public profile as a platform orator and lecturer in the 1790s,
               which meant that his face was well enough known to justify representation in more
               precise terms than those customarily used to depict the anonymous “Jacobin beast.”
               Even those that had never seen him might still recognise an accurate caricature because
               at least two engraved portraits and one bust on a commemorative conder coin were in
               circulation by the time of the 1794 Treason Trials and these likenesses share many
               physiognomical features in common. Second, much of Thelwall’s notoriety derived from
               his animated manner and volatility on the platform, which, taken together with his
               relatively small physical stature, offered caricaturists a vehicle for attitudinal,
               rather than simply facial, representation; but if Thelwall’s energetic manner was
               a subject for derogatory satire, it was also, conversely, the very thing that made
               him attractive to audiences. Third, Thelwall’s physiognomy was not remotely bestial.
               As contemporary biographers like John Aiken well understood, the heavy facial characteristics
               of a famously swarthy target like Fox, or Pitt, a man who “possessed no advantages
               of person or physiognomy, the first of which was ungraceful, the second repulsive”
               (200), were far more easily exaggerated and lampooned by caricaturists. In Thelwall’s
               case, the most likely effect of the sort of grotesque or sub-human representation
               commonly afforded in caricature to stock Jacobin figures would be personal anonymity
               rather than recognition, while faithful portraiture ran the equally undesirable risk
               of flattery. It will therefore be argued here that strategies are identifiable in
               the practice of James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank by which Thelwall’s physiognomy
               and bodily energy were (differently) negotiated and accommodated within a broadly
               loyalist discourse, although neither artist found the assimilation particularly easy.
               Only when Thelwall announced his retirement from public life and retreated to Llyswen
               at the end of 1797 did caricaturists settle upon a common form of unambiguous representation
               and, from this moment on, Thelwall became a cartoon signifier of radical defeat and
               deflation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Since most plebeian English Jacobins of the 1790s were unrecognisable to the wider
                  public, caricature representations tended to adopt a familiar visual language. Jacobins,
                  like Frenchmen, were invariably ragged, ignorant, unkempt, ungainly and cowardly with
                  poor complexions, Neanderthal brows and gaping mouths. In both attitude and physiognomy,
                  they were unprepossessing. Although the relatively respectable reformers Horne Tooke
                  and Joseph Priestley had both been the subject of likeness caricatures prior to Thelwall’s
                  rise to prominence in 1794, the only plebeian English Jacobin deemed worthy of personal
                  attention between 1792 and 1793 was Tom Paine. But Paine was a writer, not an orator,
                  and since most people had no idea what he looked like, caricaturists did not trouble
                  themselves with his likeness. Consequently, Paine was recognisable in caricature only
                  by his proximity to objects with which he was associated, most commonly a copy of <em>Rights of Man</em>, an excise book, or a pair of stays.

                           and Caricatures of Paine.” </span></div>
                  </div> Besides Thelwall, the London Corresponding Society’s best known public figure in 1795
                  was John Gale Jones, another radical whose fame was dependent upon his oratory. But,
                  perhaps because he was not tried for treason in 1794, Jones’s profile never appeared
                  on commemorative tokens, and no engraved portrait is known before 1798. Consequently,
                  when occasional reference was made to him in anti-Jacobin caricatures he was no more
                  identifiable from his features than Paine had been.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The pseudo-science of physiognomy reached the height of its popularity in England
                  at precisely the same time that Thelwall was honing his oratorical style and Gillray,
                  Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson were fully developing the art of political caricature.
                  Johann Caspar Lavater’s <em>Essays on Physiognomy</em>, originally published in German some twenty years earlier, were available to English
                  readers in twelve versions and in five different translations during the 1790s. Lavater’s
                  theories linking the body and the structure of the face to standards of morality and
                  intellect were extraordinarily influential, not only among artists and their teaching
                  academies, but among popular radicals seeking rational and scientific pathways to
                  social and political virtue on the one hand and physiology on the other. Thelwall,
                  who had signalled his interest in definitions of vitality by publishing a controversial
                  essay on the subject in 1793, was an advocate and so too was Godwin. Indeed, the most
                  popular of the 1790s editions of Lavater’s <em>Essays</em> was translated by the playwright Thomas Holcroft, a member of the Society for Constitutional
                  Information and, like Thelwall, indicted and committed to Newgate for treason in 1794.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                           Vitality.” </span></div>
                  </div> Nor did the popularisation of Lavater occur in a vacuum. A related attempt to “scientifically”
                  measure intelligence and beauty against such material variables as head shape, nose
                  length or the depth of the forehead was first published by the Dutchman Petrus Camper
                  in 1791, for instance, and then translated for an edited and popular English edition
                  in 1794. Camper’s work, moreover, was specifically concerned with the replication
                  of these physiological ideas in the arts. Given public familiarity with both Thelwall’s
                  physiognomy and his explosive bodily performance, caricaturists had every opportunity
                  to adopt a more personal approach in their handling of Thelwall than they had deployed
                  against Paine, and every encouragement to fully pursue it. As Gillray’s elderly friend,
                  the one-time Tory MP Viscount Bateman, would later remind him, “It is in your hands
                  to lower the opposition. Nothing mortifies them so much as being ridiculed and exposed
                  in every window” (qtd. in Donald 170). However, although the two most prominent print
                  satirists of the period, Gillray and Cruikshank, both made use of physiognomical likeness
                  in dealing with Thelwall, they addressed the problem of his physical energy in diverging
                  ways.

            </div>
            <p>Thelwall’s first appearance in caricature is also his best known. Gillray’s <em>Copenhagen House </em>(1795) depicts the mass outdoor LCS meeting of 12 November 1795 and was published
               four days after it. Thelwall is not named in the print, nor is he identified from
               speech bubbles or rolls of paper with “lectures” written on them, as he would sometimes
               be in later efforts. But he is clearly identifiable from his physiognomy and from
               what we might term his oratorical attitude. Gillray, who had studied physiognomy in
               the Royal Academy schools, was, like any trained artist of the period, well acquainted
               with the contents of Lavater’s <em>Essays</em>, and in 1798 would make direct reference to them in a satire entitled <em>Dublures of Characters or Striking Resemblances of Physiognomy</em>, in which members of the Foxite Opposition were made to reveal a series of satanic
               alter-egos. The association made by Gillray between face, expression and body in his
               depiction of Thelwall for <em>Copenhagen House</em> closely echoed Lavater’s assertion that “the affections of the mind should express
               themselves by the voice, the gestures, but especially by the countenance, and man
               should thus communicate to man his love, his resentment and the other emotions of
               his soul by a language perfectly infallible and universally understood” (Lavater 51).
               Thelwall understood platform performance in these cohesive terms too, for as he saw
               it, it is “uniformity and animation which should give life to [these] lectures” (<em>Tribune</em> 3: 137). Only a month before the Copenhagen House meeting, he had apologised to an
               audience when poor health inherited from prison forced him, “a shattered feeble remnant
               of a man” (3:137), to deliver lectures reduced to “a statement of facts and principles
               and the conclusions that result from them,” rather than “enter into digressions that
               would arouse my passions and feelings and occasion me to speak with particular warmth
               and animation” (3: 17). Without the uniform engagement of heart and body with mind
               and voice, he feared, a lecture lost its capacity to inspire. This uniform engagement
               is deeply embedded in Gillray’s representation of Thelwall, accentuated by a profound
               separation from both the collective grotesquerie<em> </em>of his dullard audience and the more prosaic attitudes of the less accomplished orators
               on the other two platforms. While the lowly status of his platform colleagues is indicated
               by their shabby clothing and trades (butcher, dissenting minister and barber), Thelwall
               appears dressed as a gentleman of sorts, elevated materially and figuratively from
               the LCS and its audience, in a greatcoat and a ruffled stock. </p>

            <p>If we are invited to read a degree of irrational anger in the clenching of his fists,
               and uncouthness in the gaping of his mouth, it remains a considerably kinder portrayal
               than the oddly twisted form given to Thomas Erskine, Thelwall’s principal defender
               a year earlier during the Treason Trials, by Isaac Cruikshank in <em>Cool Arguments!!!</em> (1794). Gillray’s Thelwall retains a degree of balance and self-possession that Cruikshank’s
               Erskine has almost lost, the barrister’s awkward body satirically betraying the “cool
               argument” of the title, and rendering him in the process considerably more comic than
               the <em>bête noir</em> of Jacobinism. Thelwall was no stranger to the political dynamics of empiricism and
               distortion in the manufacture of “likeness,” or the delicate balance between truth,
               poetic licence and caricature, and wrote about it at some length. In the course of
               his pedestrian tour from London to the West Country to visit Coleridge in 1797, he
               studied the classical busts at Wilton House and noted discrepancies between the recorded
               features of various Roman heroes and villains and their historical reputations. He
               was fascinated by the conflicting messages suggested by Seneca’s “open mouth and the
               mixture of voluptuousness and intellectual power blended in the lines and solid parts
               of the face” because he regarded Seneca as a genius too flawed “to live with the purity
               of a philosopher.” But two busts of Brutus, whose love of liberty and virtue Shakespeare
               and a great many historians had been so careful to record, presented a physiognomy
               that was “assassination personified.” Here was cause for thought. “What shall we say
               to this? Are the portraits fictitious? Or have we been imposed upon by legendary panegyrics?”
               The latter, he decided, was the more likely answer. The politically motivated distortions
               of history might always be exposed by returning to the evidence of the face itself.
               “Perhaps our admiration of Brutus or Cassius may have been carried too far,” he reflected.
               “For my own part, establish the authenticity of the likeness and I will believe the
               testimony of a man’s countenance in preference to his historian” (“Pedestrian” 30-32).

            <p> Fig. 4 William Ridley (after Henry Richter), John Thelwall (1794).</p>
            <p>By the time of the Copenhagen House meeting, Gillray had at least two serious portraits
               of Thelwall upon which to draw, both derived from sketches taken in the Tower by Henry
               Richter, the brother of Thelwall’s co-defendant, John. These two engravings are equally
               careful in their recording of Thelwall’s slim body, long nose, strong chin, slight
               pinching of the brow (both this and the rolled scroll recalling classical representations
               of Demosthenes), thin, fashionably cropped hair cut back from the forehead but just
               over the ears, and an elaborately ruffled stock. It is fair to assume that this is
               a close enough approximation to Thelwall’s actual appearance at the age of thirty,
               and as portraits they correspond quite convincingly with the sharp featured bust of
               Thelwall that appeared on commemorative conder tokens at roughly the same time. </p>

               <p>To these we can add John Hazlitt’s portrait in oils, and the miniature profile line
                  drawing that accompanied his appearance in <em>Public Characters</em>, both made about six years later when Thelwall had “retired” from politics. These
                  various portraits may be read as self-conscious attempts to emphasise physical signs,
                  not of oratorical enthusiasm or of reason lost but of reason secured. They emphasise
                  the performative element of Thelwall’s public persona as transitory and self-controlled,
                  and provide a balance both to the <em>appearance </em>of spasmodic excitability on the platform and to some of the crude representations
                  of the diseased and emaciated Jacobin body so characteristic of the visual language
                  of loyalism.

                  </div> Although Gillray made no attempt in this print to miniaturise his subject, Thelwall
                  was the first to admit his own “want of figure” and “feeble constitution” (“Prefatory”
                  64), for as we learn from his second wife, Cecil, “his chest was narrow; part of his
                  pleura had firmly adhered to his ribs” (Mrs. Thelwall 40). Thomas Noon Talfourd regarded
                  Thelwall as “small” and “compact” (298), and the Bow Street Officer James Walsh concurred;
                  he was “a little stout man with dark cropt hair,” quite unlike the dominant figure
                  in <em>Copenhagen House</em>. This smallness of stature did not make him <em>appear</em> feeble, however, for he was strongly built and held himself well. Talfourd, in fact,
                  also remembered Thelwall as “muscular,” with a body sturdy enough to support “a head
                  denoting indomitable resolution, and features deeply furrowed by the ardent workings

            <p>The perception of balance between passion and reason was of particular concern for
               public speakers like Thelwall for, as Godwin would have it, every orator was prone
               to “a due mixture of spices and seasoning” in his delivery, since “quiet disquisition
               and mere speculative enquiry will not answer his purpose” (20). Bombastic enthusiasm,
               Godwin feared, led to exaggeration and over-emphasis and risked a counter-productive
               incitement to irrational acts of violence. It is well known that Thelwall challenged
               Godwin over these allegations during the public debates over Pitt’s Gagging Bills
               in 1795, and it is clear that Godwin felt his case proven by the intemperate nature
               of Thelwall’s rebuttals, and the “angry temper” that gave rise to them. “It is impossible
               for me to answer the farrago of abusive language you send me,” Godwin retorted (Cestre
               203-04). Godwin was not alone among Thelwall’s political sympathisers in airing his
               misgivings about the orator’s volcanic temper. Talfourd put it this way: “Thelwall
               spoke boldly and vehemently at a time when indignation was thought to be a virtue
               . . . . [S]peech was, in him, all in all, his delight, his profession, his triumph,
               with little else than passion to inspire or colour it” (296). More than once Thelwall
               intimated that the passions of the heart should not be held accountable to the reasonings
               of the head, but rather the two should be Socratically harmonized, though few thought
               he had achieved it. An inevitable consequence of oratorical passion, it was argued
               in one anti-Jacobin tract, was that “the multitude echo the variable will of the demagogue,
               he wields their dreadful caprice and hurls it at whatever opposes his own interests.
               The multitude is the unenlightened part of a Nation; and the multitude is the tool
               of the demagogue” (<em>Rights of Citizens</em> 116).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If the representation of Thelwall’s features in Richter and Hazlitt’s portraits was
                  intended to invoke a calm and intellectual counterpoint to platform energy, it was
                  nevertheless subject to alternative readings by loyalist writers who saw in it less
                  a revelation of the self than a concealment. The anti-Jacobin novelist George Walker,
                  for example, who used Thelwall undisguisedly as a model for his sinister and classically
                  minded democratic orator in <em>The Vagabond</em> (1799), considered these same features to reveal “a little dark-complexioned man with
                  a most hypocritical countenance and a grin of self-applause mingled with contempt”
                  (79).

                  </div> Physiognomical interpretation was, unsurprisingly, of considerable interest to Thelwall,
                  who confirmed his belief in Lavater’s strictures on more than one occasion, and took
                  more than a passing interest in the facial and cranial peculiarities of his own family.
                  To Peter Crompton of Liverpool he assessed his son Algernon in 1798: “I have a thousand
                  Shandean notions about him—the peculiar form of his head, the remarkable cast of his
                  features, and the thousand antic forms into which he is every now and then distorting
                  them fill me with many a proud and many an anxious thought.” In fact, Thelwall was
                  confident enough of his own features to seek comment from Coleridge on a now lost
                  self-portrait, either written or drawn in 1796, and the satisfaction with which he
                  regarded the strong lines of his own nose and chin may be judged from the rude remarks
                  he would later make about the supposed weaknesses of his literary adversary Francis
                  Jeffrey’s.

                           to a series of observations about the inadequacies of his own physiognomy (Letter
                           to Thelwall). Of Jeffrey, whose critical reviews of the Poems of 1801 hugely irritated
                           Thelwall, he wrote, “To all the advantage to be derived from the shortness of his
                           chin, Mr Jeffrey is most certainly entitled, and it may perhaps be of some importance
                           to those whose forwardness is more conspicuous than their understanding, that their
                           chins as well as their noses, should not be over prominent” (Reply 163).</span></div>

            </div>
            <p>Since Jacobin self-representation was partly to be a balancing act between base demagoguery
               and Demosthenian assertion, Thelwall was careful to embrace and improve upon Lavater’s
               unification of voice, gesture and countenance in the construction of his own public
               self as well as in the advice he later gave to his elocution students. There was an
               important distinction to be made between histrionic excess or the “theatrical elocution”
               of the stage, and the sort of expressive oratory that arose from “the <em>harmony</em> of features, voice and action.” Controlled gesticulation, moreover, was natural to
               the “deportment of all persons when excited,” a “natural part of eloquence” in fact,
               and its “habitual restraint the chief cause of graceless and extravagant action” (<em>Selections</em>-York 2). Thelwall’s students were lectured on physiognomy and encouraged to cultivate
               facial expression as a natural accompaniment to vocal inflection and bodily stance.
               The “fashionable insipidity” of an “inexpressive countenance,” Thelwall told them,
               suggested only a “vacancy of mind” (<em>Selections</em>-Hull). Moreover, insipid oratory was the consequence of a conspiracy amongst modern
               elocutionists “to reduce almost all public speaking but that of the stage to one sympathetic
               monotony of tone and look and attitude” so that “all expression of attitude and feature
               . . . ought to be confined to the mummeries for which they are supposed to have been
               invented” (<em>Vestibule</em> 20).</p>
            <p>A holistic approach to vitality and character is a constant trait in Thelwall’s writing.
               From our introduction to his imaginary companion and virtual alter-ego, Ambulator,
               in <em>The Peripatetic</em> of 1793, with his “small, but erect and manly form, his open brow, his strong but
               softened features, and his forward-darting eye, which reveal to the physiognomist
               the internal graces and dignity of his mind” (88-89), to the manifesto-like appeals
               of the <em>Vestibule of Eloquence</em> seventeen years later, Thelwall consistently linked the science of physiognomy with
               improving elocution, deportment and intellect. Language alone would not suffice; on
               the contrary, “nature’s epitome, like nature’s self, must sympathise through every
               element: motion and look and attitude must manifest the inspiration of genuine feeling;
               and every portion of the frame must be vital with expressive eloquence” (<em>Vestibule</em> 21). Gillray, whose own practice was largely based upon an appreciation of exaggerated
               animation and physiognomical distortion, was clearly fascinated by Thelwall and his
               attitude towards him remained characteristically ambiguous. In <em>Copenhagen House</em>, the dynamic contrast between Gillray’s Thelwall and Gillray’s crowd is not intended
               to confer much credit upon the latter; indeed, the argument of the print is dependent
               upon the accentuation of distance between the two. Understandably, Thelwall rejected
               any association between his crowd and Burke’s swinish multitude, and used physiognomy
               once again to refute the charge. “I am not speaking to an unenlightened and uninformed
               auditory,” he declared, “I can perceive countenances, many of which I know, and in
               many of which, though I do not know them, I can read the lines of intelligence and
               education” (<em>Tribune</em> 3: 248). Gillray may not have been prepared to accept that but, like Coleridge, he
               was not unaware that “Thelwall is the voice of tens of thousands” (Coleridge, <em>Plot</em> 20-21), and the clear evidence of Thelwall’s personal magnetism did not present obvious
               strategies for hostile loyalist caricature.</p>
            <p>Thelwall certainly felt his own persuasive genius, “for he had the satisfaction of
               seeing persons filling considerable stations in society who had at first gone to hear
               him with every hostile intention, become his warmest approvers; and very frequently,
               in after life, he was greeted by men of first-rate intellect and staunch reformers,
               with their acknowledgement that he was their political father” (Mrs. Thelwall 405-06).

            <p>The exceptionalism implicit in Gillray’s image can be demonstrated by comparing it
               to the only previous attempt by a caricaturist to represent LCS oratory, the anonymous
               <em>Billy’s Hobby Horse</em> (1795) in which the St. George’s Fields meeting of 29 June 1795 forms part of the
               background. The only speaker that day was John Gale Jones, visible in the print with
               his arm raised, but no attempt has been made at likeness or oratorical posture and
               the meeting’s marginal position behind the principal figures of Pitt and John Bull
               reduces its role to one of commentary and context rather than argument and agency.
               We might also note the immediate and wholesale plagiarism of Gillray’s figure by Cruikshank
               in <em>The Royal Extinguisher</em> (1795), published a few days after <em>Copenhagen House</em>, and avoiding the political ambiguity underpinning Gillray’s print. In Cruikshank’s
               hands, Thelwall, though bodily identical, has become ridiculously Lilliputian; railing
               punily against Pitt’s towering Gulliver while the shelter of Gillray’s sun umbrella
               has been replaced by a gigantic candle snuffer. By contrast, Gillray’s ambivalent
               refusal to treat the LCS as a serious threat was not particularly helpful to ministerial
               arguments for the suppression of free speech and public assembly in the wake of the
               attack on the King’s coach a few weeks earlier. Indeed, some of the most diminutive
               and ineffectual figures in <em>Copenhagen House</em> are the central representations of Fox and Pitt as children chancing their luck on
               an EO table while an unrestrained Thelwall thunders above their heads. Perhaps to
               avoid the ambiguity of presenting the public with the sort of irrepressibly energetic
               Thelwall they might actually recognise, therefore, Cruikshank changed tack after the
               passage of the Two Acts, divorced the orator from his popular constituency and re-fashioned
               him as a dupe of the Foxite Whigs.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Rumours of a closer working relationship between the Fox and the LCS began to circulate
                  publicly late in 1795. Cruikshank had already placed Fox, Sheridan and Stanhope in
                  the Lilliputian crowd surrounding Thelwall in the <em>Royal Extinguisher</em>, and Gillray had made them leaders of the mob that attacked the King’s coach on October
                  29th in his highly ambiguous <em>Republican Attack</em>. These rumours gathered pace, however, after Fox and several of his parliamentary
                  allies attended Thelwall’s speech against the Gagging Bills at the last mass outdoor
                  meeting of the Society on 7 December (<em>Morning Post</em> 8 Dec. 1795). This was followed by a series of debates on “the most probable means
                  left of saving the country from the despotism of the minister” in the Westminster
                  Forum at which John Gale Jones claimed he had been waited upon by prominent Whigs
                  and invited to join a general coalition against Pitt (Thale 330). In fact, according
                  to Cecil Thelwall’s account, “Thelwall was the means of this union which now took
                  place between the Whig Club and the London Corresponding Society,” for each had become
                  “necessary to the preservation of the other,” although the LCS officially denied having
                  anything to do with it (Mrs. Thelwall 399). Rumours circulated during the general
                  election campaign of 1796 that Thelwall was intending to contest war minister William
                  Windham’s seat at Norwich, but in fact he busied himself in supporting Fox at Westminster,
                  where the Whig leader and the Pittite Admiral Allan Gardner were involved in a three-cornered
                  contest with Thelwall’s first political mentor, John Horne Tooke. Thelwall had quarrelled
                  with Tooke after the Treason Trials, but hoped now to see him elected with Fox at
                  Gardner’s expense. He used the campaign to make a number of speeches calling for cross-party
                  radical unity to defeat the ministry, but although Fox was returned, Gardner forced
                  Tooke into third place.

                           Morning Post 9 and 14 June 1796. Thelwall shared Tooke’s philological interest in
                           creating a devolved non-elite language of politics and, like Tooke, was frequently
                           taken to task by the loyalist press for dangerously addressing plebeian audiences
                           in non-elite language. On this subject, see Jenks. For Thelwall’s relationship with
                           Tooke, see Mrs. Thelwall 343-44. William Windham was notorious for referring to Thelwall
                           and his fellow treason trial defendants of 1794 as “acquitted felons.”</span></div>
                  </div> Despite appearances, Tooke and Fox had not in fact entered into a coalition, but government
                  supporters made capital from it and were quick to point out that, “among the worthy
                  electors in the interest of our senator were to be numbered Citizen John Thelwall,
                  Citizen John Gale Jones, and not a few members of the Corresponding Society” (Bisset
                  3: 381). This too was the theme of Thomas Rowlandson’s <em>Sir Alan Gardiner at Covent Garden</em> (1796) in which, not for the last time, Thelwall’s unwise associations left him headless,
                  along with both Hardy and Tooke. This was the first caricature print to use the verbal
                  joke “tell-well,” a nick-name for the lecturer that first surfaced in <em>The Times</em> in 1794.

            <p>Shortly after this, Thelwall left London for his first provincial lecture tour and
               ceased for a time to be of interest to the capital’s satirists. However, when Fox
               found himself as without influence in the reconstituted parliament as he had been
               in the previous one, he led his party into a symbolic secession from the House, citing
               as causes Pitt’s retreat into cabinet government and the intransigence of the ministry
               over reform and the continuation of the war. Instead, he proposed co-operation with
               the extra-parliamentary reform movement who would otherwise be either “too weak to
               resist the Court” or, more ominously, prone to dangerous “excesses” (<em>Public Advertiser</em> 8 Aug. 1797). Unsurprisingly, Fox’s loyalist critics suspected darker motives, for
               “telling the People that their parliament will not listen to reason” was “little short
               of an invitation to civil war” (Wells 65-66). The suspicion that radicals like Thelwall
               and Tooke were secretly plotting with disaffected parliamentarians like Fox, Stanhope,
               Sheridan and the Duke of Bedford to overthrow the State proved irresistible to satirists
               and in June, Thelwall reappeared as a pivotal figure in a series of critical prints
               by Cruikshank. </p>

            <p>These prints do not address Thelwall’s bodily energy, however, partly perhaps because
               other ministerial propagandists were emphasising the success of the Gagging Acts in
               stopping his mouth. “It is all over with me,” he is made to lament in one pamphlet,

            <p> For Cruikshank, however, Thelwall was more dangerous without his lectern than with
               it. In these prints, he may be recognised from his likeness and from textual allusions
               to lecturing, but he is otherwise unremarkable as he consorts privately with his influential
               new allies. In the first of them, <em>The Diversions of Purley</em>, Thelwall appears as part of the secessionist coalition with Erskine, Fox, Sheridan,
               Stanhope and Grey. He is no longer the orator but the secretive plotter, in a busy
               nursery, scissoring “old fashioned” aristocratic ermine to make swaddling for Fox’s
               monstrous offspring, master Revolution and miss Sedition. Should his profile be insufficient
               to identify him, he addresses a figure who breaks into the frame from the left with
               a query, “Did you hear my last lecture?” This figure is Horne Tooke, whose best known
               work provides the satire with its title, and who answers Thelwall with another question,
               “Have you heard from Sheerness”? Together, Tooke’s question and his peripheral position
               provide a commentary on Thelwall’s role as intermediary between Fox and Tooke on the
               one hand and between Jacobinism and the naval mutinies on the other. The mutiny at
               the Nore, close to the Kent coast at Sheerness, had broken out simultaneously with
               the second mutiny at Spithead, Portsmouth. John Gale Jones had been sent on a lecturing
               mission to the Kentish dockyards in 1796 and the LCS had gone to some trouble to encourage
               radical societies at Portsmouth. They were now widely suspected in the loyalist press
               of agitating amongst the sailors and schooling them in political and democratic demands.
               In May, <em>The True Briton</em> had claimed Thelwall was on the Isle of Wight, “not an indifferent spectator, doubtless,
               of the late proceedings at Spithead,” and Cruikshank’s allusion is not unpredictable
               (12 May 1797). <em>Diversions of Purley</em> was followed four days later by a second comment on the mutinies, <em>The Delegates in Council</em>. Thelwall, having flitted from his Janus-like role between Fox and Tooke to the lower
               deck HMS Sandwich at the Nore, was now placed in a more sinister position as familiar,
               prompter and grog-server to the mutineers in the negotiation of terms with Admiral
               Buckner. Tooke resumes his rightful position under the table with the Foxite parliamentarians,
               but Thelwall stands openly beside his grotesquely drawn plebeian associates, fixes
               the Admiral squarely in the eye and issues instructions: “Tell him we intend to be
               masters,” he says, “I”ll read him a lecture.” Here, Cruikshank persuades his audience,
               was a man uniquely comfortable in both Opposition and insurrectionary circles and
               apparently able not only to move between them with ease but to direct operations from
               an assumed position of authority. </p>

            <p>Later in the month, Cruikshank produced a third related image, <em>The</em> <em>Watchman of the State</em>. As in <em>Diversions of Purley</em>, Fox is the central figure, this time in the character of an absconding watchman,
               deserting his post and abdicating his responsibility to keep the more extreme wing
               of the democratic coalition under control. Lauderdale and Bedford watch and applaud
               while Horne Tooke, Sheridan, and Stanhope lay gunpowder trails to destroy the constitution,
               the Commons and the Lords. A diminutive Thelwall, with a paper marked “Norwich lectures”
               in his pocket, once again provides the link with extra-parliamentary mischief making,
               this time lighting a taper from Stanhope’s lantern in a bid to destroy aristocracy.</p>
            <p>In all three of these prints, Cruikshank’s approach is different from Gillray’s. Thelwall’s
               physiognomy is reproduced with sufficient accuracy to make him recognisable, and his
               features do not undergo even the slight comedic distortions made use of by Gillray.
               But no allusion is made to his oratorical voice or to his bodily energy. He is in
               fact quite unremarkable, and this, perhaps, is Cruikshank’s point. What makes Thelwall
               dangerous is not the bluster and posturing of his high profile public performances
               but his chameleon-like ability to flit between various reform parties, belonging to
               none but at ease in any. Given Thelwall’s self-evident personal attractions and his
               polymathical intellectual dabblings in science, philosophy and the arts, some loyalist
               approaches to Jacobinism identified a framework of fluidity, sophistry and adaptability
               in the belly of the beast. As the arch-loyalist Robert Bisset put it, seemingly with
               Thelwall in mind: <span class="quote">‘One prominent feature often mentioned in Jacobinism is its versatility . . . . He
                  is at one time a pamphleteer . . . we have him next as a novel-monger . . . next the
                  Jacobin tries his hand at play-writing . . . the Jacobin now changes himself into
                  the form of a lecturer, and from his tub his nightly nonsense pours . . . dabbling
                  a little in metaphysics which are too deep for being fathomed by his line of understanding,
                  he next comes upon us as a political philosopher . . . he turns critic next, and as
                  a reviewer attempts to spread the beneficial doctrines and precepts of the various
                  works he brings out in his other manifold capacities . . . he is a Socinian, a Methodist,
                  a Seceder, a Presbyterian, a Roman Catholic, or a Mahometan; he has projected to be
                  a Hindoo; he has been seen in the mosque and on his way to the pagoda, he struts at
                  the school desk, he pops upon us in the conventicle, and assails us on the roadside.
                  (Bisset 2: 242-43)’</span> Duplicity of this kind is rarely betrayed by low appearance or bad physiognomy; on
               the contrary, when understood on these terms, the Jacobin may be anonymous, prosaic,
               unnoticed. The Jacobin was not the first folk-devil to be constructed in this way
               for it had also been the fate of the eighteenth-century sodomite, another sinister
               figure variously imagined to be recognisable from his posture, speech and clothing,
               or alternatively concealed by outward shows of the ordinary. Sodomites did not always
               conform to the popular stereotype, lamented the pamphleteer Emanuel Collins in 1756;
               on the contrary, their insidious posturing as something they were not made them doubly
               dangerous. They “fly generally to large cities to hide themselves in the multitude,
               and seek security in the crowd . . . . Undaunted and upright they crowd our publick
               walks, unaw’d by guilt, and unappal’d by the fears of any impeachment” (1, 7). Like
               Jacobins, they were masters of facade and pretence, “lurking,” as one newspaper put
               it in an attempt to forewarn its readers, “under the different characters and disguises
               of a solicitor, a gentleman of an estate, a steward to a nobleman, a cook, a tapster,
               and other shapes” (<em>Newcastle Courant</em> 24 Sept. 1737). </p>

            <p>The contrast between Cruikshank and Gillray’s practice at this time was further demonstrated
               in the latter’s complex and highly finished <em>Promis’d Horrors of the French Invasion – or – Forcible reasons for Negotiating a
                  Regicide Peace</em> (1796). In this print, Gillray’s captivation by Thelwall’s energy and his ambivalence
               towards him is clear once again. Small in body but active and highly spirited, a recognisably
               sharp-featured Thelwall takes the Great Bedfordshire Ox (his opposition ally, the
               Duke of Bedford) by the tail and, with a well-aimed kick and a wave from a rolled
               copy of his lectures, encourages him to up-end a flailing Edmund Burke at the doorway
               of Brookes’s club in St James. Like Cruikshank, Gillray uses Thelwall more as an abettor
               and instigator than a direct agent, but he is possessed by a comic <em>joie de vivre</em> that scarcely suggests the “promis’d horrors” of the design. The loyalist message
               of the print is compromised in any case by Gillray’s insistence on using dice, playing
               cards and an EO table in White’s Club to cloud our sympathies for the misfortunes
               of a dissolute Royal Family (the Prince of Wales and the Dukes of Clarence and York).

            <p>Gillray was not uninterested in the Corresponding Society’s relationship with the
               seceding Foxites, but unlike Cruikshank, he used the unlikely coalition as a vehicle
               for light comedy, doomed to failure, and ultimately the cause of Thelwall’s undoing.
               He is never a threatening figure in Gillray’s work; rather, he is transformed from
               a fountain of energy in 1795-96, to the representation of Jacobin defeat by the beginning
               of 1797. In<em>The End of the Irish Invasion</em> (1797), a comment on the dispersal of Hoche’s invasion fleet off the coast of Ireland
               in 1796, French complicity with the Foxite/Jacobin coalition founders in storm-tossed
               seas and Thelwall is figuratively shipwrecked alongside Erskine and the Whig secceders.
               With his lectures in his pocket, and a pack of playing cards bobbing on the water
               behind him, Thelwall’s political “gamble” has failed and he is, quite literally, out
               of luck and out of his depth. A few days later in another Gillray satire, <em>The Tree of Liberty must be Planted Immediately </em>(1797), </p>

            <p>Thelwall is once again a victim of hubris. Having failed to learn the lessons of his
               own lectures on classical history, his severed head lies slightly to the side of those
               of the Whigs, meaningfully separated from them by the executioner’s axe and resting
               upon a signifier of his own folly, a notice announcing “lectures upon the fall of
               the republic.” It is true that Gillray featured a revitalised Thelwall the following
               year in <em>The New Morality</em> (1798), </p>

            <p>but this was a directed commission for the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> magazine and prompted as much by a specific reference in Canning’s accompanying verse
               as any decision of his own. The revitalisation is in any case compromised once again
               by defeat, robbing Thelwall of power and influence despite his deportment. As assorted
               English Jacobins pay homage to Larevelliere Lepaux—the “High Priest,” as Canning put
               it, of the French cult of “Theophilanthropy”—Thelwall, portrayed as a railing imp
               on Bedford’s Leviathan shoulders, has become more feeble-bodied than before. In severely
               mud-spattered clothing, Thelwall is clearly no longer the “voice of thousands” and
               there is now an absurdity to his animation. The mud is an allusion to Thelwall’s hostile
               reception from loyalist mobs during recent provincial lecturing engagements at Derby,
               Norwich, Stockport and Ashby de la Zouch, and referred to in Canning’s verse: “Thelwall
               and ye that lecture as ye go, / And for your pains get pelted, praise Le Paux . .
               . .” By the time of this print’s appearance, Thelwall had in any case ceased to pose
               any significant threat because he had publicly announced his retirement to Llyswen,
               Wales, at the end of 1797. </p>

            <p>The <em>Anti-Jacobin’s</em> prime target in 1798-99 was not the individual influence of the charismatic lecturer
               in any case, but Opposition newspapers and essayists. Apart from the usual Whig suspects,
               Thelwall’s companions in the <em>New Morality’s</em> procession of villains include Godwin, Coleridge, Southey, Holcroft, and Priestley
               besides representations of the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, the <em>Courier</em>, the <em>Star</em> and the <em>Morning Post</em>. In <em>A Charm for a Democracy</em> (1799), produced by Thomas Rowlandson for the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em>, another motley procession of radicals presides over a seditious cauldron heated
               by a bonfire of Jacobin texts, including Thelwall’s <em>Rights of Nature</em>, to a fare blown by a newsboy from the <em>Courier</em>. But this is a print that celebrates radical defeat; it is anything but alarmist.
               Thelwall stands in line, prematurely aged, his lectures tucked under one arm but effectively
               silenced. “I’m off to Monmouthshire,” he says. In loyalist discourse, the withdrawal
               of voice left Thelwall an empty windbag, his vitality extinguished, his lectures ineffective
               when committed to print. <em>The Anti-Jacobin</em> was in buoyant mood: </p>

               <p>As Llyswen recluse and then professional elocutionist over the subsequent twenty years,
                  Thelwall received little attention from satirists. When he did, it was only to suggest
                  confluence between respectable cover and Jacobin intent, and only because the next
                  generation of Whigs after Fox’s death were finding it no easier to exert lasting political
                  influence. In <em>The School of Eloquence and Grace</em> (1808), a complex engraving for the <em>Satirist</em>, a large party of washed up Whig parliamentarians, defeated in the election of 1807,
                  have booked themselves into Thelwall’s Bedford Square Institute to have their inarticulacy
                  and other ineptitudes examined. Thelwall opened the Institute in 1806 to “pupils who
                  have impediments of utterance, of whatever description . . . who may either labour
                  under the like imperfections or be desirous of improvement in the accomplishments
                  of reading and recitation, conversational fluency, public oratory, and the principles
                  of criticism and composition,” and in a later prospectus he made specific overtures
                  to parliamentarians who, “may depend upon every attention that can be instrumental
                  either to the improvement of their oratorical powers or the direction of their studies”
                  (qtd. in Duchan 139).

                  </div> Given an Opposition that still included erstwhile political colleagues of Thelwall’s
                  like Erskine, Burdett, and Horne Tooke (all of whom appear in the print), the <em>Satirist’s </em>suggestion that a little Thelwallian eloquence and grace wouldn’t go amiss was sharply
                  observed. Grenville’s political failings, it is suggested here, were compounded by
                  his lack of figure as much as his defective oratory, and it is as appropriate to Thelwall’s
                  holistic theories of vitality that Grenville must submit to having extraneous flesh
                  carved from his buttocks to improve his balance, as it is for Lord Henry Petty to
                  be taught how to stand for dancing by Thelwall’s wife. The failure of men like these
                  to carry political argument is signified most clearly by the ungainly oratorical attitude
                  of Thelwall’s old adversary, William Windham, so unsuccessful in his attempts to shame
                  ministers over the British bombardment of Copenhagen that a bust of Demosthenes falls
                  from the wall behind him.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Thelwall’s failure to recapture the political limelight when he re-emerged into public
               life at the end of the Napoleonic Wars can be measured by the indifference of the
               early nineteenth century caricature trade after the death of both Isaac Cruikshank
               and Gillray. Thelwall came out of retirement to lend support to the moderate reformer
               John Cam Hobhouse at Westminster during the election of 1818 and spoke on a number
               of platforms as a “veteran” reformer. As the newly appointed editor of <em>The Champion</em> newspaper, he appeared occasionally in satirical prints as a wizened and ineffectual
               figure in the radical crowd, in stark contravention of suggestions in sympathetic
               journals like the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> that his return to the political stage was “characterised by his usual eloquence
               and energy” (48 [1819]: 566). George Cruikshank included him in two caricatures during
               these years, <em>The Funeral Procession of the Rump</em> (1819), and <em>Coriolanus Addressing the Plebeians</em> (1820), in the first of which his sorry figure traipses along in the wake of Hobhouse’s
               election defeat, expressing itself “ashamed of [his] company,” who include not only
               Burdett but some unidentified “acquitted felons.” In the second, he lines up with
               the radical crowd’s more moderate wing (the elderly Cartwright, Hobhouse and Hone),
               and looks more inconsequential than ever. Thelwall’s marginalised position in the
               radical canon reached new heights, however, in what was probably the last caricature
               ever to feature him, <em>The Reign of Humbug</em> (1825). </p>

               <p>Uniquely, this was no loyalist print, but one composed as a frontispiece by Thomas
                  Howell Jones for the radical republican William Benbow’s short-lived satirical journal, <em>The Town</em>. The very prominent Thelwall, posturing once again as a gentleman elocutionist, takes
                  his place amongst a pantheon of public figures regarded by Benbow as modern irritants,
                  time-wasters and imposters. Having taken fright and abandoned the <em>Champion</em> when the fiercely loyalist Constitutional Association threatened to prosecute him
                  for seditious libel in 1820, and having at the same time loosened his political ties
                  even with moderate men like Hobhouse, Thelwall was dismissed more readily than ever
                  before by popular and less “respectable” stalwarts. In Howell Jones’s print, Thelwall
                  has only his continuing association with the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> to (literally) support his compromised political apostasy, and finds himself surrounded
                  by every kind of frivolous financial speculator, corrupt politician, disingenuous
                  bishop and confidence trickster (including Brougham and Burdett) in Benbow’s firing
                  line. In fact, he occupies a central position in a “humbug” world characterised in
                  Benbow’s prospectus by “every species of imposture, dupery and quackery” and whose
                  inhabitants “shall stand exposed in their native deformity.”

                           (9)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See advertisement in Morning Post 31 May 1825. I have not been able to trace a copy
                           of the journal but the print survives in the British Museum’s collection.</span></div>
                  </div> The wider public, to whom Thelwall had once directed his political energies, are shown
                  facing away from his misdirected oratorical flourish to become dupes of the revived
                  campaign against Catholic emancipation instead of making demands for reform. Thelwall’s
                  irrelevant cry from atop his barrel, “My lectures on elocution . . . ,” goes, literally,
                  over everyone’s head.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We may conclude then not only that Thelwall’s caricatured persona stayed consistently
               true to his actual physiognomy over a thirty year period (which is interesting in
               itself), but that, during the early years when it most mattered, both Gillray and
               Isaac Cruikshank—albeit in different ways—were far too interested in the apparent
               contradictions in their subject’s persona to reduce him unproblematically to an ugly
               Jacobin signifier like Paine. Thelwall emerges instead as a complex caricature, either
               a man whose slight frame, masked expression and quiet adaptability negate the strength
               of his oratory and reveal a political chameleon who is not, perhaps, the one-dimensional
               firebrand of popular construction, or alternatively a man whose credentials as a firebrand
               are unquestionable but whose darker motives and seditious character are far from clear.
               These ambiguities were only reconciled by Thelwall’s running to ground in 1797-98,
               due largely to the concerted efforts of the legislature, the connivance of the judiciary
               and the brute force of loyalist mobs. More than a decade ago, E. P. Thompson persuasively
               traced the multi-layered silencing of the “Jacobin Fox” in these terms, and it has
               been suggested here that both James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank’s satires offer a
               visual commentary on the process by which this was achieved as well as the language
               in which it was expressed. However, the success of Pitt’s ministry in engineering
               the silence and defeat of Thelwall in 1798 has yet to be measured as a factor in his
               relatively unconvincing return to politics in 1818-20. The re-embodiment of the most
               feared democratic orator of the 1790s as the patron saint of lost causes, diluted
               principles and political humbug began in visual satire with Gillray in 1797. For all
               of Gillray’s oft-cited political ambivalence, his deflated Thelwall was perhaps of
               greater service to loyalist discourse than was Cruikshank’s alarmism, an approach
               to the problem that defied any obvious solution and which tended not only to question
               the effectiveness of the Gagging Acts but to suggest they had actually prompted clandestine
               plotting. Thelwall’s portrayal in print satire as the embodiment of radical defeat
               remained current for almost two more decades and did nothing to ease his assimilation
               back into the reform pantheon. Despite the re-energised mass platform movement for
               the popular franchise in the period between the close of the French wars and the passing
               of the Great Reform Act, Thelwall had come to stand for the failure of Jacobin aspiration.
               Alienated from former allies in the LCS like John Gale Jones and Alexander Galloway,
               who both threw in their lot with the new leaders of the reform movement—Cobbett, Hunt
               and even some of the Spenceans—Thelwall took his place alongside middle-class advocates
               for a limited extension of the suffrage and remained easy prey to charges of apostasy.
               For loyalist and radical illustrators alike, Thelwall’s reappearance in the early
               nineteenth century was marked by the forging of political alliances, as hopeless as
               they were disingenuous, and in the adoption of uncontroversial “professional” channels
               for the dissipated expression of what had once seemed a most terrible and dangerous
               energy. </p>

               to a series of observations about the inadequacies of his own physiognomy (Letter
               to Thelwall). Of Jeffrey, whose critical reviews of the <em>Poems</em> of 1801 hugely irritated Thelwall, he wrote, “To all the advantage to be derived
               from the shortness of his chin, Mr Jeffrey is most certainly entitled, and it may
               perhaps be of some importance to those whose <em>forwardness</em> is more conspicuous than their <em>understanding</em>, that their <em>chins</em> as well as their <em>noses</em>, should not be over prominent” (<em>Reply</em> 163).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

Thelwall shared Tooke’s philological interest in creating a devolved
               non-elite language of politics and, like Tooke, was frequently taken to task by the
               loyalist press for dangerously addressing plebeian audiences in non-elite language.
               On this subject, see Jenks. For Thelwall’s relationship with Tooke, see Mrs. Thelwall
               343-44. William Windham was notorious for referring to Thelwall and his fellow treason
