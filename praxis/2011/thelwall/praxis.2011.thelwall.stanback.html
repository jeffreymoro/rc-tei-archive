               <p>Recent scholarship has demonstrated the rich possibilities of Romantic science and
                  the political, philosophical, and social significance of its diverse lines of inquiry.
                  In the early 1790s John Thelwall participated in the ideologically charged conversations
                  of science, medicine, and materialism while attending lectures at St. Thomas’s and
                  Guy’s hospitals and as a member of the Physical Society.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Notably, Thelwall lent his voice to the debate surrounding the vital principle, which
                           was often cast as a conflict between traditional values and the radical, Jacobin ideals
                           represented by materialism. Nicholas Roe convincingly ventures that Thelwall’s materialist
                           An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality (1793), as well as an essay on sensation,
                           may have been key contributing factors to his 1794 treason charge (188).</span></div>
                  </div> After his 1794 treason trial and the government repression that followed, Thelwall
                  turned to elocutionary science, “the <em>New Profession</em>, to which I have devoted my maturer years” (<em>Cline</em> 2). This “<em>New Profession</em>” has been understood as ideologically neutral in comparison to Thelwall’s earlier
                  involvement in radical politics and materialist science—yet the political and humanistic
                  implications of his elocutionary project are significant, and reveal an enduring dedication
                  to democratic ideals.

                           some sense of political continuity across Thelwall’s diverse career. For Scrivener,
                           however, Thelwall’s elocutionary writings “are largely apolitical—or political in
                           an allegorical way” (285); similarly, for McCann, “As an elocutionist . . . Thelwall
                           had cast off politics” (223). It was a sense that Thelwall himself certainly strove
                           to cultivate, and in A Letter to Henry Cline he distances himself from “the excentric
                           fire of youth,” which had interrupted his early study of science and medicine and
                           “hurried me …</span></div>
                  </div> Thelwall came into professional contact with “idiots,” “mutes,” and “stutterers” at
                  a key moment in the development of modern medicine and modern attitudes towards “disability,”
                  and in these contexts we may more fully appreciate the importance of his therapeutic
                  endeavor.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In keeping with contemporary disability theory, I use the term “disability” to invoke
                           the complex social position of those with medicalized biological differences—as opposed
                           to the biological differences, or “impairments,” themselves. As Susan Wendell has
                           argued, “the biological and the social are interactive in creating disability” insofar
                           as “the social response to and treatment of biological difference . . . determin[es]
                           both the nature and the severity of disability” (35, 42).</span></div>
                  </div> Ultimately, Thelwall’s approach to his practice and his patients may be understood
                  as deeply—and provocatively—egalitarian, and his major elocutionary texts—<em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em> (1810), <em>The Vestibule of Eloquence</em> (1810), and <em>Results of Experience in the Treatment of Cases of Defective Utterance</em> (1814)—may be read as actively resisting the normative views of disability that were
                  beginning to consolidate during the era.</p>

                  <p>As Roy Porter and other medical historians have detailed, the practice of medicine
                     became increasingly effective, standardized, regulated, and scientific over the course
                     of the nineteenth century.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              and outlined a required course of academic and clinical training. Diagnostic criteria
                              and practices would become ever more standardized, in large part because of increased
                              anatomical, laboratorial, and clinical expertise, and in large part because of technological
                              innovations including René Laennec’s 1816 invention of the stethoscope.</span></div>
                     </div> During the eighteenth century, however, and extending into Thelwall’s time practicing
                     elocutionary science, there was little regularity to medicine, and doctors had relatively
                     little to offer in the way of effective treatments for most illnesses and impairments.
                     Quack doctors and alternative healers—folk, religious, magical—flourished alongside
                     those striving for institutional authority, regulation, and professionalization. The
                     diversity of Romantic medicine particularly calls to mind Porter’s phrase “histories
                     of the medicines,” appropriate because “there has never been a single, homogenous
                     body of theory and practice answering to the name ‘medicine’” (<em>Popularization </em>1).

                              “Origins.”</span></div>
                     </div> Because of the openness of the age, Thelwall was in a position to carve out his own
                     distinct place in the medical landscape, and he situates his elocutionary project
                     in a careful—but often uneasy—relationship with his diverse medical contemporaries.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Determined to establish the legitimacy of “the Science of Curing Impediments” and
                     to appeal to his professional peers (<em>Results</em> 74), Thelwall addresses two lengthy elocutionary texts to a medical professor (Henry
                     Cline), describes his early exposure to medical education, and admits that he is “desirous
                     of calling the attention of the professional and scientific world” to the “researches
                     and experimental exertions of ten successive years” (<em>Cline</em> 1, 5). Thelwall asserts, however, that the treatment of speech impediments “is not,
                     and, it is obvious, cannot be, the province of the surgeon or the physician” (<em>Cline </em>60). He also criticizes dental prosthetics and oral surgery for causing greater “difficulties”
                     and “mischiefs” than impairments themselves do, and for even causing “serious accidents”
                     and “irreparable injury” in some cases (<em>Results</em> 4-5, <em>Cline</em> 50-51). Such critiques may be partly accounted for by the economic realities of eighteenth-
                     and nineteenth-century medicine. Mary E. Fissell describes the “profusion of health-care
                     providers eager for [each patient’s] custom” (37), which would have put acute pressure
                     on Thelwall to actively market his product, just as his competitors did.

                              made out of medicine, the opportunity was seized,” and Thelwall’s professional success
                              testifies to the “genuine alternatives” presented to patients by the diversity of
                              early nineteenth-century medical practitioners (24, 26). For a detailed account of

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thelwall’s textual positioning is no less vexed in relation to those medical contemporaries
                     whose practices reflected the ideals of democracy and dissent. By conspicuously withholding
                     details of his therapeutic methods from otherwise comprehensive elocutionary texts—“the
                     key to his system is missing” (Rockey, “Origins” 156)—Thelwall distinguishes them
                     from self-help manuals, a primary medium for the dissemination of medical information
                     in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Popular and influential publications
                     including John Wesley’s <em>Primitive Physick</em> and William Buchan’s <em>Domestic Medicine</em> promised to allow patients to become their own physicians. <em>Primitive Physick</em>, for example, “set down cheap, and safe, and easy Medicines; easy to be known, easy
                     to be procured, and easy to be applied by plain, unlettered men,” in contrast to expensive
                     and esoteric medical texts. Wesley’s manual provides simple remedies for conditions
                     ranging from breast cancer (“Use the <em>Cold Bath</em>”) to vertigo (“Take a <em>Vomit</em> or two”) (xxiv, xiv, 40, 110).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Multiple editions were published of Wesley’s and Buchan’s texts—originally of 1747
                              and 1769, respectively—and new editions of the latter were available well into the
                              nineteenth century. Ginny Smith notes that “[f]or a large number of people [medical
                              self-help manuals] could well have been a far more familiar source of information
                              than the personal advice of the trained physician” (250). Thelwall’s French contemporaries
                              are also worth noting here as their careers were shaped by the democratic ideals of
                              the Revolution. British medicine as a whole imported—and many would say benefited

                     opposed to the transparency Wesley endorsed. Thelwall remarks of <em>The Vestibule of Eloquence</em> that its price and limited print run may restrict its circulation, but “it is the
                     wish of the professor that every thing relating to the exercises of his pupils should
                     be open to public inspection” (iv). Indeed, Denyse Rockey speculates that practical
                     concerns—first a lack of time and later a lack of money—may partly account for the
                     gaps in Thelwall’s elocutionary texts (“Origins” 174). They may also be partly explained
                     by proprietary concerns in the competitive medical market—or perhaps, like Thomas
                     Beddoes, Thelwall feared the misapplication of medical treatments.

                              might encourage independence of judgment, breeding that ‘health protestantism’ which

                     to the philosophy underlying his practice, which is more clearly aligned with populist
                     medicine like Wesley’s. In striking contrast to doctors who use diagnosis, prognosis,
                     and therapy to “establish, exercise, and perpetuate their power” (Couser 19), Thelwall
                     demonstrates his devotion to transparency and communication, as well as his resistance
                     to pathologizing his “pupils.” He asserts, <span class="quote">‘Impress the perceptive faculty, clearly and strongly; demonstrate, step by step, your
                        theory to the understanding; and interest, at the same time, the imagination; leave

                        or that, from the nature and structure of his frame and faculties, is capable of illustration;
                        give him a system on which he can see and feel that he may depend . . . . (<em>Cline </em>58-59)’</span> Thelwall’s commitment to meaningful discourse is similarly evident in his reflection
                     that “the successful practitioner must have looked with scrutinizing eye into the
                     motions of the heart, and of the understanding” (<em>Results</em> 74).

                     William Buchan, who claims, “It is always in the power of the patient, or of those
                     about him, to do as much towards his recovery as can be effected by the physician”
                     (x). According to Thelwall, “it is desirable that the elocutionary tutor should have
                     the entire direction and superintendance of the pupil—even to the extent of absolute
                     domestication” (<em>Results </em>10)—yet much depends on “the susceptibility, diligence, previous attainments, and
                     dispositions of the Pupil” (<em>Vestibule </em>7), and “where determined effort and enthusiastic diligence are not wanting, the blemishes
                     of physical nature effectively disappear” (<em>Cline</em> 33). Tellingly, Thelwall remarks that “mental and moral causes step in to the explanation”
                     of what he calls his most successful elocutionary case: “I have never met with so
                     devoted an attention, and so entire a confidence” (<em>Cline</em> 64).

                              the authority of the physician and “describes the role of the patient as preventing

               <p>By courting and simultaneously challenging his medical contemporaries, Thelwall defended
                  his principles and economic concerns, participated in medical discourse, and framed
                  his elocutionary techniques as safe, effective, professional, and rigorously scientific
                  alternative therapies. In illuminating his therapeutic philosophy, Thelwall made his
                  democratic tendencies clear; like his populist contemporaries, Thelwall pursued partnership
                  rather than absolute authority, and clarity of communication rather than esoteric
                  discourse. We may then say of Thelwall what George C. Grinnell says of Thomas Beddoes:
                  he “model[s] . . . a reorganization of medical practice in Georgian England” (224).
                  The consequence of Thelwall’s distinct therapeutic approach is in the intersection
                  of democracy and disability.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Lispers, Stutterers, Stammerers, and the Blind: Citizens, Patients</span></h2>
               <p>In nineteenth-century medicine, an increase in institutional authority, professionalization,
                  and standardized practices led to ever more ideologically consistent approaches to
                  disability. If eighteenth-century medicine largely depended on relative and individualized
                  notions of health and illness, “medical men” of the following century “were developing
                  a language (which we still use) for situating all people in relation to each other,
                  for measuring their deviation from the <em>normal</em>, and, increasingly, for managing their deviations from that norm” (Lawrence 45).
                  As Lennard J. Davis has demonstrated, the concept of the “norm” became a fully realized
                  and socially defining construct in the 1840s and 1850s, after which those with various
                  impairments were increasingly seen as abnormal “deviants,” and biological differences
                  were increasingly regarded as indelible identity markers.</p>
               <p>Paul Youngquist has shown, however, that “by the late eighteenth century medical science
                  was consolidating its authority over deviant flesh,” and “[t]he last decades of the
                  eighteenth century witness the installation of this turn from contingency to norm”
                  (9, xxv). The forces of normativity were therefore ones that Thelwall would have confronted
                  as an elocutionary scientist, and in several important ways Thelwall stands in conflict
                  with contemporary trends. His early life helps to explain his direction: Thelwall
                  was a lisper “from the imperfection and irregular position of my teeth,” and he benefited
                  from the techniques he promoted as a speech therapist (<em>Cline </em>19); he also experienced voicelessness of a different kind as the subject of violent
                  government repression. Having experienced impairment and the inability to communicate
                  freely, Thelwall broke with many of his peers by developing an inclusive therapeutic
                  approach that addresses the social and functional consequences of “disability” while
                  humanizing the disabled.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thelwall demonstrates a particular interest in those whose marginalized status was
                     largely due to their misunderstood speech impediments; for Thelwall these cases were
                     treatable, although they were “universally” thought to be beyond “remedy” or “relief”
                     (<em>Results </em>2, 28). Thelwall “reject[s], altogether, as far as the organization of the mouth is
                     concerned, all distinction of curable and incurable impediments” (<em>Cline </em>145), emphasizing and illustrating that what may appear to be biological and inherent—and
                     thus untreatable—may be at least partly accounted for by conditional factors such
                     as education, the influence of family members, fear, habit, and trauma. He asserts
                     that speech impediments are, “Most assuredly . . . with very few exceptions,” “complicated
                     with Moral and Intellectual causes” (<em>Cline </em>61); “Impediments are, in a great degree, contagious” (<em>Vestibule</em> 9); and “very many” cases are “purely mental and moral” (<em>Cline </em>61). The word “apparent” appears frequently throughout his elocutionary texts—e.g.
                     “<em>apparent </em>deficiencies of mind,” “<em>apparently</em> defective faculties,” “apparent ineptitude”—signaling both the diagnostic failure
                     of his medical contemporaries and his pupils’ unrecognized potential (<em>Cline</em> 44, 5, 59). Accordingly, Thelwall’s prognosis for nearly all speech impediments is
                     uniform, regardless of context and cause: “a correct and impressive elocution is attainable
                     by all” (<em>Vestibule</em> 8).

                     Although it may be professionally and economically understandable, Thelwall’s emphasis
                     on treatment is potentially problematical. Disability scholars suggest that the imperative

                  <p>The framing of Thelwall’s elocutionary project, however, establishes his professional
                     services and techniques as ones that do not promote normative assumptions or adhere
                     to standard social hierarchies. “[N]ormative notions of health produce a healthy bourgeois
                     subject primarily by forcefully producing others as infirm” (Grinnell 225); in contrast,
                     Thelwall’s elocutionary principles are not only therapies for the impaired, but techniques
                     for improving the speech of the able-bodied. They may “loose the tongue of the stammerer,
                     and enable the literary student to command, and the critic to comprehend, with certainty,
                     the genuine sources of grace and mellifluence” (<em>Cline </em>4). Here Thelwall not only resists pathologizing and marginalizing his impaired patients,
                     but goes so far as to suggest that their difference from the respected—and presumably
                     able-bodied—student and critic is a matter of degree, not kind. Likewise, by treating
                     politicians and clergymen alongside the congenitally impaired, Thelwall relieves the
                     stigma that often accompanies medical treatment, creating in his London institution
                     an alternate medico-educational system—one might even say an alternate microcosmic
                     democracy—in which the disabled and able-bodied are part of a common project of self-improvement.

                     differences are separate from—and often less disabling than—the social responses to
                     those differences (e.g. indulgent parents, inadequate education, personal fears).
                     Thelwall resists surgery and dental prosthetics, mainstream medical techniques that

                     in society by attaining “[g]eneral intelligibility” (<em>Results</em> 15). By insisting that physical differences need not lead to speechlessness, and that
                     impairments need not amount to permanent social exclusion, Thelwall challenged the

                     describing the capacities and impact of two blind men: John Milton and John Gough.
                     Of course, it was not unusual to view blindness ambivalently, or even positively,
                     in Thelwall’s time. William R. Paulson argues that “The romantics rediscover, or at
                     least revive, the ancient topos of the blind poet or seer, a visionary whose sight,
                     having lost this world’s presence, is directed entirely beyond to the spiritual” (14).
                     Ossian, Milton, and Homer are obvious templates for the trope, and Edward Larissy
                     underscores the sense of nostalgia and “inward vision” common to Romantic depictions
                     of blindness (1).<sup> </sup><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">

                     and Thelwall’s praise, unlike others’, is based on the impact of sensory compensation
                     on the poet’s literary technique: “is it not unlikely that [Milton’s] blindness .
                     . . might have given an increased portion of that strength, that natural and copious
                     melody, and that variety, to the rhythms and numbers of his divine poem” (<em>Cline </em>8).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Thelwall also describes the blindness of John Gough, whom he had met years before
                  in Kendal. Gough was a scientist, not a poet—a researcher depending on empirical principles,
                  not visionary powers—and Thelwall focuses on Gough’s profession and his everyday life:
                  <span class="quote">‘Cut off, in his earliest infancy, from all intercourse with the world of knowledge
                     and observation, through the customary inlet, the organ of sight, Mr. Gough has been
                     induced . . . to cultivate, with extreme diligence, the supplementary faculties of
                     hearing and of touch. The acute perfection to which the latter of these has been improved
                     and expanded, has been sufficiently demonstrated by the extent to which he has carried
                     his practical researches into the minutiae of the science of botany; and the exquisiteness
                     of his perceptions in the other kind—the promptitude with which he discovers the stature
                     of the merest stranger by the first resoundings of his voice (of which I have myself
                     been witness), and the facility with which he recognizes the presence, and discriminates
                     the identity of his acquaintance, by merely listening to their respective breathings,
                     equally illustrate the unprecedented degree of improvement to which he has expanded
                     his hearing faculties: so that Mr. Gough is, in reality, one of those <em>demonstrative instances</em> of the omnipotency of mental energy . . . . (<em>Cline</em> 32-33)’</span> Here Gough becomes a figure of Jacobin self-improvement, effort, and perseverance.
                  It seems, too, that Gough has succeeded not in spite of his blindness, but in some
                  measure because of it. Indeed, Thelwall treats Gough’s compensatory senses as singular—“unprecedented”—but
                  also with a kind of reverence, referring to “the exquisiteness of his perceptions
                  in the other kind.”</p>
               <p>Thelwall’s progressive attitude toward Milton’s and Gough’s blindness recalls Susan
                  Wendell’s assertion that disability may be seen as a “difference” with “intrinsic
                  value” and “sometimes extrinsic advantages” (67). Biological differences themselves
                  are not inherently negative characteristics for Thelwall. He critiques and seeks to
                  rectify the social conditions of “disability” and emphasizes natural compensation
                  rather than the elimination of physical variations—and thus stands in opposition to
                  those who cast impairments as permanent, and even socially dangerous, defects. Thelwall’s
                  elocutionary project promotes the vision of a democracy in which all individuals may
                  enjoy full citizenship and all may have access to, may participate in, and may contribute
                  to society—with adequate support and to the best of their diverse abilities.</p>

                  <p>Thelwall’s acceptance of biological difference is challenged when he turns his attention
                     to the cognitively impaired, whose place in society had long been marginal. From the
                     fourteenth century on, the “natural fool,” later called the “idiot,” was known as
                     an individual who permanently lacked any semblance of “reason.” This definition remained
                     surprisingly static, as did the list of things that could earn an individual the title
                     of “idiot,” first legally and later medically. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
                     idiots were typically cared for by their families and communities, and it was only
                     at the close of the eighteenth century that efforts to educate the cognitively impaired
                     gained popularity.

                  <p>Dominant cultural views about idiots largely determined their treatment. Without “reason,”
                     the idiot was without what John Locke defined as “That Faculty, whereby Man is supposed
                     to be distinguished from Beasts, and wherein it is evident he much surpasses them”
                     (434), providing an Enlightenment rationale for the common belief that the idiot was
                     more akin to animals than to man. Closer to Thelwall’s time, Adam Smith theorized
                     that the rational subject cannot sympathize with the unreasoning man, “the poor wretch
                     . . . who laughs and sings . . . and is altogether insensible of his own misery” (15).

                              Although Smith registers particular horror at the idea of losing one’s reason, his
                              discussion of sympathy here hinges on the state of unreason itself and its social

                     </div> In “The Idiot” (1798), Robert Southey adopted the phrase “poor wretch” to describe
                     Ned, the poem’s title character, whose macabre actions and lack of understanding cannot
                     but alienate the reader: unable to comprehend death, he unearths his mother’s corpse
                     and brings it home. Yet Ned’s abiding love for his mother preserves for him some place
                     in the human community, and the poem consequently evinces a deep ambivalence towards
                     the idiot that was typical of the time.</p>

                              Mary Jacobus has convincingly argued that he had the means and motive to write his
                              poem as a corrective response to the more progressive—and thus unusual—“The Idiot
                              Boy” by William Wordsworth.</span></div>
                     </div> Although he accepted some idiots into treatment at his Institute, he notes that “Extreme
                     cases . . . for obvious reasons, cannot be admitted under my roof,” adding that “the
                     admission of disgusting objects” would detract from his own personal and professional
                     experience (<em>Results </em>35). Nonetheless, Thelwall maintains his goal of identifying patients whose impairments
                     are not beyond amelioration. In <em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em> Thelwall seeks to conceptualize and describe “moral” as opposed to “physical” idiocy,
                     in part by reprinting his correspondences with the blind scientist John Gough, who,
                     like Thelwall, was in an ideal position to understand the consequences of “disability”
                     and critique normative ideologies. Both men emphasize the intellectual potential of
                     moral idiots; as Thelwall explains, “there is a power in educational folly and mistake,
                     to distemper the brain, that might have been tranquillized to consistency” (71). Gough
                     asks of the Selborne idiot and his obsessive interest in bees, “Was there not a time,
                     when the activity and ingenuity of this young idiot might have been diverted to nobler
                     designs?” (111). Thelwall’s descriptions of his educable idiots are supplemented by
                     descriptions of his sophisticated approach to specialized instruction, which requires
                     “modes of regulation, of stimulus, and restriction” carried out “by private superintendence
                     and direction of the education of the party” (146-147). Thelwall and Gough were certainly
                     not alone in their belief in the potential of idiots, nor in their argument that some
                     cases of apparent idiocy were due to improper education or insufficient socialization.
                     Although not a proponent of education for all idiots, Jean Itard gained fame by insisting
                     that circumstance was the cause of imbecility for Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron,
                     and that he was therefore educable.

                              of his approach in the public—and medical—eye. There is the strong suggestion that
                              Itard’s goal with Victor was largely intellectual, and his therapeutic approach implies
                              a desire to verify his philosophical beliefs about human development. This may help
                              to explain why Thelwall criticized his educational techniques (Rockey, “Origins” 164).

                  of “moral idiots” hardly suggest improvability. Gough writes of the “moral idiot”
                  that “all his views [are] confined to his own person,” and illustrates “this worst
                  of human evils” by recalling the case of the Selborne idiot, whose sole, solitary
                  interest was in “hunting bees and wasps; which he caught with surprising address,
                  disarmed them with his naked hands, and sucked their bodies” (<em>Cline</em> 122, 110-11). He also describes M. Barker, a “female idiot” from Kendal who would
                  “cram” her “favourite food,” oat bread, into her mouth so eagerly that it often had
                  to be removed “by force, to prevent suffocation” (<em>Cline</em> 119). Thelwall introduces the anti-social “unfortunate Augusta,” detailing “the calamities
                  of this unhappy child” as she climbs over furniture and sits on the ground, swaying
                  her head and “hum[ming], in a low and plaintive tone” in a “monotony of . . . action
                  and . . . tone” that puzzles Thelwall (<em>Cline </em>93-94).</p>

                     and families, we may better understand the difficulties and frustrations that likely
                     led Thelwall to remark that “no species of imbecility appears to us so hopeless as
                     that which is complicated with vicious habits, and the absence of social sympathy”
                     (<em>Results</em> 47).</p>

                     determination to educate moral idiots and their faith in human improvement—even in
                     the least hopeful of cases, which they depict in the starkest of terms. Gough, for
                     example, describes a mute moral idiot who “had been reduced by injudicious tenderness,
                     to the state of a parasitical being” (<em>Cline </em>112-113); his emphasis, however, is on his sense that early intervention could have
                     altered the course of the man’s life. And Thelwall, while admitting that he is “exceedingly
                     doubtful” that Augusta, “this poor child,” will ever be capable of “intelligible speech,”
                     nevertheless asserts that there is some small hope to be had in the “persevering assiduity
                     of an intelligent superintendant” (<em>Cline</em> 94, 96). There is even perceptible hope and determination when Thelwall introduces
                     two extreme cases of moral idiocy: “In one, those faculties, tho not actually extinct,
                     were an inert and unvivified mass, that required the Promethean torch; in the other,
                     they seemed to exist only in scattered particles; or, at best only in fragments, or
                     disjointed parts, that needed the articulation of connective ligament” (<em>Results</em> 64).

                              also anticipated Leo Kanner’s unfortunate misunderstanding about the etiology of autism.
                              Though Gough leaves open the possibility of natural antisocial inclinations, he also
                              remarks on the “mischief” that “may be done to the faculties by an improper education”
                              (Cline 110), and Thelwall more emphatically connects moral idiocy to educational failures,
                              insisting “the parents are sometimes the disease” (Results 56). Kanner similarly “stress[ed]

               <p>In his project to “rescue . . . my unhappy fellow beings from Idiocy,” Thelwall aspires,
                  “even in cases the most unfavourable,” to appeal to the “general necessities, arising
                  out of the mere animal appetites” which “may be made instrumental . . . to a considerable
                  degree” (<em>Cline </em>105, 124). Thus even the most organically impaired physical idiot or most withdrawn
                  moral idiot may learn to communicate his hunger or his pain more effectively, potentially
                  life-altering improvements, even if they do not guarantee full participation in public
                  discourse. Particularly in <em>Results of Experience</em>, moreover, Thelwall’s language is deeply humanizing, as when he comments that in
                  cases of idiocy, whenever “the moral and social sympathies . . . can be properly awakened,
                  there is always hope: for the heart is the best rectifier of the head; as, in certain
                  cases, the head is also of the heart” (<em>Results </em>59-60).</p>
               <p>The ideological significance of Thelwall’s and Gough’s view of idiocy becomes apparent
                  when considered in light of nineteenth-century developments in the care of idiots.
                  In keeping with Jean Itard’s principles, five voluntary institutions for the care,
                  education, and training of idiot children were created in Britain between the late
                  1840s and late 1860s. According to David Gladstone, these charitable institutions
                  “were established within a climate of optimistic expectations of improvement” (139),
                  though their admissions process—they considered only those young idiots who were thought
                  to be the most highly educable—suggests more modest optimism and determination than
                  Thelwall and Gough displayed. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the decades that followed, the normative views that Thelwall and Gough resisted
                     gave rise to increasingly exclusionary attitudes towards idiots—attitudes with widespread
                     social, medical, and political consequences. In the latter half of the nineteenth
                     century, individuals and eugenics groups began to advocate publicly for the permanent
                     institutional confinement of idiots, insisting on their unimprovability and even danger.
                     One such advocate, Mary Dendy, declared feeble-mindedness an “evil which will, if
                     unchecked, bring ruin upon our nation, and that before very long” (758). Such ideas
                     were discussed in mainstream medical journals including <em>The Lancet</em> and <em>The British Medical Journal</em>, and helped to secure the successful passage of the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913,
                     whereby state funding for facilities replaced charitable funding, institutional residence

                              survey of the broad impact of the 1913 Act, see Thomson, who indicates that there
                              are cases on record in which individuals attempted to help idiot family members escape

                     to stop them from breeding” (Porter, <em>Benefit</em> 507), and by the 1930s there were campaigns in Britain for the voluntary sterilization

               <h2><span class="head">“Disability” and Thelwall’s Democratic Legacy</span></h2>
               <p>Key aspects of twenty-first century medicine took shape in the decades after John
                  Thelwall’s death, and we are still all too familiar with the legacy left us by the
                  Victorian medical establishment. Disability theorists contend that we still live under
                  the assumption that impairments are always deficits, that the impaired are a drain
                  to society, and that a cure is always preferable to living with an impairment. In
                  this context the Romantics require another look for their diverse figurations of the
                  impaired body and impaired mind, and few matched Thelwall in his progressive treatment
                  of medicalized individuals. Thelwall articulates a humane and humanizing method of
                  interacting with his pupils, one that is characterized by a democratic sense of respect
                  and the pursuit of common goals. In seeking to identify cases in which improvement
                  is possible, Thelwall brought the impaired in from the margins—and along the way seems
                  to have anticipated what we now know of as autism. Finally, he recognizes the benefits
                  of certain impairments, prefiguring current approaches to disability as a potentially
                  valuable, enriching human variation. It is almost certain that Thelwall’s elocutionary
                  career was meant to keep him at a safe distance from politics. Yet in this, “the <em>New Profession</em>, to which [he] devoted [his] maturer years,” Thelwall lent his voice to an ideological
                  struggle, one that, like the political struggles of the 1790s, came to shape the treatment
                  of whole classes of Western society for the next two centuries.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Notably, Thelwall lent his voice to the debate surrounding the vital principle, which
               was often cast as a conflict between traditional values and the radical, Jacobin ideals
               represented by materialism. Nicholas Roe convincingly ventures that Thelwall’s materialist
               <em>An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</em> (1793), as well as an essay on sensation, may have been key contributing factors
               to his 1794 treason charge (188).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Michael Scrivener, Andrew McCann, Nicholas Roe, and J. R. Allard have all argued for
               some sense of political continuity across Thelwall’s diverse career. For Scrivener,
               however, Thelwall’s elocutionary writings “are largely apolitical—or political in
               an allegorical way” (285); similarly, for McCann, “As an elocutionist . . . Thelwall
               had cast off politics” (223). It was a sense that Thelwall himself certainly strove
               to cultivate, and in <em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em> he distances himself from “the excentric fire of youth,” which had interrupted his
               early study of science and medicine and “hurried me away to other topics” (2).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In keeping with contemporary disability theory, I use the term “disability” to invoke
               the complex social position of those with medicalized biological differences—as opposed
               to the biological differences, or “impairments,” themselves. As Susan Wendell has
               argued, “the biological and the social are interactive in creating disability” insofar
               as “the social response to and treatment of biological difference . . . determin[es]
               both the nature and the severity of disability” (35, 42).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">The 1815 Apothecaries Act, for example, required the certification of all apothecaries
               and outlined a required course of academic and clinical training. Diagnostic criteria
               and practices would become ever more standardized, in large part because of increased
               anatomical, laboratorial, and clinical expertise, and in large part because of technological
               innovations including René Laennec’s 1816 invention of the stethoscope.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For longer accounts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medicine, see Porter, <em>Benefit</em>, Lawrence, and Bynum. For an account of speech therapy at Thelwall’s time, see Rockey,
               “Origins.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Similarly, Dorothy and Roy Porter have demonstrated that “Wherever money was to be
               made out of medicine, the opportunity was seized,” and Thelwall’s professional success
               testifies to the “genuine alternatives” presented to patients by the diversity of
               early nineteenth-century medical practitioners (24, 26). For a detailed account of
               the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century medical market, see Digby.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Multiple editions were published of Wesley’s and Buchan’s texts—originally of 1747
               and 1769, respectively—and new editions of the latter were available well into the
               nineteenth century. Ginny Smith notes that “[f]or a large number of people [medical
               self-help manuals] could well have been a far more familiar source of information
               than the personal advice of the trained physician” (250). Thelwall’s French contemporaries
               are also worth noting here as their careers were shaped by the democratic ideals of
               the Revolution. British medicine as a whole imported—and many would say benefited
               from—the medical developments of Revolutionary and Imperial France. For more on Thelwall’s
               French contemporaries, see Weiner.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">It also bears mention that self-help manuals did not necessarily live up to their
               democratic goals: “they could reinforce the authority of the medical elite or they
               might encourage independence of judgment, breeding that ‘health protestantism’ which
               fired nineteenth-century alternative medicine” (Porter, <em>Benefit</em> 283).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">As G. Thomas Couser underscores, “discourse between patient and doctor occurs in a
               way that may be at odds with the root meaning of <em>communication</em>, the making common of information”—because of specialized discourse and because of

               underscores, there is a fundamental connection between the exclusion of the disabled
               from the public world and their lack of access to—and a lack of social and governmental
               recognition of—their political and human rights (40-41). This is one of many insights
               that leads Wendell to conclude that the devastating social consequences of “disability”
               may warrant an individual’s desire for a cure, even when the immutable realities of
               an impairment itself may not. It is on all of these grounds that I do not wholly agree
               with McCann’s contention that Thelwall’s gentlemen pupils and their professional ambitions
               suggest that “assimilation into the institutions of bourgeois public life was the
               goal . . . indicating an urge to bring students into the ambit of official political
               and cultural authority, rather than an attempt to subvert its institutions” (225).

               psychological profiles afforded by centuries-old documents. Nevertheless, having read
               <em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em>, Ingrid van Balkom, a specialist in autism spectrum disorders and community mental
               health professional in the Netherlands, came to her conclusions about the Selborne
               idiot, M. Barker, and Augusta based on a number of diagnostic criteria. Michaeline
               Bresnahan, a psychiatric epidemiologist at Columbia University, concurs. I am currently
               collaborating with van Balkom and Bresnahan on a manuscript that will detail the ways
               that Thelwall’s descriptions of “moral idiocy” anticipate twentieth century understandings
               of autism. It should be noted that Rockey, too, comments in passing that M. Barker
               may be autistic (“Logopaedic” 91), and that at the conference “The Art and the Act:
               John Thelwall in Practice” in October, 2009, Gordon Bottomley explored the possibility
               that Augusta may have been autistic. The 1938 descriptions of Hans Asperger also bear
               note here; they, along with Kanner’s descriptions, form the foundation of current

               Wing asserts of Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron—whom, crucially, Thelwall connects
               to Augusta—“There can be no doubt that [he] was autistic” (14), and another of Thelwall’s
               contemporaries, John Haslam, included a possible case of autism in <em>Observations on Madness and Melancholy </em>(1809).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note23_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               also anticipated Leo Kanner’s unfortunate misunderstanding about the etiology of autism.
               Though Gough leaves open the possibility of natural antisocial inclinations, he also
               remarks on the “mischief” that “may be done to the faculties by an improper education”
               (<em>Cline </em>110), and Thelwall more emphatically connects moral idiocy to educational failures,
               insisting “<em>the parents are sometimes the disease</em>” (<em>Results</em> 56). Kanner similarly “stress[ed] the contributory effects of parental lack of warmth
               on constitutionally predisposed children” (Wolff 204). Interestingly, Thelwall is
               much more forgiving of the parents of a nine-year-old moral idiot in <em>Results of Experience</em>: “If any thing had been wrong, it was that which almost inevitably resulted from
               the kind sympathies and best feelings of an amiable family” (67). It is unclear whether
               this represents a development in Thelwall’s attitudes or a fondness for those particular
               parents, though the text strongly suggests both.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note25_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of “neglect,” and family wishes—and even objections—were often ignored. For an excellent
               survey of the broad impact of the 1913 Act, see Thomson, who indicates that there
               are cases on record in which individuals attempted to help idiot family members escape

               century progressed, Darwinian theories of evolution became increasingly important
               to attitudes about diverse medicalized classes and the progress of the human race;
               as Janet Browne notes, <em>Origin of Species</em> “provid[ed] a biological backing for human warfare and notions of racial superiority”
               (107). In the 1880s Francis Galton began to publish material on his theory of eugenics,
               and the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed the institutional
               confinement, sterilization, and even death of countless individuals whose impairments
               were deemed dangerous to the present and future wellbeing of society. For an examination
               of disability and eugenics—and speculations as to why it remains a largely unacknowledged
