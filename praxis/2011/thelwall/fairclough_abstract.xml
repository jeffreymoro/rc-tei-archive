<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This essay explores the political significance of John Thelwall’s engagement with the
    discourse of the picturesque in his travel writing of the 1790s. E. P Thompson
    asserted that Thelwall’s turn to travel writing in the immediate aftermath of his
    metropolitan radical career demonstrated the success of the authorities in driving
    him out of politics. For Thompson, Thelwall’s essays “A Pedestrian Excursion” and
    “The Phenomena of the Wye” (1798-1801) were “conventional” and “unremarkable”
    examples of the picturesque tour, in which Thelwall reneged on his reformist
    principles by failing to engage with the working people he encountered. Recent
    critical accounts have defended Thelwall against Thompson’s charge by accentuating
    the sociological emphasis of the pedestrian tours and playing down Thelwall’s
    engagement with the picturesque. This essay argues that it is precisely through an
    exploration of the picturesque that Thelwall finds a new medium for the articulation
    of his political ideals. Thelwall’s turn to the picturesque is not just a response to
    political harassment. <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> (1793) demonstrates
    Thelwall’s long-held fascination with visual forms, though it expresses distrust at
    the abstracting effects of spectatorship. In <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title>
    Thelwall begins an exploration of alternative means of “seeing,” namely the material
    exploration of both the landscape and social configurations. This exploration is
    continued and refined in the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Phenomena of the Wye,” where
    the language of Thelwall’s descriptions of landscape anticipate his engagement with
    the politics of free speech in his elocutionary writings of the next decade.</p>
