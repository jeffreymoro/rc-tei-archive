               <p>Almost two centuries after his death, the Romantic-period political reformer John
                  Thelwall is undergoing a remarkable critical renaissance. In the past five years alone
                  he has been the subject of three conferences, a four-volume selected writings, an
                  inaugural collection of essays, diverse articles and chapters, a dramatic premiere,
                  a special issue of the journal <em>Romanticism</em>, and a campaign to restore his grave.

                  </div> In the recent opinion of one scholar, Michael Scrivener, “a strong argument can be
                  made that one does not understand Romanticism in sufficient depth if one has not engaged
                  seriously the oeuvre of Thelwall” (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reviews-blog/?p=411">Rev. of <em>Peripatetic</em></a>). The discovery in 2004 of a three-volume faircopy of Thelwall’s poetry that includes
                  several previously unknown compositions, notably a satire on the leading poets of
                  the day, makes only the most recent addition to that strikingly diverse oeuvre.

                           was a “discovery” for Thelwall scholars, since not even E. P. Thompson appears to
                           have been aware of the volumes’ survival. Their existence was of course known to the
                           staff of the Derby Local Studies Library, which probably acquired them from the late
                           nineteenth-century Derby printer Mr. Bemrose. The volumes are listed in the Location

                  </div> A quintessential Romantic polymath, Thelwall also composed political lectures and

               <p>That these works have gone largely unremarked for so long is owing partly to their
                  rarity, and partly to their author’s “radical” stigma. Along with Thomas Hardy and
                  John Horne Tooke, Thelwall was a key defendant at the Treason Trials of 1794, when
                  the Pitt government attempted to suppress the radical reform movement by depriving
                  it of its leaders—and its leaders of their heads. (The penalty for “compassing” and
                  “imagining” the king’s death was hanging.)

                  </div> Thelwall was largely relegated to the footnotes of history until the mid-twentieth
                  century, when he emerged as a hero of the British left in E. P. Thompson’s <em>The Making of the English Working Class</em> (1963). Since then, he has become a recurrent figure in studies of late eighteenth-century
                  political culture. Singling him out as the foremost republican writer in Britain after
                  Paine’s flight to France in 1792, Gregory Claeys argues in <em>The Politics of English Jacobinism: Writings of John Thelwall</em> (1995) that Thelwall’s adaptation of the Lockean natural rights tradition in response
                  to widespread poverty resulted in a “new vision of economic justice” that laid a foundation
                  for the development of socialist and liberal thought in the nineteenth century (liii).

                           the “nostalgic” radicalism of the eighteenth century to the “progressive and forward-looking”
                           radicalism of the nineteenth, see Hampsher-Monk (20). Robert Lamb has recently consolidated
                           the case for the coherence of Thelwall’s political thought by examining his theoretical
                           defence of private property rights, particularly his seemingly contradictory debts
                           to natural rights, utilitarianism, and the Scottish Enlightenment’s “four-st…</span></div>
                  </div> Meanwhile, Thelwall’s equally innovative and prolific literary and elocutionary works
                  have attracted increasing attention since the publication in 2001 of both Michael
                  Scrivener’s <em>Seditious Allegories: John Thelwall and Jacobin Writings</em> and Judith Thompson’s edition of Thelwall’s verse-and-prose work <em>The Peripatetic</em> of 1793. In the intervening decade, scholars have begun to challenge earlier dismissals
                  of Thelwall as a “mediocre poet” (Thompson, <em>Making</em> 172) and a prosodist-elocutionist who would have been “none the worse of a hanging”
                  (Saintsbury 157). The most recent additions to a growing body of Thelwall scholarship
                  include <em>Incle and Yarico and The Incas: Two Plays by John Thelwall</em> (2006), edited by Scrivener and Frank Felsenstein; the four-volume <em>Selected Political Writings of John Thelwall</em> (2009), edited by Corinna Wagner and Robert Lamb; and the collection <em>John Thelwall: Radical Romantic and Acquitted Felon</em> (2009), edited by Steve Poole. The latter grew out of two Thelwall conferences held
                  in 2007 to mark the end of a successful campaign to restore his weathered gravestone
                  in Bath, where he died of “some affection of the heart” while on an elocutionary lecture-tour
                  in February 1834, age sixty-nine (“Mr. Thelwall”).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Like the gravestone, Thelwall’s oeuvre stands in need of further attention. Indeed,
                  we are only just beginning to appreciate the diversity, originality, and coherence
                  of a career that spanned four decades and brought Thelwall into contact with the leading
                  Romantic writers, artists, thinkers, and activists. E. P. Thompson accurately remarked
                  that Thelwall “straddled the world of Wordsworth and of Coleridge, and the world of
                  the Spitalfields weavers” (<em>Making</em> 172). A leading representative of “romantic sociability,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Thelwall also belonged to overlapping Romantic circles centred variously around Godwin
                  and Holcroft; the radical publishers Daniel Isaac Eaton and Richard Phillips; the
                  democrat-physicians Henry Cline, Astley Cooper, and Peter Crompton; the Norwich intellectuals
                  William Taylor, Anne and Annabella Plumptre, and John and Amelia Opie; the Derby Philosophical
                  Society members Erasmus Darwin and William and Joseph Strutt; the Westminster reformers
                  Francis Place, Francis Burdett, John Hobhouse, and John Cartwright; and other figures
                  including “the disputation metaphysical Hazlet [<em>sic</em>],” “poor Gilly” [Gilbert] Wakefield, Robert Southey, Charles Lamb, Thomas Noon Talfourd,
                  and Henry Crabb Robinson.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Yet Thelwall’s practice is not in the end strictly comparable to any of theirs. He
                  drew self-consciously on all the major traditions and discourses of the day to create
                  a body of work as “radical” and heterogeneous as the conjunction of political, medical,
                  and cultural discourses that informed it. If, as Thelwall maintained, “style is the
                  shadow of mind” (<em>Peripatetic</em> 71), it is notable that his was consistently humane and democratizing, even when repression
                  forced him to take a vow of “inviolable silence” on political issues (<em>Retirement</em> xxxvi).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The range of Thelwall’s interests and the scope for new archival discoveries are manifest
                  in a “find” I made in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum,
                  just as I was completing the editing of this collection: a copy of George Wilkins’s
                  play <em>The Miseries of Inforst Marriage</em> (1629), owned and annotated by Thelwall.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                           (10)

                           to critical attention. See Dyce 26 Box 50/12, National Art Library, Victoria and Albert
                           Museum, London.</span></div>
                  </div> The play may have been part of the large library that Thelwall amassed on the success
                  of his career as an elocutionist in the early nineteenth century, the contents of
                  which were sold at auction in 1820, as detailed in Patty O’Boyle’s essay in this collection.
                  In addition to underlining and marginal scoring, Thelwall’s copy of the play bears
                  two evaluative notes. The first, written on the flyleaf and signed “J. T.” (with “John
                  Thelwall” added by a different hand), praises the “witty foolery” of the first scene,
                  “which reminds us so strongly of the characteristic humour of Shakespeare’s Clowns,”
                  and regrets that later scenes fall short of this standard; the second note, written
                  on the back of the last page, remarks that it was “miserable want of judgment in the
                  author” not to give the play a “tragical catastrophe.” The volume thus adds to the
                  growing body of Thelwall annotations and inscriptions—including those on Bowles’s <em>Sonnets</em>, Coleridge’s <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, and Wordworth’s <em>Excursion</em>—that candidly supplement what we already know of his professional and personal opinions.
                  The volume also suggests how Thelwall was remembered in the later nineteenth century.
                  A note by Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), the literary scholar who bequeathed the play
                  and thousands more works to the South Kensington Museum, identifies its previous owner
                  as “John Thelwall,—a person of some talents in literature, &amp; of great notoriety in
                  consequence of his having been tried for high treason.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Capitalizing on this conjunction of new material and renewed critical momentum, the
               present volume aims to help restore Thelwall to his rightful place in history and
               Romantic studies by publishing a varied selection of papers from a two-day conference
               that Judith Thompson and I co-organized at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada,
               in October 2009. “The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice” sought to highlight
               the conjunction of arts and acts in Thelwall’s theory and practice, while bringing
               together the British and North American Thelwall communities in a geographically and
               historically significant location. An Atlantic midway point between the UK and the
               US, Halifax was the site of a Canadian, and more specifically Nova Scotian, conjunction
               of literature, oratory, and reform, manifest in the achievements of the nineteenth-century
               journalist and politician Joseph Howe, the inventor and speech scientist Alexander
               Graham Bell, and the adult educator and co-operative movement pioneer Moses Coady.</p>
            <p>Both the conference and this volume take inspiration from Thelwall’s ideal of unrestricted
               intellectual exchange in an expanded public sphere. Insisting on the futility of government
               attempts to silence the radical movement through arrests, surveillance, harassment,
               and “gagging” laws, Thelwall remarked that <span class="quote">‘a sort of Socratic spirit will necessarily grow up, wherever large bodies of men
                  assemble. Each brings, as it were, into the common bank his mite of information, and
                  putting it to a sort of circulating usance, each contributor has the advantage of
                  a large interest, without any diminution of capital. (“Rights” 401)’</span> Adapting Thelwall’s metaphor to the present day, we see <em>Romantic Circles</em> as the “common bank” to which scholars can each contribute their mite to enact “a
               sort of Socratic spirit” through the electronic circulation of ideas. This collaborative
               effort will, we hope, generate a “large interest” both by attracting a wider audience
               for Thelwall’s works and by taking advantage of the unique capacity of <em>Romantic Circles</em> to re-connect the printed word with image, voice, and gesture in the dynamic way
               for which Thelwall himself was renowned.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In addition to this “Praxis” volume, the larger project <em>John Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments</em> will include two components in the “Scholarly Resources” section. “John Thelwall in
                  Time and Text” combines a chronology of Thelwall’s life and times with the fullest
                  bibliography to date of his published works, letters, and manuscripts. The result
                  of a collaborative pooling of “mites” of information at the Thelwall conference in
                  Halifax, this “common bank” offers a much-needed resource for the study of Thelwall,
                  especially in the continuing absence of a modern or complete biography.

               <em>The Fairy of the Lake</em>,” which documents the first full production of a Thelwall play, his Arthurian romance
               <em>The Fairy of the Lake</em> of 1801, a politically and autobiographically resonant allegory of the times. A co-production
               by the Dalhousie University Theatre Department and the Halifax-based Zuppa Theatre
               Company, the play opened in October 2009 in conjunction with the Thelwall conference.
               Footage of the performance brings to life the oral and performative dimensions of
               Thelwall’s practice discussed in several contributions to this volume. The accompanying
               interviews explore the challenges and decisions involved in updating a piece of radical
               Romantic theatre for modern audiences, while the essay by Judith Thompson illuminates
               the <em>Fairy</em>’s origins and literary contexts, and locates it within Thelwall’s oeuvre.</p>

                  platforms erected at the mass meetings of the reform societies in the mid-1790s, where
                  Thelwall’s voice reached thousands. (Thelwall objected to the political system of
                  “virtual representation” championed by Burke, but had he known it as a digital phenomenon,
                  he would surely have embraced it as yet another means of expanding the public sphere.)
                  The caricaturist James Gillray’s depiction of Thelwall addressing the crowd that gathered
                  in the fall of 1795 at Copenhagen Fields, outside London, has become iconic in studies
                  of radical Romanticism.

                  Thelwall’s physiognomy and elevates him in dress and position above the other figures,

                  for Thelwall scholars today. How specifically did he adapt his practice to the times,
                  and in keeping with what principles? In seeking to answer those questions, the essays
                  collected here also aim to reassess existing Thelwall scholarship.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Both objectives come into focus in Nicholas Roe’s opening contribution, which considers
               what factors might have drawn Thelwall westwards in the summer of 1797, when he made
               his watershed visit to Wordsworth and Coleridge in Somerset. In his groundbreaking
               1990 essay “Coleridge and John Thelwall: The Road to Nether Stowey,” Roe recovered
               the story of a close friendship and political affinity that Coleridge tried later
               to suppress. Returning to this important moment in literary history, Roe now takes
               stock of two newly republished essays that Thelwall composed at this time: “A Pedestrian
               Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer of 1797” and
               “The Phenomena of the Wye, during the Winter of 1797-8.” For Roe, the essays’ non-chronological
               publication and conspicuous silence on the subject of the Stowey visit reflect the
               depth of Thelwall’s disappointment when his hope of friendship and intellectual fellowship
               among the poets failed to materialize. Roe’s essay thus contributes to the recent
               case for continuity in Thelwall’s practices before and after 1797, when he retreated
               into “exile” on a small farm in Wales, from which he re-emerged four years later a
               self-made professor of elocution and speech therapist. In Roe’s view, Thelwall’s excursion
               of 1797 did not mark a retreat from metropolitan radicalism so much as a reorientation
               toward the “more subjective mediated vision” of the “Wye” essay that would find fuller
               expression in Thelwall’s <em>Poems Chiefly Written in Retirement</em> of 1801.</p>
            <p>As Roe’s essay makes clear, the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Wye” essays are also noteworthy
               for giving voice to the remarkable diversity of identities that Thelwall adopted throughout
               his life and career: not only writer and orator, theorist and therapist, journalist
               and critic, but also agriculturalist, antiquarian, historian, economist, industrialist,
               painter, pedestrian, and picturesque traveller. That last, still largely unfamiliar
               persona comes to the fore in Mary Fairclough’s essay on the evolution of Thelwall’s
               engagement with the politics of the picturesque, notably in the “Pedestrian Excursion”
               and “Wye” essays. Challenging E. P. Thompson’s view that the essays’ “conventional
               rehearsals” of the discourse of the picturesque demonstrate Thelwall’s failure to
               sustain his radicalism in the face of persecution, Fairclough argues that they in
               fact carry forward an attempt begun in <em>The Peripatetic</em> to “rethink and recalibrate such engagement” and develop alternative means of “seeing”
               the landscape. In Fairclough’s view, Thelwall achieves a material exploration of the
               landscape and its social configurations that at least partially reconciles it with
               his political radicalism and anticipates his renewed public engagement in the next
               decade, also on materialist principles.</p>

                  implications of Thelwall’s associationist understanding of the human mind. Reading
                  Thelwall’s observations on the treatment of speech impediments in <em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em> (1810) alongside the earlier materialist arguments of <em>An Essay towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</em> (1793) and the associationist premises of a much later essay “On the Influence of
                  the Scenery of Nature,” Desjardins calls attention to the consistency of Thelwall’s
                  aims across decades and modes of action: both as a political activist and an elocutionist,
                  she argues, Thelwall employed his electrifying powers of speech as a sort of “vital
                  stimulus” to form and re-form associations within and between minds in an expanded
                  public sphere.</p>

                  </div> With Emily Stanback’s contribution, however, a new dimension comes into view: the
                  impaired body as the site of an ideological struggle that shaped modern attitudes
                  towards disability over the next two centuries. Analysing Thelwall’s little-known
                  writings on the treatment of speech impediments and “idiocy” in the context of the
                  history of medicine, Stanback calls attention to alternative manifestations of Thelwall’s
                  humanizing, democratizing ideals. At a time when attitudes toward illness and impairment
                  were still inconsistent yet often pathologizing and marginalizing, she argues, Thelwall
                  offered a strikingly progressive and egalitarian approach guided by a lingering Jacobin
                  faith in the human capacity for self-improvement. In the process, Thelwall seems to
                  have anticipated a modern definition of autism and ventured some of its earliest recorded
                  descriptions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thelwall’s interest in “the enfranchisement of the fettered organs” (<em>Cline</em> 9) was no doubt influenced by his own efforts to overcome the speech impediment for
                  which he was nicknamed the “Lisping Orator” (Mrs. Thelwall 40); it was also shaped
                  by his struggles with the legal and political impediments to free expression imposed
                  throughout his career. Despite both forms of impairment, Thelwall became renowned
                  as a powerful speaker. His epitaph records that “[i]n his utterance Englishmen experienced
                  the full beauty and energy of their native speech. His oratorical powers were only
                  surpassed by his devoted zeal and unflinching efforts to promote the best liberties
                  of his fellow men.” Hazlitt described Thelwall more ambiguously, as “[t]he most dashing
                  orator I ever heard [. . .], a volcano vomiting out <em>lava</em>” (264).

                  </div> Those who objected to his politics, meanwhile, saw Thelwall’s oratory as a ready target
                  for satire. He appeared in the anti-Jacobin novels of the day as Citizen Ego, John
                  Bawlwell, and the regicidal Mr. Rant.

            </div>
            <p>In an unprecedented analysis of the role of visual satire in shaping Thelwall’s public
               profile, Steve Poole examines the often contrasting strategies by means of which loyalist
               caricaturists, notably James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank, “negotiated and accommodated”
               Thelwall’s uniquely recognizable features and demonstrative oratorical manner. A complex
               and ambiguous symbol of radical energy until his retreat to Wales in 1797, Thelwall
               thereafter became “a cartoon signifier of radical defeat and deflation.” Poole’s essay
               illuminates the iconography of the period as well as the philosophical and physiognomical
               debates that informed it, in which Thelwall himself was engaged. Taken together, Poole
               notes, these caricatures offer a visual commentary on what E. P. Thompson referred
               to as the hunting of the “Jacobin fox” (“Hunting”). Indeed, Poole regards Thelwall’s
               return to politics in the 1810s and 1820s as “relatively unconvincing.” In his view
               Thelwall did not so much redirect his earlier energies as dissipate them in uncontroversial
               “professional” channels. </p>
            <p>Clearly, the nature and extent of Thelwall’s radicalism after 1800 remains an open
               question, and answering it demands closer attention to his later pursuits. This is
               precisely what Angela Esterhammer provides in her essay on Thelwall’s short-lived
               monthly periodical the <em>Panoramic Miscellany</em>. Launched on the model of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> after Thelwall’s cursory dismissal from its editorship in 1825, the <em>Panoramic</em> aimed to continue the <em>Monthly</em>’s mission of public information and improvement. Esterhammer shows that while observing
               many common journalistic practices of the time, Thelwall’s <em>Panoramic</em> stood out for its international outlook and, above all, its “dialogic orientation.”
               In various ways, the <em>Panoramic</em> sought to provoke quasi-conversational exchange with its male, middle- and working-class
               contributors and readers, while taking a more deliberately didactic approach to female
               readers. For Esterhammer, the <em>Panoramic</em> demonstrates the persistence of Thelwall’s commitment to public education, criticism,
               and unrestricted communication even as late as 1826. Her essay complements Michael
               Scrivener’s earlier analysis of Thelwall’s journalism in the <em>Tribune</em>, the <em>Champion</em>, and the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (“The Press”), and should also be read alongside Scrivener’s republication of several
               of Thelwall’s letters from this period, both for a sense of the financial aspects
               of his late ventures and for his pained awareness that by 1832 he was already slipping
               out of the “liberal remembrances of the now triumphing advocates of Reform” (“Letters”
               149).</p>
            <p>Although the <em>Panoramic Miscellany</em> was to be Thelwall’s last published work, his legacy as a writer, lecturer, artist,
               lover, and peripatetic adventurer found new and sometimes paradoxical expression in
               his children, and especially his son Weymouth Birkbeck (1831-1873). In her often surprising
               closing contribution to this volume, Patty O’Boyle reconstructs the story of the life
               and career of this “son of John Thelwall” as he continued and subverted his father’s
               talents and principles, carrying early nineteenth-century Romantic idealism into the
               colonial heart of darkness in Central Africa. By lifting the pall of anonymity that
               has long rested on this last direct descendant of John Thelwall—whose middle name
               was a tribute to the founder of the mechanics’ institutes at which Thelwall lectured
               around the time of Weymouth’s birth in 1831—O’Boyle also sheds light on his father’s
               life and achievements from a longer historical perspective. In tandem with the essays
               by Poole and Esterhammer, O’Boyle’s essay begins to address the vexed question of
               Thelwall’s eclipse and persistence in the nineteenth century.</p>

                  principles. Efforts are now underway to launch a Thelwall Society and erect a commemorative
                  English Heritage “Blue Plaque” in London, where in 2014 a major Thelwall conferenc
                  e will explore his relation to medical science and mark the 250th anniversary of his
                  birth. The launch of a <a class="link_ref" href="http://myweb.dal.ca/jthompso/Research/citjt.html">Thelwall Web site</a>, a modern edition of his abolitionist, feminist novel <em>The Daughter of Adoption</em> (1801), and the publication of two monographs on his work all promise to help sustain
                  the pace of this ongoing recovery.

               was a “discovery” for Thelwall scholars, since not even E. P. Thompson appears to
               have been aware of the volumes’ survival. Their existence was of course known to the
               staff of the Derby Local Studies Library, which probably acquired them from the late
               nineteenth-century Derby printer Mr. Bemrose. The volumes are listed in the <em>Location Register of English Literary Manuscripts and Letters: Eighteenth and Nineteenth
                  Centuries</em>, edited by David C. Sutton, and in the online index of the National Register of Archives.
               For the most part only the recto pages of the volumes are inscribed, although the
               verso pages carry some emendations and, in volume 3, portions of the satirical poem

               the “nostalgic” radicalism of the eighteenth century to the “progressive and forward-looking”
               radicalism of the nineteenth, see Hampsher-Monk (20). Robert Lamb has recently consolidated
               the case for the coherence of Thelwall’s political thought by examining his theoretical
               defence of private property rights, particularly his seemingly contradictory debts
               to natural rights, utilitarianism, and the Scottish Enlightenment’s “four-stages”
               account of economic development, while Richard Sheldon has questioned the extent to
               which Thelwall’s pro-commercial republicanism was “proto-socialist.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of the Two Acts. The projected second volume, “containing an account of his domestic
               history and of his labours in the field of literature, and of the Science of Elocution,”
               was never published (xii). The autobiographical “Prefatory Memoir” that accompanied
               Thelwall’s <em>Poems, Chiefly Written in Retirement</em> of 1801 fills in the story of his path to retirement in Wales at the end of the decade
