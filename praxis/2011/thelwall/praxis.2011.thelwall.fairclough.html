               <h1><span class="head">John Thelwall and the Politics of the Picturesque</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>John Thelwall was, for E. P. Thompson, one of the most remarkable figures and “considerable
               theorists” of the British reform movement in the 1790s (<em>Making</em> 172-73). But Thompson asserts that Thelwall’s achievements were not sustained in
               the sequel to the metropolitan radical phase of his career, in which between 1798
               and 1801 he published a series of articles in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>,<em> </em>“A Pedestrian Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer
               of 1797” and “The Phenomena of the Wye, During the Winter of 1797-8.” For Thompson,
               Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” “is unremarkable, being largely devoted to conventional
               rehearsals of the ‘romantic and picturesque’” (“Hunting” 105). Thompson criticises
               Thelwall’s apparent failure to sustain the progressive social and political tenets
               of his earlier publications and lectures, reading the pedestrian tour as evidence
               of the “success” of attempts by the authorities to “drive” Thelwall “out of the reform
               business” (104). Thelwall’s love of the “romantic and picturesque” is, for Thompson,
               incompatible with his political activism, which demands interaction and co-operation,
               rather than detached contemplation. This essay will reassess the grounds of Thompson’s
               censure, and will argue that Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque should be
               read not as a retreat from political engagement but as an attempt to rethink and recalibrate
               such engagement in the face of extreme pressure. Thelwall’s treatment of the picturesque
               demonstrates his sustained if evolving dedication to<span class="hi"> </span>his reformist principles. It also reveals the under-acknowledged ways in which Thelwall
               adapts and modifies aesthetic conventions in order to temper their political implications.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Eighteenth-century aesthetic modes do generate certain reactionary political effects.
                  Thompson’s critique of Thelwall echoes critical censure of the damaging results of
                  aesthetic spectatorship. John Barrell and Ann Bermingham have argued that the aesthetic
                  observer tends to mimic the position of a privileged landowner who disdains active
                  intervention in the lives of the poor (Barrell, <em>Dark</em> 70-76, <em>Pandora</em> 96-98; Bermingham 68-69).

                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This condemnation has been revised by critics who argue for the indeterminate, playful
                           quality of the picturesque (Michasiw 76-100; Jarvis 54; de Bolla 119-20).</span></div>
                  </div> Elizabeth Bohls notes that such spectatorship produces a “powerful abstracting impulse”
                  which reinforces a “symbolic connection between material particulars and groups of
                  people traditionally thought of as trapped in them, defined by their bodies, as opposed
                  to their minds: the labouring classes and women” (13). The focus of Thelwall’s political
                  activism during the mid-1790s had been the broadening of the intellectual franchise
                  and the diffusion of knowledge to such groups, and his early scientific training had
                  armed him with a sophisticated sense of the importance of material analyses of physical
                  and political structures (<em>Tribune</em> 102). Thelwall’s engagement with aesthetic forms appears to work against his own political
                  practice.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Michael Scrivener has recently defended Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” against
               Thompson’s charges, asserting that Thelwall’s frustration with the working people
               he encounters is a direct result of the political pressures under which he was struggling,
               which the text of the “Pedestrian Excursion” carefully suppresses (74-75). Scrivener
               argues that the essay is not restricted to accounts of the picturesque, but rather
               offers detailed analysis of the effects of agricultural monopoly and war on the condition
               of the poor. But in order to argue for this politically engaged Thelwall, Scrivener
               plays down the significance of his use of aesthetic conventions in the “Pedestrian
               Excursion,” noting that though it “has a minor aesthetic connoisseur dimension, the
               essay’s most distinctive feature is its sociological focus” (77). Thelwall’s landscape
               description is presented as a digression from rather than a component of the “sociological”
               work of the essay, and Scrivener does not engage with the reactionary implications
               of the picturesque itself.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>However, Thelwall’s exploration of the “romantic and picturesque” does not represent
                  a marker of his disillusionment with political activism, but rather arms him with
                  a new means of articulating his social and political goals of intellectual enquiry
                  and sympathetic co-operation. Long before his excursion of 1797 Thelwall had explored
                  in print whether aesthetic contemplation and political activism could prove productive
                  partners. <em>The Peripatetic</em>, Thelwall’s novel, travel narrative and reformist tract, published at the outset
                  of his political career in 1793, makes repeated use of visual conventions. However, <em>The Peripatetic</em>’s radically mixed mode does not lend itself to sustained engagement with aesthetic
                  tropes, and the passages in which Thelwall evokes the picturesque are characterised
                  by an ironic tone. Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Phenomena of the Wye” engage
                  in more detail with the picturesque; however, they are no mere “conventional rehearsals”
                  of the discourse. In these essays Thelwall demonstrates a sophisticated appropriation
                  of and deviation from aesthetic conventions to suit his political aims. As Judith
                  Thompson has suggested, Thelwall challenges the distinction between an aesthetic and
                  a sociological approach to landscape by emphasising the material basis of both (“Citizen”
                  79). For Thelwall the ideal viewing consciousness is never a disembodied, abstracting
                  entity, but rather one which maintains a material connection with the landscape of
                  which it forms a part.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Lamb and Wagner suggest, an interesting comparison piece to Thelwall’s “Pedestrian
                           Excursion” is Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark
                           (15). Bohls describes how Wollstonecraft unsettles standard aesthetic viewpoints and
                           “works toward a corporeally and political situated mode of perception” (142, 152).</span></div>
                  </div> His ongoing engagement with the picturesque demonstrates his gradual steps to overcoming
                  the abstracting effects of aesthetic contemplation and toward synthesising the representation
                  of landscape with his political activism.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">I.</span></h2>
               <p>In the preface to <em>The Peripatetic</em>, Thelwall declares his “design of uniting the different advantages of the novel,
                  the sentimental journal, and the miscellaneous collection of essays and poetical effusions”
                  (72). Despite the heterogeneous form of the work, structural coherence is conferred
                  through the walking tours which Thelwall’s protagonist Sylvanus Theophrastus undertakes
                  to Saint Albans in Hertfordshire, and to Rochester in Kent. So, like Thelwall’s essays
                  for the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>, <em>The Peripatetic</em> describes the practice of “pedestrian excursion” (115). Sylvanus states the advantages
                  of such excursions, declaring that he and his companion will “compare our remarks
                  on such monuments of antiquity, and such picturesque benefits of art and nature, as
                  the road, or its environs might present” (115). But Thelwall differentiates the pedestrian
                  excursions undertaken in <em>The Peripatetic </em>from the practice of picturesque tourism set out in the publications of William Gilpin:
                  “It was not to be a mere excursion of pleasure: for nothing is, in general, more delusive
                  or insipid. Information and improvement were to constitute the principle feature of
                  our expedition” (115). Though sensitive to its “benefits,” <em>The Peripatetic</em> maintains a sceptical attitude to aesthetic tourism; therefore, the aesthetic value
                  of landscape is rarely considered in isolation. Sylvanus admits that his “observations”
                  on the beauties he encounters “may perhaps be neither very original nor profound,”
                  but he insists on their social value, generated by and recorded in “those conversations,
                  that . . . stole the miles so imperceptibly away” (115). For Thelwall, pedestrian
                  travel should be the occasion not for isolated spectatorship, but for conversation
                  and interaction, prompting both individual and collective “information and improvement.”
                  As Judith Thompson notes, Thelwall’s commitment to “friendly converse” is reflected
                  in the “dialogic form” of <em>The Peripatetic</em>, in which contrasting discourses are juxtaposed and combined to create an “intergeneric”
                  conversational mode (Introduction 38-39, 41).</p>
               <p>Thelwall’s “intergeneric” discursive method ensures that though <em>The Peripatetic</em> makes many references to the picturesque, the descriptions that follow are rarely
                  purely aesthetic. Rather, Thelwall adopts a topographical approach, describing the
                  historical, economic and agricultural condition of the landscape, though, as Thompson
                  notes, <em>The Peripatetic</em> appropriates this discourse to “reorient” the reader’s political preconceptions (Introduction
                  33). Descriptions of picturesque scenes at Greenwich, Shooter’s Hill and Rochester
                  thus digress swiftly to the “historical allusions” or “flights of fancy” that they
                  prompt (99, 162-64, 257-74). In several episodes Sylvanus praises gothic ruins for
                  their picturesque effect, but these ruins are not pure “objects of art” as Gilpin
                  would have it (<em>Essays</em> 46). Instead they are physical reminders of the “instability of grandeur” as well
                  as relics of “ancient political institutions” (158, 199). The ruins of Rochester castle
                  “mingle” different effects to produce “one grotesque picture of sylvan nature, of
                  horticulture, and antiquities” (260). The aesthetic effects of the ruins are inseparable
                  from the intellectual stimulus prompted by the castle’s antiquarian significance,
                  and the social effects of the horticulture practiced in its grounds. The picturesque
                  is merely one component of the political “information” to be derived from the peripatetic
                  tour.</p>
               <p><em>The Peripatetic</em> does not seek a comfortable synthesis of such diverse responses to visual scenes.
                  Immediately after praising “the picturesque varieties of a British horizon,” Sylvanus
                  notes that “the scene is changed; and the topographer must, for a while, take the
                  place of the sentimental admirer of picturesque beauty” (142). So sudden are the changes
                  of “scene” in <em>The Peripatetic</em> that they often serve an ironic function, undercutting Sylvanus’s rhapsodic response
                  to visual landscapes (151). The enjoyment of visual scenes in <em>The Peripatetic</em> is never a simple “pleasure.” Thelwall’s mixed mode generates ironic juxtapositions
                  which undercut the assumed authority of the aesthetic observer, and question whether
                  visual observation alone can stimulate “information and improvement.”</p>
               <p><em>The Peripatetic</em>’s sceptical attitude to aesthetic observation complicates those scenes which come
                  closest to the conventions of the picturesque tour. Sylvanus’s descriptions never
                  generate the authority of a commentator such as Gilpin. Rather, an ironic distance
                  between Sylvanus’s voice and Thelwall’s authorial presence is implied. At Shooter’s
                  Hill Sylvanus praises the “picturesque beauties” around him, but he actually describes
                  a “prospect of the widening Thames, the rich champaign, the villages and villas which
                  lay before me” (163). Thelwall is perhaps amusing himself at Sylvanus’s lack of aesthetic
                  connoisseurship here. But Sylvanus’s failure to distinguish between the conventions
                  of the prospect view and the picturesque has significant political consequences. As
                  Barrell has shown, the metaphor of the prospect was a means through which an eighteenth-century
                  gentleman could demonstrate his suitability for a life of public virtue (Barrell,
                  <em>Pandora</em> 52; Labbe xi-xii). Though a culturally powerful viewing position, the prospect view
                  is anathema to Thelwall’s participatory political agenda. The “bird’s eye prospect”
                  eradicates all specificity from the landscape, which compromises the activist strain
                  of <em>The Peripatetic</em> (<em>Peripatetic</em> 150, 163). At times Sylvanus seems aware of the damaging effects of the prospect
                  view, and posits the picturesque as a more wholesome alternative, declaring: “Let
                  us turn, then, from this overgrown Metropolis, its spreading streets and rising palaces;
                  the trophies . . . of public misery and oppression; and contemplate the picturesque
                  home scenery with which this garden of a heath abounds” (153). The intimate scale
                  of a picturesque scene and its focus on material objects mitigates the abstracting
                  effect of the prospect. But the fact that Sylvanus often fails to distinguish between
                  these two discourses signals the dangerous effects of such spectatorship.</p>
               <p>Despite its defence of the picturesque over the prospect view on political grounds,
                  <em>The Peripatetic</em> demonstrates clear suspicion of the abstracting effects of all aesthetic tropes.
                  Reformist sentiments are articulated through the adoption of the mixed mode signalled
                  in Thelwall’s preface, rather than through a treatment of the aesthetic in isolation.
                  Though the picturesque has the potential to represent the interests of the humblest
                  members of society, Thelwall demonstrates the dangers of aestheticising the lives
                  of any group. He takes gypsies as his example, perhaps because Gilpin had asserted
                  their picturesque effect (<em>Observations</em> II 44, 46). Thelwall appears to agree when he notes that for “a hunter of the picturesque,”
                  gypsies “contribute, in no small degree, to the embellishment of rural scenery” (196).
                  But he interrogates this statement over a course of digressions which end with Sylvanus’s
                  recollection of encountering another group of gypsies. Sylvanus declares an aesthetic
                  appreciation of “the yellow misty light that gleamed over the southern horizon,” but
                  when describing the gypsies themselves, adopts a vocabulary of social configuration:
                  “I saw . . . the cheerful family of vagrants sitting on the grass, around their crackling
                  fire, and enjoying their repast, and to me unintelligible conversation; with their
                  rude, lowly tents in the rear . . . and the patient 'mute companions of their toils'
                  grazing in social familiarity by their sides” (208). These people do not merely “embellish”
                  the scene; indeed, Thelwall rejects aesthetic appreciation altogether. The scene includes
                  “none of that marvellous novelty necessary to fix the demure, half-vacant eye of reverend
                  <em>Gravity</em>” (208-09). For Thelwall these “vulgar objects” do not elicit aesthetic admiration
                  but stimulate “a concatenation of ideas” encompassing imaginative engagement, antiquarian
                  investigation and social and political activism (209). Thelwall rejects the distancing
                  effect of the aesthetic gaze and instead asserts the gypsies’ historic bonds with
                  societies from which they are now ostracised. Aesthetic “pleasure” is dismissed as
                  Thelwall reiterates his aim of promoting “information and improvement” in order to
                  better the lives of marginalised groups.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Despite <em>The Peripatetic</em>’s repeated engagement with the picturesque, the models of political and social improvement
                     that Thelwall advocates often reject visual forms altogether. Thelwall is adamant
                     that visual scenes alone are not sufficient to prompt the sympathetic sociability
                     that enables social improvement (121). An important lyric declaring lavish admiration
                     of the natural landscape ends with the assertion that “nor all the pleasures of the
                     ravish’d sight, / Like <em>friendly Converse</em> wake the raptur’d glow!” (115-16). Such “converse” is the stimulus for a material
                     investigation of the physical and by extension the social and political landscape,
                     which does not rely on the abstracting forms of visual observation but incorporates
                     different “ways of seeing” (Jarvis 44). Thelwall’s political activism and his training
                     in physiology provide the basis for his exploration of modes of vision which challenge
                     the distance between the observer and the landscape. Thelwall declares in a political
                     lecture delivered the year after the publication of <em>The Peripatetic</em> that “This is a season for inquiry and instruction, not for pastime and jocularity;

                     which we cannot but feel too sensibly” (<em>Political</em> 2). <em>The Peripatetic</em>, too, demands a material engagement with the conditions of social life. In a “Digression
                     for the Anatomists,” which draws on Thelwall’s physiological training, though enquiry
                     is prompted by the splendours of nature, “the scientific eye” reveals “wider fields
                     of wisdom and delight” than those presented by the aesthetic gaze (146).

                     and political conditions of human experience” (9). However, <em>The Peripatetic</em>, structured by ironic juxtaposition and shifts of “scene,” has no interest in synthesising
                     its diverse elements. As a result <em>The Peripatetic</em> tends to regard aesthetic effects as limited and potentially deceptive. The picturesque
                     does not yet have a positive political function in Thelwall’s work.</p>

                  <p>“A Pedestrian Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer
                     of 1797” describes a walking tour from London to the West Country, which Thelwall
                     undertook during the summer in which his metropolitan radical career seemed finally
                     to have been crushed (Scrivener 74-75). The “Pedestrian Excursion” is undoubtedly
                     a politically engaged text, but one in which Thelwall adapts his methods to a new
                     form, the picturesque tour. In doing so, he imbues that form with renewed political
                     significance. In contrast to the mixed mode of <em>The Peripatetic</em>, Thelwall’s “Pedestrian Excursion” is a sustained interrogation of the picturesque
                     which seeks to find a means to reconcile and even integrate an analysis of visual
                     forms with his political activism. While <em>The Peripatetic</em> makes only glancing allusions to Gilpin’s work, the “Pedestrian Excursion” develops
                     a self-conscious response to the strictures of the picturesque, making reference not
                     only to Gilpin’s schema, but also those of the picturesque’s arch-theorists, Richard
                     Payne Knight and Uvedale Price.

                              term for Price and Payne Knight.</span></div>
                     </div> Thelwall declares himself one of the “pedestrian hunters of the picturesque and sentimental,”
                     but the picturesque is no mere fashionable object of scorn (52). Rather, the opening
                     of the “Pedestrian Excursion” suggests a function for picturesque tourism which seems
                     to achieve a synthesis between political and aesthetic concerns. Thelwall notes that
                     “circumstances [have] produced another species of curiosity well calculated to go
                     hand in hand with a passion for the picturesque and romantic. Every fact connected
                     with the history and actual condition of the laborious classes had become important
                     to a heart throbbing with anxiety for the welfare of the human race” (17). The physiologically
                     situated fellow feeling urged in <em>The Peripatetic</em> recurs here, but Thelwall now aligns it with “a passion for the picturesque.” In contrast
                     with the distrust of the abstracting effects of spectatorship in <em>The Peripatetic</em>, the “Pedestrian Excursion” advocates the appreciation of landscape as a means of
                     generating sociability.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The “Pedestrian Excursion” develops <em>The Peripatetic</em>’s suggestion that the picturesque should be valorised over the prospect view, adding
                  a technical rigour to those conjectures. At East Knoyle in Wiltshire, Thelwall and
                  his companion are conducted to a “commanding eminence” from which “we commanded one
                  of the most pleasant views I had ever seen.” Thelwall praises the hills which “dimly
                  descried through mists, bounded the prospect and mingled with the horizon” (44-45).
                  But this “bird’s-eye prospect” cannot compare to that which follows when the travellers
                  descend from the hilltop and indulge in “the enjoyment of the picturesque, and the
                  beauty and fertility of the home-scene, in the lowlands, with their embowered and
                  scattered cottages” (45). The “home-scene” of the picturesque is valued for its humble,
                  inclusive qualities. Thelwall emphasises this point in an earlier episode which praises
                  “the solemn grandeur and shady sequestration of [the] descending path” from the summit
                  at Richmond Hill: “That pomp of scenery, that expanse and publicity of prospect .
                  . . fascinate, indeed the occasional observer: but in the picturesque of nature, as
                  in the intercourses of life, it is principally in the lowly vales and shades of sober
                  sequestration we must seek the pleasures that cloy not on repetition” (18-19). Thelwall’s
                  enthusiasm for the occluded viewpoint of “lowly vales” echoes Gilpin and his successors
                  (Gilpin, <em>Observations</em> 186; Price 33; Knight 30). However, his alignment of “the picturesque of nature”
                  with the social “intercourses of life” is original (18-19). Thelwall uses landscape
                  description to support his assertion that the social “pleasures which cloy not on
                  repetition” must be cherished and protected from the destructive effects of political
                  and economic monopoly.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thelwall’s preference for the picturesque over the prospect view is not merely a marker
                     of an unrealised social ideal, but forms part of his critique of actual institutions.
                     His speaker describes the “scene of fertility” visible from the road from Shepperton,
                     and notes that “from every eminence the mansions of opulence overlook the prospect
                     with exultation. But man, aggregate man, seems little benefitted by this abundance
                     . . . everything has the appearance of that desolating monopoly which makes fertility
                     itself a desert” (20). Thelwall demonstrates that this “prospect” is not only myopic
                     but deliberately exploitative. He demands that the observer instead adopt the perspective
                     of “man, aggregate man” and engage with the material particularities of social existence.

                     </div> Thelwall’s call for the recognition of “aggregate man” enlists aesthetic description
                     for a democratic cause, echoing as it does the rhetoric of his 1796 tract <em>The Rights of Nature</em>, in which the “aggregate reason” of obscure individuals establishes a common interest,
                     and forms the basis of civil society (459-60).</p>
               </div>
               <p>However, the “Pedestrian Excursion” also suggests an alteration in Thelwall’s social
                  and political objects since the high water mark of his metropolitan radicalism. The
                  term to which Thelwall returns again and again when advocating picturesque “intercourses
                  of life” is “sequestration.” This echoes the opening of the “Pedestrian Excursion”
                  in which Thelwall reveals the object of his journey to be an “immediate and intimate
                  communication of sentiment” with his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset (17).
                  Thelwall’s poem “Lines Written at Bridgwater,” written just after his abortive stay
                  with Coleridge during the tour described in the “Pedestrian Excursion,” demonstrates
                  the endurance of this ideal: </p>

               </blockquote>
               <p> Commentators have emphasised a lyric turn in the “Pedestrian Excursion” which expresses
                  Thelwall’s understandable desire for retreat in the face of harassment (Jarvis 35-36;
                  Scrivener 76). However, it is important to scrutinise any critical narrative which,
                  like E. P. Thompson’s, polarises Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque and his
                  political activism. Another poem dating from the summer of 1797 “On Leaving the Bottoms
                  of Gloucestershire” asserts that “sequester’d musings” must be “tho sylvan, yet not
                  solitary” (<em>Poems</em> 136). Even in rural “sequestration,” Thelwall’s social ideal and the basis of his
                  political commitment is “converse,” which enables “Culture and the Arts” and “social
                  decoration” (136). But this community is too secluded, untouched by “Factory” or associated
                  commercial “Opulence” (137). Thelwall’s preference for “sequestration” in “Pedestrian
                  Excursion,” as in the poems written during that summer, does not nullify the text’s
                  political engagement, but does complicate that engagement. Though Thelwall declares
                  a universal social sympathy as his political aim, the picturesque generates intimate,
                  rather than inclusive social relations.</p>
               <p>In certain episodes, the “Pedestrian Excursion” articulates a fully-formed account
                  of sympathetic sociability prompted by the picturesque landscape, but not alienated
                  by the distancing effect of the aesthetic gaze. Passing through a village on the edge
                  of Salisbury Plain, Thelwall’s speaker views a “range of villages scattered along
                  the valley, that opens in a long perspective to the right.” He notes that “the hour
                  was favourable to the emotions these objects were calculated to inspire . . . the
                  light was softened, and the shadows were lengthening: circumstances that cherish a
                  pensive serenity, and pre-dispose the heart to the social sympathies of our nature”
                  (39). The picturesque scene itself awakens “social sympathies” in the travellers,
                  but this state is not sustained. Thelwall’s speaker then bemoans the “jealous caution”
                  of working people he encounters, which deadens any social intercourse (39). Thelwall’s
                  sense of alienation lies at the root of Thompson’s objections to the “Pedestrian Excursion.”
                  However, Thompson separates Thelwall’s treatment of the picturesque from his political
                  activities too starkly. Thelwall’s engagement with the picturesque in the “Pedestrian
                  Excursion” is itself a political move prompted by the inequalities and hostility that
                  he meets on his tour. But though Thelwall finds the picturesque an effective means
                  of articulating protest in the face of political adversity, the “Pedestrian Excursion”
                  struggles to articulate how it might contribute to widespread political amelioration.

               <p>“The Phenomena of the Wye, During the Winter of 1797-8” continues and develops Thelwall’s
                  engagement with the picturesque. Thelwall wrote the essay after the completion of
                  his pedestrian tour of summer 1797 but it appeared in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> before the “Pedestrian Excursion.” Since the publication of Gilpin’s <em>Observations on the River Wye</em> (1789), the Wye Valley had “acquired a due celebrity” as a picturesque tourist destination,
                  as Thelwall acknowledges in “The Phenomena of the Wye” (3). But Thelwall clearly distinguishes
                  his account from that of Gilpin. Thelwall writes not as a tourist but as a resident
                  of the Wye Valley, having moved with his family to a riverside farm at Llyswen in
                  Breconshire during the autumn of 1797. In his memoir of 1801, Thelwall declares that
                  the chief reason for “the election of this spot” was “the wild and picturesque scenery
                  of the neighbourhood” (<em>Poems</em> xxxv). Thelwall’s memoir presents Llyswen as the realisation of the secluded “retreat”
                  to which the “Pedestrian Excursion” seems at times to gesture, a place in which “the
                  agitations of political feeling might be cradled to forgetfulness” (xxxvi). But “The
                  Phenomena of the Wye” presents a very different account of the picturesque at Llyswen,
                  which complicates this narrative. Thelwall’s speaker is not an isolated spectator
                  of the landscape, but rather a situated, embodied participant in the scenes that surround
                  him. As a result of this material engagement with the landscape, Thelwall adopts a
                  new vocabulary in his treatment of the picturesque.</p>
               <p>Thelwall’s speaker rejects the touring seasons of summer and autumn to recount the
                  beauties of the Wye in winter, and in doing so offers a novel account of the picturesque.
                  Thelwall’s focus is not the surfaces and shades of the landscape, but rather its “anatomy,”
                  revealed in “the leafless grove, the dismantled hill, nay, the very gloom of night
                  itself, when nothing is discernible but the mere outline of surrounding mountains”
                  (3). Such anatomical observation “is as essential to the landscape painter, as that
                  of the human form to the historical branch of the art” (3). Thelwall’s “Digression
                  for the Anatomists” in <em>The Peripatetic</em> had declared that the anatomical insights of the “scientific eye” were vital even
                  for “the elegant votary of the polite arts,” namely portrait and historical painting
                  (146). But here for the first time Thelwall connects anatomical study with the analysis
                  of landscape. In contrast to Gilpin, who makes human figures decorative appendages
                  to the landscape, Thelwall asserts that the landscape can only be understood through
                  analogy with the investigation of the “human form.” The material analysis of physical
                  forms suggests a means of overcoming the gulf between Thelwall’s political aims and
                  the abstracting conventions of aesthetic contemplation. What this formal comparison
                  lacks is a sense of the social exchange fundamental to Thelwall’s political aims.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thelwall suggests the means to make analysis of the picturesque a socially and politically
                     engaged phenomenon in the next passage of the “Phenomena of the Wye,” which sustains
                     his assertion that the appreciation of landscape is informed by the material analysis
                     of physical forms, but also suggests that social configurations might be understood
                     in the same way. The “bold and prominent” features of the Wye valley are particularly
                     suited to examination during winter because: <span class="quote">‘Scenery of this description may be compared to those superior orders of shape and
                        feature which constitute the perfection of the human form; in which transparent tints
                        and the most perfect symmetry are graces of inferior magnitude, and beauty itself
                        is the smaller part of loveliness—where the whole countenance beams expression, every
                        feature has its animation and character, every line is descriptive of some kind or
                        elevated passion, and every glance, every gesture, every motion is eloquent of sympathy
                        and intelligence. (4)’</span> This passage begins with a comparison between the form of the landscape and that of
                     the human figure. But the landscape changes from a static object of contemplation
                     to an active, co-responding companion. Thelwall employs a vocabulary of reciprocal
                     exchange of energy and emotions that echoes his most engaged political lecturing.

                     </div> Vitally, it not only recalls Thelwall’s investigations of alternate “ways of seeing”
                     in <em>The Peripatetic</em>, but also anticipates his engagement with a related form of material “inquiry” in
                     his elocutionary practice of the next decade. In his 1805 tract <em>An Introductory Discourse on the Nature and Objects of Elocutionary Science</em> Thelwall notes that language must be incorporated into the body’s physical expression:
                     “Language alone is not sufficient: nature’s epitome, like nature’s self, must sympathize
                     through every element: motion and look and attitude must manifest the inspiration
                     of genuine feeling; and every portion of the frame must be vital with expressive eloquence”
                     (24). The “Phenomena of the Wye” sustains and develops Thelwall’s critique of visual
                     forms dating back to <em>The Peripatetic</em>. But here Thelwall demonstrates that a formal appreciation of landscape is not separable
                     from other kinds of material analysis, of physiological, social, or political forms,
                     and even suggests that the aesthetic might encourage the conditions for political
                     engagement rather than isolated abstraction.

               <p>In the close to this passage Thelwall demonstrates that such inclusive forms of investigation
                  can assimilate the distinct discourses of aesthetic contemplation and social and political
                  activism: “Such are the forms that owe not their attraction to the wardrobe—the charms
                  that never cloy—that fade not even in the winter of old age—the sublime of human nature!”
                  (4). Here landscape description and social interaction are so profoundly synthesised
                  as to be inseparable. Thelwall echoes his assertion in the “Pedestrian Excursion”
                  that picturesque “sequestration” produces “pleasures that cloy not on repetition.”
                  But despite the sheltered location of his “little cottage,” Thelwall’s speaker in
                  the “Phenomena of the Wye” does not demand seclusion (5). In contrast to the often
                  isolated protagonist of the “Pedestrian Excursion,” Thelwall’s speaker exchanges stories
                  with “my predecessor in this little farm” (5). As Scrivener notes, the “grand” natural
                  phenomena that the speaker witnesses are discussed in terms of their effects on the
                  social and economic conditions in the valley (Scrivener 82; “Wye” 6-7). Through the
                  language of material analysis and sympathetic social engagement, Thelwall ensures
                  that the “romantic and picturesque” scenes of the Wye do not represent pure “retreat”
                  but rather gesture forward to Thelwall’s renewed engagement in public life in the
                  next decade.</p>

               Excursion” is Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em> (15). Bohls describes how Wollstonecraft unsettles standard aesthetic viewpoints
               and “works toward a corporeally and political situated mode of perception” (142, 152).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Several episodes in <em>The Peripatetic</em> which begin with the contemplation of the visual landscape end with Thelwall advocating
               an alternative “scientific view” (226-27).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
