            </header><br/><div class="epigraph"><span class="quote">‘Unto Us a Son Is Born who looks more like a fine boy of a year and a half than one
                  of a half an hour old. You have now therefore another brother whom I hope to see you
                  in the course of the next month nursing. My dear Cecil has had an excellent good time
                  of it and appears likely to do very well—Eliza is weeping for joy; and her dear affectionate
                  heart makes her think it the most wonderfully lovely babe that ever was born—I will
                  leave it to others, when they can find time, to tell you what sort of an old fool
                  I am–’</span></div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus a delighted John Thelwall wrote to his daughter Sara, on August 4, 1831, on the
                  birth of his son Weymouth Birkbeck, who seems almost to have attempted to catch up
                  with his father before he was an hour old.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> As if fated to live at the same breathless, belated pace, Weymouth went on to recapitulate
                  his father’s eccentric career and talents, inheriting his gift of oratory, realizing
                  his thwarted artistic and theatrical ambitions, and setting forth on even more bizarre
                  adventures in amorous, peripatetic and scientific discovery. His very life span ironically
                  mirrors the forty-six years preceding his birth that had taken John Thelwall from
                  an abandoned career in law to his trial for treason in 1794, and to the brink of success
                  in realising his long deferred political hopes in the Great Reform Bill of 1832. Forty-six
                  years years later the new life so joyfully announced in 1831 was to end in an unmarked
                  “white man’s grave,” archetypal symbol of the folly of imperialist ambitions that
                  the elder Thelwall had rejected, along with the often bigoted religious institutions
                  that partly inspired them.

                  </div> Victim of his own romantic radical inheritance, Weymouth Thelwall was swallowed by
                  the heart of darkness it led him into.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Sixty-seven years old at Weymouth’s birth, John Thelwall may have felt himself an
                  “old fool,” but he was still an enthusiastic political agitator and orator. In the
                  letter announcing the birth, he informs Sara that “alternations of public exertions,
                  a little tuition and much propensity to enjoy the long forbidden charm of quiet study”
                  have preoccupied him over the previous weeks. Those public exertions included his
                  work as a leader of the St. Mary le Bone and St. Pancras parish committee, in support
                  of the Political Union of the Working Classes (Place sec. 23). The following October
                  he was to play an important role in the successful organisation of a huge procession
                  of the union’s members, involving tens of thousands of disaffected supporters of the
                  first Reform Bill from all the parishes in London who marched through the city in
                  protest at its defeat by the House of Lords (Place sec. 23). One of the reforms Thelwall
                  had supported as early as 1795, the religious and political emancipation of Irish
                  Catholics,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> had just been achieved through the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Bill of 1829,
                  though it was bitterly contested by other denominations and Irish protestants. Here
                  the personal and the political were once more to meet in John Thelwall’s life and
                  affect the lives of the son whose nativity he heralds and of his Catholic mother Cecil,
                  whose father had been Irish.

                           Register, the long-running directory of addresses in London. His widow Eliza ran it
                           after his death.</span></div>
                  </div> It is almost as if the act itself had opened the way for his son to be born and enter
                  civic life at least partly unhindered by the repressive Test Acts and other such legislation
                  that had trammelled and harried his father’s radical generation. For, perhaps surprisingly,
                  Weymouth was brought up as a Catholic.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The religious toleration that had always marked the work of John Thelwall (catholic
                  in the sense of liberal and broad-minded) would shape the lives of his sons in very
                  different ways. Though there is little evidence that he ever converted, his marriage
                  to Henrietta Cecil Boyle in 1817 indicates a softening in his earlier staunch atheism.

                           Thoughts in Affliction offer the only slim evidence that John Thelwall (by whom they
                           were likely composed) experienced a “movement towards grace” as he grew older.</span></div>
                  </div> Perhaps in deference to her religious freedom, the wedding at St. James Westminster
                  was preceded by the baptism of the five surviving children of his first marriage:
                  Algernon Sydney, John Hampden, Manon Roland, Sara Maria and Edwin Northumbrian. His
                  eldest sons, both of whom went on to take orders in the Anglican Church, show very
                  different sides of the “Thelwall” personality. In 1831 Hampden had just begun a life
                  of rural “poverty and seclusion personified” as the charitable Rector of Oving in
                  Buckinghamshire (Kelly 181); his older brother Algernon was a militant evangelist
                  who had recently returned from trying to convert the Jews of Amsterdam. While Hampden’s
                  quiet social conscience found an outlet in supplying the poor lace-makers of his village
                  with materials and markets, and teaching their children to read (Kelly 181),

                           </span></div>
                  </div> Algernon’s outspoken activism expressed itself in polemical tracts against Catholics
                  and almost any dissenting Church that did not acknowledge the Trinity. As paid secretary
                  of the Trinitarian Bible Society (TBS) formed in 1831, he engaged in a pamphlet war
                  against the editor of <em>The Christian Observer,</em> a supporter of the long-established British and Foreign Bible Society—a battle of
                  words which rivalled any his father had fought. Even years after John Thelwall’s death
                  his opponents were still calling his respectability in doubt. Algernon summons up
                  the ghost of his own father by calling his well-known antagonist’s anonymity a “questionable
                  shape”—a borrowing from <em>Hamlet</em> that his father had used in his arguments against Burke (<em>Statement </em>12).

                           pertinently against Burke in almost a mirror version of his son’s pamphlet war with
                           Wilkes. See Thelwall, Sober Reflections 345. For another occurrence see The Rights
                           of Nature 415.</span></div>
                  </div> He is countered by the editor, Samuel Charles Wilkes, sneeringly referring to “sonorous
                  vocables” and “oratorical vocabulary” to discredit the son by raising the same ghost
                  (<em>Statement </em>29, 52); and by his lamenting the TBS’s lack of “fatherly authority” in not having
                  bishops on its committee but having as its paid secretary “a son of John Thelwall”
                  (50, 16).

                  </div> Curiously, the President of the TBS was the judge Thomas Erskine, son of the very
                  barrister who had so ably defended John Thelwall at his trial in 1794. One of the
                  main charges against Algernon was that he spent more of the subscribers’ money on
                  polemical pamphlets than on printing Bibles for the lost souls of Britain. The implied
                  objection to him, however, was quite obviously that he was simply “a son of John Thelwall.”

                  nature combined Algernon’s restlessness and Hampden’s practicality with the many-minded
                  creativity of their common sire. Only three years old when his father died, he and
                  his mother were left almost destitute, dependent upon Hampden and other relatives
                  and friends.

                           principles which at length obtained ascendancy” who “appears to me unaccountably neglected.”
                           See Hofland’s letter to Mr. Hale. </span></div>
                  </div> One of these, probably a Catholic, appears to have paid for the boy’s education at
                  Stonyhurst, a highly regarded Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire that provided a
                  route by which the sons of well-to-do Catholics, who were still excluded from Oxford
                  and Cambridge, could get into London University or the Civil Service.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The little we know of Weymouth’s schooldays comes from the drama critic Percy Hetherington
               Fitzgerald in his <em>Stonyhurst Memories; or, Six Years at School </em>(1895). He was one of only a half-dozen boys Fitzgerald considered worth noting as
               “characters.” Like his father, Weymouth was a good actor, an accomplished artist,
               and something of a democratic orator: <span class="quote">‘And what odd types there were! Such was Thelwall, son of the great Radical agitator
                  and elocutionist, the friend of Charles Lamb. There was a son of Thelwall’s “speaker”
                  and I must say he inherited the parental gift and could declaim with great tragic
                  feeling. I remember his spending weeks carving a Roman head on a piece of stone with
                  a penknife, and a clever performance it was. (Fitzgerald 41)’</span> More ominously in the light of later events, Weymouth was also the “money taker”
               for bets made on the students’ cricket matches, one of which was the cause of a rift
               between Fitzgerald and Thelwall when a school-wide political feud was running based
               on divisions of loyalty during the land league agitation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Upon his departure from Stonyhurst in 1847-48, Weymouth Thelwall immediately joined
                  the Foreign Office. In 1859, whilst working as a clerk in the War Office, he married
                  Marian Wrather, firstly in a Catholic and then in an Anglican Church; and a daughter,
                  Edith Fanny Thelwall, was born in 1862.

                  </div> By October 1864, though, Weymouth had declared himself bankrupt in his own petition,
                  with debts of between two and three thousand pounds owed mostly in bills. This was
                  possibly through gambling, sign of a reckless streak that would contribute to Weymouth’s
                  unfortunate fate.

                  salary, including his annual increase, the judge accepted this “very creditable” offer
                  and made an order of discharge (“Court of Bankruptcy” 9). He is cited as living in

                     for the part he took in the political struggles at the end of the last century, and
                     who was tried for high treason and acquitted. (“Deaths” 529)’</span> Her death occurred in February, just two months after Weymouth’s bankruptcy hearing,
                  in a squalid little backstreet, Grove Place, where the cost of unfurnished rooms was
                  in the order of four shillings a week. This was a huge step down for the beautiful
                  and talented woman who had once welcomed London literati to Thelwall’s gracious house
                  in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, boasting “a capital grand piano,” fine paintings and prints,
                  a library of over six thousand books and quality mahogany furniture, all of which,
                  along with the valuable lease, had been put up for auction in 1820 (“Sales” 4). Cecil’s
                  death certificate, signed by Weymouth, states that she died “of general decay,” which
                  perhaps makes her obituary an indictment of those who had declined to offer a pension
                  to John Thelwall in later life, when the fruits of the reform movement’s early struggles
                  were beginning to be enjoyed by those who had often resisted them, including those
                  who had caused Weymouth to be dismissed.

               <p>Yet with the rakish resilience of Thelwall’s genius, Incubus, in his play <em>The Fairy of the Lake, </em>Weymouth emulated his father’s capacity for regeneration through vocational (and amorous)
                  reinvention. In 1871, the former war-office clerk reappeared in London as a landscape
                  artist, aged forty, living in Westminster; and, according to the census record, his
                  “wife” was a woman called Helena, birthplace not known, twenty-four years old and
                  a dancer.

                  </div> It is uncanny how Weymouth’s mid-life behaviour mirrored that of his father. At the
                  age of forty-two, John Thelwall had returned to London after an eight-year exile,
                  having transformed himself from a political lecturer into an elocutionist; and ten
                  years later he too took up with a much younger woman, an actress (though, unlike his
                  son, John waited until his first wife was dead before he remarried). As a painter
                  of landscapes, Weymouth resurrected the thwarted ambitions of his father, gaining
                  success, respect and even a measure of fame thereby, for his water colours were exhibited
                  at the Royal Academy, and he even appeared at court, where he presented “drawings
                  and sketches” of Norway to the Queen in 1873 (“Court Circular” 5). He also shared
                  the theatricality which was so strong a feature of John Thelwall’s personality and
                  oeuvre, as is shown by the fact that he was granted a patent in 1872 on a “theatrical
                  monster device.” Such “colossal and other figures of men, monsters, and animals, for
                  stage purposes” were popular in the pantomimes and spectacular shows of the period
                  (Rees and Wilmore 25-26). Weymouth’s might almost have been intended for <em>The Fairy of the Lake</em>, as evidenced in the play’s spectacular premiere in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in October
                  2009. </p>
            </div>
            <p>But it was not only in his amorous, artistic and theatrical passions that Weymouth
               revived the spirit of his father. During this same period, he travelled in Norway
               and contributed notes to the Norwegian Tourist Club, giving details of an intrepid
               trek across a glacial valley in extremely harsh weather, and an account of a visit
               to the Voring waterfall (“Notes and Suggestions” 104-06). Here the son of the Peripatetic
               has succeeded the youthful actor, and the painter of words also begins to flourish.
               His description of the valley, reached only after an heroic attempt to overcome the
               dangers of a hostile environment, recalls the mix of touristic sublime and socio-scientific
               pragmatism that characterized his father’s groundbreaking pedestrian excursions: <span class="quote">‘The beauties of this magnificent foss are now by no means appreciated, as visitors
                  are obliged to rush at it from Viig, reaching it tired and taking the chance of seeing
                  it at its best or its worst according to the mercy of the weather or the guides. I
                  saw it with a 3/4 rainbow spanning the whole mist filled chasm, and nothing could
                  exceed its poetic grandeur. The payments &amp;c. for guides ought also to be regulated
                  . . . . (105-06)’</span> Like his father’s mock-heroic Peripatetic dangling from cliff tops and battlements,
               Weymouth presents himself as a bold and occasionally reckless adventurer rather than
               merely a tourist, then undercuts his heroism by drawing attention to his failures
               (his ascent of the Justedal Glacier was left unfinished because he forgot to wear
               nailed boots). He also makes practical “suggestions” for “improvements” for the benefit
               of tourists, such as chiselled-out footholds, stepping stones, and cromlech-style
               route markers (107-08).</p>
            <p>While Weymouth was in Norway, back in London Helena danced, touring much of England
               with her troupe of “Hungarian” dancers and receiving good reviews. The reason that
               this is known is rather surprising. There is a fine leather-bound folio in the Foreign
               Office archives containing over forty pages of correspondence on the <em>Case of Mr Thelwall and Miss Fielding, alias Girofle. </em>It includes a note written hastily on the back of an advertising flier with newspaper
               reviews, in reply to the British Vice Consul in Moscow, where Helena had been performing
               at the Theatre Bouffe as part of the Moscow Trade Fair. The nature of Helena’s performances
               is partly elucidated by the racy account of the dancing of “Mademoiselle Froufrou,”
               published in H. A. Munro Johnstone’s <em>A Trip up the Volga to the Fair </em> <em>of Nijni-</em> <em>Novgorod.</em> Johnstone refers to the fair’s “amusements” as a “Saturnalia” and describes the riotous
               behaviour of the theatre’s cosmopolitan audience of merchants in a manner which would
               certainly have raised alarm bells for Weymouth Thelwall <em>if</em> it were not already known to him (108-09). But he seems to have had plans afoot for
               an adventurous journey of his own.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Weymouth had written to the Foreign Office in September 1875, extremely worried about

                     assistance of the foreign office in paying for her passage home and those of her troupe
                     as may need it. (At my expense of course).

                  Lord Derby and his senior civil servants, and between the said Helena and a special
                  agent who was sent from Moscow to “find her out.” She refused to return to England
                  as she had found “engagements for the Winter,” but two of her troupe wished to do
                  so, and she said she would be obliged if they could be repatriated under the distressed
                  British subjects scheme. The problem was that Weymouth objected to paying for the
                  (obviously delighted) agent sent to accompany these “helpless girls” on their perilous
                  winter journey to the coast, and despite the Vice Consul’s protests he did not pay.
                  Eventually a court order for prosecution issued from the Treasury and an agreement
                  was reached in which he promised payment of the £61 by a bill drawn on the proprietor
                  of the<em>Illustrated London News </em>on the basis of commissions for drawings he was to send from Lake Nyassa in Central
                  Africa, “should I survive the journey.”

               <p>In the “Helena Fielding” affair and its African aftermath, we see the complicated
                  conjunction of international trade and travel, colonial bureaucracy, artistic entrepreneurship
                  and sheer, stubborn recklessness that would shape the final chapter in the curious
                  life of Weymouth Thelwall. Though now an additional motive for his African journey
                  was to pay for Helena’s expenses, he seems to have had the trip in mind for some time,
                  possibly inspired in part by the heroic example of David Livingstone, whose immensely
                  popular travels, themselves displaying the same mix of commercial and cultural enterprise,
                  had ended with his death in 1873, followed by a huge state funeral at Westminster
                  Abbey (Ross 247). In addition to his contract with the <em>Illustrated London News</em>, Weymouth twice sought support from the Royal Geographical Society (where Livingstone
                  had lain in state), banking on his reputation as an artist, but also stressing the
                  philanthropic and scientific object of his journey (and name-dropping to imply he
                  had contacts in high places): <span class="quote">‘Besides my main artistic purpose, I am fitting myself to make the most of my journey

                  who had done so much to create Livingstone’s heroic reputation) and Richard Burton
                  (the heroic but rakish scholar-explorer who captivated the Victorian imagination while
                  challenging Victorian pieties), underlines the connection between the romantic idealism
                  of the early nineteenth century and the colonial and commercial explorations and exploitations
                  to which it gave birth. Just as Stanley gravitated to Livingstone, so Thelwall intends
                  to “succour” Stanley, one in a long line of peripatetic journalist-adventurers belatedly
                  following in the footsteps of charismatic father/brother-figures, whose quest leads
                  them into the moral quagmire of ambitions, expectations, opportunities, and disillusionments
                  that was colonial Africa.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The line between the Romantic peripatetic and the Victorian explorer is deepened by
               the curious coincidence that among the groups whose support Weymouth sought for his
               African adventure were Scottish dissenters whose mission was built on the same progressive
               educational foundations that John Thelwall had helped lay. Weymouth wrote to the Livingstonia
               committee of the Free Church of Scotland, which with the support of several wealthy
               Glasgow industrialists had established their first Livingstonia mission station at
               Lake Nyassa in 1875, in honour of Livingstone’s dream of educating and converting
               the African tribes he encountered, and of eradicating slavery by setting up “industrial”
               educational missions. In this endeavour, Livingstone drew on his own background as
               a working-class boy whose self-education was capped by his studies at Anderson’s College
               in Glasgow (Ross 11-13). Founded in 1796, this institution was the home of George
               Birkbeck’s famous mechanics’ classes of 1800-04, which after 1823 grew into the mechanics’
               institute movement that did so much to shape the British system of colonial education
               and industry (Kelly 26-36). This was the very institution that John Thelwall visited
               in 1804, where he and Birkbeck discussed the “operations and cooperations” that led
               to the founding of his own Institute (Letter to Anderson). Indeed, Thelwall’s lifelong
               friendship with Birkbeck is honoured in the middle name of his son. Thus in his very
               identity, Weymouth embodies the principles that Victorian colonialism inherited from
               Romantic radicalism. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Weymouth’s letters to the Livingstonia Committee also show the complex and morally
                  ambivalent geopolitical realities, commercial interests and religious tensions in
                  which this idealistic and progressive effort was tangled. For in one letter he proposes
                  “to bring 20 sniders [rifles] with me, and to form a well armed little party, as fast
                  as I can find trustworthy men,” adding that he has been a very “zealous Sergeant of
                  volunteers, having gone through the Hythe course, and hold[s] a certificate of qualification
                  as Sergeant instructor of musketry.” Moreover, he is not “without hope that the presence
                  of a Roman Catholic well accredited by his own ecclesiastical superiors may have a
                  valuable effect on the Portuguese there, as showing the united earnestness of all
                  Britain in this business” (<em>Correspondence</em> 131). The “business” was the eradication of the slave trade, still dominating the
                  local economy and culture of central Africa, by the introduction of “honest” trade
                  in ivory, and the creation of cotton plantations; but it was equally the business
                  of men like James Stevenson, the Glasgow industrialist who bankrolled much of it,
                  and was seeking new sources of trade and the opening up of mineral resources to his
                  company in a territory controlled by the Portuguese.

            <p>Thelwall got the answer he was looking for from the Livingstonia Committee; urged
               to join a reinforcement party travelling to the Cape, he gladly agreed, eager to “acquaint
               himself with all the members of the party” and to “share equitably in all expenses
               of transport etc. up to the arrival at the Nyassa Station” (<em>Correspondence</em> 131). He drafted a letter of introduction, which the committee agreed to endorse,
               stating that without taking any responsibility for the acts of an independent traveller,
               “they are of the opinion that my journey will be of valuable assistance to the object
               they have in view, and that they will therefore be glad that I shall receive all the
               support that I can legitimately secure” (<em>Correspondence </em>138). Having now had his passage paid and letters of introduction to suppliers provided,
               he planned to finance the rest of his trip by accepting commissions, and sent the
               committee a sample advertisement flier aimed at collectors and lovers of the fine
               arts, claiming that several titled dignitaries had already contributed, among them
               Lady Rothschild (<em>Correspondence</em> 138). There is, as yet, no confirmation of how many commissions Weymouth received
               or executed, but given the glow that Livingstone’s celebrity cast over the entire
               decade, it is likely that a good home market existed for the products of Thelwall’s
               African enterprise.</p>

                  had bought goods in Port Elizabeth using “the same worthless bills” that Thelwall’s
                  original correspondent on the committee, Alexander Duff, had reported to Stewart in
                  a letter. More damning, he had heard via his brother-in-law in England that Thelwall
                  had left his wife and child destitute: <span class="quote">‘He is an agreeable, plausible man but I fear not a good one . . . . I wish he could
                     be shipped home as if he goes on ordering goods without any means of paying for them

                  for January 1878 that Thelwall’s visit to the Established Church of Scotland’s Blantyre
                  Mission in the Shire Highlands had made a bad impression. Stewart had been “distinctly
                  told not to trust him.” According to Stewart, “Thelwall seemed dissatisfied about
                  something but made no complaint. He left without saying goodbye” (<em>From Nyassa</em> 49). A short time later Weymouth Thelwall was dead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Published accounts refer merely to a hunting accident. Thelwall tried to save ammunition
                  by finishing off a wounded baboon with his rifle butt. The force of the blow, however,
                  discharged the second bullet into his chest. The Livingstonia mission journal, however,
                  goes into more detail in a report given by the native porters who had been with him.
                  It tells a tale of isolation and probable despair. Whatever funds Thelwall had begun
                  with and stores he may have managed to buy initially, he was at this stage unable
                  to secure porters, who worked for lengths of calico cloth. He had been travelling
                  for about nine days out of the Livingstonia mission, in March 1878, when he camped
                  a day’s march from a village: <span class="quote">‘Further particulars from the men are to the effect that all went well until Mangombi’s
                     village was reached. From that time forward Mr Thelwall appeared in a desponding state
                     of mind. When he rested he buried his face in his hands and generally kept muttering
                     to himself. His appetite seemed to fail him and he subsisted chiefly on native beer
                     and wine. He became less active than formerly seldom rising before ten o’clock. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div>’</span> According to the men, he had risen shortly before noon and, not delaying to dress
                  (his blood-stained shirt was submitted as evidence), had armed himself and one of
                  his men with rifles and another with a fowling piece. They had then set off a hundred
                  yards to the foot of a hill to hunt baboons. Reading between the lines, it appears
                  that Thelwall may have been lacking stores, and from the account given by the two
                  Stewarts it is possible that he was not given much assistance at Blantyre. But one
                  must also suspect that Thelwall may have pondered taking his own life.</p>
            </div>
            <p>After his death, his followers trekked back to “Mponda’s village” on the lake where
               they were given a canoe to return by. They transported Thelwall’s body back there
               during a storm, but were refused permission to bury it until they paid the chief,
               Mponda, with Thelwall’s supplies of gunpowder and wine. He was buried some distance
               from the village (now a town in central Malawi) under a great baobab tree. Robert
               Laws, the leader of Livingstonia, later pulled down a Union Jack marking the grave,
               saying Mponda would use it on one of his raids (Livingstone 133-34). Thus, the last
               direct descendant of John Thelwall lies in an unmarked grave, even further off the
               beaten track of British history than his father’s gravesite in Bath, itself long-forgotten
               until Steve Poole’s recent restoration campaign. It is a far cry from the national
               honours paid to Livingstone, who had profited from the reforms that John Thelwall,
               without recognition, had helped to institute.</p>
            <p>Like his father’s, Thelwall’s fate was in some part sealed by his refusal to conform
               to contemporary pieties and proprieties. None of the missionaries who mention him
               seems to have had a good word for him, and this may have been partly due to his Catholicism.
               Edward Young, the first Livingstonia expeditionary leader and captain of the mission’s
               <em>Illala</em> steamboat, recounts the day they engaged five hundred natives to carry the reinforcement
               party’s goods to the head of the rapids in 1876. He ordered silence while they sang
               a hymn and conducted a service together <span class="quote">‘—save only—must I say it—with one exception; for an individual who had arrived out
                  from England with this missionary detachment of labourers in Christ’s field felt himself
                  debarred by conscientious scruples from doing as we did. (Young 238) ’</span> This “individual” was obviously Weymouth, but Young cannot even give his name. Like
               his father, Weymouth is almost erased from history. Yet tellingly, the liberty of
               conscience for which the Thelwall name has always stood, lives on in this record.</p>
            <p>There is very little information about what actually did come out of Thelwall’s African
               expedition. There are numerous records of the specimens he sent back: butterflies,
               lizards and plants, including some listed with his name in the catalogues of the British
               Museum and several journals of the time. Some paintings too may survive, though it
               is difficult to know which, if any, of the watercolours that anchor his continuing
               reputation as a minor English artist were among the effects sold in the months after
               his death. Like his father’s, Weymouth’s archive has been scattered and lost (and
               this includes any mementoes of his father’s that he may have carried with him). And
               yet, while neither name, nor goods, nor even an epitaph lives on, Weymouth Birkbeck
               Thelwall may have had a broader influence than we realize, in part through his very
               Catholicism (in both senses of the word). </p>
            <p>While the Scottish missionaries disapproved of his manner and morals, there is some
               evidence that Weymouth Thelwall found friends or at least sympathizers among Catholics
               in Africa. He is mentioned specifically as having influenced the setting-up of the
               first Jesuit missionary station in central Africa after he had “a long conversation”
               with Bishop James Ricards in Cape Town on his way to the Lake Nyassa mission station
               in 1876. Ricards wrote to Father Alfred Weld, another old Stonyhurst boy, enthusing
               about a plan of sending missionary priests to Lake Nyassa, which had apparently been
               Thelwall’s suggestion (Dachs and Rea 17). Likewise Frederick, Baron Lugard, gives
               Thelwall a measure of sympathy in an account written ten years after Thelwall’s death,
               by which time, as one of the few and first Europeans on Lake Nyassa, his story must
               have become part of local history. Lugard probably heard of him from Laws, with whom
               he stayed whilst leading an expeditionary force of natives for the newly formed African
               Lakes Company against Arab slave traders intent on driving out the merchants who had
               settled there. The tone is almost wistful. “On Nyassa poor Thelwall shot one [baboon]
               and was immediately attacked by the drove” (Lugard 271). This is not what happened
               according to the Livingstonia Mission journal, but it suggests that the story had
               already taken on a certain romantic, larger-than-life allure. Lugard appears to have
               had little time for the missionaries in general, but he does extol the virtues of
               Laws, whose kindliness and literary tastes are acknowledged. Laws had been absent
               from Livingstonia for some time when Thelwall died, and he heard of his death as he
               passed Mponda’s village, where Miller, one of the station’s Scottish artisans, had
               gone to see to his remaining goods. As they approached on the steamer Miller shouted
               from the shore, “Thelwall shot himself by accident.” Laws then set off for Thelwall’s
               grave. These “goods,” whatever they were, were sold at Livingstonia for fifty-eight
               pounds, five shillings and five pence in 1878, and the money was sent to Thelwall’s
               widow Marian, who signed a receipt in 1880 (<em>Correspondence </em>171).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Re-reading Conrad’s Marlow relating the story of Mr. Kurtz in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, I was struck by the characteristics which link Weymouth Thelwall with Kurtz. He
                  too is a painter, a journalist, a hunter, an idealist with “expansive views,” and
                  above all an eloquent speaker. But the overriding attraction for the younger Marlow
                  lay in Kurtz’s “<em>imagined”</em> voice. An unheard yet famous and powerful voice also links Weymouth Thelwall with
                  his father John. “He too could declaim,” says Fitzgerald of his schoolmate at Stonyhurst.
                  In the few writings that Weymouth left behind we too can “imagine” a voice, far removed
                  as it may be from his father’s fiery oratory, already turned ashen by the belatedness
                  of textuality (at least if Hazlitt is to be believed).

                  that Weymouth Thelwall, who never really knew his father, had to live with and through.
                  It is this legacy, always already lost, that he carried into Africa with him.</p>

               <p>Reading Weymouth’s story and thinking of Conrad’s Kurtz, I was reminded too of Wordsworth’s <em>Excursion,</em> and the Pastor’s depiction of a brutal and pagan Britain (bk. 9, lines 679-719), which
                  has much in common with Marlow’s reference to England as a once “dark place of the
                  earth” in the opening paragraphs of <em>Heart of Darkness</em> (33)<em>. </em>“He was a seaman but he was a wanderer too,” the frame narrator says, as Marlow directs
                  his listeners to <span class="quote">‘think of a citizen in a toga—perhaps too much dice, you know—coming out here in the
                     train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader, even, to mend his fortunes. Land
                     in a swamp, march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the
                     utter savagery had closed around him. (33) ’</span> <em>The Excursion</em> concludes with the colonial zeal of the Wanderer’s “discourse,” the same kind of “discourse”
                  that characterises the fatal attraction of Kurtz for Marlow and for his Intended,
                  who listens like the unnamed “gentle lady” to Wordsworth’s Wanderer:

                  </blockquote> This is one of the passages highlighted in John Thelwall’s own copy of <em>The Excursion</em>, part of the lifelong dialogue between himself and Wordsworth that had so strong
                  an influence on both men’s work.

                  explore Romanticism’s colonial legacies, we may discover that both Thelwall and Wordsworth
                  had more influence than we have ever suspected upon the modernist novelist who draws
                  us into to a deeper understanding of that heart of darkness that lurks in all “civilized”

            <p><em>Heart of Darkness</em> was published in 1902, two years before Charles Cestre bought John Thelwall’s papers
               at a Sotheby’s sale. In May 1903, the<em>New Zealand Tablet</em> published an article that provides an apt epitaph for Weymouth Birkbeck Thelwall,
               and a fitting summary of the circuitous route which this essay has taken: <span class="quote">‘An interesting conversion (says The London “Tablet,” March 28) took place last week.
                  Mrs Thelwall, widow of the well-known water-colour artist, Weymouth Thelwall, was
                  received into the church by the Rev. Father Coventry O.S.M. of the Fulham Priory.
                  Mrs Thelwall is herself a connection of Sir Walter Scott’s family, and her husband
                  was the youngest son of the celebrated John Thelwall, the Reformer, who together with
                  Horne Tooke and Hardy was tried for high treason in 1795. This conversion offers a
                  curious instance of the links of history. John Thelwall, the new convert’s father-in-law,
                  was the friend of Coleridge, Lamb, Hazlitt and Condorcet, and yet here is the daughter
                  in law living and hale at the dawn of the twentieth century. No man, in his time,
                  did more to advance Catholic Emancipation than John Thelwall, and, by a curious coincidence,
                  his son died a Catholic, and his grandchild is a pious Catholic, whose influence has
                  brought her mother into the fold. (“Returning to the Fold”)’</span></p>
