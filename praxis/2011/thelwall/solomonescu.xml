            <p> Almost two centuries after his death, the Romantic-period political reformer John
               Thelwall is undergoing a remarkable critical renaissance. In the past five years
               alone he has been the subject of three conferences, a four-volume selected writings,
               an inaugural collection of essays, diverse articles and chapters, a dramatic
               premiere, a special issue of the journal <title level="j">Romanticism</title>, and a
               campaign to restore his grave.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" n="1"
                  >In addition to the works and editions listed below, see the recent chapters on
                  Thelwall in Davies, Allard, and Fairer.</note> In the recent opinion of one
               scholar, Michael Scrivener, “a strong argument can be made that one does not
               understand Romanticism in sufficient depth if one has not engaged seriously the
               oeuvre of Thelwall” (<ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reviews-blog/?p=411">Rev. of
                     <title level="m">Peripatetic</title></ref>). The discovery in 2004 of a
               three-volume faircopy of Thelwall’s poetry that includes several previously unknown
               compositions, notably a satire on the leading poets of the day, makes only the most
               recent addition to that strikingly diverse oeuvre.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2"
                  place="foot" n="2">On Judith Thompson’s discovery of the volumes, see her “Citizen
                  Juan Thelwall.” This was a “discovery” for Thelwall scholars, since not even E. P.
                  Thompson appears to have been aware of the volumes’ survival. Their existence was
                  of course known to the staff of the Derby Local Studies Library, which probably
                  acquired them from the late nineteenth-century Derby printer Mr. Bemrose. The
                  volumes are listed in the <title level="m">Location Register of English Literary
                     Manuscripts and Letters: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries</title>, edited by
                  David C. Sutton, and in the online index of the National Register of Archives. For
                  the most part only the recto pages of the volumes are inscribed, although the
                  verso pages carry some emendations and, in volume 3, portions of the satirical
                  poem <title level="m">Musalogia</title>.</note> A quintessential Romantic
               polymath, Thelwall also composed political lectures and pamphlets; a controversial
               essay on the principle of life; five collections of poetry;<note resp="editors"

            <p> That these works have gone largely unremarked for so long is owing partly to their
               rarity, and partly to their author’s “radical” stigma. Along with Thomas Hardy and
               John Horne Tooke, Thelwall was a key defendant at the Treason Trials of 1794, when
               the Pitt government attempted to suppress the radical reform movement by depriving it
               of its leaders&#8212;and its leaders of their heads. (The penalty for “compassing”
               and “imagining” the king’s death was hanging.)<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4"

               defendants had been conspiring to depose the king and establish a French-style

               largely relegated to the footnotes of history until the mid-twentieth century,
               when he emerged as a hero of the British left in E. P. Thompson’s <title level="m"
                  >The Making of the English Working Class</title> (1963). Since then, he has become
               a recurrent figure in studies of late eighteenth-century political culture. Singling
               him out as the foremost republican writer in Britain after Paine’s flight to France
               in 1792, Gregory Claeys argues in <title level="m">The Politics of English
                  Jacobinism: Writings of John Thelwall</title> (1995) that Thelwall’s adaptation of
               the Lockean natural rights tradition in response to widespread poverty resulted in a
               “new vision of economic justice” that laid a foundation for the development of
               socialist and liberal thought in the nineteenth century (liii).<note resp="editors"
                  xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" n="7">On Thelwall’s “new vision of egalitarian
                  commercial republicanism,” see also Claeys, “Origins” 266. For a comparable reading of Thelwall’s part in the transition from the “nostalgic” radicalism of the
                  eighteenth century to the “progressive and forward-looking” radicalism of the
                  nineteenth, see Hampsher-Monk (20). Robert Lamb has recently consolidated the case
                  for the coherence of Thelwall’s political thought by examining his theoretical
                  defence of private property rights, particularly his seemingly contradictory debts
                  to natural rights, utilitarianism, and the Scottish Enlightenment’s “four-stages”
                  account of economic development, while Richard Sheldon has questioned the extent
                  to which Thelwall’s pro-commercial republicanism was “proto-socialist.”</note>
               Meanwhile, Thelwall’s equally innovative and prolific literary and elocutionary works
               have attracted increasing attention since the publication in 2001 of both Michael
               Scrivener’s <title level="m">Seditious Allegories: John Thelwall and Jacobin
                  Writings</title> and Judith Thompson’s edition of Thelwall’s verse-and-prose work
                  <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> of 1793. In the intervening decade,
               scholars have begun to challenge earlier dismissals of Thelwall as a “mediocre poet”
               (Thompson, <title level="m">Making</title> 172) and a prosodist-elocutionist who
               would have been “none the worse of a hanging” (Saintsbury 157). The most recent
               additions to a growing body of Thelwall scholarship include <title level="m">Incle
                  and Yarico and The Incas: Two Plays by John Thelwall</title> (2006), edited by
               Scrivener and Frank Felsenstein; the four-volume <title level="m">Selected Political
                  Writings of John Thelwall</title> (2009), edited by Corinna Wagner and Robert
               Lamb; and the collection <title level="m">John Thelwall: Radical Romantic and
                  Acquitted Felon</title> (2009), edited by Steve Poole. The latter grew out of two
               Thelwall conferences held in 2007 to mark the end of a successful campaign to restore
               his weathered gravestone in Bath, where he died of “some affection of the heart”
               while on an elocutionary lecture-tour in February 1834, age sixty-nine (“Mr.
               Thelwall”).</p>
            <p> Like the gravestone, Thelwall’s oeuvre stands in need of further attention. Indeed,
               we are only just beginning to appreciate the diversity, originality, and coherence of
               a career that spanned four decades and brought Thelwall into contact with the leading
               Romantic writers, artists, thinkers, and activists. E. P. Thompson accurately
               remarked that Thelwall “straddled the world of Wordsworth and of Coleridge, and the
               world of the Spitalfields weavers” (<title level="m">Making</title> 172). A leading
               representative of “romantic sociability,”<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8"
                  place="foot" n="8">See, for instance, Russell and Tuite’s collection by that
                  title.</note> Thelwall also belonged to overlapping Romantic circles centred
               variously around Godwin and Holcroft; the radical publishers Daniel Isaac Eaton and
               Richard Phillips; the democrat-physicians Henry Cline, Astley Cooper, and Peter
               Crompton; the Norwich intellectuals William Taylor, Anne and Annabella Plumptre, and
               John and Amelia Opie; the Derby Philosophical Society members Erasmus Darwin and
               William and Joseph Strutt; the Westminster reformers Francis Place, Francis Burdett,
               John Hobhouse, and John Cartwright; and other figures including “the disputation
               metaphysical Hazlet [<emph>sic</emph>],” “poor Gilly” [Gilbert] Wakefield, Robert
               Southey, Charles Lamb, Thomas Noon Talfourd, and Henry Crabb Robinson.<note
                  resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" n="9">For the references to Hazlitt and
                  Wakefield, see the letters by Thelwall reprinted in Davies, <title level="m"
                     >Presences </title>318, 301.</note> Yet Thelwall’s practice is not in the end
               strictly comparable to any of theirs. He drew self-consciously on all the major
               traditions and discourses of the day to create a body of work as “radical” and
               heterogeneous as the conjunction of political, medical, and cultural discourses that
               informed it. If, as Thelwall maintained, “style is the shadow of mind” (<title
                  level="m">Peripatetic</title> 71), it is notable that his was consistently humane
               and democratizing, even when repression forced him to take a vow of “inviolable
               silence” on political issues (<title level="m">Retirement</title> xxxvi). </p>
            <p>The range of Thelwall’s interests and the scope for new archival discoveries are
               manifest in a “find” I made in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert
               Museum, just as I was completing the editing of this collection: a copy of George
               Wilkins’s play <title level="m">The Miseries of Inforst Marriage</title> (1629),
               owned and annotated by Thelwall.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" place="foot"
                  n="10">The volume is listed in the library catalogue but, to my knowledge, has not
                  yet come to critical attention. See Dyce 26 Box 50/12, National Art Library,
                  Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</note> The play may have been part of the
               large library that Thelwall amassed on the success of his career as an elocutionist
               in the early nineteenth century, the contents of which were sold at auction in 1820,
               as detailed in Patty O’Boyle’s essay in this collection. In addition to underlining
               and marginal scoring, Thelwall’s copy of the play bears two evaluative notes. The
               first, written on the flyleaf and signed “J. T.” (with “John Thelwall” added by a
               different hand), praises the “witty foolery” of the first scene, “which reminds us so
               strongly of the characteristic humour of Shakespeare’s Clowns,” and regrets that
               later scenes fall short of this standard; the second note, written on the back of the
               last page, remarks that it was “miserable want of judgment in the author” not to give
               the play a “tragical catastrophe.” The volume thus adds to the growing body of
               Thelwall annotations and inscriptions&#8212;including those on Bowles’s <title
                  level="m">Sonnets</title>, Coleridge’s <title level="m">Biographia
                  Literaria</title>, and Wordworth’s <title level="m">Excursion</title>&#8212;that
               candidly supplement what we already know of his professional and personal opinions.
               The volume also suggests how Thelwall was remembered in the later nineteenth century.
               A note by Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), the literary scholar who bequeathed the play
               and thousands more works to the South Kensington Museum, identifies its previous
               owner as “John Thelwall,&#8212;a person of some talents in literature, &amp; of great
               notoriety in consequence of his having been tried for high treason.” </p>
            <p> Capitalizing on this conjunction of new material and renewed critical momentum, the
               present volume aims to help restore Thelwall to his rightful place in history and
               Romantic studies by publishing a varied selection of papers from a two-day conference
               that Judith Thompson and I co-organized at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada,
               in October 2009. “The Art and the Act: John Thelwall in Practice” sought to highlight
               the conjunction of arts and acts in Thelwall’s theory and practice, while bringing
               together the British and North American Thelwall communities in a geographically and
               historically significant location. An Atlantic midway point between the UK and the
               US, Halifax was the site of a Canadian, and more specifically Nova Scotian,
               conjunction of literature, oratory, and reform, manifest in the achievements of the
               nineteenth-century journalist and politician Joseph Howe, the inventor and speech
               scientist Alexander Graham Bell, and the adult educator and co-operative movement
               pioneer Moses Coady.</p>
            <p> Both the conference and this volume take inspiration from Thelwall’s ideal of
               unrestricted intellectual exchange in an expanded public sphere. Insisting on the
               futility of government attempts to silence the radical movement through arrests,
               surveillance, harassment, and “gagging” laws, Thelwall remarked that <quote>a sort of
                  Socratic spirit will necessarily grow up, wherever large bodies of men assemble.
                  Each brings, as it were, into the common bank his mite of information, and putting
                  it to a sort of circulating usance, each contributor has the advantage of a large
                  interest, without any diminution of capital. (“Rights” 401)</quote> Adapting
               Thelwall’s metaphor to the present day, we see <title level="m">Romantic
                  Circles</title> as the “common bank” to which scholars can each contribute their
               mite to enact “a sort of Socratic spirit” through the electronic circulation of
               ideas. This collaborative effort will, we hope, generate a “large interest” both by
               attracting a wider audience for Thelwall’s works and by taking advantage of the
               unique capacity of <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> to re-connect the
               printed word with image, voice, and gesture in the dynamic way for which Thelwall
               himself was renowned. </p>
            <p> In addition to this “Praxis” volume, the larger project <title level="m">John
                  Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments</title> will include two components in the
               “Scholarly Resources” section. “John Thelwall in Time and Text” combines a chronology
               of Thelwall’s life and times with the fullest bibliography to date of his published
               works, letters, and manuscripts. The result of a collaborative pooling of “mites” of
               information at the Thelwall conference in Halifax, this “common bank” offers a
               much-needed resource for the study of Thelwall, especially in the continuing absence
               of a modern or complete biography.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" place="foot"
                  n="11">In 1837 Thelwall’s second wife published the first volume of a posthumous
                     <title level="m">Life of John Thelwall</title>, focusing on his rise to
                  political notoriety and cutting off in 1795 with the passage of the Two Acts. The
                  projected second volume, “containing an account of his domestic history and of his
                  labours in the field of literature, and of the Science of Elocution,” was never
                  published (xii). The autobiographical “Prefatory Memoir” that accompanied
                  Thelwall’s <title level="m">Poems, Chiefly Written in Retirement</title> of 1801
                  fills in the story of his path to retirement in Wales at the end of the decade but
                  deliberately avoids open discussion of his politics.</note> We hope that it will
               be updated to reflect new discoveries and connections, perhaps in conjunction with
               biannual Thelwall conferences. </p>
            <p> The second scholarly resource to be offered here is “John Thelwall in Performance:
                  <title level="m">The Fairy of the Lake</title>,” which documents the first full
               production of a Thelwall play, his Arthurian romance <title level="m">The Fairy of
                  the Lake</title> of 1801, a politically and autobiographically resonant allegory
               of the times. A co-production by the Dalhousie University Theatre Department and the
               Halifax-based Zuppa Theatre Company, the play opened in October 2009 in conjunction
               with the Thelwall conference. Footage of the performance brings to life the oral and
               performative dimensions of Thelwall’s practice discussed in several contributions to
               this volume. The accompanying interviews explore the challenges and decisions
               involved in updating a piece of radical Romantic theatre for modern audiences, while
               the essay by Judith Thompson illuminates the <title level="m">Fairy</title>’s origins
               and literary contexts, and locates it within Thelwall’s oeuvre. </p>
            <p> Together these three components of “John Thelwall: Recovery and Reassessments” take
               advantage of <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>’ interconnected hypermedia
               platforms to offer an online equivalent to the multiple platforms erected at the mass
               meetings of the reform societies in the mid-1790s, where Thelwall’s voice reached
               thousands. (Thelwall objected to the political system of “virtual representation”
               championed by Burke, but had he known it as a digital phenomenon, he would surely
               have embraced it as yet another means of expanding the public sphere.) The
               caricaturist James Gillray’s depiction of Thelwall addressing the crowd that gathered
               in the fall of 1795 at Copenhagen Fields, outside London, has become iconic in
               studies of radical Romanticism.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" place="foot"

               the image has him declaring, “I tell you, Citizens, we mean to new-dress the

                  xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" n="13">The line is attributed to Shakespeare.</note>
               In fact he called on his audience to speak out in a “manly, determinate, and
               constitutional way” in defence of their liberties without fear of reprisals, while
               reminding them that even William Blackstone, in his <title level="m">Commentaries on
                  the Laws of England</title>, had regarded the resistance of oppression as a
               constitutional right (<title level="m">Speech-Nov</title> 19, 9). With characteristic
               rhetorical flourish he added, “it is better to have your throats cut like the Pigs
               you have been compared to, than to be hanged like the Dogs to which you have not yet
               been assimilated” (18). As Steve Poole notes in his contribution to this collection,
               Gillray depicts Orator Thelwall ambiguously: he faithfully captures Thelwall’s
               physiognomy and elevates him in dress and position above the other figures, but he
               also expresses a potentially incendiary anger in Thelwall’s clenched fists and open
               mouth. </p>
            <p> Yet firebrand orator was only one of Thelwall’s many modes and personas. Echoing
               Machiavelli, Thelwall declared that <quote>[u]niformity of principle and versatility
                  of means are perfectly reconcilable; and he who wishes to promote the public cause
                  must vary his mode of action with the change of time and circumstances: as the
                  same line of conduct may be at one time beneficial, and at another injurious.

               </quote> Following Thelwall through his diverse “modes of action” is one of the main
               challenges for Thelwall scholars today. How specifically did he adapt his practice to
               the times, and in keeping with what principles? In seeking to answer those questions,
               the essays collected here also aim to reassess existing Thelwall scholarship. </p>
            <p> Both objectives come into focus in Nicholas Roe’s opening contribution, which
               considers what factors might have drawn Thelwall westwards in the summer of 1797,
               when he made his watershed visit to Wordsworth and Coleridge in Somerset. In his
               groundbreaking 1990 essay “Coleridge and John Thelwall: The Road to Nether Stowey,”
               Roe recovered the story of a close friendship and political affinity that Coleridge
               tried later to suppress. Returning to this important moment in literary history, Roe
               now takes stock of two newly republished essays that Thelwall composed at this time:
               “A Pedestrian Excursion through Several Parts of England and Wales during the Summer
               of 1797” and “The Phenomena of the Wye, during the Winter of 1797-8.” For Roe, the
               essays’ non-chronological publication and conspicuous silence on the subject of the
               Stowey visit reflect the depth of Thelwall’s disappointment when his hope of
               friendship and intellectual fellowship among the poets failed to materialize. Roe’s
               essay thus contributes to the recent case for continuity in Thelwall’s practices
               before and after 1797, when he retreated into “exile” on a small farm in Wales, from
               which he re-emerged four years later a self-made professor of elocution and speech
               therapist. In Roe’s view, Thelwall’s excursion of 1797 did not mark a retreat from
               metropolitan radicalism so much as a reorientation toward the “more subjective
               mediated vision” of the “Wye” essay that would find fuller expression in Thelwall’s
                  <title level="m">Poems Chiefly Written in Retirement</title> of 1801.</p>
            <p> As Roe’s essay makes clear, the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Wye” essays are also
               noteworthy for giving voice to the remarkable diversity of identities that Thelwall
               adopted throughout his life and career: not only writer and orator, theorist and
               therapist, journalist and critic, but also agriculturalist, antiquarian, historian,
               economist, industrialist, painter, pedestrian, and picturesque traveller. That last,
               still largely unfamiliar persona comes to the fore in Mary Fairclough’s essay on the
               evolution of Thelwall’s engagement with the politics of the picturesque, notably in
               the “Pedestrian Excursion” and “Wye” essays. Challenging E. P. Thompson’s view that
               the essays’ “conventional rehearsals” of the discourse of the picturesque demonstrate
               Thelwall’s failure to sustain his radicalism in the face of persecution, Fairclough
               argues that they in fact carry forward an attempt begun in <title level="m">The
                  Peripatetic</title> to “rethink and recalibrate such engagement” and develop
               alternative means of “seeing” the landscape. In Fairclough’s view, Thelwall achieves
               a material exploration of the landscape and its social configurations that at least
               partially reconciles it with his political radicalism and anticipates his renewed
               public engagement in the next decade, also on materialist principles. </p>

               Molly Desjardins’s essay on the political, elocutionary, and therapeutic implications
               of Thelwall’s associationist understanding of the human mind. Reading Thelwall’s
               observations on the treatment of speech impediments in <title level="m">A Letter to
                  Henry Cline</title> (1810) alongside the earlier materialist arguments of <title
                  level="m">An Essay towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</title> (1793) and the
               associationist premises of a much later essay “On the Influence of the Scenery of
               Nature,” Desjardins calls attention to the consistency of Thelwall’s aims across
               decades and modes of action: both as a political activist and an elocutionist, she
               argues, Thelwall employed his electrifying powers of speech as a sort of “vital
               stimulus” to form and re-form associations within and between minds in an expanded
               public sphere.</p>
            <p> Thelwall’s attention to the individual body as an instrument of communication and
               microcosm of the body politic is a recurrent focus of the essays in this volume and
               of other recent scholarship.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn16" place="foot" n="16"

               Stanback’s contribution, however, a new dimension comes into view: the impaired body
               as the site of an ideological struggle that shaped modern attitudes towards
               disability over the next two centuries. Analysing Thelwall’s little-known writings on
               the treatment of speech impediments and “idiocy” in the context of the history of
               medicine, Stanback calls attention to alternative manifestations of Thelwall’s
               humanizing, democratizing ideals. At a time when attitudes toward illness and
               impairment were still inconsistent yet often pathologizing and marginalizing, she
               argues, Thelwall offered a strikingly progressive and egalitarian approach guided by
               a lingering Jacobin faith in the human capacity for self-improvement. In the process,
               Thelwall seems to have anticipated a modern definition of autism and ventured some of
               its earliest recorded descriptions. </p>
            <p> Thelwall’s interest in “the enfranchisement of the fettered organs” (<title
                  level="m">Cline</title> 9) was no doubt influenced by his own efforts to overcome
               the speech impediment for which he was nicknamed the “Lisping Orator” (Mrs. Thelwall
               40); it was also shaped by his struggles with the legal and political impediments to
               free expression imposed throughout his career. Despite both forms of impairment,
               Thelwall became renowned as a powerful speaker. His epitaph records that “[i]n his
               utterance Englishmen experienced the full beauty and energy of their native speech.
               His oratorical powers were only surpassed by his devoted zeal and unflinching efforts
               to promote the best liberties of his fellow men.” Hazlitt described Thelwall more
               ambiguously, as “[t]he most dashing orator I ever heard [. . .], a volcano vomiting
               out <title level="m">lava</title>” (264).<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn17"
                  place="foot" n="17">Hazlitt contrasted Thelwall’s fiery oratory with the “dry
                  cinders” of his printed works and described him uncharitably as “the flattest
                  writer I ever read” (264).</note> Those who objected to his politics, meanwhile,
               saw Thelwall’s oratory as a ready target for satire. He appeared in the anti-Jacobin
               novels of the day as Citizen Ego, John Bawlwell, and the regicidal Mr. Rant.<note
                  resp="editors" xml:id="ftn18" place="foot" n="18">For Citizen Ego, John Bawlwell,
                  and Mr. Rant, see Walker, Bisset, and D’Israeli respectively.</note> As Nicola
               Trott remarks of this last portrayal, so we might say of them all that they amounted
               to a second and arguably more successful trial for high treason (xii). And this
               “trial” was not confined to literature. </p>
            <p> In an unprecedented analysis of the role of visual satire in shaping Thelwall’s
               public profile, Steve Poole examines the often contrasting strategies by means of
               which loyalist caricaturists, notably James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank, “negotiated
               and accommodated” Thelwall’s uniquely recognizable features and demonstrative
               oratorical manner. A complex and ambiguous symbol of radical energy until his retreat
               to Wales in 1797, Thelwall thereafter became “a cartoon signifier of radical defeat
               and deflation.” Poole’s essay illuminates the iconography of the period as well as
               the philosophical and physiognomical debates that informed it, in which Thelwall
               himself was engaged. Taken together, Poole notes, these caricatures offer a visual
               commentary on what E. P. Thompson referred to as the hunting of the “Jacobin fox”
               (“Hunting”). Indeed, Poole regards Thelwall’s return to politics in the 1810s and
               1820s as “relatively unconvincing.” In his view Thelwall did not so much redirect his
               earlier energies as dissipate them in uncontroversial “professional” channels. </p>
            <p> Clearly, the nature and extent of Thelwall’s radicalism after 1800 remains an open
               question, and answering it demands closer attention to his later pursuits. This is
               precisely what Angela Esterhammer provides in her essay on Thelwall’s short-lived
               monthly periodical the <title level="j">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Launched on the
               model of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> after Thelwall’s cursory
               dismissal from its editorship in 1825, the <title level="j">Panoramic</title> aimed
               to continue the <title level="j">Monthly</title>’s mission of public information and
               improvement. Esterhammer shows that while observing many common journalistic
               practices of the time, Thelwall’s <title level="j">Panoramic</title> stood out for
               its international outlook and, above all, its “dialogic orientation.” In various
               ways, the <title level="j">Panoramic</title> sought to provoke quasi-conversational
               exchange with its male, middle- and working-class contributors and readers, while
               taking a more deliberately didactic approach to female readers. For Esterhammer, the
                  <title level="j">Panoramic</title> demonstrates the persistence of Thelwall’s
               commitment to public education, criticism, and unrestricted communication even as
               late as 1826. Her essay complements Michael Scrivener’s earlier analysis of
               Thelwall’s journalism in the <title level="j">Tribune</title>, the <title level="j"
                  >Champion</title>, and the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (“The
               Press”), and should also be read alongside Scrivener’s republication of several of
               Thelwall’s letters from this period, both for a sense of the
               financial aspects of his late ventures and for his pained awareness that by 1832 he
               was already slipping out of the “liberal remembrances of the now triumphing advocates
               of Reform” (“Letters” 149).</p>
            <p> Although the <title level="j">Panoramic Miscellany</title> was to be Thelwall’s last
               published work, his legacy as a writer, lecturer, artist, lover, and peripatetic
               adventurer found new and sometimes paradoxical expression in his children, and
               especially his son Weymouth Birkbeck (1831-1873). In her often surprising closing
               contribution to this volume, Patty O’Boyle reconstructs the story of the life and
               career of this “son of John Thelwall” as he continued and subverted his father’s
               talents and principles, carrying early nineteenth-century Romantic idealism into the
               colonial heart of darkness in Central Africa. By lifting the pall of anonymity that
               has long rested on this last direct descendant of John Thelwall&#8212;whose middle
               name was a tribute to the founder of the mechanics’ institutes at which Thelwall
               lectured around the time of Weymouth’s birth in 1831&#8212;O’Boyle also sheds light
               on his father’s life and achievements from a longer historical perspective. In tandem
               with the essays by Poole and Esterhammer, O’Boyle’s essay begins to address the vexed
               question of Thelwall’s eclipse and persistence in the nineteenth century. </p>
            <p> All together, the essays collected here mark both continuity and new directions in
               the rapidly emerging field of Thelwall studies. Much like Thelwall and Coleridge in
               the mid-1790s, they “answer and provoke”<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn19"
                  place="foot" n="19">The phrase, from Coleridge’s “The Nightingale,” also figures
                  in the title of Gurion Taussig’s chapter on Coleridge and Thelwall’s “oppositional
                  friendship” in <title level="m">Coleridge and the Idea of Friendship,
                     1789-1804</title> (2002). </note> each other on topics of mutual interest, notably Thelwall’s scientific materialism; his use,
               figuration, and treatment of the speaking body, both real and imagined; the
               connection between his printed and spoken words; his historical legacy; and the
               adaptability of his modes of action. In the context of the recent surge of interest
               in Thelwall, these essays also testify to the continuing relevance and appeal of his
               “radical” principles. Efforts are now underway to launch a Thelwall Society and erect
               a commemorative English Heritage “Blue Plaque” in London, where in 2014 a major Thelwall conference will explore his relation to medical science and mark the 250th anniversary of his birth. The
               launch of a <ref target="http://myweb.dal.ca/jthompso/Research/citjt.html">Thelwall

                  level="m">The Daughter of Adoption</title> (1801), and the publication of two
               monographs on his work all promise to help sustain the pace of this ongoing recovery.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn20" place="foot" n="20">Judith

                     Reformist Imagination</title>, is nearing completion.</note> If, as Steve
               Poole has noted, it can no longer be maintained that by 1800 the “Jacobin fox” was
               dead (Introduction 11), this volume and the larger network of activities to which it
               belongs confirm that Thelwall and his body of work are finally finding new life.</p>
