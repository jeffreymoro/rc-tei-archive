            </header><br/><div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the early Romantic period, John Thelwall was infamous for both his defiant volubility
                  and subsequent silencing.<span class="hi"> </span>According to E. P. Thompson, “the story of the silencing of Thelwall” (95) begins
                  in 1795 with the passage of the Treasonable Practices Act and the Seditious Meetings
                  Act and culminates with Thelwall’s decision to become a teacher of elocution—a decision
                  signaling that “nothing survived of the Patriot except his fading notoriety” (123).<span class="hi"> </span>Perhaps no portrait better captures the drastic turn in Thelwall’s career than George
                  Crabbe’s caricature of Thelwall as the radical lecturer Hammond in the verse tale <em>The Dumb Orators; or, the Benefit of Society</em> (1812).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                           History,” Scrivener, and Edwards. </span></div>
                  </div> In <em>The Dumb Orators</em>, Hammond first stupefies a Church-and-State orator using “Deist’s scorn” and “rebel’s
                  wit,” but later gets his just deserts when the political tide turns (192). Hammond,
                  who ironically earlier used “licentious words” to prove “that liberty of speech was
                  gone,” ultimately devolves into a stuttering isolate (223-24). Under the critical
                  eyes of loyalists, Hammond loses the liberty of speech that he prematurely lamented: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">I seek no favour—I—the Rights of Man!</div>
                        <div class="l">Claim; and I—nay!—but give me leave—and I</div>
                        <div class="l">Insist—a man—that is—and in reply,</div>
                        <div class="l">I speak. (455-58)</div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Though a smug parable, Crabbe’s tale had its basis in reality. Thelwall, who had overcome
                  a speech impediment of his own, lectured to thousands in the early 1790s, but by the
                  end of the decade he had been made, effectively, dumb: first by the “Gagging Acts”
                  of 1795 and then by “dwindling interest” in his public lectures (Claeys xxvii).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Thelwall discloses in A Letter to Henry Cline that he once suffered from a lisp (19).</span></div>
                  </div> Forcibly deprived of the freedom to express his political views, Thelwall changed
                  careers to become an elocutionist who sought to cure speech impediments, mutism, and
                  “moral idiocy”—conditions that had formerly been the province of “deaf and dumb” schools
                  (<em>Henry Cline</em> 124, 84).</p>
            </div>
            <p>As Thompson’s account suggests, Thelwall’s elocutionary career has frequently been
               understood as a renunciation of his revolutionary politics. Thelwall himself encouraged
               this view, claiming that his “New Profession” returned him to the “calmness of physiological
               disquisition” he had experienced as an auditor of medical lectures at Guy’s Hospital
               before he was “hurried . . . away” by the “excentric fire of youth” into politics
               (<em>Henry Cline</em> 2). Thelwall scholars such as Judith Thompson, however, have questioned this account
               and argued that Thelwall’s “speech theory emerges as part of a total system to reform
               the body politic” (“Re-sounding Romanticism” 24). Though a number of scholars have
               drawn connections between the scientific materialism that informs Thelwall’s speech
               theory and the political materialism that informs his revolutionary opinions, there
               has not yet been a thorough explanation of how Thelwall thought an “enfranchisement
               of fettered organs” would manifestly contribute to an expansion of the franchise (<em>Henry Cline</em> 9). In other words, how did Thelwall see his work as an elocutionist as a continuation
               of his work as a political activist? In this essay I begin to answer this question
               by uncovering the model of mind that guides both Thelwall’s elocutionary work and
               his political philosophy. First, I establish the model of the mind Thelwall develops
               in elocutionary texts such as <em>A Letter to Henry Cline</em> (1810). Then, I turn to Thelwall’s <em>An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality</em> (1793), an early “physiological disquisition” that provides the scientific basis
               for his model of mind and speech theory. Finally, I look at the rhetoric of Thelwall’s
               arguments in support of free association to show that Thelwall’s scientific interests
               inform both his political philosophy and his elocutionary theory.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In a recent article, Judith Thompson compares Coleridge’s conversation poems to Thelwall’s
                     and concludes that Thelwall is “more concerned with modulations of voice than associations
                     of the mind, and with building a co-responding society than with correspondent breezes”
                     (“Why Kendal?” 18).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For more on the poetic relationship between Thelwall and Coleridge, see Thompson,
                              “An Autumnal Blast.” </span></div>
                     </div> I agree with Thompson’s assessment that Thelwall, unlike Coleridge, maintained his
                     political ideals even in retirement. However, as I will show, Thelwall also maintained
                     a commitment to associationist psychology. In fact, I argue that it is precisely because
                     of his continued commitment to associationism that Thelwall was able to continue his
                     reformist agenda after he became an elocutionist. As we will see, for Thelwall modulations
                     of voice are not opposed to associations of the mind but rather depend on them. Likewise,
                     strong corresponding societies depend on strong correspondences in the brain.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thelwall explicitly attests to the power of mental associations in “On the Influence
                     of the Scenery of Nature on the Intellectual and Moral Character, as well as the Taste
                     and Imagination” (1820), an essay first published in his newspaper<span class="hi"> </span> <em>The Champion</em>. Here, many years after Coleridge rejected Hartleian thought, Thelwall continues
                     to appeal to associationist theory.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In the 1790s Coleridge had praised Hartley’s work (and even named his son Hartley).
                              But on March 16, 1801, he exclaimed that he had “overthrown the doctrine of associationism,
                              as taught by Hartley, and with it all the irreligious metaphysics of modern infidels”
                              (Letters 2: 706). Later, in his notebooks, Coleridge definitively rejected “modern
                              Hartleio-Locklean Metaphysics, with its Impressions, Ideas, and Sensations, and its
                              Jack of all Trades, Association” (qtd. in Ford 16).</span></div>
                     </div> In his essay, Thelwall refutes two anonymous writers who deny that our natural environment
                     has any influence on our intellectual or emotional identity. Thelwall rejects their
                     claims, saying that if we did not immediately see their denials as “Affectation” we
                     would pronounce them to be “the verbiage of idiotism” (74). Neglecting the importance
                     of scenery to our internal state is “idiotism” according to Thelwall because it denies
                     “the whole doctrine of associations” and turns a human being into <span class="quote">‘a sort of abstract entity whose ideas are all innate and independent of perception;
                        and whose senses are mere superfluous appendages, not ministers to his intellectual
                        perfectibility: a sort of filigree on the outside of a tea caddee, that neither contributes
                        to the flavour nor the preservation of the aromatic luxury within. (74) ’</span> Unlike the filigree, or decorative work, on the outside of a tea caddy, which plays
                     no part in keeping tea fresh, the senses are instead like the material of the caddy
                     itself, which contributes to the flavor of the tea. The metaphor is not perfect: whereas
                     the caddy isolates the tea from external influence, the senses do the exact opposite,
                     allowing exterior images and scenes to enter into, impress, and change the mind. Yet,
                     despite the imperfection of the metaphor, it nonetheless sheds light on Thelwall’s
                     model of mind and its connection to his political theory. In Thelwall’s image of the
                     mind-as-tea-caddy, perceptions associate thoughts and, through progressive influence,
                     lead a person toward (or away from) what he calls “intellectual perfectibility” (“On
                     the Influence” 74). Whereas Wordsworth famously illustrated the integration of mind
                     and nature by tracing “the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement”
                     (597), Thelwall used associationism to provide philosophical evidence that lived conditions
                     and intercourse with others influenced how citizens experienced their world and, in
                     turn, influenced their ability to contribute to that world.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is fitting that Thelwall, who sought to explain vitality itself according to “the
                     simple principle of materialism,” would imagine the mind as a tangible object and,<span class="hi"> </span>moreover, as an object of commerce (<em>Animal Vitality</em> 13). By taking the “necessary luxury” of tea as his image, Thelwall universalizes
                     what would normally be a private possession.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Thelwall suggests that though the mind, like tea, is a material object, it is not
                     a commodity and does not gain value when locked against external influence.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In 1833, Thomas Wontner warned his readers that caddies should be locked to protect
                              tea from being stolen by servants (704). Caddies often had locks for expressly this
                              purpose. </span></div>
                     </div> On the contrary, he suggests that intellectual perfectibility is only possible when
                     there is associative communication between the permeable borders of mind and world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In his elocutionary treatises, Thelwall similarly represents the minds of those with
                  speech defects as imperfect because of their impermeability. In both cases, mental
                  associations are “ministers to . . . intellectual perfectibility” and, as such, can
                  either create or inhibit a relationship between the body of the individual and the
                  body politic (“On the Influence” 74). A speech defect occurs, Thelwall posits, when
                  the mind cannot associate the intention to speak with the physical organs that produce
                  speech. Those who want to talk simply cannot. Unlike many physicians of the time,
                  Thelwall vehemently denies that “defects of organization have any thing to do with
                  any of the various descriptions of Impediment” in speech (<em>Henry Cline</em> 54). Rather, Thelwall blames speech impediments on a “diseased association” of ideas
                  brought on by miseducation or emotional trauma (<em>Henry Cline</em> 59). By proposing that speech pathology originates in the space between ideas, or
                  in the mental action connecting ideas, Thelwall can also propose that such pathology
                  requires educational, rather than medical, intervention. While this theory helped
                  Thelwall market his services as a teacher of elocution, it also helped him to suggest
                  that impediments to speech were also impediments to sociability, and ultimately, to
                  participation in the public sphere.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The gravest consequence of speech impediments, for Thelwall, was the enforced antisociality
                     that they caused. In his case study of a young woman with a severe speech defect,
                     Thelwall’s goal was not to teach her to speak properly but to “rescue her from the
                     misery of being in eternal solitude, even in the midst of society” (64). According
                     to Thelwall, speech impediments were necessarily restrictive to sociality for two
                     reasons. Not only did they keep a person from being able to speak, but they also impaired
                     a person’s willingness to speak.

                     </div> Both prevented individuals from developing bonds with society. Thelwall went so far
                     as to call speech impediment a kind of idiocy, a term used in the period for a variety
                     of mental disorders that interfered with sociality. In his letter to Cline, Thelwall
                     exclaimed: “What, but a species of idiotcy [sic], is it, to be ignorant of the means
                     by which the will is to influence the simplest organs of volition, and (without excuse
                     of palsy, stricture, or organic privation) to be unable to move a lip, a tongue, or
                     a jaw?” (68). It is telling that Thelwall chose to call all individuals with speech
                     defects “idiots” (Gk. “private person”), as the private, or isolated, “idiot” was
                     necessarily excluded from the public sphere.<span class="hi"> </span>As Avital Ronell explains, from Plutarch through the nineteenth century, “the term
                     ‘idiot’ expresses social and political inferiority; it is not a certificate of citizenship—the
                     idiot is the one who is not a citizen (<em>politēs</em>)” (41).<span class="hi"> </span>Without the ability to associate the will to speak with the organs of speech, individuals
                     with speech defects could not exercise their natural right of participatory citizenship.
                     This right, Thelwall declared, “constitutes the essential attribute of our species”
                     (<em>Henry Cline</em> 17). One of the major tenets of Thelwall’s political philosophy was that “man is,
                     by his very nature, social and communicative” and “whatever presses men together . . . is
                     favorable to the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately promotive of human liberty”
                     (<em>Rights of Nature</em> 400).<span class="hi"> </span>For Thelwall, individuals who could not communicate with others were unnaturally denied
                     social freedom. To put it simply,<span class="hi"> </span>impediments to speech were also impediments to liberty.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Thelwall described the process by which the teacher of elocution could cure the antisociality
                  of his pupils and encourage them to rejoin society as follows: <span class="quote">‘restore, or produce those essential links of association, between the physical perception
                     and the mental volition, and between the mental volition and the organic action, which
                     either have some how been broken, or have never properly been formed—and the stammerer,
                     the stutterer, the throttler, the endless reiterator, and almost the whole order of
                     unfortunate persons, whose impediments consist in obstructed utterance, are relieved
                     from their affliction: no matter what were the original circumstances that broke,
                     or interrupted those associations . . . . (<em>Henry Cline</em> 58)’</span> However, Thelwall advised that in order to repair a pupil’s associative capacity,
                  the teacher first had to “impress the [pupil’s] perceptive faculty” by appealing to
                  her “imagination” (<em>Henry Cline</em> 58-59). In his case studies, Thelwall accomplished this by making his pupils verbally
                  request the things they desired. Too often, Thelwall explained, a child with a speech
                  defect would have her needs predicted and met without having to open her mouth. The
                  harmful consequence of this was that she never learned to regard intelligible speech
                  as a useful means of satisfying her desires, and as a result, often avoided speaking
                  at all. The teacher’s first task, then, was to compel the pupil to communicate. To
                  do so, Thelwall used “attractive object[s]” to awaken the pupil’s imagination and
                  “impress” her perception by forcefully directing her attention to objects in the world
                  (115). For example, if a pupil liked to gather honey, Thelwall required her to make
                  her goal known to others before she would be allowed to travel to the beehive. She
                  had to be prevented from using “the mute effort of solitary ingenuity” to meet her
                  goal (124). Rather, her goal had to be “socially presented, as a motive for some proper
                  species of exertion” (124). Thelwall believed that by exerting themselves in social
                  interaction, pupils would be forced to unite objects of perception (such as honeycombs)
                  with ideas of those objects and, eventually, with intelligible signifiers for those
                  ideas. Thelwall maintained that if a pupil could consciously make links between perception
                  and will through speech (however imperfect) she would also unconsciously create or
                  repair associations in the brain. With re-formed associations, the pupil would then
                  be able to<span class="hi"> </span>associate the will and the body. She would be able to connect her desire to move her
                  jaw with the muscles that moved her jaw and, thus, produce more perfect speech. Here,
                  as in the example of the tea caddy, Thelwall used associationism to explain how perception
                  of the external world influenced the will, which, in turn, bound the individual to
                  the world.<span class="hi"> </span></p>

               <p>In attempting to strengthen the power of mental associations in his pupils, Thelwall
                  was in a sense continuing his earlier efforts to strengthen the power of reformist
                  associations. In <em>Animal Vitality</em>, Thelwall revealed the physiological basis of his associationist philosophy. Most
                  notably, he established a materialist model of the mind that made it synonymous with
                  the brain. As Alan Richardson has shown, the 1790s, like the 1990s, were “a decade
                  of the brain,” in which models of the mind were revised in response to materialist
                  advances in medicine and philosophy (2). The 1790s saw Joseph Priestley popularize
                  David Hartley’s physiological associationism (1790), Erasmus Darwin theorize the embodied
                  mind in <em>Zoonomia</em> (1794‑96), and Luigi Galvani publish his initial theory of animal electricity (1791).
                  Thelwall was well aware of these major developments in brain‑mind science and evidenced
                  this awareness in his writings.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of Thelwall’s central goals in <em>Animal Vitality</em> was to disprove John Hunter’s theory that blood is the source of life. Instead, Thelwall
                     asked his colleagues to consider that the “life of the animal is in the brain, rather
                     than in the blood” (15). Although Thelwall indicated the primacy of the brain as an
                     organ that registered vitality, he made it clear he did not want to “rob the blood
                     of its vital honours, to bestow them on the Brain and Nerves” (29). Rather, Thelwall
                     contended, vitality issued from integrated bodily organization motivated by a stimulus
                     and identified the stimulus as the “electric fluid” (41). In suggesting that the electric
                     fluid stimulated life, but was not itself living, Thelwall likely followed Erasmus
                     Darwin, of whose work he was clearly aware.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In a 1795 political lecture, Thelwall praised “the sublime projects of Dr. Darwin”
                              (Tribune 114). He also discussed Darwin’s theory of life with Coleridge (Letters 1:
                              294).</span></div>
                     </div> <span class="hi"> </span>In his medical treatise <em>Zoonomia</em>, Darwin claimed that “the electric fluid may act only as a more potent stimulus exciting
                     the muscular fibres into action, and not supplying them with a new quantity of the
                     spirit of life” (1.12.83). For Darwin, the word “stimulus” referred not only to the
                     “application of external bodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres . . . [but
                     also to] desire or aversion when they excite into action the power of volition; and
                     lastly, the fibrous contractions which precede association” (1.2.13). The electric
                     fluid induced both muscular contraction and mental association. As Darwin put it,
                     just as successive muscular contractions are associated with one another, ideas “are
                     associated with many other trains and tribes of ideas” through excitation of the fibrous
                     tissue in the body induced by the electric fluid (1.9.60). Thelwall seems to have
                     agreed that the electric fluid was responsible for super-inducing absent associations
                     or repairing broken ones.<span class="hi"> </span>In his elocutionary texts, he stressed “the phenomena of the action and re‑action
                     of the physical and mental causes—and the operation, in particular, of mental, moral,
                     and educational stimuli upon the frame and fibre—the senses and the organic function”
                     (<em>Results of Experience </em>172). For the most part, the educational stimuli chosen by Thelwall was his own speech.
                     Like the electric fluid, his speech was meant to excite the body of his listener into
                     creating new associations. Because Thelwall claimed that “the individual body and
                     the social body do exactly agree,” it is reasonable to conclude that he understood
                     the speech of the political activist, like the speech of the elocutionary master,
                     as a vital stimulus (<em>Tribune</em> 114).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Indeed, much the same model of mind surfaces in Thelwall’s political rhetoric. Just
                     as the voice of the teacher of elocution re-formed associations in the minds of his
                     listeners, the voice of the political orator reformed how his listeners associated
                     with one another. As Nicholas Roe, Michael Scrivener, and others have noted, Thelwall
                     used his medical knowledge to create particularly effective Jacobin analogies between
                     a vital, organized human body and a vital, organized body politic.

                     </div> To this I would add that it is the logic of associationist psychology that informs
                     these analogies and makes them viable. In <em>The Natural and Constitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage,
                        and Freedom of Association </em>(1795) Thelwall takes up the question of social association itself. Here, Thelwall
                     argues for free association between citizens as the only means by which the power
                     of the body politic can fairly counter the power of the king. Thelwall explains: <span class="quote">‘For as the Royal Power is concentrated in a single person, girt and surrounded by
                        Ministers of his own appointment; and as the aristocratic body is also intimately
                        encorporated, if the people are not permitted to <em>associate</em> and <em>knit themselves together</em> for the vindication of their rights, how shall they frustrate attempts which will
                        inevitably be made against their liberties? The scattered million, however unanimous
                        in feeling, is but chaff in the whirlwind. It must be <em>pressed together</em> to have any weight. Deny them the right of <em>association</em>, and a handful of powerful individuals, united by the common ties of interest, and
                        grasping the wealth of the Nation, may easily persevere in projects hostile to the
                        wishes, and ruinous to the interests of mankind . . . . (46, emphasis added)’</span> In this passage, Thelwall opposes the body of the King to the body of the people;
                     the King’s power is consolidated in one physical body, and the power of the aristocracy
                     is similarly “encorporated.” The people, however, lack such incorporation. As a consequence,
                     Thelwall maintains, they must be given the freedom to associate in order to have the
                     weight of a healthy body that can confront the power of the king man to man, as it
                     were. James Robert Allard connects this passage to a similar passage in <em>Rights of Nature </em>to suggest that, “Thelwall again implies that <em>organization</em>, ‘press[ing] men together’ is necessary for reform” (72, emphasis added), However,
                     it is clear here that<span class="hi"> </span>what presses men together is <em>association</em> rather than <em>organization</em>. Though “organization” and “association” can be used interchangeably as nouns to
                     mean “a body of people with a particular purpose” (“Organization,” def. 4a), as we
                     saw in <em>Animal Vitality</em>, “organization” for Thelwall means the arrangement of elements within a larger system,
                     such as organs in the body. But by “association,” as it is developed here and in the
                     elocutionary texts,<span class="hi"> </span>Thelwall likely means the <em>act</em> of people coming together to form a group with a common purpose. That is, only when
                     citizens are allowed to gather together in the same space can they achieve what Georgina
                     Green calls “embodied communication” (80). Although distinguishing between arrangement
                     and act may seem like a minor point, it allows us to differentiate between the material
                     structure of a system and the stimulus that joins together the elements of that system,
                     allows communication between them, and thus vitalizes the whole.<span class="hi"> </span>For Thelwall, it is not so much the structure that vitalizes the state, but the dynamic
                     connections between people within that structure. As in the body, these dynamic connections
                     are figured as material associations and, as we will see, the stimulus is figured
                     as electricity. With the passage of the Seditious Meetings Act (which prohibited public
                     meetings of over 50 people), associations became “diseased” and the speech of the
                     citizens as “one heart, one voice, one sentiment” became as defective and antisocial
                     as that of the individuals Thelwall would later treat (“Peaceful Discussion” 226).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The cure for the diseased associations of society, as for the diseased associations
                  of the individual, was the intervention of a political teacher who could communicate
                  the electric stimulus to his listeners. Noel Jackson persuasively suggests that, for
                  Thelwall, the stimulus or electric spark that animates the state and keeps it vital
                  is the printed press. As evidence, Jackson cites Thelwall’s development of Burke’s
                  metaphor of the press as an electrical conductor.<span class="hi"> </span>Burke regretted that the press encouraged middle-class ambition by carrying “electrick
                  communication” throughout pre-revolutionary France (186). But Thelwall esteemed “that
                  prompt conductor and disseminator of intellect, the press,” for the same reason (<em>Rights of Nature</em> 426). Moreover, Thelwall represented himself, and the press, as the instruments through
                  which “electrick communication” traveled. Although Thelwall thought the printed word
                  was important for associating people, he also made it clear that the press had limited
                  efficacy when people were “scattered” throughout Britain and not allowed to gather
                  in the same space (<em>Natural Right</em> 46). Thelwall cautioned that without the ability to publicly associate and, as a
                  group, determine a course of action, people would be driven to form factions and exchange
                  violent crime for peaceful protest. Without “<em>public association,</em>” Thelwall warned, there would be “<em>private cabals</em>” (<em>Natural Right</em> 46). Without the ability to speak with a collective voice, individuals would brood
                  “over thoughts they dare not utter” (<em>Natural Right</em> 46). When Thelwall used his lectures to rouse “a sluggish and insensate people” from
                  a “drowsy stupor, creeping over the frozen nerve of misery,” then, he did not so much
                  suggest that the materiality of the printed word educated people by acting on their
                  bodies, but rather that the spoken word carried a material current that allowed electricity
                  to move freely from body to body (<em>Rights of Nature</em> 391). As in his account of a 1795 political lecture where “every sentence darted
                  from breast to breast with electric contagion” (qtd. in C. Thelwall 367), Thelwall
                  represented his sentences as electric because they associated word to thought and
                  speaker to listener. Like the electric fluid acting on the animal body, the electric
                  word sustained vitality by catalyzing associations in the body politic. This vital
                  transmission was only possible when people were allowed to come together in the same
                  space to speak and to hear others speak.</p>
               <p>As an orator, Thelwall intervened between his listeners’ perceptions and their wills
                  in order to reform the associations of the state’s diseased body. As a teacher of
                  elocution, he extended his reformist associationism. Far from being the dumb orator
                  Crabbe mocked, Thelwall instead continued to encourage free speech and defeat antisociality.
                  Antisociality, which could stem from “regret, repining melancholy, and dissatisfaction,”
                  impeded reform because the “man who considers himself as an isolated individual .
                  . . [becomes] barren to himself and injurious, or at least unproductive, to society”
                  (<em>Tribune</em> 224-5). This antisociality, Thelwall claimed, was a by-product of “the selfish system”
                  of an increasingly capitalist economy and was only exacerbated by the prohibition
                  against public meetings (<em>Tribune</em> 224). Like those restricted from speaking because of governmental legislation, those
                  with speech impediments suffered from “diseased associations” that hindered them from
                  contributing to public discourse (<em>Henry Cline</em> 59). As Michael Scrivener has shown, for Thelwall, “mind is not individualistic but
                  a product of ‘associated intellect’ within the public sphere” (181). Thus, once we
                  understand Thelwall’s material model of mind, we see that ministering to the speech
                  defects of others was a political act. As a teacher of elocution and as a political
                  activist, Thelwall was pursuing a common end: strengthening the associations of the
                  minds that inhabited, and created, the public sphere.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In the 1790s Coleridge had praised Hartley’s work (and even named his son Hartley).
               But on March 16, 1801, he exclaimed that he had “overthrown the doctrine of associationism,
               as taught by Hartley, and with it all the irreligious metaphysics of modern infidels”
               (<em>Letters</em> 2: 706). Later, in his notebooks, Coleridge definitively rejected “modern Hartleio-Locklean
               Metaphysics, with its Impressions, Ideas, and Sensations, and its Jack of all Trades,
               Association” (qtd. in Ford 16).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               tea from being stolen by servants (704). Caddies often had locks for expressly this

               (<em>Tribune</em> 114). He also discussed Darwin’s theory of life with Coleridge (<em>Letters</em> 1: 294).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
