                     “Paper Promises: Restriction, Caricature, and the Ghost of Gold”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The surge of scholarly interest in Romantic literary forgery has overlooked the impact
                  of financial forgery on Romantic-era politics and culture. This essay uses James Gillray’s
                  <em>Midas</em> (1797) and William Hone and George Cruikshank’s <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> (1819) as the basis for an investigation of the cultural and political repercussions
                  of the 1797 Bank Restriction Act. The decision of Pitt’s government to end payment
                  in gold and flood the economy with paper money was deeply unpopular. To begin with,
                  it was seen as an act of fiscal incompetence and incontinence, as can be seen in Gillray’s
                  scatological vision of Pitt as an inverted Midas figure showering the nation with
                  cheap banknotes. Secondly, the Restriction Act led to a massive hike in executions
                  for banknote forgery. The Bank of England’s prosecution of lower-class offenders provoked
                  a public outcry at both the unreality of paper money and the harshness of the penal
                  code. Cruikshank and Hone’s response to this controversy was the Bank Restriction
                  Note, a mock banknote in which the normal symbols of the state have been replaced
                  with macabre gallows humour. The essay concludes by proposing that caricature (sheets
                  of paper satire) was the perfect medium for ridiculing the dubious authenticity of
                  paper currency which was no longer anchored in the ‘real’ value of gold and silver.</p>

                     “<em>Emma</em> and Bank Bills: Romanticism and Forgery”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In his review of <em>Emma</em> Walter Scott comments that Harriet Smith’s "facile affections" are transferred "like
                  a bank bill by indorsation." The metaphor is doubly apt: it sums up Harriet while
                  pointing to a peculiar feature of Austen’s <em>Emma</em>—its reliance on economic language to prosecute its themes. This reliance is not accidental
                  but an expression of a fundamental aspect of Romantic-era culture: the consistent
                  juxtaposition of contingency with an imagined "gold standard" that gives such contingency
                  meaning. This essay argues that Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em> offers the reader a complex reflection on the interpenetration of economic and aesthetic
                  systems of value that developed in the aftermath of the suspension of cash payments
                  in 1797.</p>

                     “Knowledge Against Paper: Forgery, State Violence and Radical Cultural Resistance
                     in the Romantic Period”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay firstly examines the strategy of radical education in the early nineteenth-century
                  plebeian public sphere around the issue of paper money, illustrated by William Cobbett
                  in his article series "Paper Against Gold," published in the <em>Political Register</em> during 1810-11. Cobbett’s role as a counter-hegemonic intellectual in the series
                  and the conception of popular knowledge it championed is highlighted, in part through
                  his attempts to expose the complex workings of the wider financial system he described
                  as a "place . . . of a sort of mysterious existence; a sort of Financial Ark; a place
                  not, perhaps, to be touched, or even seen." The second part of the essay demonstrates
                  how this form of critical publicity was transformed in the postwar years into an active
                  project of resistance against the worst abuses of the paper money system, culminating
                  in Cobbett’s "puff out" campaign in the <em>Register</em> to materially undermine Bank of England paper currency and T.J. Wooler’s print protests
                  in <em>The Black Dwarf</em> directly confronting the enforcement of the "bloody code" in the capital forgery
                  trials of late 1818. This postwar print campaign against the paper money system illustrates
                  key aspects of the wider radical intellectual project in the plebeian public sphere,
                  highlighting how the radical press "converted" popular public debate into a new form
                  of cultural currency in the Romantic period, a currency that emblematized a continuing
                  concern for the material welfare of its readers and listeners in the face of a corrupt
                  and bloody political and economic system.</p>

                     “Walter Scott and the Financial Crash of 1825: Fiction, Speculation, and the Standard
                     of Value”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Although radicals and economists had been attacking the fiscal “speculation” of the
                  credit economy since the seventeenth century as akin to forgery and theft, many conservative
                  commentators on Britain’s financial affairs embraced it as the source of the heroic
                  and imaginative power of debt and credit. This essay reads Walter Scott’s <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther and The Chronicles of the Canongate</em> as “speculative” responses to the financial crisis of 1825. Following a period of
                  intense economic expansion, primarily in Latin America and mostly based on highly
                  speculative development plans, and facing a sudden loss of confidence in the banking
                  sectors, the British government and the Bank of England tested various forms of economic
                  diversification. Rather than assuming total responsibility for the new debt loads,
                  the banks, supported by legislation, converted it into a variety of repayment and
                  deposit schemes in smaller institutions, including, for the first time, bank branches.
                  But in Scotland, such schemes also entailed replacing an autonomous and thriving financial
                  community. In the letters, Scott attempts to revive the idea of “speculation”—which
                  I define as both an act of imagination and an act of seeing—against English models
                  of economic diversification. <em>Chronicles</em> documents the failure of this speculative economy and replaces it with a tenuous
                  if critical mode of socio-economic comparison.</p>
