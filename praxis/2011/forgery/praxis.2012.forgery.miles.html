               <p>Reviewing Austen’s <em>Emma</em> Walter Scott sums up the denouement like this: <span class="quote">‘Mr. Woodhouse’s objections to the marriage of his daughter are overpowered by the
                     fears of housebreakers, and the comfort which he hopes to derive from having a stout
                     son-in-law resident in the family; and the facile affections of Harriet Smith are
                     transferred, like a bank bill by indorsation, to her former suitor, the honest farmer,
                     who had obtained a favourable opportunity of renewing his addresses.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)

                     </div>’</span> Scott’s financial metaphor is deeply apt. In Emma’s speculative imagination, Harriet
                  Smith is the illegitimate offspring of aristocratic, Whig capital, of “nobility or
                  wealth,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> rather than what she proves to be, the natural daughter of a modest “tradesman” (403).
                  Harriet’s history is introduced through what the reader will come to realize is free
                  indirect discourse: “Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody
                  had placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had lately
                  raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder” (68). Somebody,
                  or a nobody: the antithetical possibilities vary as we imagine the voice Emma’s, or
                  Knightley’s, or, indeed, Emma’s, retrospectively, once chastened by experience. In
                  the interim Harriet circulates like a bank bill whose questionable legitimacy is deepened
                  by the facility of her transference. I shall be arguing that the financial metaphors
                  that pervade <em>Emma</em>, including the one perceptively noted by Scott, are not a fortuitous aspect of the
                  novel, but a product of forces that may be said to be constitutive of Romanticism
                  itself. My argument is based on the following thesis: the conceptual field in which
                  forgery finds itself placed is not Romanticism’s repressed secret but rather its enabling
                  condition. In <em>Emma</em>’s case, the suspicions that attach to readily-endorsed bank bills have their origins
                  in a newly shaped “social imaginary” coming to terms with “discounting” (inflation),
                  paper money, and unbacked securities: phenomena following on from the suspension of
                  cash-payment in 1797.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The term “social imaginary” derives from Charles Taylor’s <em>Modern Social Imaginaries</em>. Taylor’s ultimate aim in this book is to substantiate his thesis that we had best
               speak of multiple modernities rather than a single, uniform one; that <em>pace</em> the World Bank, putting in place a modern economy is not simply a matter of pulling
               on the usual policy levers. In each culture a unique social imaginary is at work,
               producing inevitable difference. The social imaginary refers to the way—analogous
               to Benedict Anderson and communities—we imagine a moral order, including that which
               legitimates it. Taylor aims to reveal the historical uniqueness of the social imaginary
               of the West over the last four hundred years, to those of us who live within it, where
               our social imaginary has become second nature, and unless prodded into introspection,
               invisible.</p>
            <p>The broad transition Taylor has in mind, is from “Platonic-modeled orders of hierarchical
               complementarity” to a contingent model whose “two main ends, security and prosperity,
               are now the principal goals of organized society (12, 13-14). In contradistinction
               to the former, “the modern order gives no ontological status to hierarchy or any particular
               structure of differentiation” (12). Taylor refers to modern liberalism rising from
               the natural law theories of Grotius and Locke, to the imagining of societies composed
               of equal free agents who pool sovereignty in order to advance individual goals, en
               masse. We tend to think of such individualism as inherently atomistic, but as Taylor
               notes, in its original conception private ends and public goods found themselves in
               a balanced, productive tension, as it is only through the latter (including, notably,
               security) that the former may be realized. </p>
            <p>If one were thinking of the modern, Western, moral order as a system, it would be
               “structuralist” in that no element would have an a priori meaning, but gains significance
               as it furthers or hinders the ultimate goals of prosperity and security. Originally
               the preserve of a few philosophers, the ideas underlying the modern Western order
               migrate “from one niche to many, and from moral theory to social imaginary” (6). However,
               remarkably, a third axis is at work. Summing up his distinctions, Taylor notes “that
               an idea of moral or political order can either be ultimate”, as in eschatology, “or
               for the here and now, and if the latter, it can either be hermeneutic or prescriptive”
               (7). The modern idea of order begins as a hermeneutic inquiry into the origin and
               nature of the “unquestioned legitimacy” underlying governments. But over time the
               “hermeneutic of legitimation” found in natural law theory travels along its axis towards
               prescription, so that notions of fundamental equality between social agents and the
               consensual nature of legitimacy become ethical constraints, taking on revolutionary
               force in the process. </p>
            <p>Taylor employs the term “social imaginary” because he wants to avoid the idealist
               pitfalls of “culture” and “ideology”, both of which he sees as covertly teleological.
               His definition is worth attending to: <span class="quote">‘By social imaginary, I mean something much broader and deeper than intellectual schemes
                  people may entertain when they think about social reality in a disengaged mode. I
                  am thinking, rather, of the ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit
                  together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations
                  that normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these
                  expectations. (23)’</span> Taylor’s project is emphatically not a history of ideas (although it may be mistaken
               for such at first glance). He does not believe that natural law theory accounts for,
               or explains, the Western modern order. The task of explanation, rather, would fall
               on why the theory moved along its “three axes” into the Western social imaginary,
               from few to many, abstraction to practice, hermeneutic to prescription. While Taylor
               argues that the materialist substrate is an essential part of the story, arguments
               predicated on materialism as the primum mobile inevitably traduce the complexity of
               the process. By the same token “culture” is an unhelpful metaphor, suggesting, as
               it does, something contained, with a singular axis of causality, of a medium in which
               agents act on objects (think petri dish). Taylor’s preferred term is “background”,
               a philosophical concept meaning “that largely unstructured and inarticulate understanding
               of our whole situation, within which particular features of our world show up for
               us in the sense they have. It can never be adequately expressed in the form of explicit
               doctrines because of its unlimited and indefinite nature”. Hence the need to speak
               of an “imaginary” rather than a “theory” (30).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Romantic era looms large in all of Taylor’s many accounts of the history of the
                  instantiation of what is now a salient aspect of our social imaginary, something we
                  familiarly know as the “economy“.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> For Taylor it is a period of late transition and early consolidation, and therefore
                  Janus faced. Thus <em>Emma</em>, which contains at once “hierarchical complementarity” and the new moral order of
                  equal acquisitive agents, a tension comically evident, as we shall discover, in Emma’s
                  transparent snobbery. So when I say that in <em>Emma</em> suspicions attaching to readily-endorsed bank bills ramify within a newly shaped “social
                  imaginary”, I mean a process that goes very deep.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The point can be illustrated through an argument Lynn Hunt makes about how, for the
               population at large, the French Revolution was mediated through the family romance
               (Hunt). Prior to the Revolution the king was commonly regarded as the father of the
               nation; by the same token his subjects were his children. The point Hunt stresses
               is that within the social imaginary the relationship pulsed with literal, rather than
               figurative, force. </p>
            <p>Within the Pre-Revolutionary mentality, legitimacy was a concrete affair, insofar
               as it could be materialized as blood. The shift to thinking of citizenship and state
               legitimacy in abstract terms, as matters of universal principles and rights, or, indeed,
               as the expression of Rousseau’s “general will”, was, indeed, revolutionary. In support
               of her argument Hunt provides evidence of the profound disorientation of the common
               citizenry, who felt bereft, indeed “orphaned”, by the king’s execution; they had severed
               connections with a visible “father”, and were now at sea with a host of abstractions.
               In Taylor’s terms the transition was from a previous model of “hierarchical complementarity”,
               concretely instantiated in the king’s body, haloed by an ontological investment, to
               a new order predicated on the universal human rights of equality, security and prosperity,
               so that we may concur with Saree Makdisi who argues, along with Burke, that Jacobins
               were the advanced guard of economic liberalism (Makdisi). The point of introducing
               Hunt’s perspective, is that it cues us into what this crisis in the social imaginary
               meant at the level of narrative: an explosion of stories of families and fathers,
               rebellions and repressions, unities and disunities, in which the paternal figure was
               divested of its ontological aura through the father’s endlessly repeated symbolic
               decapitation in the Gothic plots of the Minerva school; plots turning on sons and
               daughters somehow prevailing in their quest to marry in accordance with their emotional
               needs, rather than the family’s dynastic ambitions (Miles 2002). In Freudian terms,
               it’s as if contemporary readers administered their own talking cure, vicariously experienced
               through endless symbolic repetitions of the new order’s primal scene where abstract
               right was conceived (in the daughter’s stubborn adherence to her love), and the king’s
               body dispatched (in the father’s failure to impose his will), the whole psychomachia
               mediated through the cultural debris of an exploded feudal system. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I want to argue that the change in the social imaginary attendant upon the suspension
                  of cash payments was equally far reaching, as value lost its concrete embodiments
                  in favour of abstract promises: where there used to be stamped portions of precious
                  metal, there were now paper bank notes unsecured by specie. This was hardly a phenomenon
                  anyone could have missed, who lived through it. Prior to the suspension country banks
                  were prohibited from issuing notes smaller than five pounds, while the Bank of England
                  had none smaller than ten. According to John Clapham’s history of the Bank of England,
                  up until 1797 “Englishmen of the rank and file—wage-earners and small traders—knew
                  little of paper money” (Clapham 2-3). Over a period of twenty years paper or its substitutes
                  replaced traditional coins: “Gradually the age became one of bank notes and tradesmen’s
                  tokens and Spanish dollars stamped with the head of King George III and put into circulation
                  by the Bank in England” (Clapham, 4). There was an explosion of country banks, made
                  possible by the relaxation in the rules governing the supply of money (an explosion
                  involving Austen’s brother, Henry). The surge in the supply of money was in turn linked
                  to a rapid cycle of boom and bust, of speculative fevers momentarily cured by bone-numbing
                  recessions. The journals were filled with the “bullion controversy”—with the first
                  finest hour of the dismal science, as it came to grips, conceptually, with the underlying
                  causes of boom and bust, “inflation” and “deflation” (as yet, not the common currency
                  of economic discussion). Meanwhile, the suspension was a forger’s charter. When bank
                  notes were of large denomination, counterfeiting was difficult, as palming-off a dodgy
                  note was an act you did up close and personal: only with the emergence of small notes
                  in common and daily use could you anonymously slip them into circulation, and then
                  disappear; hence, as Ian Haywood explains, the draconian practice of stringing up
                  any unfortunate wretch insufficiently eagle-eyed to catch the minute signs of the
                  counterfeiter’s art.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)

                  </div> Before special paper, with unreproducible water-marks (let alone holograms) counterfeiters
                  were on the whole even more skilled than their engraving counterparts in the treasury;
                  and whatever the treasury could do, as regards intricate patterns and secret signs,
                  the counterfeiters could do as well, if not better (Dick, 389). Hence one of the more
                  unlikely public movements of the age: the societies forming for the prevention of
                  the wholesale hanging of market-traders caught with bent bills.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Romanticism—at any rate, Romantic ideology—may be understood as the dream of achieving
               permanent or transcendent value against a background of value rendered radically unstable
               and contested (McGann). In this respect forgery signifies the possibility of the endemic
               instability that fed the transcendental desires that peculiarly distinguish Romanticism.
               Although this is a version of the familiar story told about Romanticism—a story about
               the rise of secularization, with temporal theories of value replacing atemporal ones—the
               constitutive role of the bullion controversy (with its concomitant ills, such as the
               forgery epidemic) as a necessary condition for the historical rise of Romanticism
               has only recently been directly addressed, for example in Mary Poovey’s <em>Genres of the Credit Economy</em>, and in Alex Dick’s forthcoming <em>Realms of Gold: British Romanticism and the Standard of Value</em>.</p>
            <p>My aim is not to change prevailing notions of Romanticism so much as it is to change
               prevailing notions of forgery in relation to it, from forgery as Romanticism’s dark
               other (an expression of the critical imaginary understandably present in, for instance,
               Nick Groom’s ground-breaking 1994 issue of <em>Angelaki</em> devoted to the subject) to forgery as a logically necessary constituent of Romanticism.
               In effect I am positing the interchangeability of two systems of value: the aesthetic,
               and the economic (see Thompson). As disciplines, or fields, aesthetics and economics
               both famously come into being (as regards their modern shape) around the same time:
               think, for instance, of Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em> (1776) and Lord Kames' <em>The Elements of Criticism</em> (1762). Each needs the other, to think itself into being.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The hinge, linking the two systems, is forgery. In recent years there has been a great
                  deal of critical interest in the history of literary forgery, an interest K.K. Ruthven
                  links to “two intellectual developments in the final decades of the twentieth century”:
                  “post-structuralist critical theory” and the “continuing anatomy of . . . 'the postmodern
                  condition'“. The first forced a rethinking of traditional assumptions about “authorship,
                  originality, authenticity and value” while the second fundamentally undermined commonsense
                  apprehensions of the real and the simulated (Ruthven, 63). The eighteenth-century
                  habit of positing the ideal of “original genius” axiomatically produced the allied
                  condition of anxiety about its failure, which is to say, fakery, or, where it was
                  with malice prepense, forgery. Post-structuralist critical theory certainly pounced
                  on this hare, once set running; my aim, rather, is to take us back to a moment where
                  a linkage was made, that now seems self-evident, but was hardly so at the time: the
                  linkage, that is, between forgery in its dominant figurative sense (the unauthorized
                  replication of bank notes), and a secondary one: the unauthorized replication of literary
                  property. Originally a forger was simply a metal-basher, and forgery “the action or
                  craft of forging metal”. So what connects the innocent act of making something (a
                  poem, say, attributed to a long-dead poet), with the criminal act of counterfeiting
                  bank bills? Blackstone in his <em>Commentaries</em> (1769) appears to provide an answer: “the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing
                  to the prejudice of another man’s right.”

                  </div> Prior to the suspension of 1797, most forged bills were to the detriment of a named
                  individual, fraudulently endorsed (rather than to a faceless bank). Blackstone’s legal
                  definition stretches to encompass both robbery through counterfeit bank notes, and
                  the theft of literary property though imposition; both the Reverend Dodds, and Chatterton.
                  But of course, only Dodds was stretched, and not just because Chatterton checked out
                  early. The famous cases of literary forgery in the eighteenth century did not involve
                  infringements of copyright “to the prejudice of another man’s right”. Rowley’s poems
                  not having been previously published, the copyright could not have been snapped up
                  by a publisher, so none was injured. The same was true of Ireland’s Shakespeare forgeries,
                  where the worst that could be said, was that Ireland had trampled on Shakespeare’s
                  “moral rights”, as later iterations of the copyright law would come to call the right
                  of not having one’s work traduced, and its brand tarnished, by fraudsters; but in
                  the 1790’s this concept lay in the future. When Horace Walpole famously claimed that
                  all inmates of the house of forgery were relations, he was the one doing the stretching
                  (see Baines). The circle he was drawing, was greatly in excess of what was then logically,
                  or legally, possible. We do well to listen to natural contrarians, such as Cobbett,
                  who is here righteously tearing strips off the fools who rounded on W. H. Ireland,
                  once his ingenuity as a Shakespeare-basher was revealed: <span class="quote">‘instantly the base wretches, from every quarter, poured in upon him; instead of admiring
                     his ingenuity, and apologising, as well as they could, for their own folly, in having
                     been Shakespeare-mad, they pitched upon him, like tigers, called him a forger, called
                     him an impostor, and almost hunted him from the face of the earth.’</span> Cobbett continues: <span class="quote">‘With regard to Mr. Ireland, let these facts be borne in mind; that he was no forger,
                     no impostor, according to the usual meaning of those words; that he had a perfect
                     right to put forth the publications he put forth; that there was nothing illegal and
                     nothing immoral in any of his proceedings as to this matter; that Doctors Wharton
                     and Parr were deemed the two most learned men in the Kingdom; that they declared and
                     certified that it was their conviction that no human being could write those manuscripts
                     but Shakespeare; that when Mr Ireland was discovered to be the real author, the whole
                     band of literary ruffians fell upon him, and would have destroyed him, if they had
                     been able, with as little remorse as men destroy a mad dog...

                  But in the minds of those hunting him down, like a mad dog, he was, because the concept
                  of forgery had been stretched to link together the aesthetic with the monetary value
                  the aesthetic generates (where the aesthetic is arbitrarily confined to a single,
                  “original” source). From Cobbett’s perspective, these are heterogeneous notions yoked
                  together by force. The “con” was not Ireland pretending to be Shakespeare, but the
                  pretence of a rare and precious literary value only the cognoscenti could discern.
                  Ireland’s true crime, Cobbett suggests, was his laying bare the pretence.</p>

            <p>One could say that mine is a secularization argument; that the late Enlightenment
               throws us into a state of irony, contingency, and subjectivity; and the hinged relationship
               between numismatic and literary forgery is just another indication that we are in
               the free-floating realm of shifting values. But I prefer to put it like this: the
               suspension of cash payments ushered in a period in which the modern economic cycle
               first began to intensify, a period, that is, of rapid capital growth, speculation,
               and savage retrenchments; it was one where paper replaced metal as common, circulating
               tokens of value; and where the economic discourse of value (on why, for instance,
               gold and silver have value in the first place: the common answer looping back to the
               scarcity-value attendant upon the limits of South American mines and the labour that
               worked them) infiltrates other discursive systems of value. All three developments
               altered the social imaginary, not least through the pervasive example of economic
               agents rising and falling, as the economy booms and busts, along with the allied lesson
               that the modern moral order presupposes deep interconnection and dependence. And I
               put it like that, because it is the best way of understanding something really peculiar
               about Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em>.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And that is, that <em>Emma</em> is a deeply meditated work on the same interpenetration of literary and economic systems
                  of value that we found in Cobbett’s analysis of Ireland’s persecution. We can start
                  with the fact that Highbury is sixteen miles South of London, in Surrey—insofar as
                  Austen had a location in mind, it was Leatherhead, the epicentre of what is now the
                  stockbroker belt. The obvious point—for contemporary readers, screamingly so—is that
                  the Woodhouses are rentiers.

                           who retired to Highbury, not far from London and its money market, where he could
                           have bought and sold stocks in corporations and colonialist ventures like the East
                           India or South Seas Companies, or lent money to the government for William III’s and
                           Anne’s wars” (Tobin 238).</span></div>
                  </div> In the following passage, the humour is very broad indeed. Emma is wondering to herself
                  about what could have possessed Mr. Elton into imagining himself her equal: <span class="quote">‘Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in
                     talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such equality might prevent
                     his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly
                     his superior. He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations
                     at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the Eltons were
                     nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a
                     sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged;
                     but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary
                     to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence... (153)’</span> We never learn about these mysterious “other sources”—Emma is doubtless vague herself—but
                  almost certainly the Woodhouses have their money in the funds: and like many others
                  living the good life among England’s ancient gentry, they are but one or two generations
                  removed from the trade in which they earned their pile, before “cashing out”. As Shinobu
                  Minma observes, “we may assume that the progenitor of the Hartfield Woodhouses was
                  a younger brother in a landed family, who entered trade, made his fortune, purchased
                  the Hartfield estate (from the Knightleys no doubt) and settled in Highbury.”

                     Hence Johnson, perhaps influenced by the phrase “real property”, gives as one sense
                     of the word “To convert money into land”; this, however, is unsupported by quotations.’</span> In Highbury, everyone is trying to realize themselves (apart from George Knightley,
                  who has the opposite problem to contend with, of turning land to cash). Thus we learn
                  that Mr Weston had “realized an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a
                  little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for” (16). Buoyed by
                  the unexpected profits of their London “House”, meaning business, the Coles are looking
                  to realize their fortune, by buying property in Highbury and insinuating themselves
                  into the best circles, to Emma’s chagrin. The obvious point, for a contemporary reader,
                  is that Emma is drawing distinctions without a difference; or rather, the slight difference
                  of the Woodhouses being superior to the Coles, by dint of cashing out a generation
                  or two earlier.

                  </div> The irony is equally broad in this passage (Emma is explaining to Harriet why Robert
                  Martin is not a desirable catch): <span class="quote">‘“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an
                     independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at
                     all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died,
                     whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed
                     in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich
                     in time, it is next to impossible that he should have <em>realised</em> any thing yet.” (74) (my italics).’</span> This is the second instance of “realize”, used in its modern, financial sense, found
                  in the novel. Emma is speculating about Robert Martin’s speculation, his attempt at
                  the “high farming” as it was called, that was then transforming British agriculture,
                  as the speculative boom involved capital investment in land, in new farming methods
                  that were reaping strong returns owing to the unprecedented high prices in corn.

                           system of spirited improvement and high farming, as it is technically called, has
                           been principally encouraged by the progressive rise of prices..." (Quoted Anon 1815,

                  (just before the end of the Napoleonic wars) the Funds were a mere 60% of their historic
                  value, undermined by inflation (Ferguson, 80). At the point of the novel’s writing,
                  rentiers such as the Woodhouses are on their way down, while high farmers and capital
                  speculators such as Robert Martin are on their way up. Emma notes this without quite
                  taking it in (she predicts Robert Martin will be rich in time).</p>
            </div>
            <p>How broad is the irony? “. . .his share of the family property . . . is . . . all
               afloat, all employed in his stock”. Note the pun on stock (obviously livestock, but
               also the financial variety). The pun develops the double meaning of Robert Martin
               as a high farmer (a passion he incidentally shares with Mr. Knightley), but it also
               brings out this latent irony: Emma is talking as the very thing she is: a speculator,
               who is, herself, the daughter of speculators (that is, business people), who have
               realised themselves, having cashed out.</p>
            <p>The novel has a word for this conjunction of the two senses of speculation: Emma,
               we are told, is an “imaginist...on fire with speculation and foresight!” (295). The
               conjunction is also evident in the novel’s core plot device, where Emma speculates
               on Harriet Smith’s origin. Emma prefers romance (Harriet is the natural daughter of
               a Merchant Prince, or Whig Grandee, someone, ideally, combining both nobility and
               wealth, so “bleaching” the stain of her dodgy origin [404]), but has to learn novelistic
               realism (Harriet’s father is a tradesman decent enough to remain anonymous). In its
               sly way, <em>Emma</em> is also a novel about novel-writing. As someone who speculates, and predicts marriage,
               Emma is linked—at least theoretically—with the main business of the novel, of narrating
               marriage. When she takes on her protégé, Harriet Smith, the theoretical point becomes
               practical: in developing Harriet, Emma speculates through the medium of romance conventions,
               much as Catherine Morland does. She views the world through the prism of the wrong
               kind of novels. At the same time, the Harriet Smith romance encapsulates the main
               fear of Tory ideology: that feckless, irresponsible, illegitimate capital (engendered
               in the City) will be set lose to circulate freely, transforming the shires, by turning
               the social order upside down. With this allegorical dimension in mind, the gypsy episode
               is ironically inverted: the real menace, is not the raggedy offspring of a few tinkers,
               but Harriet Smith, the ambulatory bank note, the daughter of God-knows-who, who promises
               capital transformation (in Emma’s speculation), a threat further ironically intensified
               given the hero’s association with the Churchills. Frank Churchill, who gallantly disperses
               the gypsies, is the adopted son of the self-same class of Whig nabobs who are the
               putative parents of illegitimate Harriet. Where legitimacy is defined by land, a form
               of property where the social contract (of obligations and responsibilities, as well
               as privilege) is legible to all, capital has the taint of illegitimacy, or irresponsible
               pleasure. Frank himself generates the hugger-mugger Tory ideologues typically associated
               with large city fortunes. In other words, <em>Emma</em> reprises the plot of <em>Northanger Abbey</em> where a romance-addled heroine is unable to recognize the very thing that obsesses
               her when it’s in front of her face: in Emma’s case, the perils of new (City) money
               and marriage across class lines. Even as she spurns the Coles, as socially illegitimate
               new money, she promotes Harriet (its epitome).</p>
            <p>One could argue that Harriet is a counterfeit banknote, in that she is, from Emma’s
               perspective, a “fake”, but that is taking the allegory too far. The point, rather,
               is that two competing discourses inhabit the same space in the novel, and through
               the punning capacity of language, often the same words. You can try the experiment.
               Get an e-text of the novel and plug in “resources”, “speculate”, “improve”, “stock”,
               “credit”, “realize”: the terms recur, pointedly. The competing discourses are drawn
               from aesthetics and economics, where the correction of one kind of speculation (the
               economic) is linked to the improvement of another (novel-writing). </p>
            <p>Austen’s fascination with the dismal science arguably pervades her work, but most
               notably <em>Emma</em>, <em>Mansfield Park</em>, and <em>Sanditon</em>. It is not a sign of her famed Enlightenment realism; rather, it is where she is
               at her most Romantic, for it is through her economic interests that she finds a language
               for exploring a world where value is inescapably contingent. Contingent value is not
               thematized in her novels—rather it is part of the web-and-woof of a social imaginary
               that in a manner of speaking thinks itself out through the medium of her novels.</p>
            <p>I want to conclude by considering the aspect of the novel that most severely tries
               my interpretation: the idealization of Knightley and Donwell Abbey. The marriage between
               Emma and Knightley repairs the “notch” in the latter’s property, making it whole again,
               while her thirty thousand pounds is safely placed in the service of an ancient estate,
               the pinnacle of a “well-connected” community presumably stretching back to the English
               Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries. In his brisk pedestrianism, frugal
               habits, and active concern for all the “citizens of Highbury”, Knightley appears to
               be the embodiment of the responsible, enlivening spirit that draws the community together,
               transforming it (through self-regulation) into a living example of the Tory ideal.
               Emma’s epiphany, when she strolls around Knightley’s grounds, as she escapes the wretched
               Mrs. Elton and her inane mercantile chatter, appears Austen’s own, ventriloquized
               by Edmund Burke: “It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,
               English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive”
               (315). At the heart of this glorious, organic, vital media is a crucial representation
               of social relation: “The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey
               stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant
               was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood; and at
               the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey-Mill Farm,
               with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it”
               (315). Knightley, and Robert Martin, the Abbey and the Abbey-Mill farm, seem chthonically
               present, as if spontaneously grown from the sinuous earth, as close as one can get,
               in a realist novel, to an instantiation of the ontic force of “hierarchical complementarity”.
               On this reading, the mysterious power that makes the English home counties the home
               counties of England, and nowhere else—continuous across space and time, a unique identity
               enduring through the aeons—is made manifest in the novel as the healing force that
               repairs notches in ancient estates, excludes frightful sorts like the Eltons, while
               lodging dangerous females (wild imaginists and ambulatory banknotes alike) snugly
               within the confines of appropriate marriages. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This “heritage” fantasy is indisputably at work in the novel, but it works as one
                  pole in irresolvable tension with another reality, of independent, and equal, economic
                  actors, engaged in a mutual-aid society, as they seek to prosper in giddy financial
                  times. For if <em>Emma</em> was written at a time of faltering boom, it was quickly followed by a spectacular
                  bust.

                  </div> Hence the stress on what Robert Martin and George Knightley have in common: an insatiable
                  appetite for “information”, especially information relating to “improvement”—another
                  of the novel’s key terms. “Improvement” resonates ironically in the text, as the watch
                  word of enclosures, engrossments, and the capital transformation of land at a time
                  of rising prices and rents: it’s what Robert Martin does with his sheep, and other
                  farmers with oxen, and what Emma does with Harriet, even as Mr. Knightley wishes that
                  Emma would exert more effort in her own reading, to improve herself. When Mr. Knightley
                  says he can as “ill spare Robert Martin” (397) as his canny steward, William Larkins,
                  he means, not the umbilical connection of master and tenant farmer, but a collaborator
                  in their joint project of improving their lands and profits. The social imaginary
                  in which <em>Emma</em> ramifies, is a modern one of equal, mutually dependent actors where the older moral
                  outlook exists as an outdated cast of mind satirized through Emma’s snobbery, and
                  as an idealization ironically presented as just that: the era of “gold standards”
                  has passed, and ever-shifting relation ushered in. As Alex Dick notes, the “gold standard”
                  was first conceptualized in the course of the bullion controversy, at which point
                  it was retrospectively projected onto the past, onto the era preceding the suspension
                  of cash-payments in 1797, as a fantasy of origin.

               <p>J.G.A. Pocock influentially argued that the rise of a polite and commercial society
                  in the eighteenth century eclipsed the mentality in which land was automatically assumed
                  to be the proper source of wealth and the true foundation of political legitimacy.

                  </div> But as Beth Tobin notes, although this ideal had waned, it began to wax after the
                  post-Waterloo economic crash as an ideological defence of the corn laws that were
                  used to prop up farming prices, thus ensuring the continued pre-eminence of “land”
                  in the British social imaginary (Tobin, 249). At this juncture the ideological formation
                  assumed its modern form: the Tory ideal of the “knights of the shires” as the true
                  pillars of English society. <em>Emma</em> puts both things in play: the fantasy (the gold standard of “land”; Donwell Abbey;
                  the immutabilities of rank) and its opposite (contingency; the stockbroker belt; permeable
                  class). It is in this tension that Austen finds her Romantic irony.</p>
