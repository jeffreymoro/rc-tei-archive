                     Scott attempts to revive the idea of “speculation”—which I define as both an
                     act of imagination and an act of seeing—against the models of economic
                     diversification that the financial and banking communities offered as s
                     solutions to the crisis. <title level="m">Chronicles</title> documents the failure of this speculative
                     economy and replaces it with a tenuous if critical mode of comparative

               <p>In 1822, the Scottish adventurer Sir Gregor MacGregor issued a bond on the London
                  Stock Exchange to fund a British colony, Poyais, on the Mosquito Coast of Eastern
                  Central America. A veteran of the Peninsular campaign and the Bolivian War of
                  Independence—he was married to Simon de Bolivar’s sister—MacGregor told his
                  investors, mostly fellow Scots, that he had family connections to the Darien
                  expedition of the 1690s and the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. He even claimed to be
                  descended from Rob Roy MacGregor, who had been recently immortalized in a novel by
                  Walter Scott. A national infrastructure and civil service, he bragged, were
                  already waiting in Poyais for lawyers, bankers, and merchants. MacGregor raised
                  close to 200,000 pounds; the next year, three ships carrying 240 settlers crossed
                  the Atlantic. </p>
               <p>By August, 180 of them were dead. The British press, always on the lookout for
                  charlatans, accused MacGregor for having summarily duped his investors. Poyais,
                  they said, was a fraud, a fiction, a country that didn’t exist. Interestingly,
                  most of the surviving settlers accused MacGregor’s agents and publicists, not
                  MacGregor himself, for spreading false information about the colony. But MacGregor
                  had already decamped to France. For the next fifteen years, he tried to sell his
                  Poyais scheme, at one point even penning a constitution, but he could not attract
                  any further investment. He moved to Venezuela in 1838 and died penniless in
                  1845.</p>
               <p>Gregor MacGregor was one of many pseudo-aristocratic fraudsters whose stories
                  enliven historical accounts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bubbles and
                  booms, from John Law’s Missisippi Scheme of 1720 to the Railway Bubble satirized
                  in Trollope’s <title level="m">The Way We Live Now</title> (1875).<note

                  however, historians of the Latin American and Caribbean independence movements
                  have reassessed the relationship between military heroism, financial investment,
                  and print culture to suggest that figures like MacGregor embody a complex mixture
                  of fact and fiction, force and fraud, tradition and temerity that underlies the
                  hybrid American identity (Brown). Likewise, literary scholars have argued that
                  forgery and fraud in the Romantic period can hardly be understood simply in terms
                  of a stark difference between fiction and fact; rather they must be treated as
                  evidence of a new kind of subjective and, indeed, aesthetic consciousness in which
                  truth and lies are always blurred.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">On

                  industrial print, personal debt, and media manipulation that constituted a new
                  kind of literary and cultural celebrity. In this perspective, MacGregor seems less
                  like a criminal and more like a Byronic hero.</p>
               <p>The Waverley Novels, from which MacGregor drew some of his inspiration, also use
                  the historical mystique of a Scottish cultural tradition to manufacture a myth of
                  spectacular heroism to ground both the threat and the banality of Britain’s
                  speculative commerce. Following Burke, Ferguson, and other “conservative”
                  thinkers, Scott put monarchy at the centre of a pan-British
                     <foreign>bildung</foreign> to guarantee national unity and economic purpose.
                  The spectacle of the British monarchy was the standard—both literally and
                  figuratively speaking—for its speculative finance and trade economy. I use the
                  word “speculative” here in two senses: (1) as a synonym for “visual” in the sense
                  that the hero or monarch who guarantees an investment tends to be visible or at
                  least represented in highly iconographic terms; (2) to connote a sense of futurity
                  or wishfulness, thereby acknowledging that the ventures being guaranteed by the
                  hero or monarch are conjectural investments in a possible future. If these two
                  uses of the term seem contradictory, they are, and most especially as they are
                  used by Scott. Thus, to take a familiar example, in <title level="m"
                     >Waverley</title> the idea of a reclaimed Stuart monarchy is embodied in the
                  noble figure of Prince Charles, though his gambling and foolhardiness are also
                  indications of the “speculative” nature of the Jacobite campaign. Scott’s monarchs
                  are not absolutists. Bonnie Prince Charlie, Richard the Lionheart, and Charles II,
                  among other of Scott’s monarchs, are fallible and sympathetic, charismatic, but
                  often highly imaginative and, indeed, speculative. They often find themselves in
                  situations where their authority is in doubt and their identities insecure. But,
                  in the context of Scott’s historical romances, these qualities lend them the sheen
                  of realism. Monarchy is seen in Scott to be something imaginary and, indeed,
                  fictional (as it is in Burke) but nevertheless symbolically vital to the unity of
                  the nation. Scott’s brilliant fictionalizations of the monarch as someone that
                  understands the doubts and hesitations of his people, and falls into the same
                  errors and doubts, make its ghostly presence the symbolic earmark of a lost but
                  eminently valued historical tradition, one both ironic and redemptive.<note

               </p>
               <p>But something changed in the crisis of 1825. Scott was confronted with the
                  possibility that the “speculative” national and political identity he had
                  constructed for Scotland in his historical fictions and had linked in several of
                  them with Scotland’s vibrant paper money system—<title level="m">The
                     Antiquary,</title>
                  <title level="m">Rob Roy,</title>
                  <title level="m">The Fortunes of Nigel</title>—would be lost in an ocean of debts
                  and obligations under which both he and the nation found themselves. In the wake
                  of the 1825 crisis, Scott was exposed as a bankrupt and the Scottish financial
                  system, one of the most extensive in Europe, was charged with insolvency and
                  impracticability. The solution to the crash, which included the reformation of the
                  Scottish system, was not simply the institutionalization of a fixed standard of
                  value—that had actually existed in England for a decade already—but rather the
                  centralization or, in the language of the time, consolidation of British finance
                  under the auspices of a central but largely invisible authority: the Bank of
                  England. What is important about these reforms is that this central authority had
                  no symbolic or visual presence: with the introduction of branch and deposit
                  banking and by offering many, small alternatives for investment, the Bank of
                  England assumed a new authority by diversifying itself and its services into a
                  myriad of new exchange forms. In this way, the Bank succeeded where the London
                  Corresponding Society and the <title level="j">Political Register</title> had
                  failed in loosening the government’s grip on economic decisions, only this was not
                  in the service of social reform but rather of financial (and profitable)
                  centralization.</p>
               <p>My argument is that much of Scott’s later writing can be interpreted as a response
                  to the process of financial consolidation through diversification. In several
                  works published in the years during and following his financial collapse,
                  including his most direct and sustained contribution to the debates about money,
                  authority, and standardization <title level="m">The Letters of Malachi
                     Malagrowther</title>, Scott would attempt to revive rhetorically a spectacular
                  standard of value. In my reading, “speculation” is not the problem which Scott and
                  other critics of the Bank of England were trying to solve. Rather speculation was
                  an alternative to the perceived consequences of financial diversification: that
                  is, the way that the end of the wartime economy and the breakdown of the old
                  monopoly trade networks produced a highly varied field of investment opportunities
                  all existing as free but interconnected network of values and units that made the
                  financial market almost impossible to conceive in humanistic or political terms.
                  My sense is that this attempt to revive an economics of spectacle, which Scott
                  writes into <title level="m">Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</title> succeeded as
                  a work of rhetorical polemic but failed as a work of monetary economics, in much
                  the same way that Gregor MacGregor’s efforts to fund a colony on the back of a
                  fictionalized heritage and military exploits both succeeded and failed to create a
                  nation called Poyais. But the <title level="m">Chronicles of the
                  Canongate</title>, the collection of connected short narratives that Scott wrote
                  in the aftermath of his own bankruptcy hearings and published in early 1827,
                  suggests a different tone and a new purpose for historical fiction in the wake of
                  the changes to the financial system precipitated by the 1825 crash. While many
                  critics appreciate the melancholia that pervades these stories and the authorial
                  narrative that connects them, I want to suggest that the dismay at the failure of
                  spectacular heroism which Scott documents in <title level="m">Chronicles</title>
                  also offered a new way to conceive of the relation between fiction and finance. In
                     <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title> recurrent episodes of
                  awkward or disturbed reading signal the failure of heroic specularity and mark a
                  new kind of aesthetic expression. </p>

               <head>The Panic of 1825: Speculation or Diversification?</head>
               <p>Throughout the 1820s, Scott’s publishers, Archibald Constable and James
                  Ballantyne, issued handsome advances to their authors. They hoped to generate a
                  culture of gentlemanly condescension and respect that would belie their
                  fundamentally commercial provenance (Eliot 94). In the meantime, through his
                  London agents, Constable had invested heavily in the Latin American mining boom.
                  By the end of 1825, caught in the tailspin of a financial bust, both houses were
                  in serious trouble. Their most coveted asset and heaviest backer, Walter Scott,
                  found himself in debt for more than 120,000 pounds. The following spring, in a
                  hearing at Chancery meant to preempt bankruptcy proceedings, the judges gave Scott
                  a choice: either sell Abbotsford or assign a sizeable proportion of the proceeds
                  for all forthcoming works to his creditors. Scott agreed to the latter. Scott’s
                  publishing interests were signed over to Robert Cadell, whom Scott regarded as a
                  middle-class upstart. </p>
               <p>To fulfill his financial obligations, but also to stem the tide of depression,
                  Scott embarked on one his most productive periods: he completed a novel, <title

                     Napoleon</title>, a collection of stories, <emph>Chronicles of the

                  knew that he was working with literary gold. Plans were already afoot to republish
                  the complete Waverley series, the Magnum Opus. What connects these various
                  projects is their testimony to a change in Scott’s authorial appearance. No longer
                  mystified as a singular presence through the serial publication of individual
                  novels, Scott and the Author of Waverley were systematically and serially
                  “unbound” (to borrow a phrase from Benedict Anderson), that is spread through a
                  myriad of genres and venues, from the shortest note to the complete works that
                  never quite measure up to the totality they are meant to comprise. Rather than a
                  mysterious presence on which the reading public could speculate as it absorbed
                  each successive work in turn, Scott, his pseudonyms and personae, his editors and
                  his publishers, became pieces in a puzzle that never produced a coherent
                  image.</p>
               <p>My interpretation of Scott’s late career is meant to suggest what happens to
                  Romanticism in the 1820s and especially in the wake of the financial crisis of
                  1825. This crisis of 1825 is generally thought of as a “speculative bubble,”
                  similar to earlier crises such as the South Sea Bubble of 1722. But there are
                  important differences. The South Sea bubble and the Mississippi Scheme were caused
                  by massive amounts of investment, much of it fraudulent, in monopoly “Adventuring”
                  companies. The 1825 panic was caused by neither delusory investment nor
                  imperialist autocracy but rather by a series of institutional adjustments that
                  helped turn Britain from a centralized war economy to a decentralized peace
                     economy.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">My account of the 1825
                     financial panic is drawn largely from Neal with corrections from Bordo.</note>
                  What made these adjustments precarious was not speculation but diversification.
                  When the war against Napoleon ended, the decision was made in 1816 to adopt a
                  fully mono-metallic gold standard and begin the processes necessary to resume cash
                  payments. This could not happen until the Bank of England had accrued sufficient
                  cash reserves. But an immediate curtailing of loans and notes would have caused a
                  massive recession (which happened anyway, though for different reasons). The Bank
                  was compelled to balance the need to reduce the amount of credit in circulation
                  with the need to maintain commercial credit and sustain both the economy and its
                  own profits. They did this in several ways, none of them entirely honest. First,
                  they stockpiled a massive amount of gold (newly available from the continent) in
                  order to keep its price high and prevent its customers from cashing in their
                  notes. Then they withdrew a large number of notes from circulation that the
                  government had been relying on for various repayments. Then they refused to lower
                  discount rates to farmers and traders who had been adversely affected by the
                  post-war recession. Not surprisingly, the Bank and the government received a good
                  deal of negative press. But they received more criticism, notably from radicals
                  like Cobbett, for delaying the return to cash payments than for trying, albeit for
                  selfish motives, to slow its adverse effects.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

               </p>
               <p>Once convertibility was in place, the bank and the government had to maintain
                  their own solvency. Again, several tactics were employed. The government, which
                  had not only built up a massive amount of public debt during the war years but had
                  also, in a fit of post-war political fervor, eliminated the income tax that had
                  funded that debt in the first place, issued a series of new 3% consols—bonds sold
                  to investors on the proceeds of indentured aristocratic estates and other
                  government owned property—in an attempt to stimulate investment without direct
                  monetary controls.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">For a brief but
                     sufficient description of consols as an early and successful form of government
                     bonds see Ferguson, 76-85.</note> Similarly, the Bank of England did its utmost
                  to maintain consistent price levels by issuing low-yield, low-risk stocks at
                  reduced discounts. The East-India Company followed suit. As a result, brokers and
                  consumers had a range of investment choices, but this also meant that the prices
                  of each stock tended to fluctuate in a way that had not been seen during the war
                  years when all investment had been directed at a common goal. Two other factors
                  diversified the market further. First, the government introduced several
                  infrastructure initiatives: road works, ship-building, gas lighting, schools, and
                  the like. This in turn helped to stimulate new manufacture and trade and led to
                  the formation of new firms, funds, banks, and even insurance agencies in which the
                  public could invest. Second, the resumption of cash payments and the newly-won
                  political independence of several Latin American states threw open the market in
                  precious metals. Many of the major metropolitan banks invested heavily in these
                  mining ventures. The credit produced by them stimulated the domestic securities
                  market which in turn led to the opening of more joint stock companies and country
                  banks outside the capital. </p>
               <p>Of course, there were charlatans and rapscallions among the mining and gasworks
                  companies: Gregor MacGregor was only the most notorious. Eventually, the amount of
                  cheap credit circulating through the market and the irregularities that the mining
                  industry seems inevitably to confront began to make investors uneasy. By the end
                  of 1825, there were bankruptcies and bank failures everywhere: some of the leading
                  London firms went under. But what is interesting about the financial “bubble” of
                  the early 1820s is that for the most part, and unlike the South Sea and Missisippi
                  bubbles of 100 years earlier, the economic activity was “real” rather than
                  fictitious, that is, the investment actually produced tangible, material results.
                  Indeed, the leading cause of the boom was the rush to invest in precious metals,
                  the very “real” thing that was—and is—often assumed to be the only correct
                  alternative to such fictitious schemes.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="8">The
                     question of the “reality” of paper credit is, of course, controversial, though
                     economic and finance historians largely agree now that it has always been
                     credit rather than coin that has acted as the real medium of capital production
                     and exchange. </note> The real cause of the panic was not credit itself, but
                  its ready availability in small, diversified portions. On their own, each of these
                  investments represented a tangible moment of economic transaction—purchasing an
                  insurance policy, buying stock, or broking a loan—and all of them have real
                  economic intents and benefits. Collectively, however, these individual
                  transactions added up to far more activity than could be conceived within the
                  terms of a “national economy,” that is, the domestic foundation on which most
                  people based their confidence in the financial system.</p>
               <p>When the bubble finally burst, the government and the Bank of England had no
                  option but to react in a seemingly tangible manner. The country already had a
                  convertible gold standard and, thanks to a sudden influx of metals from their
                  trusted agent, Nathan Rothschild, the Governors of the Bank of England did not
                  have to suspend cash payments (as they did in 1797) to prevent a bank run. But the
                  Governors of the Bank of England also decided to extend their note issues in 1826
                  as a way to slow down incidences of bankruptcy. To the Liverpool administration,
                  this was an alarming proposition because it entailed further increases in public
                  debt, which the government felt it could not sustain, economically or politically.
                  The source of the problem, the government contended, lay with smaller banks and
                  investment firms through which local credit was apparently being channeled into
                  diverse and uncharted investments. In January, 1826, the government made three
                  suggestions. First, the Bank of England would set up its own branches to replace
                  the smaller firms. Second, it would allow competition for government business from
                  other London firms within the metropolis. Third, they would finally extend the
                  gold standard to Scotland—where it had not been in effect before—as a way to
                  curtail the Scot’s dependence on paper money and thus their dangerous inclination
                  for financial adventure. The administration did not really believe that any of
                  these suggestions would be implemented, the first being very difficult, the second
                  being unwarrantable, and the third political suicide. </p>
               <p>In the first instance, however, the Bank called the Prime Minister’s bluff and
                  proceeded to open branches around the country, leading eventually to the demise of
                  the country bank and independent note issues. Consequently, other London firms
                  increased their share of the financial market, since they no longer had direct
                  competition from country bankers. Rather than curtail investment, though, these
                  actions encouraged it in even more diversified ways thanks to the new practices of
                  deposit banking and credit facilitation that large and more secure banks,
                  including the Bank of England, could offer. This meant that at the same time as it
                  was diversifying so radically, the financial system also became more
                  centralized—though exactly where that central power lay was hard to discern. For a
                  single scheme, it is possible to cultivate a visible, intentional, symbolic
                  standard, something toward which the money promised can be balanced against: a
                  commodity to be produced, a service to be procured, a hero to found a colony. Even
                  in gigantic schemes like a war such symbols—king and country and all that —
                  usefully defray the fear and anxiety that accompanies massive debts. But when a
                  network of diversified investments exceeds the bounds of customary symbolic
                  associations, when the channels of these investments are controlled by a huge
                  consortium of competing interests, when the real value of money can no longer be
                  “seen,” where does it lie? What is its standard? These are the questions that
                  Scott asked in his responses to the panic of 1825. </p>

               <p>Scott defended the Scottish banks on the essentially nationalist grounds that a
                  “diversity” of financial institutions will better serve the mixed British economy
                  than either an abstract principle of “uniformity” or “innovation.” <note
                     place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">The historian N. T. Phillipson observed in
                     1968 that the <title level="m">Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</title>, which
                     Scott wrote to protest the incursion of centralizing English financial policy
                     on the Scottish “free banking system,” exemplify the general resentment
                     Scottish rural people and Edinburgh elites alike felt toward London’s various
                     attempts to integrate the bureaucracies of Scotland and England between 1780
                     and 1830, though ultimately, Phillipson concluded, like many such campaigns
                     Scott’s letters did little more than express an “ideology of noisy inaction”
                     (186). Caroline McCracken-Flesher in <title level="m">Possible
                        Scotlands</title> documents the wide support that Scott’s letters received,
                     even from those like Henry Dundas Lord Melville who had originally approved of
                     Parliament’s motion. Scott turned to his readers’ sense of their own
                     “otherness” to recharge Scottish nationalism with a new progressive sense of
                     its own difference within a changing British union. Those few scholars who have
                     examined these works in relation to his financial troubles have tended to do so
                     with an eye still trained firmly on the problem of Scottish national identity.
                     See also Colella. </note> His ground for such a claim was essentially
                  nationalistic. “For God’s sake,” Scott declared, “let us remain as Nature made us,
                  Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen, with something like the impress of our
                  several countries upon each! We could not become better subjects…if we all
                  resembled each other like so many smooth shillings!” (373). Via such contentions,
                  the attempt to bring the gold standard to Scotland is thus easily interpreted as
                  an act of rank imperialism and its failure a triumph of the Scottish anti-colonial
                  spirit; as Silvana Colella points out, “the banks present a specifically Scottish
                  alternative to the English search for uniformity . . . . Diversity rather than
                  uniformity is, in fact, the distinguishing feature of the Scottish monetary
                  system” (58). Beyond national autonomy, though, Scott also committed himself to a
                     <emph>speculative</emph> system based on local trust or “confidence” as opposed
                  to a consolidated system based on diversified, mathematical equivalence. Because
                  its relatively small population and rugged geography prevented the easy transport
                  of metallic currencies, Scotland had little in the way of metallic reserves,
                  relying instead on locally-issued paper credit. This credit was kept afloat by the
                  combination of private diligence and public accountability. To English charges
                  that Scottish banks were financially suspect because they did not rely on reserves
                  of precious metals, Scott answered that the security of the Scottish banking
                  system is based on a form of public accountability, “the watchful superintendence
                  of the whole profession being extended to the strength and weakness of the general
                  system at each particular point; or, in other words, to the management of each
                  individual Company” (336). The mechanism of this security is publication: “every
                  Bank throughout Scotland is obliged to submit its circulation, twice a-week in
                  Edinburgh, to the inspection of the Argus-eyed tribunal“ (337). The Scottish
                  banking system is a “republic” and “the public have, in this manner, the best
                  possible guarantee against rash and ill-concocted speculations, from those who are
                  not only best informed on the subject, but, being most interested in examining
                  each new project of the kind, are least likely to be betrayed intro a rash
                  confidence, and have the power of preventing a doubtful undertaking at the very
                  outset” (337). Scott models his idea of the “republic” of Scottish finance on the
                  model of the sociable public sphere of the Scottish Enlightenment republic of
                  letters. The English “seized with a jealous tenacious, wrangling, overbearing
                  humour” intended to undermine the very Enlightenment principles, Scottish of
                  course, which had brought Britain its economic power in the first place. “We cease
                  at once to be the Northern Athenians… we have become the caterpillars of the
                  island instead of its pillars” (361). In letter three, Scott invents an English
                  rival, Christopher Chrysal, who defends the English system on a decidedly
                  irrational love for gold. This is why Scott can give Scottish banking the somewhat
                  paradoxical epithet of “practical system.” It is a system, to be sure, but it is
                  one that embodies the dynamics of real practice and not the enthusiasms of theory.
                  As a system, then, Scottish financial practicality is something to be admired, a
                  mark or “impress” (as I quoted early) of their national spirit. </p>
               <p>The association of Scottish bankers and “the Northern Athenians” points to a
                  speculative strain of early nineteenth-century Scottish economic thought. This is
                  not the political economy of Ricardo and McCulloch that “rose” in the period just
                  prior to the 1825 crash, and strongly influenced the policy decisions made after
                  it, but a conservative economics that looked to the country estate rather than the
                  trading house for its guarantees against “rashness.” For what scholars of this
                  period often overlook is that the field we call “political economy” consisted of a
                  wide variety of doctrines and perspectives; these differences, moreover, had a
                  profound influence on the ways money was used and defined during the 1810s and
                  1820s. The root of this branching tree of monetary positions, surprisingly, is
                  Adam Smith’s <title level="m">Wealth of Nations</title> (1776). Smith actually
                  offers two quite distinct theories of money. The first, in Book I, chapter 4,
                     <title level="a">Of the Origin and Use of Money,</title> cribbed from Francis
                  Hutcheson’s <title level="m">System of Moral Philosophy</title>, uses classical
                  history and legal arguments to suggest that the value of money lies not only in
                  the scarcity and utility of precious metals but, more importantly, in the “virtue”
                  of those governments that have been able to keep the inherent value that results
                  from the scarcity pure (2.53-64). This historical aesthetics was given pride of
                  place by Dugald Stewart in his lectures on political economy at the University of
                  Edinburgh and then disseminated throughout England by his students Francis Horner,
                  Henry Brougham, James Mackintosh, and James Mill in several articles in the <title
                     level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>. Smith’s second chapter on money, in Book
                  II, chapter 2, <title level="a">Of Money Considered as a particular Branch of the
                     general Stock of the Society</title> is a much more technical description of
                  the way money circulates in relation to other forms of capital. It is here that
                  Smith warns that an extensive paper money system was only so many “wagons in air”
                  borne by “Daedalian wings.” Smith argued here that the most effective way of
                  regulating paper credit is not to associate it with unadulterated coin, but to
                  limit it to small communities in which the various borrowers and lenders are
                  already known to each other and to terms of short, manageable durations: the
                  so-called “Real Bills Doctrine.” By contrast to the defense of gold, this more
                  nuanced defense of paper credit was appropriated by financial experts and bankers
                  to give some credence to their actions during the wartime financial crash—most
                  notably the continuation of the suspension of cash payments—though by and large
                  they appealed to practical expediency more often than they did philosophical
                  precedent. </p>
               <p>The “bullion controversy,” the pamphlet war debating the link between the market
                  price of gold and the amount of banknotes in circulation that took place between
                  1809 and 1812, was a contest between those who appealed to Smith’s classical
                  theory of value and those who looked to his modern account of paper credit. But
                  after the war, there was a shift in the intellectual valence of this debate.
                  Smith’s historical account of the gold standard gave way to David Ricardo’s
                  argument in his <title level="m">Principles of Political Economy and
                     Taxation</title> (1817) that money does not need a standard of value. The ebb
                  and flow of commodities and exchange is all the market needs. For Ricardo,
                  exchange value was determined only by market forces and had nothing to do with
                  utility. Corn, which had held pride of place as the most useful commodity
                  available, was valuable only to the extent of its supply or demand. Labour, the
                  ultimate source of value, was marginal to the exchange value of the commodities
                  produced by it. For Ricardo and his followers—notably J. R. McCulloch who
                  popularized Ricardo’s ideas in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> and
                  elsewhere—the economy had no symbolic guarantees, no inherent values. It was a
                  diverse field of competing interests and, for the first time, classes:
                  agriculturalists vs. merchants vs. labourers. And it was this model of economic
                  diversity that drove the consolidation of economic policy after the crisis of
                  1825. </p>
               <p>In response to these developments, conservative critics complained that economy
                  was loquacious, impenetrable, and ultimately self-serving on one hand and built on
                  little more than pure self-interest on the other. <note place="foot"
                     resp="editors" n="10">As Peacock pithily remarked, it was “the real art of
                     talking about the imaginary art of teaching every man his own business” (321).
                     Many of these conservative attacks came from Scotland. Writing in <title
                        level="j">Blackwood’s</title> in 1824, the conservative critic and
                     philosopher John Wilson claimed that “political economy cannot be studied with
                     advantage and satisfaction in the modern writers on the subject, by any person
                     who wishes to be convinced of the soundness of its first principles;—who
                     expects perspicacity, consistency, and accurate reasoning in the deductions
                     from these principles, or to find them applicable to, and explanatory of what
                     is occurring, or sure guides in the advancement and acquisition of social
                     wealth” because it is so replete with “obscurity, contradiction, and ambiguity
                     in the use of words [and] illogicalness in reasoning.” </note> But behind these
                  complaints, many of them Scottish in origin, lay a counter-model of economic
                  organization. Agriculturalists like Sir John Sinclair and Lord Lansdowne argued in
                  pamphlet after pamphlet that the benevolent state, modeled on the manor, should
                  control the economy paternalistically. The guarantee of this control was the
                  managerial acumen and moral fiber of the benevolent landowner. Many were prepared
                  to accept Ricardo’s practical account of how the market economy worked, though
                  they refuted his claim that capitalism was the only possible basis for the idea of
                  economic or, more to the point, social value. In an 1817 issue of <title level="j"
                     >Blackwood’s</title>, for instance, John Gibson Lockhart wrote a positive
                  review of Ricardo’s <title level="m">Principles</title>. But he followed it with a
                  blistering attack on McCulloch’s claim that Ricardo had proven that the various
                  classes of society exist in a state of perpetual antagonism. “If political
                  economists chuse to depart from the common use of language,” Lockhart wrote, to
                  label the relations between classes “a perpetual opposition of interests, and,
                  consequently, a state of perpetual hostility, let them have the consistency to
                  call it a <emph>general</emph> opposition of interests; and let the rest of
                  mankind admit that, if in one sense they be mutual enemies, in a more
                  comprehensive view of the matter, they are mutual friends and cannot do without
                  one another.” This contention leads Lockhart to compare the benefits of landed
                  property and inherited wealth against the cut-throat competitiveness of the
                  Ricardian marketplace: <quote>a rich man, like a watering-pan in the hands of
                     Providence, serves to diffuse more generally and usefully the means of
                     subsistence while the envious absurdity of the human heart grudges even
                     existence to that which feeds it! As if the flesh of our bodies should rise, in
                     unhallowed insurrection, against the heart. All would be watering-pans, all
                     would be hearts; but this is not the order of nature nor of Providence, which
                     must ultimately prevail. After derangement shall be succeeded by derangement,
                     and revolution to revolution—after having exhausted all the forms of madness of
                     misery, of murder, and of blood, it is only by returning to the order and
                     subordination of nature, that wretched and weary mortals can escape from
                     anarchy and despotism, and expect to find, if not happiness, at least safety
                     and repose. (59)</quote> In one way, this is a paternalist argument in which

                  to a moral claim that once the competitive marketplace collapses, a “natural”

               <p>Temperamentally, Scott sympathized with Sinclair, Lockhart, and other conservative
                  critics: the true standard of value lay in the symbolic order of the country
                     estate.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">Lockhart is performing a fairly

                     toward redemption from the rather fraught present as described by Ferguson.
                     Scott recounted a similar scheme in a chapter entitled <title level="a">The
                        Progress of Civilized Society</title> that opened the second series of
                        <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> (1828). For more see my
                        <title level="a">Scott and Political Economy</title> in <title level="m">The
                        Edinburgh Companion to Walter Scott</title>. </note> Indeed, my sense is
                  that Scott’s description of Scottish banking in the <title level="m">Letters of
                     Malachi Malagrowther</title> comes directly from this Blackwoodian branch of
                  conservative economic thought, the roots of which lie in the same Smithian
                  economics as the Ricardian’s branch. To be sure, Scott was conscious of his own
                  dependence on “speculation”—the flow of capital that sold his books—that he never
                  endorsed outright his contemporaries’ more extreme paternalism. But his admiration
                  for the practical “republic” and “tribunals” of Scottish finance, based like
                  Lockhart’s “nature” on the traditional confidence of the country estate, at times
                  led Scott, as it did Wilson, Lockhart, and others, toward a more affective, even
                  violent defense. Several times in the letters, Scott hints that the Scots might
                  take up arms to defend their financial liberty, such as the moment when he alludes
                  to the magically-numbered “45” Scottish members of Parliament or refers to the
                  government as “the enemy.” Initially, Scott claims that the “body politic” in
                  Scotland is healthy and thus is in no need of “physic” as the English quack
                  economists seem to think. By the third letter, that same body is being encouraged
                  to lift the blazon for the “auld cause.” Scott’s respondents, including John
                  Wilson Croker, writing in the character of “Edward Bradwardine” disparagingly
                  pointed out the allusions to cudgels and regiments and the lost 45. Respondents
                  were also quick to point out that suspension of cash payments and the credit
                  system it endorsed were instituted and maintained largely for the symbolic purpose
                  of fighting a patriotic war. In <title level="m">Familiar Epistles</title> Daniel
                  Dreadnaught denounced Scott’s argument on precisely these anti-Jacobite grounds.
                  “I abominate the system,” he proclaimed, “which has heaped countless injuries on
                  my country, for the navigation of a river with which she had nothing to do; for
                  the restoration of an old man, about whose concerns we ought to have been
                  regardless, and for the possession of a barren rock!” (11).</p>
               <p>Scott was conscious of these dangers. In a letter to Croker written sometime after
                  the Malagrowther skirmish was over, Scott explained what this rhetoric was meant
                  to accomplish. “Scotland, completely liberalized,” Scott wrote, <quote>will be the
                     most dangerous neighbour to England that she has been since 1639. There is yet
                     time to make a stand, for there is yet a great deal of good and genuine feeling
                     in the country. But if you <emph>unscotch</emph> us you will find us damned
                     mischievous Englishmen. The restless and yet laborious and constantly watchful
                     character of the people, their desire for speculation in politics or any thing
                     else, only restrained by some proud feelings about their own country, now
                     become antiquated and which late measure will tend much to destroy, will make
                     them, under a wrong direction, the most formidable revolutionists who ever took
                     the field of innovation. (qtd. in Croker 3: 318)</quote> Scott’s used of the
                  term “antiquated” is critical here.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="12"> The
                     OED attributes this use of the term “antiquate” to two sources, an <title
                        level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> article of 1821 and a letter from Scott
                     to Lockhart, 1823.</note> As Susan Manning observes, late eighteenth-century
                  antiquarians’ “investment in the immediate pleasures of the particular, without
                  investigation or sublimation of that pleasure, made them vulnerable, in the
                  cultural currency of the eighteenth century not only of incivility but of
                  ‘enthusiasm’, defined as [the] incapacity to link things with thoughts” (63). In a
                  similar way, the “speculative” but “watchful character” of the Scots—the very
                  character that makes their paper credit work—would become an object of antiquarian
                  “investment” or Jacobite nostalgia once outlawed by English policy. Within Scott’s
                  argument on behalf of the confident “republic” of Scottish banking, then, there
                  lies a fiercer, almost overwrought attachment to the symbolic value of Scottish
                  banks as <emph>Scottish</emph>, a commitment with the potential to undermine the
                  confidence, trust, and social stability of the Scottish economy that Scott
                  suggested was its national character. In the final section of this paper, I will
                  argue that this complex array of commitments, sentiments, and misgivings is the
                  thematic crux of <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>. </p>

               <head>Speculation and Comparison in <title level="m">Chronicles of the
                     Canongate</title></head>
               <p>I have been arguing that <title level="m">The Letters of Malachi
                     Malagrowther</title> represent Scott’s attempt to revive an economy of
                  speculation, in the sense of both the unbacked credit system it defends and the
                  spectacular or iconic confidence that it rhetorically conveys, in the face of its
                  loss to the faceless powers of “innovation” and centralized diversification. Many
                  of the fictional and historical works that Scott wrote in the years following the
                  publication of the <title level="m">Letters</title> project that same hoped-for
                  revival. <title level="m">Woodstock</title>, for instance, which Scott began in
                  Autumn 1825 and published in May 1826, concerns Charles II’s escape from the
                  Battle of Woodstock just prior to his flight to France by way of the “Royal Oak”
                  in which it is said he hid. In Scott’s novelization, the Oak is on the Estate of
                  Sir Henry Everard, whose family is divided between Royalist and Parliamentarian
                  sympathies and much of the novel concerns Charles’ various attempts to hide from
                  Cromwell and his proselytizing minions and convince the Everard family of his
                  virtue. He succeeds, and the closing tableau of the novel, set on the day of his
                  Coronation in 1660, might be seen as a testament to Scott’s belief in the power of
                  enlightened monarchy—or at least his hope in its possible revival. </p>
               <p>But by the time he began <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, in
                  mid-1826, much of this renewed confidence had receded to be replaced by its very
                  opposite quality, the perplexity or “embarrassment” that Ricardo had warned
                  against. Not a novel per se but a compendium of linked stories, <title level="m"
                     >Chronicles</title> is already moving away from the hopefulness of <title
                     level="m">Woodstock</title> and the other romances and toward a darker, more
                  fragmented sense of the end of speculative confidence in the face of financial
                  diversification. The frame narrative, which is about Chrystal Croftangry, the last
                  in a line of Scottish landowners who, having squandered the family fortunes,
                  returns to Edinburgh to set up as an antiques dealer, is in itself a quite
                  fully-realized statement of Scott’s misgivings about the possibility of national
                  or Romantic revival. But I want to focus here on what I will describe as a pattern
                  of deliberate misreading in the three stories that make up the <title level="m"
                     >Chronicle</title> all of which point to the failure of the speculative economy
                  that Scott had tried to resurrect. The violent consequences of “antiquing” as
                  Scott warns in his letter to Croker, is the basic theme of the first two stories
                  in <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>. <title level="a">The
                     Highland Widow</title> is the story of Elspeth, wife of the Highland outlaw
                  Hamish McTavish, killed while garrisoned by the English after Culloden, and her
                  son, also Hamish, who refuses to become an outlaw like his father and joins a
                  Scottish regiment to fight in America. When Hamish visits his mother before he is
                  due to depart, she drugs him and, having exceeded his furlough, shoots a sergeant
                  who had come to apprehend him, is taken prisoner, court-martialed, and shot.
                  Elspeth is the literal embodiment of “antiquated” feelings, but more than that she
                  also represents the need to make a symbolic or speculative understanding of life,
                  including money, meaningful at a time when such efforts are overshadowed by modern
                  exchange practices. In a memorable scene, Hamish sends his mother a 5-guinea coin,
                  the proceeds from his enlistment in the Highland regiment; she “remained gazing on
                  the money as if the impress of the coin could have conveyed information how it was
                  procured” (82). Re-employing the metaphor of impression that, in the first
                  Malagrowther letter, Scott had used to define both the national feeling behind the
                  distinct cohesiveness of Scottish banking and its grounding in Scottish empirical
                  philosophy, Scott has Elspeth deliberately fail to read the coin and misunderstand
                  its now strictly economic function. For Scott, coins, like the monarchs whose
                  faces are imprinted on them, have both symbolic value and financial value as
                  guarantees of the vitality of the nation. But to Elspeth, whose whole world is
                  appreciable <emph>only</emph> as a series of meaningful icons, the systemic
                  “meaning” of coins as instruments of fluid exchange makes no sense. </p>
               <p><title level="a">The Two Drovers</title> is a complex tale about a Highland
                  cattleman, Robin Oig, and his sometime English friend, also a cowman, Harry
                  Wakefield. Having made their way to Cumberland, Oig and Wakefield unfortunately
                  negotiate respectively with the squire and the bailiff for the same pasture. When
                  the two arrive at the local alehouse, Wakefield is egged on by his fellow
                  Englishman to challenge Oig, who initially refuses to fight, but then when
                  provoked, stabs Wakefield with his dirk, which he had been keeping in trust for a
                  lowland drover. Again, feelings and sensations become focused on an object which
                  then becomes the means of a proto-revolutionary murder. The crisis at the heart of
                  the “Two Drovers” is the substitution of Oig’s economy of trust and honour with an
                  economy of omnipresent though invisible reason. The presiding judge at Oig’s trial
                  offers this general assessment of what <emph>should have</emph> happened:
                     <quote>The first object of civilization is to place the general protection of
                     the law, especially administered, in the room of the wild justice, which every
                     man cut and carved for himself, according to the length of his sword and the
                     strength of his arm. The law says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior
                     to that of the Deity, “Vengeance is mine.” The instant there is time for
                     passion to cool, and reason to interpose, an injured party must become aware,
                     that the law assumes the exclusive cognizance of the right and wrong betwixt
                     the parties, and opposes her inviolable buckler to every attempt of the private
                     party to right itself. (146)</quote> What I want to stress here is Scott’s
                  sense that law can also become the “buckler” of retribution. This is a clear case
                  of what Foucault called a disciplinary process: a law-abiding “subject” is created
                  out of an external injunction to suppress certain feelings of desire or
                  self-identification. Through education people are taught to respect civility. But
                  if they transgress that civility the law “antiquates” into its archaic violent
                  form. The relationship between law and subject also changes from one based on
                  mutual respect to one based on affective responses and overt domination. The
                  danger of any symbolic system, no matter how rational or unifying it may be, is
                  that it has the potential to become violent, especially for the sake of its
                  coherence.</p>
               <p>Similar complexities surround Richard Middlemas, the ambitious anti-hero of <title
                     level="a">The Surgeon’s Daughter.</title> The longest of the three tales,
                  really a novella in its own right, <title level="a">The Surgeon’s Daughter</title>
                  tells the story of Menie Gray, daughter of the Selkirk doctor, Gideon Gray, and
                  the rivals for her hand, the doctor’s two students, Adam Hartley and Richard
                  Middlemas, the latter the ward of Dr. Gray. Famous for its setting in colonial
                  India (a setting in which not one but <emph>two</emph> colonial British armies
                  operate, the regulars and the East India Company’s, the latter to which both
                  Middlemas and General Tresham/Witherington belong), most of the story focuses on
                  the circumstances and consequences of Middlemas’ birth. His parents, we eventually
                  learn, are the eloping General, then only a captain, who is also both a Jacobite
                  and a Catholic, and the daughter of a wealthy Portugese-Jewish merchant who pays
                  Middlemas’ adopted Highland guardian, Dr. Gray, for his upkeep without any regard
                  or fondness. Middlemas’ claim in early-adolescence that he is a “free-born
                  Englishman” is ironic not only because he in conventional terms anything but, but
                  also because his lineage acts to demonstrate just how fetishistic such national
                  designations are becoming in an increasingly global economy. </p>
               <p>Scott’s financial metaphors focus on the interplay between the economics of
                  exchange and the affective power of persuasion and (self-) love. The scene in
                  which Middlemas confronts his parents is a parody of similar scenes of familial
                  recognition, such as, for instance, at the end of Burney’s <title level="m"
                     >Evelina</title>. In Scott’s take, instead of “seeing” his parents as the
                  fulfillment of his ambition to discover his “true” identity, Middlemas abjects
                  them: “O, my more than father… how much greater a debt do I owe to you than to the
                  unnatural parents, who brought me into this world by their sin, and deserted me
                  through their cruelty!” (231). The result of this ignorant declaration is complete
                  confusion: Zilia dies after bashing out a discordant lament on the harpsichord
                  while the General forces his son to “look upon [his] parents who [he] hast so much
                  envied—whom thou hast so often cursed. Look at that pale emaciated form, a figure
                  of wax, rather than flesh and blood—that is thy mother—that is, the unhappy Zilia
                  de Moncada, to whom thy birth was the source of shame and misery, and to whom thy
                  ill-omened presence hath now brought death itself” (232). He then rages into a
                  fury and threatens to kill his other children. The General’s, Zilia’s, and
                  Middlemas’ understanding of themselves are revealed in this moment not to be
                  ratified by a hidden bond, but rather by their individual miscomprehension of
                  their systematic existences. Once set into contention by the exposure of this
                  system, the organization breaks down. </p>
               <p>The tragedy, then, is that the standard of value that might underlie the
                  characters’ attempts to vindicate themselves before the others or serve as a
                  possible point of comparison between them has been replaced by a new standard of
                  systemic inevitability, much as the symbolic standards trusted by Oig are replaced
                  at the end of the story by the “buckler” of the law. Not even Hartley and Menie
                  Grey can withstand the “agitation” and “shock” of the events of their story:
                  Hartley dies of a colonial disease two years later and Menie refuses to marry
                  probably in memory of Hartley but also in her continual irrational devotion to
                  Richard. Once again affection undermines security. This is not to say that the
                  novella does not <emph>suppose</emph> a standard, that is, of fetishistic glamour
                  of wealth and adventure such as is presented to Richard Middlemas by his credulous
                  Nurse and Tom Hilary. But at the same time, it also presents to us the way in
                  which these fantasies circulate as, in a word, systems and by extension, empires.
                  As Tara Ghoshal Wallace observes, it is “such instances of the reality of imperial
                  fantasies that constructs the imperial identity” (322). The trouble is, it is not
                  the imperial fantasy that wins, but rather the ebb and flow of a diversified
                  global capitalism. </p>
               <p>Yet, I would also venture to suggest that <title level="a">The Surgeon’s
                     Daughter</title> provides a different kind of standard to <emph>both</emph> the
                  “fantasy” of glory that Scott associates with empire <emph>and</emph> the systemic
                  intransigence of finance. In a strange scene, Hartley and Menie are on their way
                  into the interior of India when they come upon the near-lifeless body of Sadhu
                  Sing and hear the story of how his bride was taken from him on their wedding day
                  by a tiger. Via Hartley, the narrator makes the rather facile analogy between this
                  story and “the probable fate of [Menie] almost within the grasp of a more
                  formidable tiger than that whose skeleton lay beside Sadhu Sing” (271), the Indian
                  Prince for whom Middlemas fought and whose wedding is disrupted by a tiger attack.
                  But Scott also makes us aware that a comparison between these two marriages is
                     <emph>possible</emph>: at the creek in the jungle, “the travelers stopped to
                  drink, and to refresh themselves and their horses; and it was near this spot that
                  Hartley saw a sight which forced him to compare the subject which engrossed his
                  own thoughts, with the distress that had afflicted another” (270). Scott is here
                  projecting a frame of reference outside the narrative that will be able to bring
                  the two “systems” of the story—the British and the Indian—into a hybrid
                  construction. They are not the same, as the narrative makes clear, for Menie’s
                  fate is <emph>not</emph> that of Sing’s bride, any more than Scottish farms
                  cultivated by free credit (as Scott describes in the <title level="m">Letters of
                     Malachi Malagrowther</title>) are the same as the “impenetrable thicket” that
                  the plain has become once war has “suspended the labours of industry” (270). The
                  end of the tale offers not a speculative vision of imperial or financial unity
                  that might regulate or oppose the flow of finance, but rather an opportunity to
                  view both the failure of speculation and the consolidation of capital flow as
                  parts of a constellated object of a critical and comparative judgment, to see
                  them, that is, <emph>as</emph> the “thicket” that they really are once the
                  “labours” and “industry” of narrative are over. </p>
               <p>In this way, <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, provides a
                  standard of comparison through which various cultures can be measured against each
                  other—Britain and India, Scotland and England, The Highlands and India—which is
                  apparent, in a way that the consolidated standard of financial diversification is
                     <emph>not</emph>, in the tensions and contradictions of literary form. This is
                  not the same thing as saying that Scott invents an imperial ideology, for there is
                  no specific imperial agenda associated with the standard of comparison as such.
                  The novel neither represents a standard (on the contrary all its speculative,
                  monarchical figures are either absent, corrupt, or destroyed) nor embodies a
                  particular economic system (as the <title level="m">Letters</title> had done).
                  Rather, the text itself, viewed as a collective whole, is an effect of the
                  continual comparisons between different economic and cultural systems, manifest in
                  the antiquarian tendencies of Croftangry and in the process of reading that he and
                  other collectors in the frame narrative exemplify. By contrast to his polemical
                  writings, Scott’s fiction allows us to recognize the conflicts and unevenness of
                  the economic field by staging their de-consolidation. In this respect, while the
                  Waverley Novels might be partly responsible for popularizing and acclimatizing the
                  “heroism” of capitalism’s entrepreneurial spirit, they can also be seen to
                  foreshadow the kinds of formal and logical critiques of capitalism, both
                  conservative and radical, that would emerge in the nineteenth century and after.
