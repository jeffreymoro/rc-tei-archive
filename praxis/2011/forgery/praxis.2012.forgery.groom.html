               <p>Forgery studies have developed rapidly in the past few years. No longer confined to
                  “fakelit”—the “original” literary forgeries of Chatterton, the controversies surrounding
                  Macpherson’s Ossian and W. H. Ireland’s Shakespeare, and the cultural hoaxes of eighteenth-century
                  antiquarianism—forgery has moved into such areas as the law and character impersonation.
                  The current work of Lionel Bently, as well as that of Simon Stern, is, for example,
                  scrutinizing notions of copying within the legal frameworks of intellectual property
                  and copyright legislation in the eighteenth century, a field tackled in a different
                  way by Richard Terry’s recent book on literary accusations of plagiarism. Jack Lynch,
                  meanwhile, has approached the subject from the opposite perspective, focusing on the
                  practice of detection. In contrast, Margaret Russett, Debbie Lee, and others have
                  focused attention on the proliferation of impostors and fraudsters in the Romantic
                  period.</p>
               <p>The activities of these variously fraudulent writers and performers—these “texts”—may
                  have been hinted at in earlier work on forgery, but it is most heartening to see it
                  is now bearing rich fruit. And the papers collected here reveal that, influenced in
                  part by the work of Mary Poovey and Margot Finn, another, significant area of forgery
                  studies is emerging in literary finance and forgery. These four essays all, in very
                  different ways, examine the implications that the anxieties and politics surrounding
                  financial fraud had in the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>It is notable that this work concentrates on the first two decades of the century.
                  As Ian Haywood argues, the Bank Restriction Act, which released the Bank of England
                  from issuing metal currency in exchange for paper banknotes, precipitated a credit
                  crisis that exposed “Britain’s system of paper money as tantamount to a form of legalized
                  counterfeiting”, with the result that the entire political system risked becoming
                  effectively a “fraud.” Restriction undermined the system of credit, but it also led
                  to a huge increase in the number of executions for forgery. As Phil Handler puts it,
                  these trials and hangings “provided a stark public reminder of the evils of the paper
                  system and the unreliability of Bank of England notes.” They also galvanized opposition
                  to the government’s financial controls. As Alex Benchimol points out, radical publications
                  such as <em>Black Dwarf</em> campaigned against forgery prosecutions. Haywood’s interest here is in investigating
                  the imaginative implications of counterfeit banknotes, a fascinating link that could
                  connect the whole project of Romanticism with the credit crisis. Specifically in this
                  essay, he examines the figure and work of the engraver, demonstrating that “Romantic-period
                  anxieties about authenticity and value achieved a spectacular visual form in the ‘formidable’
                  power of the caricaturist.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There is perhaps a striking parallel for today’s readers to jokes made about the recent
                     Bank of England’s policy of “quantitative easing”, which has been compared with counterfeiting—and
                     also caricatured.

                              of the sort of jokes that have circulated on the internet, this comic parable derives
                              from http://www.edugeek.net, but is apparently much older than the current crisis:
                              It’s a slow day in a little Scottish town. The sun is beating down, and the streets
                              are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.
                              On this particular day a rich tourist from down south is driving through town. He
                              stops at the motel and lays a £50 note on the desk saying he wants to inspect the
                              rooms upstairs…</span></div>
                     </div> But the historical context is also compelling. Things had been very different in the
                     early eighteenth-century. As Thomas Levenson has shown, Sir Isaac Newton’s innovations
                     at the Royal Mint were designed to maintain the integrity of the physical fact of
                     the coin. It was Newton who pioneered the use of milled edges to coins and the motto,
                     “<span class="foreign">decus et tutamen</span>” (“an ornament and a safeguard”) to ensure that coins could not be clipped (it is
                     also worth noting that he attended the executions of coiners who fell foul of his
                     minting techniques). But over the course of the century the prevalence of paper money
                     eventually created a profoundly different economic environment. Paper was not bullion—it
                     had no inherent value. There were not even objective criteria for determining what
                     constituted an authentic note, and attempts to create a forgery-proof banknote were
                     a constant reminder of the threat of counterfeit bills. Moreover, the persistent slippage
                     between literary and financial forgery (a slippage over the period that has been examined
                     in detail by Paul Baines) meant that the rhetoric of the economy was laced with the
                     terminology of fiction. No wonder it provided abundant raw materials for caricature.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The credit crisis (with its attendant language of forgery) also pervaded the politics
                  of the time. Benchimol himself considers the production, representation, and circulation
                  of radical knowledge to show that there was an explicit radical campaign against the
                  system of paper money. William Cobbett energetically exposed the mystifications of
                  the financial system, which, he argued, was spectral: it had no bodily existence and
                  paper money had merely imaginary value. The system was, according to Cobbett, “profoundly
                  immoral, unjust, and constructed upon an unsustainable foundation of monetary abstractions.”
                  His response was to outline a mass campaign of active resistance. Cobbett argued that
                  it was the act of <em>uttering</em> (that is, passing as legal tender) forged paper bills that brought the charge of
                  forgery and led to the gallows; he therefore attacked the circulation of paper money
                  by proposing that forged notes be cast about in the streets for anyone to pick up,
                  unuttered.</p>
               <p>This shift in forgery studies towards legal property and financial forgery also offers
                  opportunities to reconsider authenticity. In legal and financial areas the definitions
                  of forgery and counterfeit are conflated and wholly entangled, and this informs recent
                  work by Robert Hopkins, who argues that aesthetic meanings of forgery should be governed
                  by establishing artistic intentions, in essence mimicking the legal definition of
                  the crime of forgery. Yet it is clear that the distinction between forgery as an “original”
                  composition attributed to another, and counterfeit as an exact copy of a pre-existent
                  work remains a valuable distinction—if only in aesthetics.</p>
               <p>In one of two essays of literary criticism here, Robert Miles pursues the relationship
                  between aesthetics and economics by usefully arguing that forgery is a “hinge” linking
                  the two systems. Focusing on Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em>, he discovers that the “social imaginary” of the novel is wholly underpinned by economic
                  values: in particular, the endeavours to “realise” cash by turning it into land and
                  hence political influence. The internalization of such values, brought about by the
                  credit crisis and resulting boom-and-bust economy, generates the conditions for the
                  understanding of value and its circulation throughout the text: Miles argues that
                  Austen “through her economic interests … finds a language for exploring a world where
                  value is inescapably contingent.”</p>
               <p>Miles’s earlier work on impostors encourages Alex Dick to analyse the figure of the
                  Byronic rogue Sir Gregor MacGregor as an impostor or fraudster inspired in part by
                  Walter Scott’s <em>Waverley</em>. Scott’s money troubles literally underwrote his work and obliged him to mortgage
                  his future writing—consequently readers should be on the alert whenever Scott describes
                  the economy. Dick argues that in Scotland, financial speculation was presented as
                  the solution to the problem of economic diversification, which neatly explains Scott’s
                  tendency in his fiction to present speculative economies as failing economies. Dick’s
                  work is also an important reminder that Scotland retained some degree of economic
                  autonomy compared with the rest of Great Britain (as it does to this day)—an archipelagic
                  perspective that enables Scott’s fiction to become an “instrument of comparison” between
                  different cultures.</p>
               <p>These four essays therefore indicate some of the directions that this field may take.
                  There will be others: more work is needed for example on the Gold Standard and the
                  national debt (Haywood reveals that by 1821 it was 2.7 times the national income),
                  and it would be good to see legal historians, economic historians, and literary historians
                  work together to trace, for example, counterfeiting, plagiarism, and the emergence
                  of copyright through the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth century. In the
                  meantime, these studies afford a new opportunity to reassess literary finance and
                  forgery in the period.</p>
