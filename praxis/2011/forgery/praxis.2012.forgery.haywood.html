                  <p>The topic of literary forgery in the eighteenth century and Romantic period has become
                     something of a boom industry in the last few decades.

                     </div> Since I published my own studies on this theme in the 1980s (<em>The Making of History</em> and <em>Faking It</em>), scholarly interest in this area has burgeoned and has contributed much to the remapping
                     and redefining of literary history in this period. One reason for this renaissance
                     is undoubtedly that the eighteenth century is so rich in primary sources. The literary
                     forgeries of the “big three” still continue to fascinate scholars: I refer here of
                     course to James Macpherson, who invented an ancient Scottish epic poet called Ossian;
                     Thomas Chatterton, the boy wonder of Bristol who fabricated a series of poems and
                     other documents supposedly written in the fifteenth century; and William Henry Ireland,
                     who “discovered” a new play by Shakespeare, <em>Vortigern and Rowena</em>. Some of the scholarly interest in these figures and other forgers has been motivated
                     by nationalistic affiliations: the “Ossianic Celtic revival” has produced solid studies
                     by, among others, Fiona Stafford and Howard Gaskill, while Mary Ann Constantine has
                     recently championed the Welsh antiquarian scholar-forger Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams).
                     Other work has perhaps been stimulated by post-Foucauldian concerns about the vexed
                     yet intriguing relationship between creative authorship, originality, and authenticity.
                     As Debbie Lee notes in her chapter on 
                     “Forgeries”
                      in <em>Romanticism: An Oxford Guide</em> (and this inclusion is itself symptomatic of the resurgence I am describing), “One
                     of the things impostors and forgers make strikingly clear is the period’s idolatrous
                     worship of authenticity and truth” (521). Chief among the iconoclasts determined to
                     expose Romanticism’s “idolatrous worship of authenticity and truth” is Nick Groom,
                     whose book <em>The Forger’s Shadow</em> (2002) represents the most sophisticated and searching re-evaluation of the impact
                     of forgery on our conceptions of authorship and authenticity. Groom goes so far as
                     to state that Romanticism “(for want of a better term) would have been very different
                     without literary forgery—indeed it may not have recognisably existed at all” (<em>Forger’s Shadow</em> 15); hence the subtitle of his book, 
                     “How Forgery Changed the Course of Literature.”
                     </p>
               </div>
               <p>Groom’s book, together with recent studies by Debbie Lee, Margaret Russett, Jack Lynch
                  and Robert Miles provide clear evidence that forgery studies have expanded well beyond
                  those paradoxically-defined “original” fakes of the Big Three (supposedly ancient
                  or renowned works of the past actually authored in the present and as such qualifying
                  as new, “valid” creative texts). Forgery now embraces aspects of canonical authors’
                  poetic practice (such as plagiarism), but increasingly there is an interest in the
                  colourful cases of exotic hoaxes and imposture, a tradition which begins with the
                  sprightly career of the “Formosan” rogue George Psalmanazar. Indeed, the Romantic
                  impostor has graduated into the heroic performer of Butlerian, transgressive gender
                  and identity politics, most notably in the examples of Joanna Southcott (who claimed
                  to be the bride of Christ) and the servant Mary Wilcox/Baker, alias “Princess Caraboo
                  of Javasu.” As Groom remarks on Debbie Lee’s <em>Romantic Liars: Obscure Women who became Impostors and Challenged an Empire</em> (2006), “Lee’s impostors are women who disguised themselves to create social opportunities,
                  which they lacked through gender and class prejudice” (
                  “Romanticism and Forgery”
                  ). This cast of Romantic impostors continues to grow and is not restricted to one
                  gender. One important and lively figure whom Lee overlooks and who takes the theme
                  of forgery into the furthest regions of the British Empire is George Barrington, a
                  celebrated “Prince of pickpockets” who was transported to Australia in 1791 where
                  he supposedly wrote several pioneering biographical accounts of Botany Bay and New
                  South Wales. As Nathan Garvey’s excellent study shows, these influential books were
                  actually fabrications produced by unscrupulous publishers cashing in on Barrington’s
                  celebrity.</p>
               <p>As these examples demonstrate, the subversive credentials of forgery continue to generate
                  historical curiosity and scholarly passions. In Groom’s words, literary forgers are
                  “by turns spectral, mad, illegitimate and elusive; vilified, criminalised, excluded
                  from the canon” ("Romanticism and Forgery"). However, one area of Romantic forgery
                  which remains under-explored is financial forgery; to be precise, the massive counterfeiting
                  of banknotes which emerged from the credit crisis of the Romantic period. The contemporary
                  tone of the phrase “credit crisis” is quite intentional, as there are some striking
                  (if depressing) parallels between the collapse of faith in paper money which occurred
                  in the early nineteenth century and the current desperate measures to restore faith
                  in an international monetary system based on credit and colossal levels of national
                  debt. In one sense this recurrence attests to Romanticism’s failure to prevent credit
                  becoming (in Brantlinger’s words) “a basic, unavoidable aspect of modern money and
                  modern economic processes” (139) yet, as Brantlinger’s fine study shows, the Romantic
                  period saw some of the most illuminating analyses of credit by both its supporters
                  (such as Coleridge) and its radical critics (such as Blake, Cobbett and Shelley) (114-35).
                  The stakes were extremely high: the controversy about credit struck not only at the
                  roots of national wealth and security but also at the emerging idea of culture as
                  a civilising force which both resisted and transcended commercialism. “Paper” was
                  therefore a massively ambiguous symbol of both the fraudulent power of the state and
                  the democratic medium of print culture and the press. If the problem for Romantic
                  writers was to try to reconcile this contradiction, one course of action was relatively
                  easy: if “paper” was illusory and dangerous, critics of credit could restate their
                  faith in “real” gold and silver. But a remaining concern for “currency radicals” (Poovey
                  220) was that the rejection of what Cobbett called the “paper promises” of a debt-ridden
                  system did not necessarily reveal a new source of value outside the (dis-credited)
                  economy: what would be the literary or cultural manifestation of the absent gold standard?
                  Hence the Romantic credit crisis may well have sharpened and deepened the Romantic
                  quest for an “egotistical sublime” and a redemptive concept of culture uncontaminated
                  by materialism, conformity and commodification (Williams, chapters 1-2).</p>
               <p>However, it was not the suspension of cash payments alone but another controversy
                  which pushed the paper-money scam to the forefront of public debate: the spectacular
                  increase in the number of executions for forgery. It was the severity of Britain’s
                  “bloody” penal code which heightened and inflamed public opinion about the invidious
                  connections between paper money and unreformed political power. This theme has been
                  neglected by scholars of both Romantic forgery and the credit crisis, so it is to
                  be hoped that the essays in this volume will open up some new lines of investigation
                  and provide some interesting case studies. For opponents of paper money the public
                  execution of hundreds of lower-class victims of petty forgery crimes (the handling
                  of fake one-pound banknotes) was a spectacular display of the evils of an unreformed
                  state which relied on a credit economy to pursue its goals. As the essays in this
                  volume show, the shockwaves of these judicial crimes reverberate throughout the literature
                  and culture of the Regency period and beyond—all that is needed are the methodological
                  sensors to detect the tremors.</p>
               <p>My own interest in Romantic financial forgery takes up in a quite literal way the
                  idea that forgery spectacularized the contradictions of the credit economy. The anti-hero
                  of my essay is not the literary forger or bravura impostor but the spectral figure
                  of the engraver: the generic producer of, on the one hand, both genuine and counterfeit
                  currency and, on the other, the “shadow” economy of popular graphic caricatures. By
                  giving the forgery controversy a visual turn, I show that Romantic-period anxieties
                  about authenticity and value achieved a form of visual apotheosis through the “formidable”
                  power of the caricaturist (and the source and significance of that word “formidable”
                  will be revealed later). I propose that Romantic-period caricature actually flourished
                  within the credit and forgery crisis, finding a fertile cultural climate for its own
                  paper economy of “fake” or falsifying representations, and exploring in an inimitably
                  effective way the dubious logic of a system built on “paper promises.”</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>On 25 February 1797, “a day which will long be remembered”, according to William Cobbett
                     (149), Prime Minister William Pitt went to see the King for an emergency meeting.
                     The country was in a state of national alarm, as news had just arrived of a French
                     invasion at Fishguard. In fact this turned out to be easily repelled (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure1.jpg">Figure 1</a>), but the incident forced Pitt to consider an option he had resisted for some time.
                     Fearing that there would be a run on the Bank of England which would in turn damage
                     the financing of the war against France, he persuaded the King to issue (what turned
                     out to be) a momentous decree: starting immediately, the Bank would no longer issue
                     specie (cash or metal currency) in exchange for paper banknotes. The Bank Restriction
                     Act, as it later passed into law, is a somewhat misleading title, as it actually led
                     to a massive expansion of paper money. Specifically, the Act authorized the mass production
                     of new £1 and £2 banknotes to replace the withdrawn specie, and it was this literal
                     cheapening of the currency which would prove to be so disastrous in its social consequences.
                     The explosion of paper money was seized on immediately by James Gillray, the period’s
                     leading caricaturist. In his wonderful print <em>Midas</em>, published just a few weeks after Restriction came into force (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure2.jpg">Figure 2</a>), Pitt is shown as a colossus squatting over the Rotunda of the Bank of England which
                     serves him like a toilet. From both his rear end and his mouth Pitt is showering the
                     Bank with the new low denomination notes which also make up his paper crown. We will
                     return to this image throughout this essay as it forms one of the most iconic responses
                     to the credit crisis, matched only by George Cruikshank’s <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> which we will meet shortly. Note that Gillray foregrounds Pitt’s megalomania and plays
                     down the culpability of the Bank: obviously, at this very early stage he could not
                     have foreseen the Bank’s role in securing convictions for forgery and the ensuing
                     public outrage this engendered. Originally, Restriction was meant to last only six
                     months, but as the credit crisis persisted the Act was renewed continually until specie
                     payment was eventually reintroduced in 1821, by which time the national debt was an
                     astonishing £854 million, or 2.7 times the national income (O’Brien 179). During its
                     24-year reign (which dovetails quite neatly with a large slice of the Romantic period),
                     Restriction provoked a storm of controversy which is still under-valued in Romantic
                     studies. Though the topic is mentioned in a number of books on forgery, the issue
                     of forgery remains marginal in the seminal studies of the role of credit in British
                     culture.

                     </div> But in light of the fact that, as Margot Finn notes, an “aversion to paper money”
                     was “deeply rooted in Georgian England” (80) this theme clearly deserves more exploration.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There were two major problems with Restriction. The first was that it seemed to undermine
                     the very system of credit which it was supposedly safeguarding. Charles James Fox
                     called the stoppage of cash payments “the first day of our national bankruptcy” (Richard,
                     1: 84). But, as we shall see, the Restriction crisis actually exposed deeper contradictions
                     which had bedevilled the British “financial revolution” from its inception in the
                     Restoration period (Dickson, chapters 1-2). The second problem with Restriction was

                     Bank of England notes circulated) saw a massive increase in executions for forgery.

                              proceedings” (Thornton, 114). According to Jerome Christensen, a review of Thornton's
                              book in the first issue of the Edinburgh Review was the first recognition of the “revolutionary”

                     </div> Before this time forgery had been largely a white-collar crime. The best-known eighteenth-century
                     forger was probably the Reverend William Dodd, who was executed in June 1777 for forging
                     the signature of his former pupil Lord Chesterfield on a banknote valued at £4,000.
                     Despite Dr Johnson coming to his aid and writing his pleas for clemency, and despite
                     a large petition of 30,000 signatures in his favour, Dodd went to the gallows. As
                     Boswell puts it in his <em>Life of Johnson</em>, Dodd had committed “the most dangerous crime in a commercial country” (828).</p>

                  <p>The second contributing factor to the rise in Restriction forgery was the poor quality
                     of the banknotes which made them easily counterfeited (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure3.jpg">Figure 3</a>). The third factor was something which Gillray could not have foreseen: the ruthlessness
                     of the Bank of England - the “head of all circulation” - in prosecuting offenders.

                     </div> Indeed, the Bank employed a team of lawyers at great expense to ensure prosecutions.
                     The statistics are dramatic: the period 1783-97 saw only four prosecutions for forgery,
                     but 1797-1821 (the Restriction period) saw over 2000 prosecutions and over 300 executions.
                     The Bank spent thousands of pounds to secure these executions, and in some years such
                     as 1819 this amounted to more than was lost through forgery (McGowen para 4). Almost
                     one third of all executions at this time were for forgery, but the vast majority of
                     these were concentrated in the post-Napoleonic war period, when economic depression
                     and demobilization of thousands of troops and sailors produced ever greater incentives
                     for the forger (Handler, 
                     “Forging the Agenda”
                     ). When the government reneged on the original promise to abolish Restriction after
                     six months of peace (which eventually came in 1815), public hostility to the growing
                     body count of convicted forgers and handlers (or “utterers”) became vitriolic. James
                     Mackintosh spoke in parliament of the “course of guilt and blood which had followed

                     practice of press-ganging and crimping - persistently and sensationally exposed the
                     injustices of the forgery trials. Thomas Wooler’s <em>Black Dwarf</em> declaimed that “<em>homicide</em> has been <em>legalized</em>” to defend “the <em>paper bubbles</em> which are dignified with the name of <em>currency</em>” (2 [9 September 1818], 561). In 1818, when almost 30,000 fake banknotes were in
                     circulation, public sympathy for the hapless plebeian forger led to numerous acquittals.

                     a fake from the real banknote. As early as 1814 an anonymous caricature called <em>A Peep into the Rag Shop in Threadneedle Street</em> highlighted this theme. The print shows a poor forger pleading with Bank of England
                     directors who are examining a bank note. As the speech bubbles make clear, behind
                     their callous bluster is dire ineptitude: <span class="quote">‘<em>“Upon my soul I have my doubts but at all events—we had better declare it bad.”<br/> “Take him out Thomas !!! he has a d----d hanging lok.”<br/> “Away with the Vagabond! Do you think we sit here for nothing!”</em>’</span> By the late 1810s, therefore, forgery was no longer, in Handler’s words, a “uniquely
                     subversive” crime which undermined what William Wilberforce called the “vital principle
                     of a commercial nation”, but a dramatic exposure of the eighteenth-century “bloody
                     code” (Handler, 
                     “Forging the Agenda,”
                      264, 263). The response of both the Bank of England and the government to this barrage
                     of criticism was characteristically insensitive: rather than campaigning for leniency,
                     they both launched inquiries aimed at finding a foolproof or “inimitable” design for
                     the banknote. However, the clamour of public opinion was proving to be a formidable
                     force and in 1819 official moves began to review both Restriction and capital punishment.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There could have been no timelier a moment than January 1819, therefore, for the radical
                     publisher William Hone and the leading Regency caricaturist George Cruikshank to issue
                     their own “inimitable” contribution to the Restriction controversy. The <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> and its companion piece the <em>Bank Restriction Barometer</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure4.jpg">Figures 4</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure5.jpg">5</a>) were published just days after the Bank of England’s inquiry concluded that a forgery-proof
                     design had to be robust enough to withstand the “formidable power of imitation” of
                     the engraver (<em>Times</em>, 27 January 1819). Hone and Cruikshank undoubtedly appreciated this ironic tribute
                     to their joint production, as the <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> takes the form of a mock-submission to the inquiry.

                     </div> Unlike earlier satirical banknotes which resembled actual counterfeits (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure6.jpg">Figure 6</a>), the Hone-Cruikshank caricature is more than just a “formidable” imitation which
                     exposes the flimsy authenticity of the original. By using visceral and witty gallows
                     symbolism, Hone and Cruikshank inscribed into the banknote the catastrophic social
                     consequences of its circulation: what <em>Black Dwarf</em> called the “blood-cemented fabric of paper currency” (2 [14 October 1818], 611). Reminiscent
                     of the “blood sugar” anti-slavery propaganda of the 1790s, the <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> defamiliarizes and demonizes everyday consumption, transforming banknotes into emblems
                     of blood money: satirically, this is their true appearance and true value (the Bank’s
                     role as surrogate executioner is evidenced by the replacement of its clerks’ signature
                     with that of Jack Ketch, the notorious hangman of the 1680s).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The national calamity of Restriction can be gauged by comparing Gillray’s efflorescent
                  vision of paper-money inflation with Hone and Cruikshank’s single banknote: with hindsight,
                  Pitt becomes an apocalyptic monster of destruction, spewing out seemingly innocuous
                  and ephemeral scraps of paper which are actually seeds of future calamity. Put another
                  way, Pitt is spreading his malign influence over the Bank to ensure its compliance
                  in devastating the lower classes, those absent or proleptic victims of the new dispensation
                  (Pitt puts John Bull in the Rotunda but he is clearly incongruous). The Midas legend
                  is brilliantly if ironically apt, as the new notes will bring death to those who touch
                  them and ‘restrict’ the body politic in the most debased way possible. Seen in conjunction
                  with Cruikshank’s caricature, the full significance of the catastrophic transformation
                  of “value” under Restriction becomes terrifyingly apparent. In a series of mock-mythic
                  metamorphoses, a whole national narrative of modernity and progress is unravelled:
                  gold transmutes into paper, paper into its forged “shadow”, and this phantom form
                  of circulation is re-incarnated into the “blood” of the nation, an inverted symbol
                  of national well-being. The function of currency as both the literal and symbolic
                  signifier of national wealth and security is systematically dis-credited by satirically
                  re-encoding its semiotic processes as both fantastical and lethal—as if currency is
                  the Gothic alter-ego of caricature itself.</p>

                     the gold standard), and during the same year a parliamentary inquiry into capital
                     punishment focused on forgery as one of the main reasons for reforming Britain’s harsh
                     penal code. In his old age Cruikshank claimed that his print had single-handedly led
                     to the abolition of the death penalty for forgery 13 years later, an exaggeration
                     though a forgivable one.

               <p>But the spectacular achievements of the <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> should not be allowed to overshadow the quiet power of its companion print the <em>Bank Restriction Barometer</em>. Clearly, this print takes a different approach to its companion piece’s mimetic
                  wit. At first sight the <em>Barometer</em> appears to be a simple visual illustration of the radical argument that over-investment
                  in paper currency leads to national ruin, but the satirical dynamic is more complex
                  than this. Many viewers in 1819 would have recognised that the print was a close parody
                  of the Evangelical spiritual barometer of the late eighteenth century (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure7.jpg">Figure 7</a>). In the caricature, the salutary function of the vertical scale is inverted: the
                  overheated economy replaces sublime spiritual redemption and the gravitational security
                  of gold replaces the sins of the flesh (and note that novel reading is calibrated
                  at minus 40!). This parodic allusion makes clear that the satirical target of the
                  <em>Barometer</em> is the quasi-religious “faith” in paper money which, as we shall see, both underpinned
                  and troubled the “financial revolution” from its Williamite origins. But the process
                  of allusion does not end there, as the spiritual barometer first appears in Hogarth’s
                  anti-Methodist caricature <em>Enthusiasm Delineated</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure8.jpg">Figure 8</a>). The echo of Hogarth is, I believe, a self-authorizing reference to the English
                  caricature tradition which first accrued substantial cultural authority by critiquing
                  the new monied interest of the early eighteenth century. Like the fake banknote, the
                  satirical print shadowed, mirrored and exposed the new credit economy throughout its
                  history.</p>

                     </div> the earlier eighteenth century was haunted by the transubstantiation of paper. When
                     Charles James Fox remarked that “the solidity of Notes consisted in their being convertible
                     into cash” (<em>Times</em>, 1 March 1797), he identified that magical process of transformation which underpinned
                     the credit economy and which could maintain the illusion that banknotes were “solid”
                     rather than ephemeral and insubstantial. To its many critics, Pitt’s Restriction Act
                     of 1797 jeopardised the nation by undermining the system of credit and national debt
                     which it was supposedly trying to protect. It was this system of deferred payment
                     which lay behind the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 and which allowed Britain
                     to finance wars and imperial gains well beyond its actual stock of bullion—as Roy
                     Porter puts it succinctly, “Britannia”s wars were won on credit” (132). The genius
                     of the “financial revolution” was that it utilized the foundational economic metaphor
                     of circulation to naturalize and anthropomorphize convertibility:

                     so long as this flow of money is neither “restricted” nor inundated: if one nightmare
                     is economic starvation (as seen in the stereotype of the emaciated French), the other
                     danger—as Gillray imagines—is the inflationary overproduction of worthless and wasteful
                     currency. Another way to read Gillray’s <em>Midas</em> is as a scatological parody of the famous cover illustration to Thomas Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure9.jpg">Figure 9</a>): instead of the monarch comprised of his people, Pitt’s body is a sack of secreted
                     and hoarded gold; the literal and symbolic wealth of the nation becomes the tyrant’s
                     booty, replacing citizens with financial chicanery (Pitt’s incontinent largesse also,
                     unavoidably, brings the current dis-credited euphemism “quantitative easing” to mind).
                     However, behind Gillray’s scatological effects lies a more acute point: by evoking
                     the Midas legend, Gillray exposed the alchemical delusions and perils of the myth
                     of convertibility—indeed, the critique was anticipated in a print of 1796 (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure10.jpg">Figure 10</a>) which shows Pitt as a megalomaniac alchemist who is converting the national wealth
                     into a throne for himself. As Gillray understood, it was the magical properties of
                     paper money which mystified both economic and political power. Even political economists
                     (whether supportive or not) invariably resorted to pre-enlightenment tropes of what
                     Marx called “primitive economic superstition” (261): alchemy, allegory, magic, blind
                     allegiance. Debacles like the South Sea Bubble and the John Law Mississippi scheme
                     (both collapsed in 1720) fuelled the idea that paper credit was a powerful and potentially
                     dangerous illusion.

                     the switch to deferred payment was a “momentous intellectual event.” By locating value
                     in an endlessly receding future, credit changed the whole basis of the individual’s
                     relationship with the state, replacing civic humanist duty with an “imagined” community

               <p>A characteristically ambivalent attitude to paper money can be seen in Joseph Addison’s
                  third <em>Spectator</em> essay (Saturday 3 March 1711). The essay takes the form of an allegorical dream vision
                  of the goddess Credit, a deity who sits on a throne in the Bank of England, surrounded
                  by “a prodigious heap of bags of money” and pyramids of gold piled to the ceiling.
                  It is likely that Addison is alluding to the image of Britannia “sitting and looking
                  on a Bank on Money” which was the logo of banknotes from their earliest issue (Keyworth)
                  and which reassuringly emblematized the “real” value of the note in bullion. Hence
                  Addison likens Credit to the “Lydian king”; Credit can “convert whatever she pleased
                  into that precious metal”—in other words she is a transgendered Midas who guarantees
                  the nation’s wealth with her miraculous powers of transformation. However, at the
                  first sign of political and social unrest the goddess shrivels into a skeleton, the
                  bullion becomes “bags full of wind” and the gold changes into “heaps of paper.” Only
                  when order is restored is the goddess resuscitated and restored to her former beautiful
                  but “delicate” constitution (<em>The Spectator</em>, 1: 17-20).</p>
               <p>Addison’s nervous allegory of the politically unstable rise of paper rule (a “bag
                  full of wind”) was a vivid and influential expression of residual Enlightenment scepticism
                  towards the new faith of “speculative fantasy” (Nicholson 10). Alexander Pope delivered
                  a poetic broadside against the new orthodoxy in <em>Epistle III: To Allen Lord Bathurst</em> (1733-4): </p>

               <p> David Hume referred to paper credit as “counterfeit money” (173), while Adam Smith
                  in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> had to apologize for using “so violent a metaphor” when he compared paper credit
                  to “a sort of waggon-way through the air”, a fantasy of elevated economic activity
                  which he was obliged to qualify by reworking Pope’s trope of tainted flight: <span class="quote">‘The commerce and industry of the country, however, it must be acknowledged, though

                  powers of convertibility, the Icarus myth added the elements of ambition, risk and
                  catastrophic failure. The perils of putting all the nation’s financial eggs into the
                  flimsy basket of credit became only too apparent in the Gordon riots of June 1780.
                  When the Bank of England was attacked, the country faced the prospect of financial
                  ruin: <span class="quote">‘Let any rational mind figure to itself the confusion that must have ensued, the ruin

                  it faced an even greater threat in the wake of French revolution. On this occasion,
                  the price to be paid for “national deliverance” was regarded by many observers as

                  <p>By the revolutionary 1790s, the idea that “public credit” faced an imminent “Daedalian”
                     disaster became a powerful rhetorical tool in anti-government writing. In <em>The Rights of Man</em> (1791-2), Thomas Paine noted that the “English system of funding” was close to bankruptcy;
                     in order to finance overseas conflicts, Britain was “increasing paper till there is
                     no money left” (133). As the war-torn decade progressed and the national debt grew,
                     Paine realised that the principle of convertibility was about to collapse. From this
                     point on, radical discourse configured paper and gold as class enemies. In his pamphlet <em>Decline of the English System of Finance</em>, published one year before Restriction in 1796, Paine predicted that gold and silver
                     were about to “revolt against depreciation and separate from the value of paper”,
                     in the process destroying the “popular delusion” of the credit system (Foner, 2: 661,
                     651-2).

                     by the shadowy insurrectionary group the United Britons in 1799. The document calls

               <p>Alongside the oppositional analysis, caricature added its own distinctive contribution
                  to the debunking of credit by imagining a new national narrative of conflict between
                  the people and the government: John Bullion versus Paper Pitt. In <em>Bank Notes</em> (1 March 1797), Gillray’s first response to the Restriction Act, John Bull is a hapless
                  yokel caught between the insidious “bullionist” temptations of the Jacobin Foxites
                  and the spectacular “paper” rip-off of Pitt and his ministers (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure11.jpg">Figure 11</a>). Characteristically, Gillray mocks all three parties and leaves the viewer uncertain
                  about which is the greatest offence: Fox’s disloyalty, Pitt’s tyranny, or Bull’s idiocy.
                  Bull decides “a’ may as well let my Measter Billy hold the Gold to keep away you Frenchmen,
                  as save it, to gee it you, when ye come over, with your domn’d invasion”, but this
                  reluctant compliance with the lesser evil does not defuse the satirical gusto with
                  which Gillray depicts the “delusion” of paper money: the stash of padlocked money
                  bags beneath Pitt’s counter constitutes both a mock-patriotic bulwark against the
                  French and a new symbol of centralised state power (hence in <em>Midas</em> one such money bag is used for Pitt’s body). The hapless Bull fails to notice that
                  in the background ministers are delivering sacks of increasingly low-denominational
                  notes (including one labelled “one shilling”). Their worthlessness is brilliantly
                  echoed in Pitt’s use of an inflationary scoop, a satirical inversion of the Bank of
                  England’s supposedly authoritative and measured release of currency into the economy.
                  Seen alongside <em>Midas</em>, this print anticipates the dangerous consequences of the Restriction Act for the
                  plebeian classes: in another telling touch, John Bull’s coat-buttons look perilously
                  like gold coins, a tempting prize for the voraciously asset-stripping government.
                  Before very long, as we shall see, the caricature narrative of John Bullion’s victimization
                  will take on a much more violent form.</p>

                     argued that only “real money” had “real value” (96), but in stating this he was only
                     echoing the Bullion Committee report of 1810 which called cash payments the “natural

                     to Hone and Cruikshank’s debunking of the official iconography of the nation state
                     in their <em>Restriction Bank Note</em>. Instead of depicting Britannia staring at a beehive, a symbol of industriousness
                     which replaced the earlier pile of gold, the satirical Britannia is shown as an unnatural
                     mother eating her children, an apt illustration of the state’s dereliction of duty
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure12.jpg">Figure 12</a>). Reminiscent of the liberticidal monsters of anti-Jacobin caricatures, this grotesque
                     figure reveals that such symbols of authority are now (in Cobbett’s words) a mere
                     “paper promise” of “real value” (98). As Gillray’s successor, Cruikshank was able
                     to see the Restriction narrative through to its grisly end: the cannibalistic Britannia
                     is the tragic climax to the paper assault on John Bullion. The bloated Midas has transmuted
                     into the vampiric mother, and forgery executions are both a literal and symbolic destruction
                     of the democratic body of the nation.</p>

                  <p>A more optimistic note is struck in another caricature which Cruikshank issued in
                     January 1819. <em>Johnny Bull and his Forged Notes!! or Rags and Ruin in the Paper Currency</em> shows John Bull as a small tradesman rather than a plebeian or yokel (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure13.jpg">Figure 13</a>). He is about to be arrested in his impoverished home for hoarding forged banknotes,
                     but as he says to the foppish inspector, “I took all these notes in the way of Trade—I
                     can’t tell Bad Good ones from Good Bad ones. Even those who issue them are frequently
                     mistaken &amp; have been deceived by Forgeries.” The debunking of paper money is wittily
                     conceived by reducing the bank notes to combustible paper—this is now their only value.
                     But the most important feature of this print is its portrayal of the Bull family.
                     Far from being abject, Johnny Bull is defiant, sturdy, patriarchal and ruggedly masculine.
                     He is the personification of the moral gold standard, the “real value” of the national
                     character, and he is protecting his “little platoon” against a cowardly and intrusive
                     government. His defiance reflects the resurgent mass radicalism of the post-war years
                     which later in 1819 will confront the repressive state apparatus at Peterloo. His
                     self-belief is a striking riposte to the more familiar caricature figure of a disempowered
                     John Bullion who is constantly duped, plundered and violated by a paper system of
                     taxes, bills and cheap banknotes. The most striking examples of this extreme exploitation
                     of John Bullion are probably Richard Newton’s <em>The New Paper Mill</em> and <em>The Inexhaustible Mine</em>, both published in 1797 as a response to Restriction (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure14.jpg">Figures 14</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure15.jpg">15</a>). In <em>The New Paper Mill</em> Bull is being minced by Pitt into paper notes (presumably having been stripped of
                     his gold first, though allegorically Bull himself represents “real” money); in the
                     brutal Restriction age, Pitt’s mincer is the modern state’s industrially efficient
                     yet banal replacement for the alchemical bravura of convertibility. <em>The Inexhaustible Mine</em> is an eye-catching, quasi-pornographic inversion of Gillray’s <em>Midas</em>. John Bull’s spouting orifices are not scatologically rendered: they are the result
                     of a violation which conflates a gang-rape, a mugging and a strip search. The image
                     captures the repressive authoritarianism of counter-revolutionary policy in the 1790s,
                     a period in which “the spirit of despotism” led to “invasions of privacy” (Barrell).

                     to circulate, Britain faced an unthinkable fate. If Britons found cheap banknotes
                     unpalatable, they should consider the Jacobin alternative: the rule of the revolutionary

                     </div> For Edmund Burke, the assignat was the epitome of Jacobin mischief and the arch enemy
                     of the gold standard. In Pocock’s opinion, it was the introduction of the assignat,
                     and not the invasion of the Queen’s bedchamber, which was for Burke “the central,
                     the absolute and the unforgivable crime of the Revolutionaries” (197). Throughout
                     his <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>, Burke rails against the revolutionaries’ decision “to force a currency of their
                     own fiction in the place of that which is real” (261). He declaims that “So violent
                     an outrage upon credit, property, and liberty, as this compulsory paper money currency,
                     has seldom been exhibited” (226). Overall: <span class="quote">‘everything human and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national

                                 through imagination and a suitably terroristic rhetoric” (108)—a useful gloss on Gillray”s

                     England should follow the French example and worship the “idol of public credit.”
                     These misguided supporters of paper currency <span class="quote">‘forget that, in England, not one shilling of paper money of any description is received
                        but of choice; that the whole has had its origin in cash actually deposited; and that

                        cash again. (357-8)’</span> But as Tom Furniss notes, Burke’s method of “projecting a negative aspect of Britain’s
                     own financial revolution which had haunted it from the beginning onto a radical ‘other’
                     across the channel” simply reproduced those endemic anxieties about an economy based
                     on what Furniss calls “imagination” (241). So it is both ironic and poignant that
                     Burke died in the year in which Pitt introduced the English equivalent of the assignat
                     (Gillray’s <em>Midas</em> illustrates this irony in the way in which the tiny Jacobin demons swarming round
                     Pitt’s head merge into banknotes). In Burke’s own terms, paper money was no longer
                     “convertible, at pleasure, in an instant, and without the smallest loss, into cash
                     again.”</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet by freeing paper money from convertibility and the gold standard, it could be
                     argued that Restriction was an unconscious act of modernization, as there was no longer
                     a pretence (or “delusion”) that paper and gold were related (this is surely the case
                     today in so far as no one believes the “promise” on British banknotes to “pay the
                     bearer” the equivalent in gold). By converting currency into “imagination” rather
                     than “real value”, the idea of value migrated into the aesthetic realm, the realm
                     of symbolic circulation. But if Romantic writers remained troubled by the loss of
                     the real, this was not the case for caricaturists, whose work was premised on converting
                     political events into an alternative, parallel and usually controversial fantasy.
                     In this sense, caricature’s generically maverick and ungovernable aesthetics were
                     more in tune with a system of “fabricated pieces of paper”.

               </div>
               <p>The efflorescent character of Gillray’s <em>Midas</em> seems to register this new creative opportunity. Unlike the macabre <em>Bank Restriction Note</em>, Gillray shows that Restriction was actually a dynamic explosion of paper energy.
                  It is as if Gillray found the idea of unconvertible paper currency irresistible, despite
                  the print’s overt political attack on Pitt’s policy. Another way to think about this
                  apparent celebration of paper circulation is to consider how Gillray innovated upon
                  and modernized his satirical sources, so that we understand more clearly how Gillray
                  constructed Pitt/Midas’s bizarre anatomy. The most immediate influence on his fantasy
                  is the figure of the political colossus. This was a well-honed satirical technique
                  which became popular with attacks on Britain’s first Prime Minister Robert Walpole
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure17.jpg">Figure 17</a>) and quickly became a familiar visual weapon with which to attack overweening ministerial
                  ambitions such as those of the Earl of Bute (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure18.jpg">Figure 18</a>). Just a few weeks before the introduction of Restriction, Gillray portrayed Pitt
                  as a colossus in <em>The Giant Factotum Amusing Himself</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure19.jpg">Figure 19</a>), so the novelty of <em>Midas</em> consisted of the change of venue (from parliament to the Bank of England—a clear
                  hint of the true source of the nation’s ills) and the switch of satirical wit from
                  bawdy pun (‘amusing himself’) to scatological extroversion. For the latter effect,
                  Gillray drew on another popular caricature language in which politicians are depicted
                  scatalogically if not always gigantically. These prints visualize tyranny, patronage
                  and sycophancy by showing the powerful leader shitting or vomiting on hangers-on and
                  suitors. The literary sources of such earthy wit included Rabelais and Swift, but
                  caricature could add the unique extra frisson of visuality. Good examples include
                  anti-Walpolian prints such as <em>The Political Vomit for the Ease of Britain</em> and <em>Idol Worship; or the Way to Preferment</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure20.jpg">Figures 20</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure21.jpg">21</a>) and James Aitken’s <em>Public Credit, or the State Idol</em>—the latter shows Edmund Burke as the arse-licker climbing the mired pole of preferment
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure22.jpg">Figure 22</a>). Where Gillray innovates on such sources is his remarkable ability to show Pitt/Midas
                  vacating and ingesting at the same time; metaphorically, this strange physiology registers
                  the credit system’s simultaneous mystification and demystification of paper. As the
                  transparent torso shows, this colossus is anatomically far more agile than his scatological
                  predecessors: he is both hoarding and secreting money, an apt image of “convertibility.”
                  This in itself is a considerable artistic achievement, but Gillray goes one step further
                  in his visual dexterity and allusiveness.</p>
               <p>Another popular visual source for <em>Midas</em> is the medieval fantasy of the money devil, a diabolical yet faintly comic figure
                  who exposes greed and covetousness by raining coins onto people from all his orifices.
                  The genesis of this creature can be seen in Hieronymus Bosch’s <em>Garden of Earthly Delights</em>. Next to the so-called “Prince of Hell” (who sits on a toilet-throne expelling people
                  into a diabolical midden) there is a naked rear end ejecting coins into the same pit,
                  a clear association of lucre and damnation. By the eighteenth century the money devil
                  had become a familiar figure in European and Russian caricatures, some of which Gillray
                  may have known (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure23.jpg">Figure 23</a>). In <em>Midas</em>, however, the cluster of coins which appear to be dropping from Pitt’s posterior
                  like the money devil are actually defying the laws of gravity; they are being sucked
                  up into Pitt/Midas’s torso while banknotes (the new ‘easing’) now perform the lavatorial
                  function—a brilliant realization of the “delusion” of convertibility. As Marc Shell
                  notes, “many people in the eighteenth-century were used to seeing depictions of a
                  coin-covered money devil” but “they were more puzzled by paper money than by coin,
                  so they were especially leery of the new paper money devil’s graphic powers of production,
                  or poesis” (67). Gillray’s genius lies in his ability to imagine this new “poesis”
                  and make <em>Midas</em> a satirical tribute to “the new paper money devil’s graphic powers of production”
                  rather than to the print’s ostensible theme, the “goodness of guineas” (Cobbett, 204).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This contradiction has a wider bearing on the fraught relations between Romanticism
                     and popularity. On the one hand, as already surmised, the loss of “real” currency
                     and the hike in forgery executions made many thinkers mistrustful of the paper money
                     system and for writers and artists these doubts may have extended to the signifying
                     power of “paper” more generally. Simon During describes the post-Restriction mood
                     for Romantic writers as a strange cocktail of “fearfulness, unpredictability, opportunity
                     and weightlessness” (339), perhaps unintentionally echoing Adam Smith’s trope of credit’s
                     perilous “Daedalian” sublimity. Despite clinging to the secure “weight” of bullion,
                     Romantic writers were also impelled to explore new, relatively autonomous and self-authorizing
                     imaginative paradigms which could keep the vexed issue of the tainted paper economy
                     of print circulation and popularity at arm’s length. Though Shelley ventured into
                     Heavy Metal performances in his satires <em>Oedipus Tyrannus; Or Swellfoot the Tyrant</em> (which has a character called “Banknotina”), <em>Peter Bell the Third</em> (which characterises paper money as expropriated bee-honey), and <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> (which memorably styles the credit economy the “ghost of gold”), such incursions into
                     popular culture were rare.

                     </div> On the other hand, radical authors like Paine and Cobbett saw the teeming popularity
                     of print circulation as an opportunity for ideological subversion rather than state
                     control. Despite all the government’s efforts to suppress, regulate and neutralize
                     radical writing in the 1790s, Paine was still able to claim (with typical bravado)
                     that Restriction had been precipitated not by the alarm of a French invasion but by
                     the panicky response to cheap editions of his pamphlet <em>Decline of the English System of Finance</em> (Foner, 2: 1387-8). For Paine, cheap radical literature operated like a phoney currency
                     of economic espionage, overloading the system to breaking point. Paper was a medium
                     to be appropriated and carnivalized rather than repressed, displaced or sublimated.
                     When Cobbett asked his readers to flood the market with fake banknotes, he recalled
                     wryly that Pitt had considered deluging France with fake assignats (<em>Black Dwarf</em>, 2 [21 October 1818], 658-9); <em>Cobbett’s Weekly Political Register</em>, 22 August 1818). Like Paine, Cobbett’s phenomenal success cocked a snoop at the
                     new paper economy from within its own ranks: <em>Paper against Gold</em> sold around 150,000 copies, making it, according to Spater, “probably the most widely
                     read book ever written purely on monetary questions” (1: 315). By converting currency
                     into “imagination”, the Restriction Act released its own critique and sowed the seed
                     of its own destruction.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The “formidable” caricaturist</span></h2>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But it was the caricaturists, above all, who could have their Restriction cake and
                     eat it: caricature thrived in a cultural environment in which the boundaries between
                     the “real” and the phoney or fake were being so sensationally and publicly challenged,
                     eroded, undermined and continually flouted. Caricature had a productively contradictory
                     relation to Restriction forgery. To begin with, Horace Walpole’s oft-quoted comment
                     that “all the house of forgery are relations” was much truer of engravers than writers.
                     Walpole made this comment to rebut accusations that his rejection of Chatterton’s
                     request for patronage had led to the latter’s suicide, but he was not alone in seeing
                     a slippage from literary to financial forgery. Joseph Ritson, for example, remarked
                     that “a man who will forge a poem, a line or even a word will not hesitate, when the
                     temptation is greater and the impunity equal, to forge a note or steal a guinea” (Ruthven,
                     57-9). In fact there was little if no evidence to support this claim, whereas there
                     was abundant evidence that engravers were playing both sides of the law. As noted
                     earlier, the state both relied on and feared the “formidable power of imitation” of
                     the engraver. Ironically, the Bank of England subjected all submitted designs for
                     “inimitable” banknotes to a counterfeiting test by its own engravers: not one design
                     passed the test.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The consensus was that the new note should combine, in the words of the Society of
                              Arts report into Restriction forgery, the “highest perfection” of hand engraving with
                              “mathematical accuracy” of “engine engraving” (Report of the Committee of the Society
                              of Arts, 10)—theoretically at least, this fusion of high artistic standards and technological
                              sophistication would put the banknote beyond the reach and resources of the forger.</span></div>
                     </div> Equally revealing is the fact that one of the eventual solutions to this problem,
                     the use of lithography, was first proposed by the well-known caricature print seller
                     Rudolph Ackermann, yet his suggestion was rejected as “a discovery as applied to the
                     subject of Forgery, infinitely more to be dreaded than encouraged” (cited in Mackenzie,
                     61).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This takes us the second aspect of caricature’s cultural power. Ackermann undoubtedly
                     knew that the single print caricature functioned like an alternative currency, shadowing
                     and transforming “official” history.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note29" id="Note29_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Gary Dyer confirms that Regency caricature had a much greater impact on “public perceptions”
                              than literary satires (93).</span></div>
                     </div> Moreover, society seemed to be imitating art. For critics of the unreformed political
                     system, Regency England had become a caricature of itself, consuming rather than protecting
                     its own children. No event showed this more clearly than the Peterloo massacre of
                     August 1819, an incident which lies at the heart of that extraordinarily productive
                     few years of Romantic literary output which James Chandler (borrowing from Shelley)
                     calls “England in 1819.” But what Chandler fails to note is that these years also
                     represent the crowning achievement of caricature. It is surely no coincidence that
                     the title page of Hone and Cruikshank”s bestselling satire <em>The Political House that Jack Built</em> (1819) shows a pair of scales in which the pen of radicalism outweighs not just Wellington’s
                     sword but a bundle of unjust laws topped by “Bank Restriction” (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure24.jpg">Figure 24</a>). The image implies that radical critique is the antithesis of Old Corruption’s mystifications,
                     but there could also be an allusion to the <em>Bank Restriction Note</em> of earlier that year. In other words, Cruikshank could be complimenting his own “formidable”
                     imitation of the forged banknotes which (in Baines’ words) were “naturally engendered”
                     by the paper money system and which functioned as an emblem or synecdoche of unreformed
                     political and social structures. This ability to satirically copy a discredited copy
                     of a discredited copy (caricature—forged banknote—original banknote) is a paradigm
                     of the way caricature used its distinctive “imagination” and the medium of paper to
                     critique the “real.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>A third way in which caricature mimicked forgery was that the satirical copy had to
                  be sufficiently life-like so that public figures would be recognised. In essence,
                  this constituted a kind of identity theft in which counterfeit images circulated in
                  place of the original and without the original’s consent. Hone and Cruikshank’s Duke
                  of Wellington is simultaneously real and satirical, his (modestly caricatured) visual
                  identity determined by a few key features such as the hook nose, oversize plumed hat
                  and spurs. Ironically, many Georgian authority figures were known to the public primarily
                  through their caricature representations (Charles James Fox would be the obvious example).
                  As Gombrich and Kris argue, graphic satire’s ability to steal an original identity
                  and manufacture phantom copies tapped into pre-Enlightenment superstitions about magical
                  fetishes which “annihilated” individuality. The reason why “portrait” or personalized
                  caricature appeared so late in history was not, they argue, due to the relaxing of
                  censorship; it has more to do with the secularization of society and the desacralization
                  of the image, its dissociation from actual necromancy. Once this tendency merged with
                  “political allegory”, the result was an explosive release of anti-authoritarian visual
                  aggression (14-17, 26-7). In Vic Gatrell’s words, caricature was “a modernized form
                  of an ancient effigy magic delivered against otherwise unassailable enemies … [a]
                  symbolic defilement anciently embedded in ritual destructions of the defamatory image”
                  (227). </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Relatively untouched by legal prosecutions, unburdened by the aesthetics of originality,
                     masterful in creating allegorical fantasies of politics and culture, firmly embedded
                     in reportage and print culture, the single print caricature circulated like a shadow
                     economy of symbolic representation, pumping out “phantom” versions of political leaders,
                     authority figures and celebrities.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note30" id="Note30_return"><sup class="super">
                              (30)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>If Julie Carlson is correct to state that Romantic celebrity was about “making a spectacle
                              of one’s self” (503), then caricature celebrity was about making a spectacle of a
                              phantom other.</span></div>
                     </div> Again, there is a useful parallel here with Marx’s theory of the quasi-divine, transformative
                     power of money which “turns real human and natural powers into purely abstract representations,
                     and therefore imperfections and tormenting phantoms, just as it turns real imperfections
                     and phantoms—truly impotent powers which exist only in the individual’s fantasy—into
                     real essential powers and abilities” (378). Perhaps the final irony of the relationship
                     between caricature and forgery is that the restoration of “real value” in 1821 (which
                     in practice meant a return to convertibility and the abolition of the lethal £1 and
                     £2 notes) also marked the decline of the golden age of British caricature. After the
                     success of the campaign to support Queen Caroline, Cruikshank took a huge bribe from
                     the state and retired from the scene.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Paper money, on the other hand, continued to be a controversial issue beyond the Romantic
                  period. In 1830, for example, just two years before the abolition of the death penalty
                  for forgery, the Northamptonshire peasant poet John Clare grumbled that: <span class="quote">‘The Speculator is looking for a new paper currency which placed a false value on
                     every species of his traffic &amp; thereby enables the cunning to cheat the honest…I would
                     have every bank issuing one pound notes (which is but a shadow of a promise for a
                     substance which the promiser has pocketed) dependent as Branch banks on the Bank of
                     England. (To John Taylor (1 February 1830); Storey, 498-500)’</span> The influence of Cobbett over the next generation of radicals who formed the Chartist
                  movement kept the discourse of ‘paper against gold’ alive. In Thomas Doubleday’s satire
                  <em>The Political Pilgrim’s Progress</em> (1839), for example, the hero Radical’s main adversary Political Apollyon is a demon
                  composed of paper money (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/forgery/images/figure25.jpg">Figure 25</a>). But given that forgery ceased to be a capital offence in the early 1830s, the debunking
                  of credit lost much of its sensationalism.</p>
               <p>To conclude: if Niall Ferguson is correct to say that “Money is not metal. It is trust
                  inscribed” (Ferguson, <em>The Ascent of Money</em>, 29-30), then the key issue remains: who, or what do you put your trust in? If, to
                  quote a popular ditty, “One forgery makes a felon –Millions a statesman!” perhaps
                  you would be wise to invest in caricature.</p>

               credit “Air Money,” anticipating both Adam Smith and Gillray: see Lynch, 96. Such
               anxieties can even be found at the inception of western responses to paper money.
               When Marco Polo reported that paper money was used in the city of Cambaluc in China,
               he commented that the Emperor must have a power like a “perfect alchemist” (cited
               in Shell, 13, n.10). The 14th-century Chinese experiment in paper money collapsed
               after just a few decades when the Ming dynasty’s attempt to replace metal with banknotes
               resulted in hyper-inflation: see the discussion of the Ming banknote in the Radio
